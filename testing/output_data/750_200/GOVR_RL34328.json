The America COMPETES Act authorizes research funding and support for early career scientists at government agencies like NIST, DOE, and NSF. It includes grants for researchers and education programs to recruit K-12 STEM teachers and enhance existing STEM teacher skills. STEM programs for students are also offered by DOE, ED, and NSF. The America COMPETES Act includes support for STEM education at various levels, such as scholarships, mentoring, and new STEM activities at government agencies like ED, DOE, and NSF. It also establishes programs like a summer educational program, graduate fellowships, and a professional science master's program. White House efforts under OSTP aim to foster innovation. The America COMPETES Act supports STEM education through various programs at government agencies like ED, DOE, and NSF. It also includes White House efforts under OSTP to foster innovation and competitiveness activities. To maintain economic growth and competitiveness in a global economy, U.S. companies must engage in trade and offer high-quality products and services. Scientific and technological advances contribute to economic growth. Scientific and technological advances contribute to economic growth by creating new goods, services, jobs, and capital, and increasing productivity. These advances can help firms retain market shares and offer high-quality products and services. Various factors such as government activity, firm organization, and serendipity can influence technological progress. Two policy approaches have been used to address U.S. competitiveness. Since World War II, the United States has utilized a combination of direct and indirect policy approaches to enhance U.S. competitiveness. The Steelman report issued concerns about future competition from other national economies. In the 1970s, experts expressed concerns about U.S. competitiveness as Japan, Europe, and other countries emerged as major competitors. The United States had lost market share in various industries, leading to worries about declining technological superiority. Some experts expressed concerns about the decline in U.S. technological superiority, citing lower productivity growth, a narrowing gap in the number of scientists and engineers, and a decrease in patents granted to Americans. The decline in U.S. technological superiority led to concerns about lower productivity growth, fewer patents granted to Americans, and a narrowing gap in the number of scientists and engineers. Congress responded by passing several acts to address the issue. The Bayh-Dole Act, Federal Technology Transfer Act, National Cooperative Research Act, and Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 were passed to address concerns about U.S. technological superiority. Additional actions included creating the SEMATECH consortium and increasing corporate spending on research and development through the 1981 Economic Recovery Tax Act and the Tax Reform Act of 1986. The 1981 Economic Recovery Tax Act and the Tax Reform Act of 1986 addressed competitiveness concerns by providing a research and experimentation tax credit. The Small Business Development Act established federal R&D funds for innovative small firms. Competitiveness improved in the mid-1990s due to actions taken by U.S. manufacturers, universities, and national laboratories. In the 21st century, competitiveness concerns have shifted towards globalization and issues like federal research funding, STEM education quality, and the number of Americans with science and engineering degrees. The impact of globalization on American companies, workers, and families is significant, with many large U.S. companies relying on international markets for sales and employing more foreign workers than domestic. This integration with the world economy can increase productivity and living standards. The impact of globalization on American companies, workers, and families is significant. Increasing integration with the world economy can lead to higher productivity and living standards. However, concerns about job loss and lower wages arise as American companies compete in a global economy, especially with low-wage developing countries. The information technology revolution has also affected U.S. white collar jobs. Three main trends drive today's globalization: technology reducing communication and transportation costs, companies adapting to global markets, and the expansion of competitiveness concerns. The America COMPETES Act addresses trends influencing globalization, such as technology reducing communication costs, increased global labor supply, and government policies promoting trade. The act authorizes direct measures in these areas and establishes committees to explore indirect policy mechanisms. The America COMPETES Act increases federal funding for basic research in key fields like physical sciences, engineering, mathematics, and computer science to drive innovation and job creation. It also establishes committees to explore indirect policy mechanisms related to technology and globalization. The America COMPETES Act aims to boost competitiveness by increasing funding for research in key fields like physical sciences, engineering, mathematics, and computer science. It also focuses on improving the U.S. labor pool to compete globally, addressing concerns about proficiency in science and mathematics among American students and low numbers pursuing STEM degrees compared to other countries. The America COMPETES Act aims to increase funding for research in key STEM fields and improve the U.S. labor pool to compete globally. It addresses concerns about proficiency in science and mathematics among American students and low numbers pursuing STEM degrees compared to other countries. The act initiates actions to increase the quality and quantity of STEM teachers and encourage more American students to undertake advanced STEM classes and post-secondary STEM degrees. It also authorizes meetings, studies, and committees to identify possible actions the United States might undertake in government trade and investment policies. The America COMPETES Act aims to boost research funding in STEM fields and enhance the U.S. workforce's global competitiveness. It focuses on improving STEM education, increasing STEM teachers, and encouraging students to pursue STEM degrees. Recent legislative initiatives also promote industry investment in research and development, collaboration between companies and universities, technology transfer, and quality improvement incentives. The America COMPETES Act has bipartisan support, but experts suggest further actions to enhance competitiveness. The America COMPETES Act aims to boost research funding in STEM fields and enhance the U.S. workforce's global competitiveness. Some experts support actions to improve competitiveness, while others doubt the effectiveness of the proposed Act. Competitiveness perspectives vary based on individual domestic firms, multinational corporations, and domestic labor. The focus of competitiveness varies depending on whether it is from the perspective of an individual domestic firm, a multinational corporation, or domestic labor. For a domestic firm, competitiveness is about trade and the ability to compete for market share against imports or foreign firms in export markets. A key measure is the economy's trade balance, as shown in Table 1 with U.S. trade in advanced technology products. The U.S. has traditionally had a surplus in these products. The United States historically had a surplus in high technology products, but this shifted to a deficit in 2002. The deficit grew from $16.6 billion in 2002 to $55.5 billion in 2008, with fluctuations in between. The United States had a surplus in high technology products historically, but it shifted to a deficit in 2002. The deficit grew from $16.6 billion in 2002 to $55.5 billion in 2008, with fluctuations in between. This deficit does not necessarily mean the U.S. is losing the high technology race, as many imports are from U.S. companies. However, the growing deficit may require closer policy scrutiny. For U.S. multinational corporations, competitiveness is defined by the ability of overseas operations to compete for market share with firms from foreign host countries or third countries. Foreign direct investment in the United States declined after 2000 but rebounded by 2006. Competitiveness for U.S. multinational corporations is defined by the ability of overseas operations to compete for market share with firms from foreign host countries or third countries. Foreign direct investment in the United States declined after 2000 but rebounded to $184 billion by 2006. Domestic labor defines competitiveness as the ability to compete against foreign firms in export markets or within the United States. Key measures for domestic labor are employment levels and wages received. The United States is the largest recipient of foreign direct investments. The United States is the largest recipient of foreign direct investments, with investment by U.S. firms abroad totaling $249 billion in 2006. While some see these investments as beneficial, concerns exist about displaced U.S. workers and lower wages. Most of the investment is concentrated in high-income developed countries, leading economists to attribute the trend to a broad restructuring of U.S. manufacturing. The share of investment going to developing countries has decreased in recent years, attributed to a restructuring of U.S. manufacturing industries. Direct investment abroad is not seen to result in fewer jobs or lower incomes for Americans. NSF identifies five categories of science and engineering occupations, but this classification does not cover all individuals with such degrees. The classification of science and engineering occupations by NSF does not include all individuals with such degrees, including those who use their knowledge in teaching or management roles. There are also professionals in science and engineering-related occupations who may not have degrees in the field, such as patent attorneys or physicians. Occupations utilizing science and engineering knowledge may not always require degrees in those fields, such as patent attorneys or physicians. The science and engineering workforce could be larger than currently estimated by government analyses. The size of the science and engineering workforce may be larger than government estimates, ranging from 5.0 million to 21.4 million individuals in 2006, according to the National Science Board. The most relevant numbers are 17.0 million with degrees in S&E fields and 21.4 million including related fields like health or technology. The National Science Board estimates that the science and engineering workforce in 2006 ranged from 5.0 million to 21.4 million individuals, including those with degrees in related fields like health or technology. This reflects the various ways science and technical knowledge are utilized in the United States. The National Science Board estimates the science and engineering workforce in 2006 ranged from 5.0 million to 21.4 million individuals, including related fields like health or technology. There is a need for workers to have a basic understanding of STEM and new technologies. Computerization has changed the skills needed for employment, reducing routine tasks and increasing high-level tasks. This shift explains sixty percent of the demand for college-educated labor from 1970 to 1998. The analysis found that task shifts in education demand explained 60% of the relative demand shift favoring college labor from 1970 to 1998. The number of workers in science and engineering occupations grew significantly, 7.7 times larger in 2000 than in 1950, outpacing the growth of the total labor force. The STEM workforce grew significantly, with the total labor force increasing 2.3 times and managers/professionals growing 4.9 times. In the 1990s, STEM growth was over three times that of the overall labor force. Recent data shows a decline in STEM professionals as a percentage of the workforce since 2000. However, science and engineering occupations are projected to grow by 21.4% from 2004 to 2014, with 65% of the growth in computer-related occupations. The growth in science and engineering occupations is projected to be 21.4% from 2004 to 2014, with 65% of the growth in computer-related occupations. Unemployment in S&E occupations was 1.6% in 2006. These projections only consider the demand for strictly defined S&E occupations. The compensation for most STEM occupations is above the U.S. labor force average, ranging from $53,000 to $58,000 per year. In 2003, median salaries for S&E bachelor's degree holders increased by 15% from 1993 to 2003. The real salary for recent S&E bachelor's degree recipients increased by an average of 15% across all fields from 1993 to 2003. In 2003, median salaries for S&E bachelor's degree holders 15-19 years after receiving their degree were $65,000, higher than non-S&E bachelor's degree recipients at $49,000. There is significant variance among STEM occupations, fields, and sub-fields. The Council on Competitiveness argues that traditional measures of competitiveness do not fully capture a nation's competitiveness. The Council on Competitiveness argues that traditional measures of competitiveness, such as balance, foreign direct investment, level of employment, and wages, do not fully capture a nation's competitiveness. Factors like foreign affiliate sales, intrafirm trade, global supply chain fragmentation, and lack of inclusion of services and intangibles are not considered in today's assessment. Assessing a nation's trade balance is less useful in the global economy, where value is created through intangible assets. Today, competition is now about the creation of value through intangible assets in global networks of multinational firms. The Council on Competitiveness suggests additional measures like pension funds, real estate, healthcare benefits, and purchasing power to understand individual prosperity. They also emphasize assessing prosperity equality across society levels and individuals' potential to enhance their prosperity through personal efforts. The America COMPETES Act is based on certain assumptions. The America COMPETES Act is based on the assumption that STEM knowledge is essential for all Americans, not just those in science and engineering careers. K-12 students lack proficiency in STEM due to a shortage of qualified teachers. Scientists, engineers, and teachers with STEM degrees will inspire more enthusiasm in students, leading to a better-trained workforce. Individuals with STEM degrees are crucial for U.S. competitiveness and economic growth. More Americans need to pursue STEM fields to generate new ideas and industries. STEM degree holders are versatile and can work in various occupations beyond traditional roles. Science and engineering research is vital for U.S. competitiveness and economic growth. Current funding for basic research in these fields is insufficient compared to other competing countries. Additional federal funding can lead to the creation of new industries and jobs, as well as enhance existing ones. The OECD's Program for International Student Assessment compared U.S. students' science and math scores to international peers in 2006, revealing lower scores. Additionally, a study found that U.S. middle school math teachers are not well-prepared to teach math. The United States has lower literacy scores than the OECD average. Middle school math teachers in the US are not as well-prepared as teachers in other countries, contributing to lower math scores for American students. The US also has one of the lowest rates of STEM degrees awarded compared to non-STEM degrees globally. According to NSF data, STEM degrees accounted for 16.8% of all first university degrees awarded in the United States in 2002, compared to an international average of 26.4%. The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, supported by the National Science Foundation, developed a research and development satellite account to estimate the impact of R&D investment on U.S. economic growth. If R&D were considered an investment, it would have contributed to 5% of real GDP growth between 1959 and 2004, and 7% between 1995 and 2004. These analyses highlight the importance of R&D, although some question their validity. Some question the extent of U.S. benefit from federal research investments, as research is international. They also question the influence of the federal government in STEM education and if investments will yield timely results. Some question the federal government's influence in STEM education and the impact of investments on U.S. competitiveness. Concerns also arise about the timeliness of results and whether actions are necessary in this policy area. Some analysts question the necessity of action on U.S. competitiveness, doubting the need for more scientists and engineers and pointing out discrepancies in workforce projections. Concerns also include potential oversupply of STEM professionals and exaggerated quality of scientists in China and India. The act focuses on direct measures to address concerns about U.S. competitiveness, including increased funding for research programs. Policymakers are also considering indirect measures like tax policy to support technology development. The act focuses on direct measures for U.S. competitiveness, including increased research funding. Proponents debate direct government assistance versus market-driven technology investment. President Bush announced the American Competitiveness Initiative in January 2006 to address concerns about the United States' ability to compete economically with other nations in the future. The initiative focused on increasing research funding and debated the use of direct government assistance versus market-driven technology investment. The America COMPETES Act and the ACI aimed to address concerns about the US's future economic competitiveness by investing in science, technology research, and workforce development. Many provisions of ACI were included in the America COMPETES Act, such as increased funding for NSF, NIST, and DOE Office of Science, as well as STEM education programs like Math Now and AP/IB. The America COMPETES Act authorizes funding increases for these areas and introduces two new programs. The America COMPETES Act authorizes funding increases for the NSF, NIST laboratories, and the DOE Office of Science, as well as new research organizations like ARPA-E and Discovery Science and Engineering Innovation Institutes. It also encourages executive agencies to allocate a percentage of their basic research budget to high-risk, high-reward projects and emphasizes appropriate funding levels for NASA. The America COMPETES Act authorizes funding increases for NSF, NIST, and DOE Office of Science, emphasizing high-risk, high-reward projects and appropriate NASA funding levels. It advocates for doubling funding for these agencies over seven years and supports research in physical sciences, engineering, mathematics, and computer science. Many organizations advocate increasing research funding for physical sciences, engineering, mathematics, and computer science. The America COMPETES Act calls for a 10% annual increase in federal investment in long-term basic research over seven years, based on the National Academies' Rising Above the Gathering Storm report. This rate of change is deemed necessary due to flat federal funding in these fields for 15 years. Federal funding for sciences, engineering, mathematics, and information sciences has remained flat for 15 years, leading to a lack of support for high-potential high-risk research. Corporations are unlikely to fill this gap as they fund little basic research, which is seen as riskier and offering greater societal benefits than its sponsor. The National Academies committee recommended a 10% annual increase in funding for basic research over a seven-year period, taking into account the NSF Authorization Act of 2002 which authorized doubling NSF's research budget. This growth rate was deemed appropriate to balance the urgency of the issue with the research community's ability to utilize new funds. The Administration has not explained why it chose a 7% annual growth rate for research funding, which would double the budget over 10 years. Despite limited funding, there is consensus on the importance of federally funded science for economic competitiveness, as highlighted in the National Academies' 2005 report. The National Academies' 2005 report \"Rising Above the Gathering Storm\u2026\" emphasized the need for increased funding in basic research in physical sciences, mathematics, and engineering to enhance the nation's economic competitiveness. The report suggested reallocating existing funds or introducing new funds to support these areas due to limited federal funding for science programs. The Administration's response to the need for increased funding in basic research was the American Competitiveness Initiative, proposing to double budgets for NSF, NIST, and the Department of Energy's Office of Science over ten years. The America COMPETES Act also emphasized NASA's role in promoting innovation and economic competitiveness through scientific research and STEM education. The America COMPETES Act emphasizes promoting innovation and economic competitiveness through basic scientific research, engineering development, and STEM education in line with NASA's mission. It highlights the importance of robust funding for NASA to contribute significantly to U.S. innovation and competitiveness across its various programs. The Senate and House appropriations committees are concerned about the lack of balance in the President's FY2008 budget for NASA, with insufficient funds for space exploration and other important initiatives. A National Research Council report suggests that NASA is being asked to do too much with too little resources. The National Research Council report recommends that NASA and the government address the mismatch between tasks and resources. The America COMPETES Act emphasizes the need for high-risk, high reward projects in executive research agencies. The America COMPETES Act emphasizes allocating a percentage of basic research funding for high-risk, high reward projects that address fundamental challenges and involve multidisciplinary work. This provision aims to address concerns about federal research funding mechanisms not being open to new, unproven ideas. Transformative research often does not fit within traditional project-focused or center-based research models. Transformative research, which is often high-risk and paradigm-challenging, faces challenges in traditional research funding systems due to low success rates and reluctance from investigators. The National Institutes of Health has introduced the Pioneer's Award to support such research endeavors. The National Science Foundation lacks dedicated funds for transformative research, despite conducting research that could be considered revolutionary and cutting edge. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 emphasizes the importance of transformative research at NSF. The National Science Foundation lacks dedicated funds for transformative research, as noted in the report \"Enhancing Support of Transformative Research at the National Science Foundation.\" The Appropriations Committees have directed the Foundation to review current practices and provide reports on addressing this issue, including a definition of transformative research. Additionally, the House Committee on Appropriations has suggested allocating $10 million of NSF's budget for a new and dedicated program. The House Committee on Appropriations recommends allocating $10 million of NSF's budget for a new program emphasizing transformative research. The America COMPETES Act authorizes ARPA-E, a new federal organization in DOE aimed at enhancing economic and energy security through technology development. ARPA-E aims to reduce energy-related greenhouse gas emissions, improve energy efficiency, and promote advanced energy technologies. It follows the DARPA research management model and focuses on sponsoring revolutionary energy technology projects. The concept for ARPA-E is based on the DARPA research management model used by the Department of Defense. Similar initiatives have been proposed in the past, including an advanced civilian technology agency in previous Congresses. Several initiatives have been proposed in the past, such as the creation of a civilian technology agency in previous Congresses and recommendations for a civilian technology corporation or agency for energy research. Presidential candidate Bill Clinton and Senator Al Gore also suggested a civilian advanced research agency for renewable technologies and fuels. The civilian advanced research agency ARPA-E was proposed to support research on renewable technologies and fuels. It aims to bring excitement and attract top minds for out-of-the-box research that industry may not support. The organization is envisioned to be flat and nimble. The proposed ARPA-E organization aims to focus on creative, transformational research that industry may not support. It will be flat, nimble, and capable of sustaining promising projects while phasing out unproductive ones. The goal is to bridge gaps between basic energy research, development, and industrial innovation, serving as a model for improving science and technology transfer in other essential areas. Initial funding for ARPA-E is suggested to start at $300. The report proposed starting ARPA-E funding at $300 million in the first year, increasing to $1 billion per year over five to six years. The program's effectiveness would be evaluated at that point. National Academies committee members emphasized the importance of not jeopardizing basic research supported by the DOE's Office of Science. They did not specify ARPA-E's organization and mission in detail, suggesting those details be worked out later. The National Academies committee recommended starting ARPA-E funding at $300 million in the first year, increasing to $1 billion per year over five to six years. They emphasized the importance of not jeopardizing basic research supported by the DOE's Office of Science and suggested that the organization and mission of ARPA-E be determined by the Secretary of Energy and the Under Secretary for Science in consultation with experts. For more information on ARPA-E, refer to CRS Report RL34497. The America COMPETES Act directs DOE to establish multidisciplinary Discovery Science and Engineering Innovation Institutes at DOE National Laboratories to apply fundamental science and engineering discoveries to technological innovations. The institutes, along with their partners, support research on emerging technologies critical to global competitiveness, train science and engineering students, develop educational curricula, and conduct research with higher-education partners. The America COMPETES Act directs DOE to establish Discovery Science and Engineering Innovation Institutes at DOE National Laboratories. These institutes aim to develop innovative educational curricula, conduct research with higher-education and industrial partners, and train engineers in areas like nanoscience and microsystems to address global market challenges, national security, energy sustainability, and public health. The America COMPETES Act authorizes new STEM education programs to address challenges in global markets, national security, energy sustainability, and public health. It involves multiple sectors of society and focuses on recruiting and enhancing STEM teachers, as well as supporting students in STEM education at all levels. The America COMPETES Act includes programs to recruit and enhance STEM teachers, support students in STEM education through various initiatives, with an emphasis on outreach and mentoring for women and minorities, and inclusion of students and teachers from high-need schools. It also includes a pilot program of grants to states for establishing or expanding STEM specialty high schools and providing experiential-based learning opportunities and internships. The America COMPETES Act includes a pilot program of grants to states for STEM specialty high schools, internships for students at DOE national labs, centers of excellence in STEM education, summer institutes for teachers, and a new Director for STEM Education at the Department of Energy. A new Director for STEM Education at the Department of Energy will improve STEM content knowledge for K-12 teachers nationwide. The DOE will also offer a graduate research fellowship program called Protecting America's Competitive Edge (PACE) for outstanding graduate students in STEM fields. Additionally, the Department of Education will introduce two new grant programs, Teachers for a Competitive Tomorrow, to support partnerships in STEM education leading to a baccalaureate degree. The Department of Education (ED) is launching a program called Teachers for a Competitive Tomorrow to support partnerships in STEM education. This program includes courses leading to a baccalaureate degree with teacher certification, a part-time master's degree program for current teachers, and a one-year master's degree program for STEM professionals. Additionally, a program called Math Now will provide teachers with tools and professional development to enhance math instruction for elementary and middle school students. A new program called Math Now aims to improve math instruction for elementary and middle school students by providing teachers with research-based tools and professional development. Another initiative, the Advanced Placement/International Baccalaureate (AP/IB) Program, seeks to expand low-income students' access to AP/IB coursework by training more high school teachers in math, science, and critical foreign languages. Additionally, increased support is planned for existing NSF programs like the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program, which encourages STEM majors and professionals to become K-12 math and science teachers. The NSF supports various programs to improve STEM education, including the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program, Math and Science Partnerships program, STEM talent expansion program (STEP), Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program, and Graduate Research Fellowships (GRF). These programs aim to increase the number of STEM teachers, improve math and science education, boost STEM degree attainment, enhance technician education, and provide support for graduate students. The America COMPETES Act programs focus on STEM education at various levels, including undergraduate, secondary, and graduate levels. The DOE and its National Laboratories are involved in managing these programs, which aim to improve STEM education and support graduate study in STEM fields. The Administration has opposed some DOE-managed STEM initiatives. The Administration has opposed several DOE-managed STEM initiatives, including Specialty Schools in Math and Science, Experiential-based Learning Opportunities, Summer Institutes, and National Laboratories Centers of Excellence. Proponents argue that inspiring children in K-12 STEM education is crucial, and interacting with DOE scientists and engineers conducting research can motivate teachers and students. DOE specialty schools for math and science are part of this effort. The DOE specialty schools for math and science aim to improve academic achievement in STEM subjects by providing students with a high-quality curriculum. Supporters believe these schools will serve as centers of excellence in math and science, attracting both students and teachers. The America COMPETES Act authorizes summer internship programs at DOE national laboratories for middle and secondary school students to provide hands-on learning in STEM subjects. The Administration suggests focusing on improving existing efforts rather than starting new programs without clear need. The Administration emphasizes improving existing STEM education efforts rather than starting new programs without clear need. DOE National Laboratory Centers of Excellence in STEM education aim to assist teachers by providing access to national laboratory equipment for high-need public secondary schools. The Administration opposes establishing school-based centers for STEM education in partnership with DOE national laboratories, believing it would divert resources. Proponents argue that such programs benefit teachers and students. The America COMPETES Act reauthorizes existing STEM programs and authorizes one new program, which the Administration opposes increasing funding for. The Administration opposes increasing funding for the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program and the Laboratory Science Pilot program under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008. NSF emphasizes the importance of promoting quality math and science education to maintain competitiveness in the 21st century. Increasing the number of qualified K-12 math and science teachers is crucial. Increasing the number of highly qualified K-12 math and science teachers is crucial for maintaining competitiveness in the 21st century. The National Academies' Rising Above the Gathering Storm report emphasizes the need to expand programs for future science and engineering workforce education. An additional $5,000,000 is allocated for the Robert Noyce Scholarship program to support STEM undergraduate students. The Robert Noyce Scholarship program aims to recruit STEM undergraduate students and professionals to become K-12 math and science teachers. It provides grants to higher education institutions to prepare students for teaching roles in high-need school districts in exchange for scholarships and stipends. The Robert Noyce Scholarship program offers scholarships and stipends for STEM students and professionals to become math or science teachers in high-need K-12 school districts. The program is based on successful models like UTeach and California Teach, which train teachers in science and math departments instead of education departments. Master K-12 classroom teachers are often used to educate students in these programs. The Robert Noyce Scholarship program aims to train STEM students and professionals to become math or science teachers in high-need K-12 school districts. The program utilizes successful models like UTeach and California Teach, which involve training teachers in science and math departments instead of education departments. Master K-12 classroom teachers play a key role in educating students in these programs. Universities involved in the program have shifted their focus to prepare students for both research and education careers, recognizing them as some of their best science, engineering, and mathematics undergraduates. Additionally, the program authorizes a new NSF program to provide grants for higher education institutions to create or enhance STEM education programs. The NSF program aims to provide grants for higher education institutions to create or improve professional science master's degree programs that focus on practical training for high-need fields. Science programs traditionally view master's degrees as a step towards a PhD, but professional science master's programs are seen as a way to better meet industry workforce needs. Professional Science Master's (PSM) programs are designed to provide advanced training in science or mathematics while also developing workplace skills valued by employers. These programs, developed with industry guidance, typically include two years of academic training, internships, and cross-training in business and communications. Approximately 120 PSM programs at 60 institutions aim to meet industry workforce needs by offering practical training in high-need fields. The NSF Laboratory Science Pilot program provides grants to partnerships of higher education institutions to create or enhance PSM programs. The NSF Laboratory Science Pilot program awards grants to partnerships to improve school laboratories and enhance STEM instruction through professional development for teachers, equipment procurement, and hands-on instructional programs. The America COMPETES Act authorizes new programs in the Department of Education to improve laboratory experiences for high school students, especially in schools with higher concentrations of non-Asian minorities and poor students. The America COMPETES Act authorizes new programs in the Department of Education to improve laboratory experiences for high school students, especially in schools with higher concentrations of non-Asian minorities and poor students. The Teachers for a Competitive Tomorrow program aims to increase the number of STEM teachers by providing grants to institutions of higher education. It encourages undergraduate students pursuing STEM degrees to also pursue teacher certification and helps current teachers improve their STEM knowledge and pedagogical skills through a part-time master's degree program. Math Now is a part-time master's degree program aimed at improving math instruction for elementary and middle school students. The America COMPETES Act includes provisions for the President's Office of Science and Technology Policy to establish a Council on Innovation and Competitiveness. The America COMPETES Act directs the establishment of a President's Council on Innovation and Competitiveness, chaired by the Secretary of Commerce. President Bush responded by creating a National Science and Technology Committee (NSTC) subcommittee to meet the act's requirements. The act also calls for a National Science and Technology Summit convened by the President through OSTP to assess the U.S. science and technology enterprises. The America COMPETES Act directs the convening of a National Science and Technology Summit by the President through OSTP to examine the U.S. science, technology, engineering, and mathematics enterprises. This summit took place on August 18-19, 2008. The act also requires OSTP to submit a description of how the Administration's R&D budget priorities align with the summit's conclusions and recommendations. Additionally, OSTP is directed to establish principles for the communication and exchange of data by federal scientists and engineers, which was addressed by the Bush Administration in a memorandum to federal agencies on May 28, 2008. The Bush Administration OSTP sent a memorandum to federal agencies on May 28, 2008, emphasizing the importance of open communication of scientific information by federal scientists and engineers. The memorandum highlighted the core principle of scientific openness for advancing science and providing society with objective information for sound decision-making. The Federal government emphasizes scientific openness for sound decision-making. NASA's science communications policy serves as a model for other agencies, allowing employees to speak to the press and public about their work. Exceptions exist for privileged information. Actions designated for OSTP by the America COMPETES Act are outlined. The America COMPETES Act designates actions for OSTP, including studies on barriers to innovation and national coordination of research infrastructure. A summary of these activities is provided in Appendix B. On February 12, 2009, the Senate Committee held a hearing on the Nomination of Dr. John Holdren. Dr. John Holdren's nomination as OSTP Director was confirmed on March 19, 2009 after a hearing by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. During his testimony, Dr. Holdren emphasized the importance of efficient communication of scientific and technical information by federal scientists and engineers to provide accurate advice to the President and Congress. Dr. Holdren, as the confirmed OSTP Director, prioritizes ensuring objective and accurate science and technology advice to the President and Congress, free from political influence. He emphasizes the importance of working with federal agencies to prevent censorship or distortion of scientific information for ideological reasons. The America Competes Act, signed into law in August 2007, requires the director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy to develop principles for open communication of data and results from federal scientists to prevent suppression or distortion of research findings. Clarifying policies for disseminating research results is crucial for scientific integrity in the federal government. President Obama issued a memorandum on Scientific Integrity in 2009, assigning OSTP the responsibility for ensuring integrity in the executive branch's involvement with scientific processes. This includes developing policies for disseminating research results and providing training on these policies. The Director of OSTP is tasked with developing recommendations for Presidential action to ensure scientific integrity in the executive branch within 120 days. This includes criteria for selecting science and technology candidates, establishing rules for scientific integrity within agencies, and considering scientific information in policy decisions. Each agency should have rules and procedures to ensure scientific integrity. Scientific or technological information in policy decisions should undergo well-established processes, including peer review. Agencies must accurately reflect this information in compliance with statutory standards and make findings available to the public. Each agency should establish procedures to ensure scientific integrity, including making scientific findings available to the public and addressing any compromises in the scientific process. Additional procedures, including whistleblower protections, should be adopted to safeguard the integrity of scientific and technological information used in decision-making. Each agency must ensure the integrity of scientific and technological information used in decision-making.

The combined funding from the Omnibus Appropriation Act and the American Investment and Recovery Act supported America COMPETES Act programs at authorized levels. Some programs were funded below authorized levels or not funded. For ARPA-E, the FY2009 appropriation exceeded the authorization. Future funding levels may pose challenges for institutions if not maintained at authorized levels. Funding levels for programs under the America COMPETES Act may face challenges if not maintained at authorized levels, as seen in FY2009. The alignment of budget proposals with the Act has been inconsistent, making it difficult to determine the status of these programs. The Obama Administration's FY2010 budget request did not realign existing programs with the America COMPETES Act, leading to uncertainty about the funding status of new programs under the Act. Insufficient evidence suggests that several programs, such as DOE Pilot Program of Grants to Specialty Schools and Early Career Awards for Researchers, are funded. The Talent Expansion Program Early Career Awards for Science, Engineering, and Mathematics Researchers, Discovery Science and Engineering Innovation Institutes, and other programs under the America COMPETES Act are awaiting funding decisions for FY2010. The Obama Administration's budget request did not align existing programs with the Act, causing uncertainty about funding for new programs. The Obama Administration's FY2010 appropriation deliberations include funding for America COMPETES Act programs. The requested funding is below authorized levels, but would still be the highest in U.S. history if approved. Some newly authorized programs have not received funding proposals, raising questions about their establishment. The Obama Administration has not proposed funding for some newly authorized America COMPETES Act programs. The issue is whether they will receive the necessary funding. The Act aims to invest in innovation and improve U.S. competitiveness. Funding levels are authorized only through FY2010, and the nation's success in implementing the Act remains uncertain. The America COMPETES Act aims to invest in innovation and improve U.S. competitiveness. The goal is to maintain the U.S.'s first-place ranking in international competitiveness rankings, despite other nations increasing their science and technology investments. The Act's success in achieving this goal remains uncertain. The America COMPETES Act aims to maintain the U.S.'s top ranking in international competitiveness despite other nations increasing their science and technology investments. Evaluation mechanisms and longitudinal analysis by international organizations assess competitiveness using various inputs, outputs, and outcomes. It is important to note that there are no direct measures of innovation or competitiveness. When evaluating innovation and competitiveness, it is crucial to consider that there are no direct measures available. Various indicators of innovation activity exist, but combining them may not accurately assess innovation or a nation's competitiveness. Factors like necessity and serendipity also play a significant role, making it challenging to evaluate the quality and impact of innovation on economic growth. The evaluation of innovation's quality, impact on economic growth, and value can vary depending on perspectives. Increased spending on research and development does not guarantee innovative technologies. Innovation can occur regardless of R&D due to market demand or minor product alterations. The federal government, industrial sector, and universities all contribute to funding R&D. The federal government, industrial sector, and universities fund R&D and innovation. Innovation can happen due to market demand or minor product changes. University-industry cooperation is crucial for bridging basic research and industry. University-industry cooperation plays a vital role in connecting basic research with industry by educating scientists, engineers, and managers. It is important to consider the differences in R&D funding between countries, especially in non-defense sectors. Analyzing industry R&D investment, including the balance between research and development spending and funding distribution across different industrial sectors, is crucial for understanding the overall picture. The degree of funding spent on research versus development and in particular industrial sectors varies between countries. Patent data can indicate innovation, but not all results from R&D can be patented. Some companies choose not to patent to protect ideas or due to time constraints. The number of scientists and engineers may not fully reflect a nation's innovation. The focus of government policy is on creating an environment where innovation can flourish, leading to competitiveness with other nations. There are no guarantees that any specific action will result in innovation. Both international and U.S. government monitor and assess the effects of innovation. The United States is competitive with other nations in increasing innovation. Monitoring and assessing the effects of U.S. policies are crucial as other nations take their own actions. The act includes mechanisms to measure effectiveness, such as the President's Council on Innovation and Competitiveness. The President's Council on Innovation and Competitiveness includes members from various departments and agencies to monitor and advise on promoting innovation, global competitiveness, and improving conditions for innovation through talent development, investment, and infrastructure improvements. It also evaluates specific research and education programs. The President's Council on Innovation and Competitiveness includes members from various departments and agencies to monitor and advise on promoting innovation, global competitiveness, and improving conditions for innovation. Provisions are in place to evaluate specific research and education programs, such as ARPA-E and the Discovery Science and Engineering Innovation Institutes. Federal research programs are required to be evaluated based on quality, relevance, and performance. The DOE summer institutes and ED STEM baccalaureate degree grants are evaluated based on quality, relevance, and performance. The evaluation includes assessing the impact on STEM teaching skills, increasing STEM teacher participation, and improving student academic achievement on State STEM assessments. The ED STEM grants aim to increase the number of STEM teachers, improve student academic achievement, and evaluate programs to bring more professionals into teaching STEM and retain teachers in need. An annual independent evaluation assesses the impact on student academic achievement. The ED STEM grants aim to increase the number of STEM teachers, improve student academic achievement, and evaluate programs to bring more professionals into teaching STEM. An annual independent evaluation assesses the impact on student academic achievement, with reports to relevant committees. Monitoring mechanisms are in place to evaluate U.S. competitiveness. The WEF Global Competitiveness Report and OECD Science, Technology, and Industry Scoreboard provide useful indicators for evaluating U.S. competitiveness. The WEF report ranks countries based on data and surveys of business leaders, while the OECD report focuses on innovation and trade competitiveness. The OECD Science, Technology, and Industry Scoreboard report analyzes innovation by regions and industries, trade competitiveness, and productivity using input and output indicators like economic trade balance, foreign direct investment, employment, and wages. Various agencies like the BEA, BLS, Census Bureau, and NSF monitor these indicators regularly. The BEA, BLS, Census Bureau, and NSF monitor output indicators regularly. The NSF releases a biannual Science and Engineering Indicators report that tracks the health of the science and engineering enterprise. Input indicators like education quality, STEM workforce availability, and innovation capacity are also monitored. The BEA is conducting an analysis on R&D's contribution to GDP growth. The America COMPETES Act programs focus on input indicators like STEM workforce and innovation capacity to improve the nation's competitiveness. Despite being ranked number one overall in the WEF competitiveness analysis, the US does not rank first on all input/output indicators. This highlights areas where the US needs to focus relative to its competitors. The America COMPETES Act programs focus on key sub-indicators related to education, innovation, and scientific research institutions. The US ranks 2nd in quality of scientific research institutions and 9th in capacity for innovation out of 131 countries. State-level competitiveness analysis is also available, with indicators influenced by the Act. Some input/output indicators in analyses influenced by the America COMPETES Act include factors like human capital investment, research and development inputs, risk capital, technology workforce, and technology concentration. Various organizations use different factors such as high-tech jobs, scientists/engineers in the workforce, R&D expenditures, and workforce educational attainment for their assessments. Alera and Suffolk University's Beacon Hill Institute use factors like R&D expenditures, human capital, public education, academic R&D funding, and STEM degrees in their assessments.
