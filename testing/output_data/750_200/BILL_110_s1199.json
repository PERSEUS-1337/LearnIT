    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Nanotechnology in the Schools Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings section. The rapidly growing field of nanotechnology is generating breakthroughs that will benefit society by improving design and manufacturing processes. Nanotechnology is expected to have a positive impact on security, economy, and health in the United States. It is crucial for the US to maintain world leadership in nanotechnology to maximize its benefits for individuals. According to the National Science Foundation, foreign students on temporary visas earned a significant percentage of science and engineering doctorates in the United States in 2003, with many intending to return to their home countries after completing their studies. To maintain leadership in nanotechnology, the United States needs to invest in educating its students in secondary schools and higher education to conduct research and develop nanotechnology applications. The Act aims to enhance the ability of US schools and higher education institutions to prepare students for careers in nanotechnology by providing grants for necessary tools and training. The Act aims to enhance US schools and higher education institutions to prepare students for careers in nanotechnology by providing grants for tools and training. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines an \"eligible institution\" as a school offering advanced science courses or a community college or 4-year higher education institution. The Act defines \"qualified nanotechnology equipment\" as equipment used for teaching nanotechnology. \"Qualified nanotechnology equipment\" refers to equipment used for teaching nanotechnology in the classroom, manufactured in the United States with at least 50 percent domestic materials. SEC. 4. PROGRAM AUTHORIZED. The Director of the National Science Foundation will establish a nanotechnology in the schools program to strengthen eligible institutions' capacity to provide nanotechnology instruction. Grants of up to $150,000 will be awarded to acquire equipment and software for teaching nanotechnology in the classroom. The National Science Foundation will establish a program to enhance nanotechnology instruction in schools by providing grants for equipment, software, educational services, faculty development, and teacher education/certification. The National Science Foundation will establish a program to enhance nanotechnology instruction in schools by providing grants for equipment, software, educational services, faculty development, and teacher education/certification. The program aims to provide teacher education and certification for individuals seeking to enhance technology skills for using nanotechnology in the classroom. Not more than 1/4 of the grant funds can be used for software, educational services, or teacher education and certification. The National Science Foundation will establish a program to enhance nanotechnology instruction in schools through grants for equipment, software, educational services, faculty development, and teacher education/certification. Grants awarded to community colleges or higher education institutions can only be used in undergraduate programs. Eligible institutions must submit an application to the Director to receive a grant under this Act. The Director will establish a procedure for accepting grant applications under the Act within 180 days of enactment. Selection of eligible institutions for grants will be done with a focus on encouraging applications. The Director will select eligible entities in diverse locations, encourage historically Black colleges and universities and minority institutions to apply for grants under the Act. The Director will select eligible institutions, including those in EPSCoR states, for grants under the Act. Institutions must agree to cost requirements to receive a grant. The institution receiving the grant must provide non-Federal contributions amounting to 1/4 of the grant. The Director can waive this requirement for institutions with no or low endowment. The institution must provide non-Federal contributions amounting to 1/4 of the grant. The Director can waive this requirement for institutions with no or low endowment. If a branch receives a grant over $100,000, it is ineligible for another grant for 2 years. If an institution other than a branch receives a grant exceeding $100,000 under this Act, it will be ineligible for another grant for 2 years. SEC. 5. ANNUAL REPORT AND EVALUATION. Each institution receiving a grant must submit a report on grant fund usage within a year. The Director will review these reports annually and evaluate the program every third year based on the activities of grant-receiving institutions. The Director evaluates activities of grant-receiving institutions and assesses their impact on students, faculty, and staff. A report with recommendations for Federal support is submitted to Congress within 6 months. Authorization of appropriations for the Director to carry out the Act includes $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2008 and necessary sums for fiscal years 2009 through 2011."
