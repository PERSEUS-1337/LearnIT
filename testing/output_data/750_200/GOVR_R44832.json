    "content": "Prescription drug affordability has become a major concern due to the rapid rise in retail drug spending. This increase is attributed to manufacturers introducing new drugs and raising prices for existing brand-name products. Additionally, fewer brand-name drugs losing patent protection has resulted in lower savings from generic substitutes. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services predict a 6.3% annual growth in retail drug spending from 2017 to 2026. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services forecasts a 6.3% annual growth in retail drug spending from 2017 to 2026, with retail drug spending expected to increase faster than other areas of medical spending. The report addresses government and private-sector policies affecting drug prices and availability, including federally funded research, regulation of direct-to-consumer advertising, legal restrictions on reimportation, and federal price negotiation. The report discusses government and private-sector policies impacting drug prices and availability, including federally funded research, regulation of direct-to-consumer advertising, legal restrictions on reimportation, and federal price negotiation. It references National Health Expenditures data on prescription drug spending in retail settings. The United States spent $328.6 billion on prescription drugs in 2016, forecasted to reach $338.1 billion in 2017, accounting for 10% of national health care spending. By 2027, prescription drug spending is expected to increase to about 11% of total health care spending. Retail drug spending typically ranges from 5% to 10% of total health care expenditures. Prescription drug spending is projected to increase to around 11% of national health care spending by 2027. Retail drug spending has varied from 5% to 10% of total health care expenditures since 1960. The Department of Health and Human Services conducted a study in April 2016 to estimate total U.S. prescription drug spending, including retail and institutional use in hospitals and health facilities. The Department of Health and Human Services conducted a study in April 2016 to estimate total U.S. prescription drug spending, including retail and institutional use in hospitals and health facilities. National estimates vary due to factors like rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers and coupons for consumers, but all studies show a trend towards higher spending in recent years. The pace of U.S. retail prescription drug spending has varied over the decades, with growth slowing from 2003 to 2013 due to various factors. However, in 2014, spending for retail drugs increased. Retail drug spending in the U.S. saw a significant increase in 2014, with a 12.4% jump, the largest in over a decade. Subsequent years showed varying growth rates, with a forecasted 2.9% increase in 2017. Projections indicate an average annual growth of about 6.3% through 2027, driven by faster drug price growth, especially for specialty drugs. The NHE projects a 6.3% annual growth in drug spending through 2027, driven by faster price growth for specialty drugs. This growth rate is higher than that of physician services and hospital care. Hearings in Congress have addressed the sharp increases in drug prices and overall spending. Retail prescription drug spending has been the focus of congressional hearings due to rising costs driven by new high-cost drugs, price increases, and decreased generic substitution impact. The rate of prescription drug spending slowed in 2016 due to factors such as fewer new drug approvals, decreased use of high-cost hepatitis C drugs, and a deceleration in spending for diabetes treatment drugs. New, innovator brand-name drugs are often more expensive than older drugs. The U.S. FDA has approved many new expensive specialty drugs for various conditions like hepatitis C, cancer, diabetes, and heart disease. These new drugs contribute significantly to the growth in prescription drug spending, with more than half of the increase in 2016 coming from drugs available for less than two years. In 2016, over half of the rise in U.S. prescription drug spending came from drugs available for less than two years, including new hepatitis C drugs that accounted for a significant portion of the increase. The impact of these expensive drugs is decreasing as fewer new patients are treated and prices drop. Since 2016, U.S. prescription drug spending has been decreasing as fewer new patients are treated with expensive drugs and net prices drop. The patent cliff in 2012 led to a significant decrease in spending for brand-name drugs subject to generic competition. Changes in drug mix will continue to impact spending in the future. Annual savings from brands losing patent protection has decreased since the patent cliff in 2012. Changes in drug mix will continue to affect spending, especially with the rise of biologics in the development pipeline. FDA has approved biosimilar substitutes for some biologics, but they are not significantly lower-priced. Prescription drug prices have been rising faster than overall U.S. goods and services since 2014. Prescription drug prices have risen faster than overall U.S. goods and services since 2014, driven by price increases for existing brand-name drugs and adoption of expensive new innovator brand-name drugs. In 2014, U.S. retail drug inflation was 6.4%, compared to general consumer inflation of 0.8%. The gap between prescription drug and overall inflation narrowed significantly in 2017, with drug inflation at 2.8% compared to consumer inflation of 2.1%. Drug inflation has been driven by price increases for existing brand-name drugs and adoption of expensive new innovator brand-name drugs. Manufacturers have also raised prices for existing generic drugs, but a 2016 HHS study found that generic price increases were not a major contributor to inflation. Express Scripts analysis showed that average prices for commonly used brand-name drugs rose 10.7% from 2015 to 2016, while average prices for generic drugs declined by 8.7% over the same period. The average prices for commonly used brand-name drugs increased by 10.7% from 2015 to 2016, while prices for generic drugs decreased by 8.7% during the same period. Biologics and specialty drugs have been driving the price inflation in the brand-name drug category. The ACA expansion of prescription drug coverage has boosted demand for prescription drugs, with a nearly 15% annual increase in drug spending for insured consumers on ACA exchange-based health plans. The ACA expansion of prescription drug coverage has led to a significant increase in drug spending for insured consumers on ACA exchange-based health plans. This increase is mainly driven by higher utilization, with Medicaid coverage also expanding under the ACA to include drug coverage for non-elderly, low-income individuals. The aging of the baby boomers has also contributed to increased demand for prescription drugs, with patients aged 50 and older accounting for a majority of dispensed prescriptions. According to IQVIA, patients aged 50 and older accounted for 70% of dispensed prescriptions in 2016 and 77% of the increase in drug dispensing since 2011. Out-of-pocket spending for filled prescriptions made up 57% of U.S. retail drug spending in 1990, but has since declined to 13.2% as commercial payers and taxpayer-financed health programs cover a growing share of the nation's retail prescription drug bill. Payers and taxpayer-financed health programs cover a growing share of the nation's retail prescription drug bill. Out-of-pocket spending declined to 13.2% of drug spending in 2017, with a forecast to account for 12.1% in 2026. Consumer cost sharing represents a smaller share of overall prescription drug spending, but high out-of-pocket expenses can still occur depending on various factors. Health plans have been increasing cost sharing for prescription drugs, with a rise in drug deductibles and the use of formulary tiered pricing. This trend is especially prevalent in health plans sold on ACA state exchanges. The use of formulary tiered pricing and coinsurance for expensive drugs has been increasing in health plans, especially those sold on ACA state exchanges. This trend has widened the price differential between tiers, placing a greater financial burden on consumers. For example, in 2017, enrollees in employer-sponsored health plans with three or more drug tiers had an average co-payment of $110. In 2017, enrollees in employer-sponsored health plans faced a financial burden with higher-priced drugs, with an average co-payment of $110 for tier-four drugs compared to $11 for generic drugs. Cost-sharing increases were partially offset by ACA regulations and pharmaceutical manufacturer assistance programs. Manufacturers have expanded patient assistance through discount coupons and programs based on health condition and income. Generic drug-use rates have increased, leading to a decline in average out-of-pocket spending for retail drugs. However, the number of consumers with high out-of-pocket costs, especially those with serious conditions or prescribed specialty drugs, has risen. A 2016 study found that average out-of-pocket spending decreased to $144 in 2014 from a. The out-of-pocket spending for specialty drugs has increased, with some enrollees facing costs over $1,000 in 2014. The share of people with high drug costs has tripled since 2004, and median out-of-pocket spending for outpatient specialty drugs rose by 46% from 2003 to 2014. Out-of-pocket spending for outpatient specialty drugs costing $600 or more per month increased from $24 to $35 per month from 2003 to 2014, a 46% rise. Median out-of-pocket spending for nonspecialty drugs decreased 57% from $14 to $6 per month during the same period. Per person out-of-pocket spending for retail prescription drugs declined from $146 in 2010 to $140 in 2016, forecasted to decrease to $137 in 2017 and gradually rise to $207 by 2026. Despite overall U.S. retail drug spending increasing, out-of-pocket spending is expected to decline as a share of retail drug expenditures. Out-of-pocket spending is expected to decline as a share of retail drug expenditures, with the government's share of U.S. retail prescription drug spending forecasted to rise to 47% by 2026. This increase is attributed to the expansion of subsidized drug coverage through programs like Medicare Part D and Medicaid eligibility under the ACA. The government's share of U.S. retail prescription drug spending is expected to rise to 47% by 2026. Unlike other countries, the U.S. does not have a centralized system for administering government-sponsored drug benefits. Various departments and agencies oversee different drug discount and contracting systems. The U.S. government oversees drug discounts and procurement through different programs like Medicare Part D, Veterans Health Administration, and Medicaid. The FDA ensures drug safety but does not regulate prices. Federal agencies can secure discounts, with Medicaid rebates being higher than those in Medicare Part D. In 2012, Medicaid rebates were 47% of Medicaid spending, much higher than the 15% of Part D spending. Some Medicaid rebates were over 10 times larger than Part D rebates for the same drugs. Legislation has been proposed to allow the HHS Secretary to negotiate Medicare Part D drug prices. The purchasing systems for federal health care programs include Medicare Part D, Medicare Part B, Medicaid, and the Veterans Health Administration health system. Medicare Part D is a market-oriented program where commercial health payers compete for enrollees based on drug coverage and pricing. Part D plan sponsors negotiate drug rebates and discounts with manufacturers and contract with pharmacies for drug dispensing. The Medicare Part D program involves plans, unions, employers, and PBMs negotiating drug rebates and discounts with manufacturers. The program prohibits the HHS Secretary from intervening in negotiations between plan sponsors, manufacturers, and pharmacies. Congress has debated the effectiveness of the market-based model in controlling drug prices and enrollee costs. Congress has debated the effectiveness of the market-based model in controlling drug prices and enrollee costs under the Medicare Part D program. Total Part D drug rebates have increased significantly over the years, with forecasts predicting a rise to 24% in 2018. A 2014 Congressional Budget Office study found that areas with robust competition among Part D plans had lower premiums. The Congressional Budget Office found that Part D premiums were lower in areas with robust competition among plans, but Part D plans have higher drug prices than Medicaid. Lawmakers propose giving the Secretary authority to negotiate drug prices to secure larger discounts for Medicare beneficiaries. The House approved H.R. 4 in 2007 to allow the Secretary to negotiate Part D drug prices, but the Senate did not approve it. A CBO analysis stated that the bill would only save money if the Secretary had authority to create a central formulary or set prices administratively. Patient and consumer groups oppose giving the Secretary more control of the Part D formulary, fearing it could reduce drug coverage. Lawmakers have introduced bills to modify the noninterference provision, while the Obama Administration recommended allowing the Secretary to negotiate prices for high-cost Medicare Part D drugs. The Trump Administration has also suggested additional approaches. The Trump Administration has recommended additional approaches for Medicare Part D, including requiring plans to pass on more drug rebates to enrollees and moving some Part B-covered drugs to Part D. Lawmakers have introduced legislation to apply Medicaid's rebates to Part D drugs for low-income enrollees, with potential cost savings according to CBO. State governments play a key role in regulating prescription drug use and pricing, administering and funding Medicaid, and offering health insurance plans to state employees. Some states have patient assistance programs providing free prescription drugs to low-income individuals. Some states are taking various approaches to address prescription drug spending and access, focusing on limiting spending for high-priced drugs and requiring transparency in drug prices. California, Delaware, and Vermont have passed laws to regulate drug costs and increase manufacturer disclosure for drugs with significant price increases. In 2016, Vermont passed a law requiring drug manufacturers to disclose large price increases. The law mandates an annual list of 15 drugs with significant price hikes, with manufacturers having to justify the increases to the state attorney general. The goal is to make drug companies justify prices based on costs and to prohibit gag clauses that prevent pharmacists from informing consumers about cheaper options. The United States spends more on prescription drugs than other industrialized nations, with a 34% share of global drug spending in 2016. Some states are passing legislation to allow citizens to import drugs from other countries and to prohibit gag clauses that prevent pharmacists from informing consumers about cheaper options. The United States spends more on prescription drugs than other industrialized nations, with a projected increase to 45% of global drug spending by 2021. U.S. per capita spending for retail prescription drugs was $1,162 in 2015, significantly higher than the OECD average of $553. The United States spends more on prescription drugs compared to other industrialized nations. U.S. per capita spending for retail prescription drugs was significantly higher than the OECD average. Studies have shown that drug prices in the U.S. are often double those in the European Union, with various reasons cited for the higher spending and prices. The higher U.S. spending on prescription drugs is attributed to faster adoption of new drugs, market exclusivity for manufacturers, and lack of price limits. OECD countries may have government-run healthcare systems that set price limits using external reference pricing. Value-based pricing is used in national health programs to determine drug payment based on effectiveness. In Canada, the Common Drug Review evaluates new and existing drugs for reimbursement. In the U.S., alternative pricing methods are being explored, such as by Harvard Pilgrim Health Care. In the U.S., alternative pricing methods are being explored by Harvard Pilgrim Health Care and other payers, with a focus on value-based purchasing. CMS is encouraging state Medicaid programs to adopt this approach, while the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) is producing reports on drug effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) produces public reports on the effectiveness and cost of newly approved drugs, raising concerns in the pharmaceutical industry about limiting reimbursement and patient access. ICER has engaged with various healthcare sectors to refine its drug valuation methodology. The federal government focuses on basic research while the pharmaceutical industry invests more in clinical trials. Assigning credit for therapeutic advancements is challenging without major basic advances like recombinant DNA. Various studies have tried to quantify the contribution of publicly funded research to new drug discovery. Various studies have quantified the contribution of publicly funded research to new drug discovery. A study in 2003 found that only 6.7% of new drugs approved by the FDA from 1990-1999 originated from sources other than private industry. Another study in 1993 found that 7.6% of new drugs approved from 1981-1990 came from non-industry sources. A 2010 study found that 24.1% of new molecular entities (NMEs) and new biologics approved by the FDA between 1998 and 2007 originated from publicly funded research. Another study by Ashley J. Stevens et al. in 2011 provided a more comprehensive analysis of the contribution of publicly funded research to the discovery of new drugs. The Stevens study in 2011 analyzed the contribution of publicly funded research to new drug discovery. It found that 9.3% of FDA-approved drugs from 1990 to 2007 resulted from publicly funded labs. Additionally, 19% of drugs that received priority review were a result of publicly funded research. This highlights the significant impact of public-sector research institutions on drug development. According to a study, 19% of drugs that received priority review were from public-sector research institutions, showing their significant impact on drug development. The data suggests that these institutions tend to discover drugs with important clinical effects. The 2011 Stevens study analyzed the role of public-sector research institutions in drug discovery, focusing on drugs with significant clinical effects. The study excluded the contribution of these institutions to platform technologies that enabled the development of new drug classes approved by the FDA. The study excluded platform technologies developed with public funds, such as recombinant DNA technology and methods for producing antibodies, from its evaluation of public-sector research institutions' role in drug discovery. The Cabilly, Axel, and Mello-Fire patents revolutionized antibody production, glycosylated protein synthesis, and gene silencing. These platform technologies have led to the development of numerous new drugs, shaping the economic landscape of the pharmaceutical industry. A 2018 study revealed that public funding, particularly from the NIH, played a crucial role in the approval of new medical entities by the FDA from 2010 to 2016. The study found that NIH funding was associated with every one of the 210 new medical entities approved from 2010-2016. About 29% of the publications were directly linked to NIH-funded projects, with up to 20% of the NIH budget allocation from 2000 to 2016 contributing to new drug approvals. The study found that NIH funding was associated with every one of the 210 new medical entities approved from 2010-2016. The authors concluded that the NIH's contribution to research for new drug approvals is greater than previously appreciated. Pharmaceutical manufacturers disclose aggregate research and development spending, but specific drug development costs are not usually available. Academic researchers have tried to estimate average spending for drug development, with the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development being a commonly cited source. The Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development conducted a study estimating the average cost of developing an FDA-approved prescription drug to be $2.6 billion in 2014, including $1.4 billion in clinical spending and $1.2 billion in time costs. This study used data from 10 large drug manufacturers to analyze the expenses and time investments involved in drug development. The Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development estimated the cost of developing an FDA-approved prescription drug to be $2.6 billion in 2014, including $1.4 billion in clinical spending and $1.2 billion in time costs. However, academic and government research has challenged the study's assumptions, including the rate of return for drug companies and the impact of federal tax breaks on research and development spending. A 2016 HHS study highlighted the high costs of new drug development, ranging from $1.2 billion to $2.6 billion, with factors such as development time, cost of capital, and inclusion of orphan drugs affecting estimates. Transparency legislation may require drugmakers to disclose research, marketing, and other costs for drugs. Price transparency legislation being debated in Congress and state legislatures would compel drugmakers to provide data on research, marketing, and other costs for high-priced or significantly increased drugs. Research costs are not always the primary factor in drug pricing, as shown in studies of specific drugs like Gilead Pharmaceutical's hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni. The 2015 Senate Finance Committee investigation of Gilead Pharmaceutical's hepatitis C drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni revealed that pricing was focused on maximizing revenue rather than research and development costs. Pfizer's pricing strategy for the breast cancer drug Ibrance was influenced by the prices of existing drugs in the same category. The main factors influencing Pfizer's pricing strategy for the breast cancer drug Ibrance include the prices of existing drugs in the same therapeutic category, likely reimbursement from insurance companies and federal programs, and feedback from prescribers. The United States and New Zealand are the only nations allowing direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription drugs, regulated by the FDA to ensure accuracy and balance in the information provided. Pharmaceutical companies can deduct advertising expenses for drugs, including direct-to-consumer advertising. This form of advertising is part of the industry's promotion efforts, alongside marketing to healthcare providers. FDA has authority over pharmaceutical advertising since 1962. Pharmaceutical advertising has evolved since 1962 when FDA gained authority over prescription drug advertising. In 1969, regulations required true and balanced information in ads primarily in print journals for physicians. By the 1980s, firms started advertising to consumers, addressed by FDA in 1985. Guidance on broadcast ads was issued in 1999, with updated guidance on internet advertising since then. DTC prescription drug advertising has steadily expanded. DTC prescription drug advertising has steadily increased over the years, reaching over $6 billion in 2015. Pharmaceutical advertising rose 56% from 2012 to 2015, with companies directing more money towards advertising. DTC prescription drug advertising increased to over $6 billion in 2015, with a 56% rise from 2012 to 2015. Companies focused on advertising newly introduced drugs, with internet-based ads showing the fastest growth. FDA regulations require drug companies to submit ads for assessment. According to FDA analysis from 2001 to 2014, internet prescription drug promotions are increasing while television promotions remain flat. Pharmaceutical advertising supporters claim it leads to more informed consumers and better diagnosis of undertreated illnesses, but critics argue about the industry's presentation. Critics argue that pharmaceutical advertising may lead to inappropriate prescribing and higher drug spending, as new brand-name drugs with higher prices may not always offer significant additional benefits compared to existing drugs. Recent studies suggest a link between drug advertising and increased use of prescription drugs, with a 2015 study showing a 10% rise in drug advertising views leading to a 5.4% increase in filled prescriptions for the advertised drugs. A 2006 Government Accountability Office report found that advertising may encourage the use of advertised drugs even if alternatives may be more appropriate. Advertising for prescription drugs may have direct benefits but can also lead to the use of advertised drugs even when alternatives may be more suitable. A government survey found that many people feel DTC advertisements lack sufficient information about the benefits and risks of the drugs. There have been debates in Congress about restricting DTC drug advertising to protect public health and finances. The American Medical Association recommended a ban on DTC drug ads in 2015. The American Medical Association and the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists recommended a ban on direct-to-consumer drug ads in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Legislation in the 114th Congress proposed a moratorium on advertising for new drugs, citing concerns about promoting drugs without sufficient long-term evidence. Manufacturers are focusing ad dollars on newly introduced products, raising constitutional issues regarding commercial speech and the First Amendment. The focus on advertising new drugs raises concerns about promoting products without long-term evidence of safety and effectiveness. Various recommendations and legislative proposals have been made to restrict or ban direct-to-consumer drug ads, including a suggested two-year moratorium by the Institute of Medicine in 2006. Congress has debated but not approved measures such as disallowing tax deductions for pharmaceutical advertising to reduce drug spending. FDA has also been involved in regulating DTC advertising under federal authority. Tax deductions for pharmaceutical DTC advertising have been debated by Congress to reduce drug spending. FDA regulates the sale of pharmaceuticals in the United States under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. An approved marketing application includes clinical data on safety and effectiveness, manufacturing procedures, reporting processes, and labeling requirements. The Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987 clarified that imported drugs must meet detailed FDA approval requirements, including labeling approved for U.S. sales. Physically identical drugs packaged for foreign sale would not meet U.S. packaging codes. The Medicine Equity and Drug Safety Act (MEDS Act) of 2000 allowed pharmacists and wholesalers to import FDA-approved prescription drugs, but in practice, importation has not been allowed. The act required the HHS Secretary to certify to Congress before implementing regulations for import provisions. The MEDS Act of 2000 allowed importation of FDA-approved drugs, but implementation has been hindered as no HHS Secretary has certified to Congress, preventing cost reduction for consumers. The importation provision in the MEDS Act of 2000 has never been implemented due to lack of necessary certifications from HHS Secretaries, preventing consumers from importing prescription drugs from abroad. If implemented, a company could bring FDA-approved drugs manufactured outside the US into the country for sale. Lawmakers have attempted to use the agriculture appropriations bill to bypass obstacles to prescription drug importation into the US. The FDA has been lenient in enforcing personal importation of drugs that comply with FDA approval requirements. The FDA has been lenient in enforcing personal importation of drugs that comply with FDA approval requirements, allowing individuals to bring in a 90-day supply of non-FDA-approved drugs for personal use. Individuals must affirm in writing that the drugs are for their own use and provide their treating physician's information. FDA's personal-use import policy was not intended for consumers to bring lower-priced prescription drugs into the US. The FDA's personal importation policy was not designed for consumers to import lower-priced prescription drugs into the US. It aims to save FDA resources and allow individuals to access medical treatments not available in the US. Foreign-made chemical versions of drugs already available in the US are not covered by this policy. The FDA's personal importation policy in the United States is now being used by consumers seeking lower foreign prices for FDA-approved drugs available in the US, rather than for importing drugs not available domestically. Some states have tried to pass laws allowing prescription drug importation. The Senate Committees have held hearings on drug costs and the repercussions of pharmaceutical companies' business models on patients and the healthcare system. The Senate Committees have conducted hearings on sudden price spikes in decades-old Rx drugs and off-patent drugs, as well as examining the proposed Medicare Part B drug demonstration. The Senate Committees have conducted hearings on sudden price spikes in decades-old Rx drugs and off-patent drugs, as well as examining the proposed Medicare Part B drug demonstration. The hearings included discussions on the cost of prescription drugs and how the drug delivery system affects what patients pay.

The FDA report from the 114th Congress discusses progress on biosimilar implementation and advancing research for patients. The House Energy and Commerce Committee examined the drug supply chain in the 115th Congress, while another hearing focused on how covered entities utilize the 340B Drug Pricing Program. In 2017, the House Energy and Commerce Committee held hearings on various topics including the drug supply chain, utilization of the 340B Drug Pricing Program by covered entities, patient access to investigational drugs, and modernizing FDA's regulation of over-the-counter drugs. The House Energy and Commerce Committee held hearings in 2017 on topics such as the drug supply chain, 340B Drug Pricing Program, patient access to investigational drugs, and modernizing FDA's regulation of over-the-counter drugs. The House Energy and Commerce Committee held hearings in 2017 on various topics related to the drug supply chain, 340B Drug Pricing Program, patient access to investigational drugs, and modernizing FDA's regulation of over-the-counter drugs. The hearings included discussions on the Obama Administration's Medicare drug experiment, antitrust concerns in the FDA approval process, and the state of competition in the pharmacy benefit manager and pharmacy marketplaces. The State of Competition in the Pharmacy Benefit Manager and Pharmacy Marketplaces was discussed in a hearing by the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform in November 2015. This included examining the impact of voluntary restricted distribution systems in the pharmaceutical supply chain. Examining the Impact of Voluntary Restricted Distribution Systems in the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain, Reviewing the Rising Price of EpiPens, and Developments in the Prescription Drug Market were topics discussed in congressional hearings."
