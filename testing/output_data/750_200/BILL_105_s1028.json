    "content": "The Act titled \"Quincy Library Group Forest Recovery and Economic Stability Act of 1997\" establishes a pilot project for Plumas, Lassen, and Tahoe National Forests to implement the Quincy Library Group proposal. The Quincy Library Group-Community Stability Proposal defines an agreement by a coalition in northern California to develop a resource management program for Federal lands in the Sierra Nevada area. It includes a map dated June 1993. The Act establishes a pilot project for implementing this proposal in specific national forests. The Quincy Library Group-Community Stability Proposal outlines an agreement for a resource management program in the Sierra Nevada area. A pilot project on Federal lands is required to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed activities within 200 days of completing an environmental impact statement. The Quincy Library Group-Community Stability Proposal recommends management activities in specific areas of California's national forests for a pilot project to demonstrate effectiveness. The pilot project will be conducted on Federal lands within designated areas outlined on a map dated June 1993. The pilot project area, designated in June 1993, excludes spotted owl habitat areas and protected activity centers from resource management activities and timber harvesting. The Regional Forester for region 5 will oversee these exclusions. During the pilot project, resource management activities, road building, and timber harvesting are prohibited on designated Federal lands in California's Plumas National Forest, Lassen National Forest, and Sierraville Ranger District of the Tahoe National Forest. During the pilot project, resource management activities, road building, and timber harvesting are prohibited on designated Federal lands in California's Plumas National Forest, Lassen National Forest, and Sierraville Ranger District of the Tahoe National Forest. Riparian protection guidelines apply to all resource management and timber harvesting activities in the pilot project area. The guidelines for resource management activities in designated Federal lands in California are outlined in a Forest Service research document co-authored by Dr. Jack Ward Thomas in March 1993. Compliance with applicable Federal law and standards is required for all activities. During the pilot project, resource management activities on Federal lands in California must comply with applicable Federal law and guidelines for the conservation of the California spotted owl as outlined in the California Spotted Owl Sierran Provence Interim Guidelines. This includes construction of fuelbreaks on an acreage basis. The pilot project area includes fuelbreak construction of defensible zones using various vegetation management methods on 40,000 to 60,000 acres per year, along with group and individual tree selection for forest management. Utilization of group selection and individual tree selection for uneven-aged forest management in the Quincy Library Group-Community Stability Proposal aims to achieve all-age, multistory, fire resilient forests. Group selection covers .57 percent of the pilot project area annually, with the option of individual tree selection. Total acreage for resource management is also considered. The pilot project area may utilize selection methods for resource management activities, with a total acreage limit of 70,000 acres per year. Riparian management, including protection zones and restoration projects, is required. The Secretary must prioritize cost-effectiveness in implementing these activities. The Secretary will use cost-effective means to implement resource management activities for the pilot project, utilizing specific funds allocated for the Forest Service and excess funds. The Secretary will implement resource management activities for the pilot project using specific funds allocated for the Forest Service and excess funds. The pilot project cannot use funds designated for any other unit of the National Forest System. During the pilot project, forest supervisors may use excess funds for resource management activities in specific national forests. The Secretary or forest supervisors are restricted from using funds designated for other forest units. The Tahoe National Forest will conduct resource management activities as outlined in subsection (d), with restrictions on using funds that may limit other non-timber multiple use activities. Up to 12 percent of available funds can be allocated for general administration or overhead costs. Authorized supplemental funds are available to be appropriated for the pilot project, with a minimum baseline funding level required for resource management activities. Baseline funds for resource management activities must include existing funding levels. The pilot project will be conducted from the enactment of the Act until the completion of land and resource management plan revisions for specific national forests, or up to five years after the enactment date. The pilot project will be conducted in National Forests, including Lassen and Tahoe National Forests, for up to five years. Consultation with the Quincy Library Group is required for preparing statements, and private contracts may be used for implementation. Regional Forester must make corresponding Forest Plan Amendments within 180 days of the Act's enactment. Within 180 days of the Act's enactment, the Regional Forester for Region 5 will begin amending the land and resource management plans for Plumas, Lassen, and Tahoe National Forests to include the pilot project and other specified activities from the Quincy Library Group Community Stability Proposal. The pilot project includes resource management activities outlined in the Quincy Library Group Community Stability Proposal and other necessary changes based on environmental analyses and relevant laws. Reporting requirements mandate the Secretary to provide updates annually by February 28. The Secretary must submit an annual report to Congress by February 28 on the status of the pilot project, including a complete accounting of funds used and accounts for the previous fiscal year. The annual report to Congress must include a schedule of funds used from accounts in the previous fiscal year for resource management activities, along with a description of total acres treated and natural resources-related benefits achieved. The annual report to Congress must include a schedule of funds used for resource management activities, total acres treated, water yield increases, economic benefits to local communities, and a comparison of revenues and costs incurred in the implementation of resource management activities on Federal lands. The annual report to Congress must include a schedule of funds used for resource management activities, total acres treated, water yield increases, economic benefits to local communities, a comparison of revenues and costs incurred in the implementation of resource management activities on Federal lands, and details on management activities, revenues, costs, and environmental impacts for the pilot project area. The final report will assess the effectiveness of the pilot project in meeting its goals, including watershed monitoring of lands. Federal funds for each annual report are limited to $50,000. The final report for the pilot project will assess watershed monitoring, analyze environmental impacts, consult with the Quincy Library Group, and be submitted to Congress by July 1, 2002. The pilot project report, including watershed monitoring and environmental impact analysis, must be submitted to Congress by July 1, 2002. Federal funds for the assessment and report are limited to $150,000, with an additional $75,000 allocated for watershed monitoring each fiscal year from 2000 to 2002. The project is not exempt from any Federal environmental laws."
