    "content": "Deconvolutional layers are commonly used in deep models for up-sampling, but they often face the checkerboard problem due to the lack of direct relationships among adjacent pixels on the output feature map. To address this issue, the PixelDCL method is proposed to establish direct relationships among adjacent pixels on the up-sampled feature map, offering a new interpretation of regular deconvolution operations. The PixelDCL method establishes direct relationships among adjacent pixels on up-sampled feature maps, improving spatial feature consideration and segmentation accuracy compared to deconvolutional layers. It can be seamlessly integrated into models without compromising trainability, although efficiency may slightly decrease. Deep learning methods, including deconvolutional layers, are used in various artificial intelligence tasks like image classification, semantic segmentation, and image generation. Deconvolutional layers are essential for up-sampling feature maps in deep models. The PixelDCL method is proposed to improve deconvolutional layers in deep models, addressing the issue of checkerboard artifacts and enhancing the generation of photo-realistic images and smooth outputs in tasks like semantic segmentation and image generation. The PixelDCL method aims to solve the checkerboard problem in deconvolution operations by introducing a new approach that addresses the root cause of checkerboard artifacts. The PixelDCL method introduces pixel deconvolutional operations to address checkerboard artifacts in output feature maps by establishing direct relationships among adjacent pixels. This sequential generation of intermediate feature maps may slightly decrease computational efficiency. The proposed PixelDCL method addresses checkerboard artifacts in output feature maps by introducing pixel deconvolutional operations. Experimental results show improved performance in semantic segmentation and image generation tasks. The proposed PixelDCL method effectively overcomes the checkerboard problem and enhances predictive and generative performance in tasks like semantic segmentation and image generation. It is related to PixelRNNs and PixelCNNs, which are generative models utilizing autoregressive methods for probability density estimation. Masked convolutions in training make the training time comparable to other generative models like GANs and VAEs. PixelDCL can replace deconvolutional layers in a plug-and-play manner, overcoming checkerboard artifacts. It offers a more efficient alternative to PixelRNNs and PixelCNNs, which generate images pixel by pixel. The slight decrease in efficiency can be mitigated with an implementation trick. The pixel deconvolutional layers proposed in this section offer an efficient alternative to deconvolutional networks. These layers are commonly used in deep models for tasks like semantic segmentation and generative models. Deconvolutional operations involve shuffling intermediate feature maps obtained through convolutional operations for up-sampling. Deconvolutional operations involve shuffling intermediate feature maps obtained through convolutional operations for up-sampling, illustrated in Figures 2 and 3. Standard deconvolution can be decomposed into several convolutional operations based on the up-sampling factor. A deconvolutional layer can generate an up-sampled output by applying convolutional operations and periodical shuffling. A deconvolutional layer can generate an up-sampled output by shuffling intermediate feature maps obtained through convolutional operations. The intermediate feature maps are generated by independent convolutional kernels, with no direct relationship among them. The periodical shuffling operation plays a key role in this process. The pixel deconvolutional operation is proposed to address checkerboard artifacts caused by the periodical shuffling of intermediate feature maps in convolutional operations. This approach aims to alleviate the need for post-processing methods like smoothing, which can add complexity to the network and hinder full trainability. The pixel deconvolutional operation addresses checkerboard artifacts in convolutional operations by making adjacent pixels close to each other, solving the problem effectively without compromising network trainability. The pixel deconvolutional layers address the checkerboard artifact problem in deconvolutional layers by ensuring adjacent pixels are close together, without compromising network trainability. The iPixelDCL involves convolution with multiple feature maps, conditioning output feature map pixels on both input and previously generated feature maps. The iPixelDCL, or input pixel deconvolutional layer, conditions output feature map pixels on input and adjacent pixels, aiming to solve the checkerboard problem. The relationships among intermediate feature maps are flexible, allowing later maps to rely on previously generated ones. In iPixelDCL, dependencies among intermediate feature maps are added to make adjacent pixels on final output feature maps directly related to each other. Information from input feature map and previous intermediate feature maps is repeatedly used in generating intermediate feature maps. In iPixelDCL, dependencies among intermediate feature maps are added to make adjacent pixels on final output feature maps directly related to each other. The simplified pixel deconvolutional layer reduces dependencies on the input feature map for computational efficiency and fewer trainable parameters. Only the first intermediate feature map depends on the input, while subsequent maps depend on previously generated ones, simplifying pixel dependencies. The purple, orange, green, and red feature maps in iPixelDCL are generated sequentially, with each map depending on the input feature map and previously generated intermediate feature maps. This approach simplifies pixel dependencies and enhances computational efficiency. PixelDCL simplifies pixel dependencies by allowing only the first intermediate feature map to depend on the input feature map. The orange feature map depends on the purple feature map, the green feature map relies on the purple and orange feature maps, and the red feature map is conditioned on all previous feature maps. The red feature map in PixelDCL is conditioned on the purple, orange, and green feature maps, simplifying pixel dependencies. Removing certain connections improves computational efficiency, solving the checkerboard problem. Experimental results show better performance with simplified dependencies compared to complete connections, indicating that repeated dependencies on the input may not be necessary. Pixel deconvolutional layers can replace deconvolutional layers in models like U-Net, VAEs, and GANs, creating pixel deconvolutional networks. These layers are used for upsampling in semantic segmentation, image reconstruction, and generator networks. The simplified dependencies in PixelDCN show improved performance over complete connections, demonstrating that repeated dependencies on the input may not be necessary. In VAEs and GANs, pixel deconvolutional layers are utilized for upsampling in image reconstruction and generator networks. The performance of these layers surpasses traditional deconvolutional layers in U-Net and VAEs, showing superior results. The common up-sampling operation involves doubling the size of input feature maps, leading to improved output feature maps. The pixel deconvolutional layer increases the size of input feature maps by a factor of two, from 2\u00d72 to 4\u00d74. It involves up-sampling a 4\u00d74 feature map to an 8\u00d78 feature map through convolutional operations. The purple feature map is generated first, followed by the orange feature map, both of which are dilated. The pixel deconvolutional layer involves applying convolutional operations to increase the size of input feature maps. The purple and orange feature maps are dilated and combined to form a larger feature map. A masked 3\u00d73 convolutional operation is used to reduce sequential dependencies. Finally, the large feature maps are combined to generate the final output feature map. The proposed pixel deconvolutional methods improve performance in semantic segmentation and image generation tasks compared to regular deconvolution. Experimental evaluation is done on PASCAL 2012 and MSCOCO 2015 datasets, with images resized to 256\u00d7256\u00d73 for training. Models predict labels for each pixel directly. The proposed pixel deconvolutional methods improve semantic segmentation performance by predicting labels for each pixel directly. The models are trained from scratch using the U-Net architecture BID23, consisting of four encoder and decoder blocks with deconvolutional and convolutional layers. The U-Net model consists of four encoder and decoder blocks with deconvolutional and convolutional layers. The number of feature maps in each layer is adjusted based on the number of classes in the dataset, with the MSCOCO 2015 dataset having more classes than the PASCAL 2012 dataset. The deconvolutional layers in the decoder path are replaced with a proposed pixel deconvolutional method for semantic segmentation. The baseline U-Net model uses deconvolutional layers in the decoder path for up-sampling feature maps. These layers are replaced with a proposed pixel deconvolutional method (iPixelDCL and PixelDCL) while maintaining other variables. The kernel size in DCL is 6\u00d76. For fine-tuning experiments, the models are based on DeepLabResNet BID0 architecture, fine-tuned from ResNet101 BID5 with external data. The DeepLab-ResNet model is fine-tuned from ResNet101 BID5 and utilizes external data for training, significantly improving performance on accuracy and mean IOU. The output is eight times smaller than the input image, requiring three up-sampling blocks to recover the original dimensions using deconvolutional and convolutional layers. Additionally, PixelDCL and iPixelDCL are used with kernels of the same size as in training. The U-Net model utilizes PixelDCL and iPixelDCL instead of deconvolutional layers, showing improved performance in capturing local image information and spatial features like edges and shapes. Sample segmentation results on PASCAL 2012 and MSCOCO 2015 datasets are provided in FIG3. The PixelDCL model outperforms the iPixelDCL model in semantic segmentation, especially with fewer training epochs. It produces smoother outputs and considers more spatial features like edges and shapes, making it more efficient and effective overall. PixelDCL outperforms iPixelDCL in semantic segmentation with fewer training epochs, showing better efficiency and effectiveness due to fewer parameters to learn. Evaluation results in pixel accuracy and mean IOU indicate that U-Net models using PixelDCL yield better performance than regular deconvolution. Fine-tuned models from Deeplab-ResNet also show better performance with iPixelDCL performing the best. In semantic segmentation, models using iPixelDCL and PixelDCL outperform the model using DCL, with iPixelDCL performing the best. Mean IOU is a more accurate evaluation measure than pixel accuracy. Models using pixel deconvolution show better results on mean IOU. The dataset used for image generation is CelebFaces Attributes (CelebA), with images preprocessed to retain only facial information. The task is to reconstruct faces without backgrounds in training images. The image generation task involves reconstructing faces without backgrounds using a VAE model. PixelDCL is proposed to replace deconvolutional layers in the decoder, resulting in better face generation compared to the baseline model. The kernel size in DCL is 6\u00d76, while PixelDCL uses 2 sets of 3\u00d73 and 1 set of 2\u00d72 kernels. Figure 9 displays the generated faces using VAEs with regular deconvolution and PixelDCL in decoders. The proposed PixelDCL replaces deconvolutional layers in the decoder of a VAE model for face generation. It uses 2 sets of 3\u00d73 and 1 set of 2\u00d72 kernels to overcome checkerboard artifacts in generated images. PixelDCL establishes direct relationships among adjacent pixels, producing photo-realistic images without the checkerboard problem. PixelDCL is beneficial for generative models as it addresses the checkerboard issue and enhances local spatial information in image generation. Comparisons show that using PixelDCL for up-sampling in U-Net models slightly increases training and prediction times compared to using DCL. In this work, pixel deconvolutional layers (PixelDCL) are proposed to solve the checkerboard problem in deconvolutional layers. The U-Net models using iPixelDCL and PixelDCL take slightly more time during training and prediction than the model using DCL due to sequential generation of intermediate feature maps. However, PixelDCL is more efficient with reduced dependencies and improved implementation. The increase in time is not significant and is not expected to be a major bottleneck for the proposed methods. Pixel deconvolutional layers (PixelDCL) are proposed to address the checkerboard problem in deconvolutional layers by establishing direct dependencies among intermediate feature maps. This sequential generation ensures that later feature maps depend on previously generated ones, leading to directly related adjacent pixels in output feature maps. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PixelDCL in tasks such as semantic segmentation and image generation. PixelDCL addresses checkerboard artifacts by establishing direct dependencies among adjacent pixels on output feature maps. Experimental results show its effectiveness in tasks like semantic segmentation, considering local spatial features for better results. Future plans include integrating PixelDCL into a broader range of models like GANs."
