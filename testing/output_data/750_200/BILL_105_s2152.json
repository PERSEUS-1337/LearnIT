    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Microcredit for Self-Sufficiency Act of 1998\". It includes findings and purposes. Congress finds that over 1 billion people in the developing world live in severe poverty, with high child mortality rates and preventable deaths from malnutrition and disease. Women in poverty face greater workloads and fewer opportunities compared to men. Women in poverty, especially in the developing world, have larger workloads and limited access to education and economic opportunities compared to men. Directly assisting the poorest, particularly women, can positively impact family incomes, child nutrition, health, and education as women tend to reinvest income in their families. Additionally, many poor women in the developing world lack stable employment and social safety nets, leading them to rely on self-employment for a significant portion of their livelihood. Many poor women rely on self-employment for income but struggle to access credit at reasonable rates, trapping them in poverty. Some are forced to pay exorbitant interest rates to money lenders. An international Microcredit Summit in 1997 aimed to address this issue. The international Microcredit Summit in 1997 aimed to expand access to credit for self-employment and financial services to 100 million of the world's poorest families by 2005, particularly women. This initiative would benefit nearly half of the world's 1 billion absolute poor. The international Microcredit Summit in 1997 aimed to expand access to credit for self-employment and financial services to 100 million of the world's poorest families by 2005. Poor people can dramatically expand their incomes and businesses with access to loans at reasonable interest rates through self-sustaining microcredit programs led by them. NGOs like the Grameen Bank, Accion International, and FINCA have successfully lent directly to the very poor, with repayment rates averaging high. Microcredit institutions like FINCA have high repayment rates, reducing poverty and dependency on foreign assistance. Interest income from loans can cover institutional costs, ensuring long-term sustainability. Loans are recycled, leveraging foreign assistance resources for new benefits to program participants. In 1994, AID launched a Microenterprise Initiative with a funding of $137,000,000 for fiscal year 1994 to expand funding for microenterprise programs and promote sustainable institutions for poverty reduction and economic development. In fiscal year 1996, AID's microenterprise funding decreased to $111,000,000, with only 39 percent allocated to programs supporting the poorest with loans under $300, falling short of the goal set for that year. Increased investment in microcredit institutions serving the poorest is crucial for achieving the Microcredit Summit's objective. Increased investment in microcredit institutions serving the poorest is crucial for achieving the Microcredit Summit's goal. AID's funding for microenterprise activities in the developing world should be expanded to $160,000,000 for fiscal year 1999 to match the growing capacity of microcredit institutions. Meeting the global investment needed for the Summit's goal will require a modest increase in United States funding for international microcredit programs, with a focus on institutions serving the poorest. To reach millions of the poorest with microcredit, successful institutions need assistance in expanding their services and accessing capital. PVOs and NGOs have shown competence in developing local networks. PVOs and NGOs have demonstrated competence in developing networks of local microcredit institutions to reach the very poor and achieve financial sustainability. AID should prioritize investing in these organizations through central funding mechanisms to expand successful microcredit institutions. By expanding successful microcredit institutions, AID can lead efforts to provide financial services to the world's poorest families and improve coordination among development aid agencies. The Act aims to promote best practices in providing financial services to the poor, develop microcredit institutions, make microenterprise development a key economic growth strategy, and support organizations in offering credit, savings, and training services to microentrepreneurs. The Act aims to promote best practices in providing financial services to the poor, develop microcredit institutions, and increase assistance for providing access to credit for the poorest sector in developing countries, especially women. The Act aims to promote best practices in providing financial services to the poor, develop microcredit institutions, and increase assistance for providing access to credit for the poorest sector in developing countries, especially women.
