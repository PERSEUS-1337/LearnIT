    "content": "Each year, Congress funds the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to renew over 2.1 million Section 8 vouchers, which are rental subsidies for low-income families in the private market. These vouchers help cover the gap between rent and the tenant's contribution (30% of adjusted income). The program is federally funded and governed by federal rules but administered locally by public housing authorities (PHAs). The Section 8 voucher program provides rental subsidies for low-income families, covering the gap between rent and the tenant's contribution. The cost of a voucher to a Public Housing Authority (PHA) is based on the difference between actual rent and the maximum subsidy level, as well as 30% of the tenant's income. Changes in tenant incomes, rents, and payment standards impact this cost. Congress and HUD have made changes to voucher renewal funding distribution to PHAs in recent years. In recent years, Congress has made changes to the way voucher renewal funding is distributed to local Public Housing Authorities (PHAs), leading to funding uncertainty and pressure for permanent funding reform. This report discusses the changes enacted since FY2003 and their effects on PHAs administering the voucher program. Since FY2003, PHAs administering the voucher program were funded based on their average annual per-voucher cost from the previous year, adjusted by an inflation factor. They also received a reserve equal to one month of voucher funding. Despite full funding, few PHAs leased 100% of their authorized vouchers, leading to low utilization rates, a concern for Congress. In FY2000 and FY2001, national voucher utilization rates were just over 91%, below the expected 95%. PHAs had low budget utilization due to not using all vouchers, resulting in excess funds in their budgets. HUD would reconcile budgets at year-end and recapture excess funds from PHAs' reserves. HUD and PHAs reconciled budgets annually, with HUD recapturing excess funds from PHAs' reserves. HUD used a formula based on previous year's costs and inflation to request funding from Congress for Section 8 vouchers. PHAs could use excess funds for new vouchers through maximized leasing. In FY2003, Congress changed the funding system for PHAs to reduce recaptures of unspent funds and align funding levels with actual voucher use, resulting in lower appropriations needed for the program. HUD was directed to implement these changes. In FY2003, Congress changed the funding system for PHAs to align funding levels with actual voucher use, reducing the amount of appropriations needed for the program. HUD was directed to fund PHAs based on their average annual per-voucher cost from the previous year, increased by the inflation factor, and multiplied by the number of vouchers the PHA could reasonably be expected to lease in that year. HUD implemented a provision to renew expiring section 8 tenant-based annual contributions contracts for public housing agencies based on utilization rates and adjusted costs. HUD implemented a provision to renew expiring section 8 tenant-based annual contributions contracts for public housing agencies based on utilization rates and adjusted costs. Renewal calculations for the [Federal Fiscal Year] 2003 Appropriation will be based on total unit months under lease and actual cost data reported on the PHA's most recent year-end settlement or subsequently submitted to HUD. Actual costs will be adjusted using Annual Adjustment Factors. HUD implemented a provision to renew expiring section 8 tenant-based annual contributions contracts for public housing agencies based on utilization rates and adjusted costs. Renewal calculations for the [Federal Fiscal Year] 2003 Appropriation will be based on total unit months under lease and actual cost data reported on the PHA's most recent year-end settlement or subsequently submitted to HUD. Actual costs will be adjusted using Annual Adjustment Factors. Expiring voucher funding increments will generally be renewed for terms of three months, enabling HUD to calculate funding more accurately. Congress also created a Central Reserve fund for the Secretary to replenish PHA reserves in case of increased utilization or costs. The law allowed PHAs to use reserves for increased costs. The Central Reserve fund could be used for contract amendments due to cost or utilization increases. Restrictions were placed on maximized leasing. The bill imposed restrictions on maximized leasing, prohibiting the use of funds to support more vouchers than a PHA was authorized to lease in a year. This caused issues for over-leased PHAs, leading them to stop reissuing vouchers to bring their leasing back to authorized levels. The FY2004 appropriations law continued this trend by funding PHAs based on actual voucher utilization and limiting funds for maximized leasing. The FY2004 appropriations law imposed restrictions on maximized leasing, funding PHAs based on actual voucher utilization and limiting funds for over-leasing. The conference report expressed concerns about cost increases in the voucher program and expected the Secretary to control costs by utilizing administrative tools. The FY2004 appropriations law imposed restrictions on maximized leasing and funding PHAs based on actual voucher utilization. The Secretary is expected to control costs by utilizing administrative tools such as renewing expiring ACCs. The FY2004 appropriations law imposed restrictions on PHAs funding based on actual voucher utilization. The Central Reserve fund could only be used to replenish reserves depleted due to increased utilization, not increased costs. In FY2004, the Secretary could use Central Reserve funds to replenish reserves depleted due to increased utilization, not increased costs. HUD issued a notice implementing the appropriations law, basing PHAs' budgets on utilization rates and costs reported on their end-of-the-year statements. The notice issued by HUD in August 2003 required PHAs to base their budgets on utilization rates and costs from end-of-the-year statements, adjusted by the annual adjustment factor (AAF). PHAs could appeal only if they could prove that rental costs in their areas had risen higher than the inflation factor adopted by HUD. Some housing advocates argued that HUD should consider a broader measure of inflation, including utility costs and other changes in PHAs' expenses. The notice issued by HUD in August 2003 required PHAs to base their budgets on utilization rates and costs from end-of-the-year statements, adjusted by the annual adjustment factor (AAF). HUD granted appeals requests of 380 agencies out of approximately 400 that applied, distributing $160 million from the Central Reserve. The final FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act directed the Secretary to fund PHAs based on their voucher costs and utilization rates as of May-July 2004. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 108-447) directed the Secretary to fund PHAs based on voucher costs and utilization rates from May-July 2004, adjusted by the AAF. If data was unavailable, funding was based on February-April 2004 data or the most recent year-end financial statement. If funding was insufficient, budgets were prorated according to the conference report (H.Rept. 108-792). The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act directed the Secretary to fund PHAs based on voucher costs and utilization rates. If funding was insufficient, budgets were prorated according to the conference report. PHAs were expected to manage their voucher programs within their budgets for CY2005, with reduced agency reserves and continued prohibition on maximized leasing. HUD provided agencies with flexibility to adjust payment standards and portability policies as necessary. The FY2005 appropriations act changed how PHAs received voucher renewal funding, shifting to a calendar-year cycle. This allowed for budget savings and required PHAs to adjust their budgeting process. HUD issued guidance on these changes in December 2004. HUD implemented changes to voucher program budgeting in December 2004, shifting to a calendar-year cycle. Agencies were notified of preliminary budget levels on December 17, 2004, with a deadline to report data errors. Appeals were limited to data errors only, not the budget calculation formula. Final budget calculations, including a proration factor, were released on January 21, 2005, resulting in agencies being funded at 4.03% less than their actual cost and utilization levels from May-July 2004. The final calculations, including a proration factor, were published on January 21, 2005. Agencies were funded at 4.03% less than their actual cost and utilization levels from May-July 2004, plus the 2005 AAF. The proration factor of just under 96% was implemented due to insufficient funding from Congress for voucher renewals. According to CRS analysis, the median change in PHA renewal budgets from FY2004 to FY2005 was a 0.17% increase, with a wide variance ranging from a 12% decrease to a 14% increase. On February 25, 2005, HUD published Notice PIH 2005-9, offering administrative options for PHAs to reduce costs in 2005. Suggestions included lowering payment standards, reducing utility assistance, restricting portability, reviewing rents, suspending voucher reissuance, restricting bedroom sizes, instituting minimum rents, monitoring income eligibility more strictly, and terminating. The FY2006 HUD Appropriations Act (P.L. 109-115) distributed renewal funding to PHAs based on their eligibility in CY2005, adjusted for inflation and prorated to fit within the appropriated amount. The act also provided administrative options for PHAs to reduce costs, such as lowering payment standards and instituting minimum rents. The FY2006 HUD Appropriations Act provided $45 million for agencies to adjust budgets based on low leasing costs or unforeseen circumstances. HUD issued projected funding letters to PHAs in January 2006, with a deadline for concerns by February 3, 2006. HUD issued projected funding letters to all PHAs on January 19, 2006, directing them to respond by February 3, 2006. PHAs were funded at about 94% of their eligibility due to insufficient funding from Congress. Changes enacted up through FY2006, especially in FY2005 and FY2006, incentivized PHAs to reduce costs, leading to a reversal of the cost growth trend seen in 2003. Average annual per voucher costs remained flat from calendar year 2004 to calendar year 2005. Average annual per voucher costs remained flat from calendar year 2004 to calendar year 2005 and declined by about 1.5% from calendar year 2005 through September 2006. Utilization also declined, from a peak of over 98% in 2004 to around 90% as of September 2006, resulting in nearly 100,000 fewer households receiving assistance in 2006 compared to 2004. Most PHAs had accumulated reserve funds, with unspent balances averaging 10% of their budget authority from January 2005 through September 2006. In 2006, PHAs had accumulated reserve funds averaging 10% of their budget authority. Budget utilization dropped nationally from over 98% in 2004 to under 92% in 2006. The debate in FY2007 was between a \"budget-based\" and a \"unit-based\" funding formula for PHAs. Then-President Bush requested Congress to continue funding the voucher program using a budget-based formula. In FY2007, President Bush requested Congress to fund the voucher program using a budget-based formula and lift the prohibition on maximized leasing. Some PHAs had excess funding they couldn't use to serve more families. In FY2007, Congress rejected President Bush's proposal to fund the voucher program based on a budget formula. Instead, they adopted a formula tied to how much funding PHAs were using, not how much they had received the previous year. PHAs with excess funding were not allowed to serve more families from their waiting lists. The law included adjustments for PHAs experiencing cost increases or decreases in voucher funding, with a central reserve fund for unforeseen circumstances. It also continued the prohibition on over-leasing. The law included adjustments for PHAs experiencing changes in voucher funding, with a central reserve fund for unforeseen circumstances. P.L. 110-28 later amended the formula to provide exceptions for certain PHAs, including those affected by Hurricane Katrina and agencies under receivership. Under the FY2007 formula change, PHAs were funded based on their actual usage in FY2006 rather than the amount they received. PHAs with higher costs and utilization rates did better under this formula than under President Bush's proposed formula. Under the FY2007 formula change, PHAs were funded based on their actual usage in FY2006. PHAs with higher costs and utilization rates did better under this formula than under President Bush's proposed formula. The funding provided was sufficient to fund all PHAs at more than 105% of their eligibility, ensuring agencies could continue to serve the same number of families or more. The FY2007 formula combined unit-based and budget-based elements. The FY2007 formula for voucher funding combined unit-based and budget-based elements, with PHAs receiving funding based on their actual usage in FY2006. President Bush's FY2008 budget request proposed a strictly \"budget-based\" formula for funding agencies. The FY2008 budget requested a \"budget-based\" voucher funding formula for agencies based on their eligibility in 2007, adjusted for AAF, FSS program deposits, and tenant protection vouchers. The President planned to re-benchmark the formula in the future. The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 110-161) adopted a cost and utilization-based funding formula for agencies in FY2009. It funded agencies based on leasing and costs from the prior year, adjusted for various factors. The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 110-161) introduced a new funding formula for agencies in FY2009, adjusting budgets for certain agencies and implementing a rescission that reduced each PHA's funding level based on their unusable reserves exceeding 7% of their total received in FY2007. The FY2008 Act rescinded $723 million in FY2008 renewal funding, freeing up unusable reserves for PHAs to use for renewals in FY2008 and FY2009. In FY2008, voucher renewals were provided without reducing total funding available to PHAs. In FY2009, President Bush requested a budget-based funding formula, but Congress rejected it. The FY2009 omnibus funding bill directed HUD to fund PHAs based on a hybrid, cost and utilization-based formula adopted in FY2008. In FY2008, HUD directed funding for PHAs based on leased vouchers' cost, adjusted for inflation. PHAs' allocations were prorated based on HUD's estimate of their Net Restricted Assets. PHAs were expected to supplement new funding with unused NRA and a $100 million renewal set-aside was included for adjustments under certain circumstances. HUD allocated funding for PHAs in FY2008 based on leased vouchers' cost, adjusted for inflation. PHAs were prorated based on HUD's estimate of their Net Restricted Assets. A $100 million renewal set-aside was included for adjustments under certain circumstances in CY2009, but inaccurate estimates sometimes led to discrepancies in costs, utilization, and NRA balances. HUD's estimates of costs, utilization, and NRA did not accurately represent PHAs' CY2009 balances due to inaccurately reported data and changes in cost and leasing conditions. Some PHAs faced funding shortfalls as a result, with up to 15% of agencies administering the voucher program affected. HUD worked with agencies to address these issues. HUD estimated that 15% of PHAs administering the voucher program faced funding shortfalls. The department provided additional funding from the FY2009 renewal set-aside or administrative fee funding to assist agencies. HUD also advised agencies on cost-cutting measures to stay within their budgets. If a PHA does not have enough funding to renew all vouchers, they may have to stop issuing vouchers, leading to families potentially losing assistance. HUD requested agencies facing shortfalls to contact the department for assistance. In response to concerns about families losing assistance due to funding shortfalls, Congress enacted legislation allowing HUD to access additional funding (up to $200 million) to support PHAs at risk of terminating assistance. This policy change increased the set-aside renewal funding provided to HUD in FY2009 and expanded its purposes to help agencies adjust their budgets. In FY2009, HUD increased set-aside renewal funding to adjust agencies' budgets and prevent assistance termination. The FY2010 budget under the Obama Administration requested a funding formula based on PHAs' costs and utilization, with the authority to offset excess reserves at the Secretary's discretion. The Administration requested the authority to offset agencies' budgets for excess reserves and reallocate funding to high-performing or needy agencies in the FY2010 budget. The final funding law adopted a similar formula but did not grant the Secretary the authority to offset agency budgets based on reserves or lift the prohibition on over-leasing. The FY2010 allocation formula did not grant the Secretary authority to offset agency budgets based on reserves or lift the prohibition on over-leasing. In FY2011 and FY2012, Congress directed HUD to allocate Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher renewal funding to PHAs based on their costs and utilization, with no offset from PHA reserves in FY2011 and a $650 million rescission in FY2012. The FY2012 law (P.L. 112-55) included a $650 million rescission offset from PHAs with reserves above a certain level. Prior to FY2003, PHAs served more families than authorized and spent all federal funds received. After funding formula changes from FY2003 to FY2006, PHAs served fewer families and spent less federal funding. Since FY2006, PHAs have seen an increase in funding utilization from 91% to 95% by the end of 2009. They were also serving over 150,000 more families by 2009 compared to 2006, surpassing the previous high point in 2003. By 2009, Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) were serving more families than in 2006, surpassing the previous high point in 2003. Reserves accumulated during budget-based formula days in 2005 and 2006 were spent down due to rescissions in FY2008 and FY2009. Per voucher costs began rising in CY2007 and were expected to continue increasing in CY2012. Members of Congress have introduced voucher reform legislation in recent years. Per voucher costs began rising in CY2007 and were anticipated to continue increasing in CY2012. Members of Congress have introduced voucher reform legislation with changes to the funding formula, but the Appropriations Committees have the authority to override it each year since FY2003. It is uncertain if they would defer to the authorizing committees in this situation. The Section 8 voucher program's funding has undergone changes since FY2003 to address concerns about inefficient allocations and rising costs. Congress enacted funding changes to gain more control over cost growth, moving away from an entitlement program model. The Appropriations Committees have overridden voucher reform legislation introduced by Congress members, raising uncertainty about deferring to authorizing committees. Congress enacted funding changes for the Section 8 voucher program starting in FY2003 to address inefficient funding allocations and rising costs. The changes converted the program's funding structure to a fixed sum model, giving Congress more control over the budget but making it harder for Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) to administer. PHAs have limited control over costs due to statutory subsidies provided to families. Many PHAs found the changes to the Section 8 voucher program difficult to administer, as they have limited control over costs. Some PHAs made adjustments such as lowering payment standards and conducting rent reasonableness reviews to reduce rents paid to landlords. Some PHAs reduced rents paid to landlords through rent reasonableness reviews, leading some landlords to withdraw from the program. PHAs could select higher-income families to lower subsidy costs, but still had to allocate 75% of vouchers to low-income families. Some PHAs intentionally decreased voucher issuance to save money, causing budget issues in subsequent years. In FY2004, some agencies lowered utilization rates to save money, leading to budget issues in FY2005. Changes in funding formulas resulted in fewer households receiving vouchers. Voucher costs and utilization rates declined from 2005 to 2006. Average voucher costs decreased by 1.5% and average utilization declined by over 2%. According to CRS analysis of HUD data, average voucher costs decreased by 1.5% and average utilization declined by over 2% from 2005 to 2006. Some agencies received more funding than allowed, leading to unused funds in 7% of all PHAs by September 2006. The budget-based funding formula changes enacted through FY2006 were controversial with low-income housing advocates and PHA industry groups, with calls for a return to an actual-cost and unit-based formula. PHA advocacy groups expressed concerns about the difficult predicament created by the current formula and the statutory constraints they operate under. The FY2007 funding bill reversed recent trends by enacting a voucher renewal funding formula similar to the previous one. The FY2007 funding bill reversed recent trends by enacting a voucher renewal funding formula similar to the previous one, where PHAs were funded based on their previous year's usage rather than the amount received. This resulted in PHAs with large surpluses receiving less funding, but still sufficient to serve all eligible families. The FY2008 and FY2009 formulas closely followed the FY2007 formula, with reductions in agency budgets for those with excess reserves. These reductions made unused funding usable and reduced the appropriations needed for the program. FY2010 and FY2011 formulas were similar, but without reductions related to reserves. In FY2012, agency reserves were used to offset renewal costs. In FY2012, agency reserves were used to offset renewal costs. The funding model has shifted to a cost and utilization-based model, leading to increased costs and utilization. Rising costs may pressure policy makers to contain program costs. Rising costs in the program may pressure policy makers to find ways to contain costs. Past strategies reduced costs but also decreased the number of families served and led to unspent funds accumulation. Future cost containment strategies should aim to maintain service levels while minimizing unspent funds. Proposed Section 8 voucher reform focuses on maximizing families served without capping cost growth. Future legislation could override these changes. Proposed Section 8 voucher reform aims to maximize families served without firmly capping future cost growth, which could be overridden by future legislation."
