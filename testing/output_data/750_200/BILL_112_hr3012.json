The \"Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act of 2011\" amends the Immigration and Nationality Act by making changes to visa allocation and numerical limitations. The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to make changes to visa allocation and numerical limitations, including special rules for countries exceeding the immigrant visa limit in any fiscal year. The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to allocate visa numbers to natives of states or areas exceeding numerical limitations in a fiscal year. Visa numbers are allocated based on the proportion of total visas available under each paragraph of section 203(a). The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to allocate visa numbers based on the proportion of total visas available under each paragraph of section 203(a). Amendments include country-specific offsets and transition rules for employment-based immigrants. Effective date is set for fiscal year 2012. The Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to allocate visa numbers based on the proportion of total visas available under each paragraph of section 203(a) for fiscal year 2012. Transition rules for employment-based immigrants are also outlined. For fiscal year 2013, 10 percent of immigrant visas under section 203(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act will be allotted to immigrants from states with lower numbers of natives obtaining visas in 2010. For fiscal year 2014, 10 percent of immigrant visas under section 203(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act will be allotted to immigrants from states with lower numbers of natives obtaining visas in 2012. In fiscal year 2012, the two states with the highest number of natives obtaining immigrant visas did not receive the largest aggregate numbers. Per-country visa levels restrict the number of visas available to natives of any single foreign state or dependent area to 25 percent or 2 percent of the total. In fiscal years 2012, 2013, and 2014, not more than 85 percent of immigrant visas under paragraphs (2) and (3) of section 203(b) of the Act shall be allotted to natives of any single foreign state. In fiscal years 2012, 2013, and 2014, immigrant visas may be issued without regard to certain rules if the total number available would otherwise not be issued. In fiscal years 2012, 2013, and 2014, immigrant visas may be issued without regard to certain rules. Section 202(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act applies in determining the foreign state to which an alien is chargeable for this purpose. The House of Representatives passed the bill on November 29, 2011. Karen L. Haas is the Clerk."
