The Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of Health and Human Services will jointly carry out a demonstration project where the Department of Veterans Affairs receives reimbursement from the medicare program for health care services provided to targeted medicare-eligible veterans. The project will last for three years. The Secretaries will conduct a three-year demonstration project starting on January 1, 1998. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may waive certain Medicare requirements for the project. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will designate up to three service areas for participating facilities. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will designate up to three geographic service areas for facilities to participate in a demonstration project. The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, will establish a plan for selecting facilities within the designated service areas. The Secretary will select facilities within designated service areas based on criteria favoring those suited to serve targeted Medicare-eligible individuals with high demand for services and sufficient billing capability. Facilities selected must have sufficient billing capability, quality care indicators, patient satisfaction, and meet other relevant criteria. At least one facility near a closed military medical facility will be chosen. The demonstration project allows voluntary participation of targeted Medicare-eligible veterans from a closed military medical facility. The demonstration project allows voluntary participation of targeted Medicare-eligible veterans in participating facilities with cost-sharing requirements similar to nongovernmental facilities. Payments received will be credited to the Department of Veterans Affairs medical appropriation. The determination of reimbursement amounts is outlined in Section 3. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will reimburse the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for services under a demonstration project at 95% of regular Medicare payment rates. This is subject to specific provisions, with payments based on what would be payable under Medicare if the facility were not federal. The Secretaries will establish rules for computing payment amounts for services in the program. Payments will be made periodically from Medicare trust funds, as determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish rules for payment amounts from Medicare trust funds for a demonstration project with the Department of Veterans Affairs. The annual limit for Medicare payments to the VA for the project is $50,000,000 to prevent shifting costs onto the Medicare program. The payment amounts for hospital care and medical services for targeted medicare-eligible veterans will be reduced if the actual VA medical expenditures for targeted veterans are less than the maintenance of effort level for the fiscal year. Maintenance of effort levels will be determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The maintenance of effort level for each fiscal year is determined based on the preceding year's level or the VA medical expenditures for targeted veterans in fiscal year 1997, adjusted by the percentage difference in the medical care appropriation for the Department of Veterans Affairs. The maintenance of effort level for each fiscal year is determined based on the preceding year's level or the VA medical expenditures for targeted veterans in fiscal year 1997, adjusted by the percentage difference in the medical care appropriation for the Department of Veterans Affairs.

SEC. 4. EVALUATION AND REPORTS. An independent entity will evaluate the health services demonstration project annually and submit reports to the Secretaries and Congress by March 1 each year. The reports will include the evaluation results and assessments of the project. The annual reports on the health services demonstration project will assess the cost to the Department of Veterans Affairs, compliance of participating facilities with quality measures, and compare participation costs with reimbursements. The report on the extension and expansion of the demonstration project will evaluate the costs and reimbursements for participating facilities, savings or costs to the Medicare program, changes in access to care or quality of care for targeted Medicare-eligible veterans, and the project's impact on access to care for veterans not participating in the project. The Secretaries will report on whether to extend or make permanent the demonstration project, expand it to cover more sites and increase reimbursement amounts, and adjust project terms and conditions. The Secretaries will report on the feasibility and advisability of establishing a new demonstration project to reimburse the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for health care under the Social Security Act by March 1, 1999.
