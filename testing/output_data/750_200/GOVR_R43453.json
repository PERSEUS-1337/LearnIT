    "content": "The renewable electricity PTC is a tax credit for electricity generated using qualified energy resources, sold to an unrelated person. The credit can be claimed for 10 years once a qualifying facility is in service. The maximum credit amount for 2013-2016 was 2.3 cents per kWh, and for 2017-2018 it is 2.4 cents per kWh. Wind, closed-loop biomass, and geothermal energy qualify for the maximum credit amount. Under current law, nonwind facilities for which construction began before January 1, 2018, may qualify for the PTC. For wind facilities, the credit is available for facilities for which construction begins before January 1, 2020. Other technologies qualify for a reduced credit amount, where the amount of the credit is reduced by one-half. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) is available for wind facilities that begin construction before January 1, 2020. The credit amount is reduced by 20% for facilities starting in 2017, 40% for 2018, and 60% for 2019. The PTC phases out once electricity market prices exceed certain levels. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) phases out when electricity market prices exceed threshold levels. The PTC has not been phased out since enactment and is unlikely to be under current law. Before 2018, the PTC was limited by the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT), but unused credits could be carried forward. The corporate AMT limited the ability to claim the PTC, but unused credits could be carried forward. The corporate AMT was eliminated in the 2017 tax revision. PTC-eligible taxpayers had the option of claiming the energy investment tax credit or an ARRA Section 1603 grant for property placed in service from 2009 to 2011. Indian coal production facilities placed in service before January 1, 2009, can receive production tax credits for coal produced before January 1, 2016. There is no placed-in-service limitation for coal produced and sold after December 31, 2015. Credits are not available for coal produced after 2017. The base rate for Indian coal is $2.00 per ton, with an inflation-adjusted credit of $2.4 in 2017. Refined coal has a base credit amount of $4.375 per ton. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was first enacted in 1992 as part of the Energy Policy Act of 1992. Since then, it has been extended 11 times. The base credit amount for Indian coal is $2.00 per ton, with an inflation-adjusted credit of $2.4 in 2017. For refined coal, the base credit amount is $4.375 per ton, with the 2018 credit being $7.307 per ton. Refined coal facilities must have been placed in service before January 1, 2012, to qualify for credits. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was first enacted in 1992 as part of the Energy Policy Act of 1992. Since then, it has been extended 11 times, with various amendments to include different qualifying technologies such as wind, closed-loop biomass systems, and poultry waste. The PTC has lapsed before being reinstated multiple times, with extensions through legislation like the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 and the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) has been extended multiple times with amendments to include new qualifying technologies such as open-loop biomass, geothermal energy, solar energy, small irrigation power, and municipal solid waste. The PTC was extended through legislation like the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act and the Working Families Tax Relief Act. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was extended to new qualifying resources like geothermal energy, solar energy, small irrigation power, and municipal solid waste. These resources were limited to a five-year PTC period, with reduced credit amounts for some facilities. The AJCA also introduced a PTC for refined coal. The PTC was extended twice during the 109th Congress, including through the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was extended twice during the 109th Congress through the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT05; P.L. 109-58). EPACT05 extended the PTC for qualifying facilities except solar energy and refined coal for two years, added hydropower and Indian coal as new qualifying resources, and extended the credit period from 5 years to 10 years for all qualifying facilities (other than Indian coal). Indian coal could qualify for a credit over a seven-year period, with the credit amount set at $1.50 per ton for the first four years, and $2.00 per ton for the last three years, adjusted for inflation. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was extended through various acts, including EPACT05, the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, and the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. The PTC was extended for qualifying facilities, except for solar, refined coal, and Indian coal, with adjustments made to the credit period and amounts. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was extended through various acts, including EPACT05, the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, and the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. The PTC for closed-loop biomass, open-loop biomass, geothermal energy, small irrigation power, municipal solid waste, and qualified hydropower was extended for two years, through 2010. Marine and hydrokinetic renewable energy were also added as qualifying resources. A new credit for steel industry fuel was introduced at $2.00 per barrel-of-oil equivalent. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was extended through various acts, including EPACT05, the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, and the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. The PTC for closed-loop biomass, open-loop biomass, geothermal energy, small irrigation power, municipal solid waste, and qualified hydropower was extended for two years, through 2010. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA; P.L. 111-5) further extended the PTC for wind through 2012 and for other renewable energy technologies through 2013. ARRA also introduced the Section 1603 grant program. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) introduced the Section 1603 grant program, allowing taxpayers to receive a one-time payment from the Treasury in lieu of tax credits for renewable energy projects. The program was available for projects placed in service or under construction in 2009 or 2010. The Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 extended the program through 2011. Additionally, the Production Tax Credit (PTC) for wind was extended through 2013. The PTC for wind was extended through 2013 under the American Taxpayer Relief Act. The credit expiration date was changed to a construction start date for all qualifying technologies. The PTC and ITC options were retroactively extended through 2014 under the Tax Increase Prevention Act. The PATH Act of 2015 further extended these provisions. The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes (PATH) Act of 2015 extended the production tax credit (PTC) expiration date for nonwind facilities through 2016. The investment tax credit (ITC) in lieu of PTC option was also extended through 2016. Additionally, the production credit for Indian coal facilities was extended for two years, and the placed-in-service limitation was removed. The production tax credit (PTC) for wind facilities was extended through 2019, with reductions for facilities beginning construction in 2017, 2018, and 2019. PTCs for nonwind technologies and Indian coal were retroactively extended for tax year 2017 in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. The PTC for nonwind technologies and Indian coal was extended for tax year 2017 in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. Without further legislative action, these PTCs will not be available for facilities starting construction after December 31, 2017. Estimated revenue losses for the PTC between 2018 and 2022 are $25.8 billion. Between 2018 and 2022, estimated revenue losses associated with the PTC are $25.8 billion, with most of the losses attributed to wind energy. Other sources of revenue losses include geothermal, open-loop biomass, municipal solid waste, and qualified hydropower. Additionally, production credits for refined coal and Indian coal account for $0.1 billion each over the same period. The estimated revenue losses for refined coal and Indian coal production credits over a five-year period are $0.1 billion each. JCT's tax expenditure estimates are based on current law, and extending the PTC policy would increase these estimates. In 2013, 230 corporate taxpayers claimed PTCs totaling $2.8 billion, mostly for renewable electricity production. In 2013, taxpayers claimed PTCs of $2.8 billion, with some carrying forward unused credits from previous years. Policy actions in response to the economic downturn affected renewable energy tax credit claims. The IRS data on PTC claims show the impact of policy actions in response to the economic downturn on renewable energy tax credit claims. The number of taxpayers claiming the PTC increased between 2008 and 2009 but decreased after 2009, with fewer taxpayers claiming the PTC due to the availability of Section 1603 grants. $15.5 billion in grants was claimed for technologies that would have been PTC-eligible. The economic downturn also affected renewable energy tax credit claims. The economic downturn impacted renewable energy tax credit claims, with a significant increase in PTC carry forwards between 2008 and 2010. Weakness in tax equity markets made it challenging for developers to monetize tax credits. The CBO estimates the cost of a long-term PTC extension. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that extending various tax credits, including the PTC and Indian Coal Production Credit, would reduce federal revenues by billions between 2019 and 2028. The PTC was enacted in 1992 to promote renewable energy sources. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was enacted in 1992 to promote renewable energy sources and has been extended multiple times since then. Recent extensions reflect a belief that the tax incentives contribute to the development of renewable energy infrastructure, advancing environmental and energy policy goals. Research suggests that the Production Tax Credit (PTC) drives investment and growth in the wind industry, contributing to renewable energy infrastructure development. Further extension of the PTC may lead to more investment and growth, but short-term extensions have limitations. Retroactive extensions are seen as windfall benefits for taxpayers, rewarding investments made without tax incentives. The PTC has increased the use of renewable electricity resources, but its impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions is still being researched. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) drives investment in the wind industry, contributing to renewable energy growth. Research on its impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions is mixed. Removing tax credits for renewable electricity would result in a small increase in power-sector emissions. Recent extensions of tax credits for wind and solar contribute to reduced emissions, especially when natural gas prices are low. Tax subsidies for clean energy resources aim to address market failures caused by negative externalities from pollution in energy production and consumption. These subsidies help reduce emissions, especially when natural gas prices are low. Tax subsidies for clean energy resources are not the most efficient way to address market failures in the energy sector. They reduce the average cost of energy, encourage consumption, counter conservation efforts, and may favor costly emissions reductions over less expensive alternatives. Tax subsidies for clean energy resources do not provide equal incentives for emissions reduction alternatives and can favor costly reductions over cheaper ones. A more efficient approach would be a direct tax on pollution, like a carbon tax, which could generate revenue to offset other taxes, meet distributional goals, or reduce the deficit. This approach is technology-neutral and more economically efficient in addressing pollution and environmental concerns in the energy sector. A carbon tax approach could generate revenue to offset other taxes, achieve distributional goals, or reduce the deficit. Tax incentives are not the most efficient way to support renewable energy projects, as developers often rely on outside investors to monetize tax benefits through tax-equity financing arrangements. This reduces the direct federal financial support for renewable energy. Tax equity investors, major financial institutions, reduce federal financial support for renewable energy. Incentives rewarding production over investment lead to more renewable electricity per federal subsidy dollar. Interaction of PTC with other policies like state RPS mandates reduces compliance costs. The PTC is a federal subsidy for renewable energy that helps reduce compliance costs with state RPS mandates. It is set to expire for nonwind projects after 2017 and wind projects after 2019. Options include letting the PTC expire as scheduled or providing a temporary extension with an extended construction start date deadline. One option is to extend the PTC for nonwind technologies retroactively for 2018 and apply the phaseout currently in place for wind projects. Another alternative is to extend the PTC for nonwind technologies and remove the phaseout for wind projects. One option is to extend the PTC for nonwind technologies retroactively for 2018 and apply the phaseout currently in place for wind projects. Another alternative is to extend the PTC for nonwind technologies and remove the phaseout for wind projects. In 2014, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp proposed a form of PTC phaseout as part his tax reform proposal introduced in the 113 th Congress, the Tax Reform Act of 2014 ( H.R. 1 ). Under this proposal, the PTC inflation adjustment factor would have been eliminated, reducing the value of the PTC for renewable electricity to 1.5 cents per kWh. Chairman Camp's proposal in the 113th Congress aimed to reduce the value of the PTC for renewable electricity to 1.5 cents per kWh for eligible properties within the 10-year window. The proposal would have fully repealed the PTC after 2024, potentially raising $9.6 billion in additional federal revenues between 2014 and 2023. A similar proposal was introduced in the 114th Congress as the PTC Elimination Act. President Obama's proposal in the 114th Congress aimed to make the Production Tax Credit (PTC) permanent, refundable, and include solar facilities as qualifying property. The credit would also be modified to allow renewable electricity consumed by the producer to qualify for tax credits. Solar property eligible for the residential energy efficient property credit would also qualify for the PTC. Additionally, the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for renewable energy would be included. The PTC and ITC for renewable energy would be made permanent under President Obama's proposal, costing $19.8 billion between 2016 and 2026 according to the JCT analysis of his FY2017 budget. Solar property eligible for the residential energy efficient property credit would also qualify for the PTC."
