    "content": "Copyright is the exclusive right to reproduce, distribute, perform, display, and exploit an original work of authorship. Protection is automatic when the work is created, but registration offers advantages such as the ability to file infringement suits and receive statutory damages and attorney's fees if done within three months of publication. The 2001 Supreme Court case, New York Times Co. v. Tasini, involved freelance authors suing publishers for licensing their articles to electronic databases. The case highlighted the copyright owner's exclusive rights to reproduce and distribute their work. The Supreme Court case New York Times Co. v. Tasini ruled that publishers cannot reproduce freelance works electronically without specific authorization from the author. This decision required publishers to obtain a separate license from the author to electronically reproduce written works. The Supreme Court case New York Times Co. v. Tasini required publishers to obtain a separate license from authors to electronically reproduce written works. This led to many freelance works being removed from electronic databases. Several class action infringement suits were activated and consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, including Reed Elsevier v. Muchnick. Reed Elsevier v. Muchnick is a class action lawsuit discussed in this report, similar to the Tasini case. Class actions allow named plaintiffs to sue on behalf of a larger group with similar claims. Litigation requires court certification, and settlement approval. The Reed Elsevier class action lawsuit involves individual authors and trade groups suing publishers for reproducing their freelance works in electronic databases without consent or compensation. Class members can object to settlements, but objections can only be withdrawn with court permission. The plaintiffs sued publishers and electronic database services for copyright infringement of freelance works. After the Tasini decision affirmed their rights, the parties reached an agreement in 2005 for compensation based on three categories of claims. Category A claims involved copyrights eligible for statutory damages and attorney's fees, while Category B claims concerned copyrights that qualified. The settlement in 2005 for copyright infringement of freelance works involved three categories of claims. Category A claims were eligible for statutory damages and attorney's fees, Category B claims qualified for actual damages only, and Category C claims largely involved unregistered copyrights. Each type of claim had a specific damages formula assigned, with Category A claimants receiving a flat fee, Category B claimants receiving a flat fee or a percentage of the original price, and Category C claimants receiving a flat fee or a percentage of the original price. The settlement in 2005 for copyright infringement of freelance works involved three categories of claims. Category C claimants received compensation based on a flat fee or a percentage of the original price of the work. If total costs exceeded $18 million, Category C claimants' payments could be reduced or even eliminated before Category A and B claimants were affected. Plaintiffs agreed to release all claims against defendants in exchange for financial compensation. The plaintiffs and defendants reached an agreement to release all claims related to their articles in electronic databases. They sought class certification and settlement approval from the district court. Objectors opposed, claiming the settlement was unfair to Category C claimants who were paid little and could have their payments reduced if total claims exceeded $18 million. Objectors argued that the named plaintiffs did not adequately represent absent class members with only some registered copyrights. The named plaintiffs with registered copyrights did not adequately represent absent class members with unregistered copyrights in Category C claims. Defendants argued that unregistered copyright holders were fairly represented as they would not have been able to bring infringement actions without registration. The district court granted final class certification and settlement approval in September 2005, despite objections challenging the fairness of the settlement and the adequacy of representation. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals ordered parties to address jurisdictional question regarding unregistered copyrights in settlement approval process. Both plaintiffs and defendants argued that Copyright Act's registration requirement is not jurisdictional. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed with the argument that the Copyright Act's registration requirement is not jurisdictional. They stated that federal courts have limited subject-matter jurisdiction and that jurisdiction in this case was not proper, even though the named plaintiffs' works were registered. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed with the argument that the Copyright Act's registration requirement is not jurisdictional. They stated that federal courts have limited subject-matter jurisdiction, deriving it from specific sections of Title 28 of the U.S. Code. Congress has supplemented these grants with \u00a7411(a) of the Copyright Act, which limits a district court's jurisdiction. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Copyright Act's registration requirement is jurisdictional, limiting a district court's subject-matter jurisdiction to claims arising from registered copyrights only. This decision was based on previous opinions and distinguished from a Supreme Court ruling. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals held that the district court lacked jurisdiction to certify a class and approve a settlement due to many plaintiffs' unregistered copyrights. Judge Walker dissented, arguing for a more careful distinction between true jurisdictional bars and claim-processing rules. The Supreme Court's ruling in Eberhart prompted a re-evaluation of the copyright registration requirement, categorizing \u00a7411(a) as an \"enforcement mechanism.\" The Second Circuit precedent stated that unregistered copyrights did not invalidate a class-action settlement. On March 2, 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari. The U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari to review whether 17 U.S.C. \u00a7411(a) restricts federal courts' jurisdiction over copyright infringement actions. This section states that no civil action for infringement can be initiated without copyright registration. The U.S. Supreme Court is reviewing whether 17 U.S.C. \u00a7411(a) limits federal courts' jurisdiction over copyright infringement cases. This section requires copyright registration before initiating a civil action for infringement. If registration is refused, the applicant can still sue for infringement by serving notice on the Register of Copyrights. The Register can choose to join the action within sixty days. The U.S. Supreme Court is considering if 17 U.S.C. \u00a7411(a) limits federal courts' jurisdiction in copyright infringement cases. Petitioners argue that the registration requirement is not jurisdictional and that circuit courts have misinterpreted it. The Supreme Court is reviewing whether 17 U.S.C. \u00a7411(a) restricts federal courts' jurisdiction in copyright infringement cases. Petitioners claim that the registration requirement does not limit jurisdiction and that the Second Circuit's interpretation is flawed. They argue that failing to implement the \"bright line\" test from Arbaugh v. Y&H Corp could hinder parties from settling disputes involving unregistered works. Respondents argue that \u00a7411(a) is not a jurisdictional bar but a claim-processing rule, citing cases where the requirement was waived. They claim that even without original jurisdiction, disputes involving unregistered works can still be resolved. The petitioners and the United States argued that \u00a7411(a) does not limit federal courts' subject-matter jurisdiction but serves as a mandatory prerequisite to a lawsuit that should be strictly enforced. They contended that even if the district court lacked original subject-matter jurisdiction, it had supplemental jurisdiction over the case involving authors with unregistered copyrights. The U.S. argued that while district courts should enforce \u00a7411(a) as a mandatory prerequisite to suit, once a case reaches the court of appeals, rigid application of this requirement would waste judicial resources. Non-compliance with the registration requirement did not justify vacating the district court's judgment. The U.S. argued that non-compliance with the registration requirement did not justify vacating the district court's judgment. Both petitioners and respondents agreed on overturning the Second Circuit's ruling, leading to the appointment of Professor Deborah Jones Merritt as amicus curiae. Professor Merritt emphasized that \u00a7411(a) restricts federal courts' jurisdiction. The plain language of \u00a7411(a) restricts federal courts' jurisdiction, serving vital public purposes such as supporting a public record of copyright claims and protecting defendants. The integrity of the judicial process precludes parties from waiving \u00a7411(a) as it was invoked before the district court to defend the fairness of a settlement. The parties cannot waive \u00a7411(a) jurisdictional bar as it was invoked before the district court to defend the fairness of a settlement, which favored registered copyright owners over unregistered ones. Professor Merritt argued that no special rule for settlement or supplemental jurisdiction act could cure this defect, as courts need jurisdiction over class actions to resolve claims of absent class members. The Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA) supported this argument in an amicus brief. The authors and databases involved in the lawsuit did not constitute a single case or controversy. The Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA) supported the Second Circuit's judgment, arguing that the registration requirement is necessary for Internet service providers to reduce exposure to copyright infringement claims. CCIA stated that the Second Circuit's opinion was correctly decided and the petitioners' writ of certiorari should be dismissed on two grounds. CCIA supported the Second Circuit's judgment in Reed Elsevier, arguing that the petitioners' writ of certiorari should be dismissed because there was no case or controversy before the court and no circuit split on the issue of \u00a7411(a) limiting federal courts' jurisdiction. The Supreme Court heard oral argument on October 7, 2009, and made a decision on March 2, 2010. The Supreme Court unanimously reversed the judgment of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Reed Elsevier. Justice Thomas authored the opinion ruling that the Copyright Act's registration requirement does not limit federal court jurisdiction for copyright infringement claims involving unregistered works. The district court had the authority to certify the class and approve the settlement. The Supreme Court reversed the U.S. Court of Appeals judgment in Reed Elsevier, stating that the Copyright Act's registration requirement does not limit federal court jurisdiction for copyright infringement claims involving unregistered works. The district court had the authority to certify the class and approve the settlement. The Court clarified that subject-matter jurisdiction refers to the courts' power to adjudicate the case, not the rights or obligations of parties. Some statutory requirements are not jurisdictional conditions but claim-processing rules or elements of a cause of action. The Supreme Court clarified that some statutory requirements are not jurisdictional conditions but claim-processing rules or elements of a cause of action, distinguishing between true jurisdictional conditions and nonjurisdictional claim-processing rules. If Congress does not rank a statutory limitation on coverage as jurisdictional, courts should treat the restriction as such. In Arbaugh v. Y&H Corp., the Supreme Court held that statutory limitations on coverage should be treated as nonjurisdictional if Congress does not specifically designate them as jurisdictional. This was exemplified in a Title VII case where the numerical qualification for \"employer\" was deemed a substantive element of the claim, not affecting federal court jurisdiction. The Arbaugh Court determined that the employee numerosity requirement in Title VII is a substantive element of the claim, not a jurisdictional limit. This precedent was applied in the Reed Elsevier case regarding the Copyright Act. The Reed Elsevier Court applied the Arbaugh precedent to \u00a7411(a) of the Copyright Act, rejecting the argument that the registration requirement is jurisdictional. Congress used the word \"jurisdiction\" to clarify federal court authority, not to establish jurisdictional limits. The Court clarified that the statutory reference to \"jurisdiction\" in \u00a7411(a) of the Copyright Act was intended to give federal courts authority to determine registrability issues, regardless of the Register's involvement in the infringement suit. This provision is separate from Title 28 provisions that grant federal courts jurisdiction over copyright infringement actions, without conditioning it on prior registration of works. The Copyright Act's provisions condition jurisdiction on whether copyright holders have registered their works before suing for infringement. Exceptions allow courts to adjudicate infringement claims involving unregistered works in specific circumstances. The Court argued that jurisdictional significance should not be ascribed to conditions subject to exceptions, citing previous decisions that treated similar statutory prerequisites as nonjurisdictional. The Reed Elsevier Court attempted to distinguish its 2007 decision in Bowles v. Russell regarding federal civil action requirements. The Reed Elsevier Court distinguished its 2007 decision in Bowles v. Russell, which examined a statutory provision on filing a notice of appeal within 30 days in federal civil actions. Bowles noted that such limitations are historically treated as jurisdictional, while Reed Elsevier argued for contextual interpretation. The Court in Reed Elsevier explained that the registration requirement in \u00a7411(a) is not jurisdictional, unlike the statutory time limit in Bowles. The Court rejected arguments to construe \u00a7411(a) as jurisdictional to promote policy goals and congressional objectives underlying copyright registration. The Court also declined to affirm on estoppel. The Court rejected arguments to construe \u00a7411(a) as jurisdictional to promote policy goals and congressional objectives underlying copyright registration. The Court also declined to affirm on estoppel grounds the appellate court's judgment. The parties' assertion that \u00a7411(a) was jurisdictional in defending or negotiating the settlement agreement was not adopted by the District Court. The Second Circuit rejected the argument that \u00a7411(a) did not restrict the district court's subject-matter jurisdiction. The Supreme Court's adoption of the petitioners' arguments would not create inconsistent court determinations in their favor, so the circumstances supporting estoppel do not exist. The Supreme Court declined to express an opinion on the fairness of the settlement and will now consider the merits and objections at the court of appeals. The question of whether \u00a7411(a) is a mandatory precondition for copyright infringement claims remains open for lower courts to decide. Justice Ginsburg wrote a concurrence on this matter. Justice Ginsburg concurred with the Court's decision that \u00a7411(a) is a prerequisite for filing copyright infringement claims, but noted a conflict between previous rulings. She attempted to reconcile these opinions by explaining the bright-line rule set by the Arbaugh Court. Justice Ginsburg attempted to reconcile conflicting opinions on jurisdictional conditions by referencing the Arbaugh Court's bright-line rule and the Bowles Court's reliance on longstanding decisions. Justice Ginsburg reconciled conflicting opinions on jurisdictional conditions by referencing the Arbaugh Court's bright-line rule and arguing that the Copyright Act's registration requirement is nonjurisdictional. She noted that over 200 opinions characterize \u00a7411(a) as jurisdictional, but those opinions are from lower courts and do not apply to the Copyright Act. Justice Ginsburg argued that the Bowles precedent does not apply to the Copyright Act's registration requirement, as the opinions cited are from lower courts and not the Supreme Court. The Reed Elsevier case is remanded to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to review the settlement's merits and objections. If approved, freelance authors will receive compensation and databases can restore publications. The appellate court may focus on objections to the proposed damages. The appellate court will review objections to the settlement's proposed damages formula, particularly focusing on the failure to create a sub-class for \"C-class\" claims and separate representation for those members. This issue was highlighted by Judge Walker's dissent in the Second Circuit's ruling on the case. The Supreme Court's opinion in Reed Elsevier may lead to favoritism towards A- and B-class claim holders over C-class claim holders in settlements. This could result in C-class claim holders receiving little or no payment. The case also has implications for copyright holders in future infringement cases, suggesting that even unregistered works may be eligible for participation in settlements and class action lawsuits. The Supreme Court's decision in Reed Elsevier allows for unregistered works to be included in copyright infringement settlements and class action lawsuits, even if they do not comply with \u00a7411(a). District courts may dismiss copyright infringement claims for unregistered works, but federal courts can still approve settlements involving both registered and unregistered works. This case also clarifies federal courts' jurisdiction in copyright law litigation. Reed Elsevier clarifies federal courts' jurisdiction in copyright law litigation, reaffirming the clear statement rule as the primary test for statutory limitations. The concurrence seeks to limit Bowles to situations historically treated as jurisdictional by the Supreme Court."
