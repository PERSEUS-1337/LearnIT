    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Arctic Marine Shipping Assessment Implementation Act of 2010\". The Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas are becoming more accessible to shipping due to thinning ice cover, technological advancements, and growing demand for Arctic tourism and resources. It is in the interests of the United States to collaborate with Alaska and Arctic neighbors to ensure safe shipping in the region. The United States collaborates with Alaska and Arctic neighbors to ensure safe and secure shipping in the Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas, protecting the environment and respecting sovereign and security interests. The United States aims to ensure safe and secure shipping in the Arctic Ocean by respecting vessel rights, promoting international cooperation for reliable shipping, and maintaining peaceful relations in the region. For nearly 500 years, mariners and sea-faring nations have sought national and global benefits from sea routes in the Arctic similar to those provided by the Panama and Suez canals. Expanded shipping in the Arctic presents risks to residents, and coordinated shipping regulations are needed to protect United States interests. Coordinated shipping regulations are necessary to safeguard United States interests in the Arctic, even beyond its territorial waters. Existing models of international cooperation, such as joint administration of the St. Lawrence Seaway with Canada and collaboration with the Russian Federation for fisheries enforcement, demonstrate successful management of regional waterways. The United States has significant research, security, environmental, and commercial interests in the Arctic that require attention. The United States has interests in the Arctic and North Pacific regions, including research, security, environmental, and commercial interests that rely on icebreaker platforms. The current Polar Class icebreakers from the 1970s need replacement. Sovereign interests in the Arctic Ocean and Bering Sea regions may increase with a United States claim for an extended continental shelf. Building new icebreakers and international cooperation for aids to navigation are essential. Building new icebreakers, coordinating international plans for aids to navigation, and establishing shipping regulations and oil spill prevention capabilities through international cooperation are crucial for protecting United States interests in the Arctic. This effort is especially important given the current extensive use of the Arctic Ocean by vessels from various nations. The implementation of the Arctic Marine Shipping Assessment is crucial for protecting United States interests in the Arctic. The purpose of this section is to ensure safe and secure maritime shipping in the Arctic, including aids to navigation, vessel escorts, spill response capability, and maritime search and rescue. The Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard operates is encouraged to negotiate agreements through the International Maritime Organization to promote coordinated action among Arctic nations. Agreements among Arctic nations to ensure safe maritime shipping, including aids to navigation, marine safety, oil spill prevention, vessel tracking, and search and rescue. Coordination by the Committee on the Maritime Transportation System. The Committee on the Maritime Transportation System coordinates domestic transportation policies in the Arctic. The Secretary of the department with the Coast Guard may enter agreements or make grants to carry out the purpose of this section. The Secretary of Transportation may enter agreements or grants to individuals and governments for icebreaking and demonstration projects to reduce emissions from vessels. Authorization of Appropriations: $5,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2011 to 2015 for seasonal operations in the Arctic, including training mariners for ice navigation and preventing discharges from vessels. The Guard is allocated $5,000,000 annually for Arctic operations from 2011 to 2015. Additionally, $10,000,000 is designated for agreements and $5,000,000 for transportation demonstration projects during the same period. The Commandant of the Coast Guard will conduct a cost-benefit analysis of extending the service life of existing icebreakers or constructing new ones for operation by the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard will analyze extending the service life of existing icebreakers or building new ones for Federal icebreaking missions in the Arctic regions. The United States may struggle to maintain a presence in the Arctic regions through 2020 if funding for icebreaker fleet recapitalization is insufficient. Reports to Congress are required within 90 days of the enactment of the Act or the completion of the High Latitude Study on Arctic icebreaking mission requirements. The Commandant of the Coast Guard must submit a report with the results of the ongoing High Latitude Study on Arctic ice-breaking mission requirements to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the House of Representatives Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. This report must include recommendations deemed appropriate under section 93(a)(24) of title 14, United States Code. Additionally, within 1 year of the enactment of this Act, the Commandant must submit the report. The Commandant of the Coast Guard must submit reports with the results of the High Latitude Study on Arctic ice-breaking mission requirements to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and the House of Representatives Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, along with recommendations under section 93(a)(24) of title 14, United States Code, within 1 year of the enactment of this Act. Assessment of needs for additional Coast Guard presence in high latitude regions. Within 270 days of enactment, the Secretary of the department overseeing the Coast Guard must submit a report to relevant committees assessing the need for increased Coast Guard capabilities in high latitude regions for various missions. This includes search and rescue, marine pollution response, fisheries enforcement, and maritime commerce. The report should include an assessment of operating needs in these regions. The Secretary must submit a report assessing Coast Guard capabilities in high latitude regions for missions like search and rescue, marine pollution response, fisheries enforcement, and maritime commerce. The report should evaluate current assets, projected needs for forward operating bases, shore infrastructure, personnel, logistics, communications, and resources requirements. Additionally, an assessment of the need for high latitude icebreaking capabilities should be included. The report will assess Coast Guard capabilities in high latitude regions, including the need for icebreaking capability and the current fleet's performance and conditions. The report will include an assessment of high latitude icebreaking assets' conditions and their impact on mission performance, as well as detailed cost estimates for acquiring and maintaining additional assets for Coast Guard missions in these regions. The report will provide detailed cost estimates for high latitude icebreaking capability to meet mission performance goals, including renovating and modernizing the existing fleet and replacing it. SEC. 5. ARCTIC DEFINITION. The term \"Arctic\" in this Act has the same meaning as in the Arctic Research and Policy Act of 1984."
