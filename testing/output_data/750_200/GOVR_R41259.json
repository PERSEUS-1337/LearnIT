Despite efforts through negotiations, aid, and sanctions, North Korea's capabilities have continued to grow. The United States has never established formal diplomatic relations with North Korea since its creation in 1948. The United States has tried negotiations, aid, and sanctions to stop North Korea's weapons programs, but their capabilities continue to increase. U.S. interests in North Korea include security, political, and human rights concerns, with military alliances obligating defense of South Korea and Japan. U.S. troops and civilians in these countries are within range of North Korean missiles. North Korea's nuclear and missile capabilities pose a threat to the U.S. homeland and its allies in the region. The potential conflict or collapse in Pyongyang would have significant economic implications globally. Negotiations with North Korea impact U.S. relations with major powers like China and South Korea, as they navigate dealing with a totalitarian regime. North Korea, with a population of about 25 million, was founded on the philosophy of juche (self-reliance) by Kim Il-sung. The totalitarian regime led by the Kim family resists outside influences and has a history of breaking diplomatic and commercial agreements. This poses a challenge for major powers like China and South Korea in dealing with North Korea's unpredictable behavior. The Kim family's near-totalitarian control in North Korea has enabled the country to resist outside influences and break diplomatic and commercial agreements. They have built one of the world's largest militaries, acting as a deterrent to military intervention and giving Pyongyang leverage over foreign powers. However, this militarization, along with North Korea's provocative behavior and opaque policymaking, has led to defiance of international norms. North Korea's militarization, combined with provocative behavior and opaque policymaking, has hindered economic growth by limiting interactions with the outside world. Despite signs of economic strengthening under Kim's rule, the majority of the population remains impoverished, and increased access to outside information could fuel discontent if growth stalls. Congress plays a significant role in shaping U.S. policy towards North Korea through sanctions legislation and the North Korean Human Rights Act. They have the power to set restrictions on trade, engagement with DPRK, and the President's ability to ease sanctions. Additionally, Congress has authorized millions in energy assistance under past nuclear agreements. Congress has authorized millions in energy assistance under past nuclear agreements and may need to approve funds for future aid to North Korea in exchange for denuclearization steps. Congressional oversight includes hearings questioning North Korea's capabilities, intentions, and human rights record. North Korea's capabilities and intentions have been questioned in numerous Congressional hearings. Recent advances in missile and nuclear weapons have raised concerns about the regime's threat to the United States, with the potential ability to strike the continental U.S. with a nuclear-armed ballistic missile. North Korea's accelerated capability to strike the continental United States with a nuclear-armed ballistic missile has become a top U.S. foreign policy and national security concern. Pyongyang's threats have increased across various domains, including nuclear weapons, long-range missile technology, submarine-based missiles, short-range artillery, and cyberattacks. Multiple nuclear tests and missile tests were conducted by North Korea between January 2016 and September 2017, with the sixth nuclear test being the most powerful to date. North Korea conducted multiple nuclear tests and missile tests between January 2016 and September 2017, with the sixth nuclear test being the most powerful. In 2017, they also tested missiles capable of reaching the continental United States and developed a submarine-based ballistic missile program. The Trump Administration blamed North Korea for the \"WannaCry\" cyberattack, showcasing their ability to disrupt critical operations. The \"WannaCry\" cyberattack, attributed to North Korea, demonstrated their ability to disrupt computer networks worldwide. The Trump Administration responded with a \"maximum pressure\" policy, similar to the Obama Administration's approach, to coerce Pyongyang through economic and diplomatic measures. This included increasing economic pressure, urging China and others to apply more pressure, and strengthening alliances with South Korea and Japan. The Trump Administration successfully led the United Nations Security Council to pass four new sanctions resolutions against North Korea, expanding requirements for member states to halt interactions with the DPRK. Both the Obama and Trump Administrations pushed countries globally to cut ties with North Korea beyond UNSC requirements. The Trump Administration emphasized the option of launching a preventive military strike against North Korea, leading to contradictory statements on U.S. conditions for negotiations and the possibility of a strike. The Trump Administration's public statements on U.S. policy towards North Korea have been inconsistent, causing confusion. In early 2018, North Korea accepted invitations from South Korea and the U.S. for diplomatic talks, leading to the 2018 Winter Olympics and the Singapore Summit between Kim Jong-un and President Trump. Before the June 2018 Singapore Summit, Kim Jong-un met with Moon and Xi Jinping to pave the way for the historic meeting with Trump. Kim's shift towards diplomacy after previous provocations was likely influenced by various factors, including harsh rhetoric from the Trump Administration. Kim Jong-un pursued diplomacy due to factors like harsh rhetoric from the Trump Administration, punishing sanctions limiting North Korea's economy, Moon Jae-in's outreach, and Kim's confidence in his nuclear deterrent. He found willing counterparts in Moon, Xi, and Trump, leading to the historic Singapore Summit on June 12, 2018. On June 12, 2018, President Trump and Kim met in Singapore to discuss North Korea's nuclear program and future relations. They issued a joint statement committing to security guarantees and denuclearization. The Singapore document focuses on normalization in four key areas. The Singapore document outlines principles for normalization between the United States and North Korea, focusing on establishing new bilateral relations, building a lasting peace regime, working towards denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and recovering POW/MIA remains. No mention was made of North Korea's ballistic missile program. Follow-on negotiations are planned. During the Korean War, some soldiers remained unaccounted for. The agreement between the U.S. and DPRK did not address North Korea's ballistic missile program. Follow-on negotiations will be led by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Trump announced the suspension of U.S.-South Korea military exercises, aiming to save money and potentially withdraw U.S. troops from South Korea. The agreement between the U.S. and DPRK aimed to save money by suspending U.S.-South Korea military exercises and potentially withdrawing troops from South Korea. The deal also included the suspension of missile and nuclear tests by North Korea, reducing their capability advancement. Critics noted similarities to previous agreements not made by the DPRK leader. Critics of the agreement highlight concerns about the lack of a timeframe, verification mechanisms, and Kim's commitment to dismantle North Korea's ballistic missile program. Uncertainties remain regarding the definition and sequencing of denuclearization, as well as the establishment of a peace regime and diplomatic normalization. Some analysts view North Korea's push for a peace treaty as a tactic to delay denuclearization talks. Some analysts believe North Korea's push for a peace treaty before denuclearization talks is a tactic to stall for time and gain recognition as a nuclear state. U.N. sanctions have been effective in imposing costs on North Korea, but maintaining political momentum for sanctions implementation is challenging during engagement initiatives. U.N. sanctions are a key tool in holding North Korea accountable for its weapons programs. The UNSC, led by the United States, adopted its first resolution in 2006 after North Korea's nuclear test, with a total of 10 resolutions passed by December 2017 to expand sanctions requirements on member states. The UNSC has passed 10 resolutions between 2006 and December 2017 to expand sanctions on North Korea, targeting arms sales, materials for weapons programs, individuals involved in WMD activities, and luxury goods transfers. Sanctions were further expanded after North Korea's fourth nuclear test in January 2016, with six additional resolutions adopted since then, the latest in December 2017. Since January 2016, U.N. sanctions on North Korea have significantly increased, with six resolutions passed by December 2017. These sanctions now prohibit various financial transactions, trade in key industries, and interactions with North Korean entities. As a result, most of North Korea's major exports are now banned in global markets. The value of North Korean exports declined by over 30% in 2017 compared to 2016 due to international bans on its major export items. The Obama and Trump Administrations urged countries to cut ties with North Korea beyond UN requirements, but it is unclear if Trump has continued this approach since diplomatic outreach to Pyongyang in 2018. The Trump Administration has continued an aggressive approach towards North Korea, imposing unilateral sanctions and designating them as a state sponsor of terrorism. Congress has also passed legislation targeting North Korea since 2015. Since 2015, the U.S. has imposed sanctions on North Korea, including trade restrictions on food and medicine, financial transaction prohibitions, and a ban on new investments. The U.S. has imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2015, including restrictions on trade in food and medicine, financial transactions, and new investments. Additionally, U.S. foreign aid to North Korea is minimal and emergency-based, with strict controls to prevent the government from benefiting. U.S. persons are prohibited from engaging in trade with North Korean entities designated by the OFAC. The U.S. has imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2015, including restrictions on trade and transactions with designated individuals, entities, and vessels. Foreign financial institutions could face U.S. sanctions for facilitating transactions for DPRK entities. U.S. persons are prohibited from trading with Kim Jong-un, the Korean Workers' Party, and others. U.S. travel to North Korea is limited and requires a special validation passport. North Korea's demands in negotiations regarding its weapons programs have varied over the years. North Korea's demands in negotiations regarding its weapons programs have changed over the years, including requests for U.S. recognition as a nuclear weapons state and a peace treaty with the United States. Pyongyang's behavior has ranged from limited cooperation to overt provocations, such as testing long-range ballistic missiles and conducting nuclear tests. North Korea has a history of testing long-range ballistic missiles and conducting nuclear tests. Pyongyang's willingness to negotiate is often driven by internal conditions like food shortages or economic desperation, seeking aid from China, the United States, or South Korea. North Korea exploits divisions among parties and political transitions to stall nuclear negotiations, leading to debates on the effectiveness of negotiating with them. North Korea's history of testing missiles and conducting nuclear tests has led to debates on negotiating with them. Some analysts believe negotiations are necessary to reduce conflict and are feasible because Kim Jong-un's goal is economic development. A potential bargain could involve North Korea giving up nuclear weapons and missiles in exchange for a more secure relationship with the United States, an end to the Korean War, and economic benefits. Kim Jong-un's focus on economic development in 2018 is seen as a signal of potential denuclearization, but analysts doubt North Korea will give up its nuclear weapons voluntarily. Pyongyang's negotiating behavior suggests reluctance to disarm despite offers of benefits and sanctions relief. North Korea's regime is unlikely to give up its nuclear weapons capability voluntarily, viewing it as essential for survival. Analysts doubt Pyongyang's intentions to disarm, as it has repeatedly stated its determination to maintain its nuclear program. North Korea has shifted its intentions regarding its nuclear weapons program, declaring itself a \"nuclear-armed nation\" in 2012 and stating that its nuclear weapons are not negotiable in 2013. The successful test of an intercontinental ballistic missile in 2017 was hailed as a significant achievement by North Korean news outlets. Following the successful test of the Hwasong-15 intercontinental ballistic missile in November 2017, North Korea declared itself a \"nuclear-armed nation\" and stated that it will not give up its nuclear stockpile until all nuclear weapons are eliminated worldwide. The 2011 military intervention in Libya, which abandoned its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions removal, may have reinforced the value of nuclear arms for regime security in North Korea. The 2018 Singapore summit conferred legitimacy on North Korea as a nuclear state, satisfying some of its past demands and reinforcing the perceived value of nuclear arms for regime security. The Trump Administration's efforts have met some of North Korea's past demands, including canceling military exercises, easing sanctions, and meeting with other heads of state. Previous nuclear and missile negotiations with North Korea include the Agreed Framework, missile negotiations, Six-Party Talks, and the Leap Day Deal. The proposed formula for these negotiations involves North Korea halting or disabling its nuclear or missile programs in exchange for concessions. In 1986, U.S. intelligence detected North Korea starting a plutonium production reactor and reprocessing plant at Yongbyon, not monitored as required by the NPT. North Korea joined the NPT in 1985 but later obstructed IAEA inspections and announced its intention to withdraw from the treaty. After obstructing IAEA inspections and announcing withdrawal from the NPT, North Korea faced discussions of sanctions and potential military strikes. Diplomatic efforts, including a mission by former President Jimmy Carter, led to negotiations and the 1994 U.S.-North Korea Agreed Framework for denuclearization. The 1994 U.S.-North Korea Agreed Framework involved the U.S. providing North Korea with two light water reactor nuclear power plants and heavy fuel oil in exchange for North Korea freezing its plutonium program under IAEA supervision. Despite delays, North Korea froze its plutonium program, received heavy fuel oil, and started construction on the reactors. However, North Korea did not fully declare all nuclear facilities to the IAEA as agreed. In 2002, the George W. Bush Administration accused North Korea of a secret uranium enrichment program, leading to the halt of fuel oil shipments and reactor construction. North Korea expelled IAEA inspectors, withdrew from the NPT, and restarted its reactor and reprocessing facility. In response to congressional pressure, the Clinton Administration began negotiations with North Korea in 1996 to curb its missile program and exports. In 1999, North Korea agreed to a missile testing moratorium in exchange for lifting some U.S. sanctions. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright visited Pyongyang in 2000 to finalize agreements. During negotiations with North Korea in the late 1990s and early 2000s, agreements were made to curb missile development and exports in exchange for sanctions relief. Despite efforts by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, a final agreement was not reached. The \"Six-Party Talks\" involving China, South Korea, Japan, and Russia from 2003 to 2008 made some progress but did not fully resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. The \"Six-Party Talks\" involving China, South Korea, Japan, and Russia from 2003 to 2008 aimed to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue, but ultimately failed due to disagreements on verification measures for North Korea's compliance with abandoning its nuclear weapons programs. The Obama Administration's policy towards North Korea, known as \"strategic patience,\" aimed to pressure Pyongyang to return to the Six-Party Talks for denuclearization. Key elements included coordinating with Japan and South Korea, urging China to take a tougher stance, and applying pressure through arms interdictions. The Obama Administration's policy towards North Korea involved closely coordinating with treaty allies Japan and South Korea, urging China to take a tougher stance, and applying pressure through arms interdictions and sanctions. U.S. officials sought a comprehensive package deal for North Korea's denuclearization in exchange for normalization of relations and aid, but insisted on a freeze of nuclear activities and testing before negotiations. This policy was reinforced by large-scale military exercises to showcase the strength of the U.S.-South Korean alliance. The Obama Administration implemented multilateral and unilateral sanctions on North Korea, targeting entities involved in weapons of mass destruction procurement and illicit activities like money laundering and arms sales. This was in addition to showcasing the strength of the U.S.-South Korean alliance through military exercises. Following the 2014 cyberattack on Sony Pictures Entertainment attributed to North Korean hackers, President Obama issued E.O. 13687 to seize assets of designated DPRK officials. Despite attempts at engagement, provocations by Pyongyang halted negotiations, leading to a cycle of action and reaction with the U.S. focusing on building consensus at the UNSC and pressuring North Korea. The \"Leap Day Agreement\" in February 2012 committed North Korea to a moratorium on nuclear tests, missile launches, and uranium enrichment at Yongbyon in exchange for nutritional assistance from the Obama Administration. The \"Leap Day Agreement\" in February 2012 committed North Korea to a moratorium on nuclear activities at the Yongbyon facility and the readmission of IAEA inspectors in exchange for 240,000 metric tons of \"nutritional assistance\" from the Obama Administration. However, North Korea violated the agreement by launching a long-range rocket and conducting a third nuclear test in February 2013. The U.S. policy of pressuring North Korea economically and diplomatically relies heavily on China, its largest trading partner and a key provider of food and energy aid to the regime. China, North Korea's main trading partner, provides essential food and energy aid to the regime, accounting for over 90% of its total trade since 2015. Despite not supporting Pyongyang's nuclear goals, China prioritizes maintaining stability on the Korean Peninsula to prevent North Korea's collapse. This is due to fears of a humanitarian crisis, refugee flows, and uncertainty about other nations' actions, especially the United States, in the event of a power shift. China's strategic importance in maintaining stability on the Korean Peninsula is highlighted by its role as North Korea's main trading partner. Despite not supporting Pyongyang's nuclear goals, China prioritizes stability to prevent a collapse that could lead to a humanitarian crisis and significant refugee flows. Beijing's influence often hinders U.S. efforts to impose harsher punishments on North Korea in international forums, with Chinese companies found violating sanctions against the regime. In 2017, China increased enforcement of UNSC sanctions on North Korea to deter US military action. Chinese trade and aid to North Korea are limited, possibly to avoid appearing fully supportive of the regime. Chinese trade and aid to North Korea are limited, likely to avoid full support of the regime and to maintain a responsible image internationally. Relations between Beijing and Pyongyang strained after Kim Jong-un's rise to power, especially following the execution of his uncle, who had been a key intermediary with China. Kim Jong-un's rise to power in 2011 strained relations between Beijing and Pyongyang, particularly after he executed his uncle Jang Song-taek in 2013, who had been a key intermediary with China. Chinese President Xi Jinping had multiple summits with South Korean leaders but did not meet with Kim. Chinese public opinion also turned against North Korea, with many calling for a reassessment of China's ties with the country. In 2017, China agreed to stringent UNSC sanctions against North Korea, and public opinion favored a U.S. preemptive airstrike on North Korea's nuclear sites. Trump and Kim's diplomatic efforts in 2018 improved North Korea-China relations, with Kim visiting Beijing for the first time. After Trump's agreement to meet Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader visited Beijing to strengthen ties with China. This move followed the deescalation of hostilities and the cancellation of U.S.-South Korean military exercises, giving Kim new leverage in his relationship with Beijing. Kim Jong-un is the third generation of the ruling Kim family in North Korea. Kim Jong-un, the third generation ruler of North Korea, has gained new goodwill and leverage in his relationship with Beijing. His bold emergence on the global stage in 2018 suggests he has consolidated power, despite the opaque nature of the Pyongyang regime. Kim Jong-un's confidence on the global diplomatic stage in 2018 indicates his consolidated power in North Korea. He has pursued a two-track policy of economic development and nuclear weapons, aiming to strengthen his regime and improve the country's economy. Kim has rejected external pressure to choose between the two tracks and has achieved a \"limited nuclear deterrent.\" Kim Jong-un has pursued economic opportunities and improved relations with South Korea and China while maintaining a \"limited nuclear deterrent.\" Despite initial hopes for political reform, his actions show a ruthless drive to keep the dynastic dictatorship intact. Since becoming supreme leader in late 2011, Kim Jong-un has demonstrated a brutal hand in leading North Korea, consolidating power through purges and executions of senior officials, including his own uncle and half-brother. Over 300 senior military and civilian officials were replaced in his first four years in office. Kim Jong-un, unlike his father, has displayed a more open ruling style by allowing Western influences in North Korea and being informal in public appearances. His wife has been introduced to the public, a stark change from his father's era. Kim Jong-un's wife has been introduced to the North Korean public, signaling a departure from his father's era. The couple's three children remain hidden. Analysts view these changes as Kim's attempt to appear young and modern, evoking his grandfather Kim Il-Sung's \"man of the people\" image. North Korea is one of the world's poorest countries, with a per capita GDP of under $2,000, and operates as a centrally planned economy. Kim's economic policy changes seem to have had some impact. North Korea, with a GDP of under $2,000, operates as a centrally planned economy. Kim Jong-un's economic policy changes have spurred growth and improved living standards for many North Koreans. Increased domestic production and sanctions-evasion activities have helped North Korea withstand international sanctions since 2016. Kim Jong-un's economic policy changes have allowed market principles to govern some sectors of North Korean business, industry, and agriculture, leading to an expansion in markets and ancillary services. Kim emphasizes domestic manufacturing and calls for a shift in consumption. Kim Jong-un emphasizes domestic manufacturing and calls for a shift in consumption from imported to domestically produced goods. North Korea's marketization process has been facilitated by international trade with China, accounting for over 90% of its trade since 2016. Agricultural liberalization and favorable planting conditions have led to larger harvests since 2010, stabilizing food prices since around 2012. Since around 2012, North Korean food prices have been stable, indicating increased stability in food production. Despite some elite and those with hard currency faring better, over 10 million North Koreans, or over 40% of the population, continue to suffer from food insecurity and undernutrition. Analysts debate whether Kim's changes can be considered \"reforms\" as they may not be as sweeping as those seen in socialist countries in the past. Kim's changes in North Korea are seen as potential reforms, but their extent is uncertain compared to past socialist countries. The government's stance on marketization is ambiguous, with periodic crackdowns on market activities. Many North Koreans face limited access to healthcare and food shortages despite the regime's claims of providing universal healthcare. Many North Koreans lack access to quality healthcare and suffer from food shortages. The regime controls where families can live based on loyalty, limiting access to medical care. Pyongyang has better health facilities for the elite, but many cannot afford medications or bribes for doctors. The regime's control is slowly weakening. Many North Koreans struggle to access quality medical care due to financial constraints and government control. Pyongyang's grip on information is loosening, with citizens turning to outside sources for news despite government efforts to block foreign broadcasts. Defectors report that some citizens have illegal radios to listen to outside news. The North Korean government restricts access to outside information by altering radios and blocking foreign broadcasts. Despite these efforts, some citizens have illegal or modified radios to listen to foreign programs. In 2009, North Korea restarted a mobile phone network with over 3 million subscribers in 2017, possibly for better surveillance. The North Korean government restricts access to outside information by altering radios and blocking foreign broadcasts. Despite these efforts, some citizens have illegal or modified radios to listen to foreign programs. In 2009, North Korea restarted a mobile phone network with over 3 million subscribers in 2017, allowing increased mobile-phone use for surveillance. Some reports suggest that North Korean cadres consume foreign media, are involved in smuggling, and use Chinese cellphones near the border for international calls. The spread of cell phones enables faster dissemination of information within North Korea. The Harvard University Belfer Center paper in 2015 suggests that spreading information within North Korea could lead to positive political changes. A survey found that 28% of North Koreans owned domestic mobile phones, with 15% using them to access sensitive media content. Thae Yong-ho, a former North Korean deputy ambassador, believes increased access to information could weaken the Kim regime's control over its citizens. The North Korean regime indoctrinates citizens to be loyal to the Kim family and portrays the outside world as inferior. The country has one of the largest militaries globally, with significant defense spending. Outside information could challenge the regime and inform people about their living conditions. North Korea's military is substantial, with a large number of troops and significant defense spending. The military has deployed most of its forces near the DMZ for quick mobilization in a conflict with South Korea. Despite resource limitations, North Korea is focusing on developing nuclear weapons and long-range missiles to compensate for weaknesses in its conventional forces. North Korea is developing its WMD capabilities, including nuclear weapons, long-range ballistic missiles, chemical weapons, and possibly biological weapons. Analysts believe Pyongyang has the ability to conduct offensive cyber operations and is considered a significant cyber threat by the U.S. intelligence community. South Korea's Defense Ministry stated that North Korea has 6,000 cyber warfare troops. North Korea's conventional military capabilities have weakened since 1990, but they could still cause significant damage to Seoul with artillery and rocket attacks. Experts believe that in a war on the Korean Peninsula, the United States and South Korea would ultimately prevail, but at a high cost. Analysts estimate that North Korean artillery forces, hidden in underground facilities, could unleash thousands of rounds. Analysts estimate that North Korean artillery forces, fortified in underground facilities, could fire thousands of rounds at Seoul in the first hour of a war. North Korean military equipment is outdated compared to the U.S. and South Korea. North Korea has been focusing on improving its asymmetric capabilities like UAVs and cyber operations. North Korea has been focusing on improving its asymmetric capabilities, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), offensive cyber operations, special operations forces, GPS jamming, stealth and infiltration, and electromagnetic pulse. They have also made advancements in long-range artillery, tanks, armored vehicles, infantry weapons, surface-to-air missiles, ballistic missile-capable submarines, and special operations forces. Additionally, North Korea has constructed new helicopter-carrier corvettes and may be developing a larger model of submarine for launching ballistic missiles. North Korea has constructed two new helicopter-carrier corvettes and may be developing a larger model of submarine for launching ballistic missiles. The North Korean military's centralized command structure and lack of independent actions would hinder its effectiveness in a major conflict due to institutional weaknesses. General resource scarcity impacts military readiness in various ways, with highly scripted and inflexible war plans and limited initiative from mid-level officers. The North Korean military's centralized command structure and lack of independent actions hinder its effectiveness in a major conflict due to institutional weaknesses. General resource scarcity impacts military readiness in various ways, such as lack of fuel for adequate flight training, logistical shortages, lack of spare parts reducing equipment availability, and food shortages affecting combat endurance. U.S. analysts are concerned about North Korea's nuclear weapons development for deterrence purposes. The U.S. intelligence community is skeptical of North Korea's willingness to abandon its nuclear weapons program, despite ongoing talks about denuclearization. Pyongyang's commitment to possessing nuclear weapons and long-range missiles for survival raises doubts about its intentions. North Korea's nuclear weapons and long-range missiles are crucial for its survival, with the regime showing no intention of negotiating them away. The North Korean nuclear arsenal is seen as a deterrent against the United States, and the country is focused on developing smaller, lighter, and more diversified warheads. North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests to strengthen its nuclear force. North Korea has tested nuclear explosive devices six times since 2006, including a hydrogen bomb in September 2017. Each test produced progressively higher magnitude blasts. In early 2018, North Korea announced it had achieved its nuclear goals and would no longer conduct tests. North Korea's nuclear program began in the late 1950s with cooperation agreements with the Soviet Union on a nuclear research program near Yongbyon. By 1986, they had a small nuclear reactor capable of producing plutonium. Despite announcing the closure of its test site in 2018, fissile material production and related facilities remain active. North Korea's nuclear program started in the late 1950s with Soviet cooperation near Yongbyon. By 1986, they had a reactor producing 6kg of plutonium yearly. The reactor and reprocessing plant have been operational or frozen under safeguards since 1994. After the collapse of the Six Party Talks in 2008, North Korea restarted its reactor, reprocessing plant, and built a uranium enrichment plant. In 2008, North Korea restarted its 5MW(e) reactor, reprocessing plant, and built a uranium enrichment plant. They also acknowledged a uranium enrichment program in 2009, aiming for nuclear power fuel production. North Korea has produced 30-40 kilograms of separated plutonium, enough for several nuclear weapons. North Korea openly acknowledged a uranium enrichment program in 2009 for nuclear power fuel production. In November 2010, they displayed early construction of a light-water reactor and a gas centrifuge uranium enrichment plant at Yongbyon. U.S. officials suspect other clandestine enrichment facilities exist, with one identified at Kangson in July 2018. The extent of North Korea's warhead and material stockpiles is challenging to estimate. North Korea's uranium enrichment program was openly acknowledged in 2009 for nuclear power fuel production. In July 2018, a clandestine enrichment facility was identified at Kangson. Estimating warhead and material stockpiles is challenging due to lack of transparency. Recent scholarly analyses suggest North Korea could produce 20 to 100 warheads by 2020. The country prioritizes the development of its ballistic missile program. North Korea has conducted numerous ballistic missile test launches since Kim Jong-un came to power in 2011, aiming to improve offensive capabilities and evade U.S. missile defense systems. In 2016, they conducted 26 tests, and in 2017, they launched 18 missiles, with some failures. The low-end estimate for their warhead production by 2020 is 20, with a maximum of 100 warheads. North Korea conducted 26 ballistic missile flight tests in various platforms. In 2017, they test launched 18 ballistic missiles, including two ICBM tests in July and November. North Korea also possesses around 700 short-range ballistic missiles, but their accuracy is questionable. The main goal of North Korea's nuclear weapons program is to develop a miniaturized warhead for long-range ballistic missiles. North Korea's nuclear weapons program aims to develop a miniaturized warhead for long-range ballistic missiles. The medium-range Nodong missile poses a near-term threat to the Korean Peninsula, mainland Japan, and some U.S. military bases. Experts believe North Korea may have the capability to mount a nuclear warhead on the Nodong missile. North Korea has the capability to mount a nuclear warhead on the Nodong missile, as identified in a December 2015 Department of Defense report. The KN-08 and Taepodong-2 are two hypothetical ICBMs on which North Korea could mount a nuclear warhead. In 2016, the intelligence community assessed that North Korea has taken initial steps towards fielding an ICBM system, although it has not been flight-tested. In July 2017, the DPRK conducted two ICBM tests. North Korea has shown progress in its medium-range ballistic missile program and submarine-launched ballistic missile test program. They are also transitioning towards solid rocket motors for their ballistic missiles, with successful tests of the Pukguksong-2 solid fuel MRBM in 2017. North Korea's focus on developing solid fuel missiles like the Pukguksong-2 has led to plans for mass production. Recent missile tests aim to counter missile defense systems in the region. Some tests in 2016 had unusual trajectories, possibly for reentry warhead testing. North Korea's missile tests in 2016 had unique trajectories, potentially for reentry warhead testing. In 2017, they demonstrated the ability to launch multiple missiles in quick succession, indicating a possible strategy for large-scale ballistic missile attacks that could overwhelm missile defense systems. North Korea's progress with SLBMs could challenge missile defense systems. The United States has tried to negotiate limits on North Korea's missile program since 1998. Since 1998, negotiations have been ongoing to limit North Korea's missile program, with talks on a moratorium on long-range missile tests ultimately failing. The Bush Administration prioritized the North Korean nuclear program over ballistic missiles, and in 2006, UNSC Resolution 1718 prohibited North Korea from engaging in missile-related activities, which they disregarded. In 2006, UNSC Resolution 1718 banned North Korea from missile-related activities. Despite this, North Korea conducted a test launch in April 2009, leading to UNSC Resolution 1874 imposing further restrictions on their ballistic missile program. The 2012 Leap Day Agreement included a moratorium on ballistic missile tests, but North Korea argued that it did not cover satellite launches. Recent talks have not specifically addressed missiles, although North Korea is reported to have active biological and chemical weapons programs. North Korea has active biological and chemical weapons programs, with one of the world's largest chemical weapons stockpiles. They possess mustard, phosgene, and sarin gas, with multiple facilities and storage depots for chemical weapons. North Korea's estimated chemical weapon production capability is up to 4,500 metric tons during a typical year. North Korea has a significant chemical weapons stockpile, with production capability up to 4,500 metric tons annually. They have storage depots for chemical weapons and are not part of the Chemical Weapons Convention. If they were to use chemical weapons, South Korea and Japan would be likely targets. North Korea, not a signatory to the Chemical Weapons Convention, is suspected of maintaining a biological weapons production capability. The U.S. intelligence community believes North Korea has a longstanding biological weapons capability and munitions production capacity to weaponize biological agents. South Korea and Japan are seen as the most likely targets for any potential chemical or biological attacks. North Korea is suspected of possessing anthrax and smallpox, along with a biological weapons production capability and biotechnology infrastructure. The country has sold missile parts and technology to various countries, generating hard currency for the regime. North Korea has provided missile technology and telemetric information to countries like Libya, Burma, Pakistan, Syria, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen for hard currency. They assisted Syria in building a nuclear reactor destroyed by Israel in 2007, potentially for a nuclear weapons program. The U.N. Panel of Experts reported transfers of chemical weapons-related materials to Syria from North Korea. North Korea and Iran have collaborated on missile development since the 1980s, sharing information and components. Iran's ballistic missile research advisors were observed in North Korea before. North Korea has collaborated with Iran on missile development since the 1980s, with reports of scientific advisors from Iran's ballistic missile research centers seen in North Korea before the December 2012 launch. China may have also assisted the North Korean missile program, as evidenced by a Chinese company selling heavy transport vehicles to North Korea for conversion into missile transport-erector-launchers. The North Korean regime engages in illicit activities to earn hard currency. The North Korean regime engages in illicit activities to earn hard currency, including production and trafficking of drugs, counterfeit currency, cigarettes, and pharmaceuticals. One agency, Office 39, oversees many of these activities. North Korean agency Office 39 oversees illicit activities generating $500 million to $1 billion annually, including methamphetamine production and international smuggling. Tighter sanctions have led to increased narcotics production since 2017. Thai authorities arrested individuals smuggling North Korean methamphetamines in 2013. North Korea has increased illegal narcotics production since 2017 due to tighter sanctions. It is unclear if these activities are state-directed or carried out by criminal gangs. The country also sells Cold War-era weapons to various states, particularly in the Middle East and North Africa. In 2016, a ship was seized with over 30,000 rocket-propelled grenades near the Suez Canal. Authorities seized the Jie Shun outside the Suez Canal in August 2016, finding over 30,000 rocket-propelled grenades destined for the Egyptian military. North Korea cooperates with Iran and Syria, developing ballistic missiles and shipping weapons and equipment to Syria through front companies based in China. Chinese companies, often assisted by North Korean diplomats, help North Korea mask its illicit dealings by keeping regime earnings in overseas bank accounts. These companies use front companies in locations like the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong to conduct transactions in U.S. dollars for sanctioned North Korean banks, allowing the money to remain in the international financial system. The U.S. government has been increasingly sanctioning companies involved in these activities. In November 2017, the U.S. Treasury Department banned a Chinese bank, Bank of Dandong, for acting as a conduit for illicit North Korean financial activity. Previously, in September 2005, Banco Delta Asia in Macau was identified for distributing North Korean counterfeit currency and laundering money for the country's criminal enterprises. The Treasury Department ordered the freezing of $24 million in North Korean accounts with the bank. The U.S. Treasury Department banned Bank of Dandong for facilitating North Korean financial activity and froze $24 million in North Korean accounts. North Korea boycotted talks until the funds were returned. Congress has addressed North Korea's human rights abuses. The State Department's annual human rights reports and reports from private organizations have consistently highlighted extreme human rights abuses by the North Korean regime, including a total denial of political, civil, and religious liberties. Citizens face severe physical abuse for violating laws and restrictions, with no freedoms of speech, press, assembly, or independent judiciary. Citizens are also subjected to extensive ideological indoctrination. Reports detail severe physical abuse and ideological indoctrination of North Korean citizens, with roughly 100,000 political prisoners held in prison camps. Conditions are harsh, and many do not survive in these camps. Reports from survivors and escapees indicate that conditions in North Korean prison camps are extremely harsh, with many political prisoners perishing due to starvation, disease, executions, and torture. The Commission of Inquiry found that close to 400,000 prisoners died during a 31-year period. The number of political prisoners in North Korea has decreased in recent years. The number of political prisoners in North Korea has declined in recent years, possibly due to high mortality rates in the camps. The United Nations has been actively addressing human rights violations in North Korea, establishing the Special Rapporteur on human rights in 2004 and the Commission of Inquiry in 2013 to investigate grave violations. In 2013, the U.N. Human Rights Council established the Commission of Inquiry (COI) to investigate human rights violations in North Korea, concluding that the regime had committed \"crimes against humanity\" and recommending referral to the International Criminal Court (ICC) in 2014. The UN Human Rights Council found that North Korea committed \"crimes against humanity\" and recommended referring the situation to the International Criminal Court. Despite a resolution in 2014, no further action has been taken due to resistance from China and Russia. In 2017, a resolution was adopted to archive evidence of human rights violations for potential future prosecution. The archive evidence details human rights violations in North Korea, which could be used for future prosecution. Tens of thousands of North Koreans flee to China to escape persecution and abuse, facing further mistreatment and lack of protection. Repatriated individuals risk harsh punishment or execution. The UNHCR has not been allowed to conduct a systematic survey. Reports indicate that women and children are often victims. The UNHCR has not been allowed to conduct a systematic survey. Reports indicate that many women and children are victims of human trafficking, especially those lured to China for a better life but forced into marriage or prostitution. Some refugees make their way to Southeast Asia, seeking passage to South Korea, where all North Korean defectors receive citizenship. The number of defectors has declined in recent years, with 1,127 North Koreans arriving in South Korea in 2017, a 21% decrease from 2016. In recent years, the number of North Korean defectors resettling in South Korea has declined, with 1,127 arriving in 2017, a 21% decrease from 2016. Elite defections in 2016 highlighted a shift in the demographic profile of defectors, with an increase in those with good songbun. This trend may be due to tightened border patrols and increased border security. Since Kim Jong-un came to power in 2011, the number of defectors with good songbun has increased, possibly due to heightened border security. Diplomats are now tasked with earning foreign currency, leading some to defect if unable to meet expectations. Elite defectors risk imprisonment or execution, prompting many to flee to China where thousands are in hiding. Since Kim Jong-un took power in 2011, the number of defectors with good songbun has risen, possibly due to increased border security. Diplomats now must earn foreign currency, leading some to defect if unable to meet expectations. Elite defectors risk imprisonment or execution, prompting many to flee to China where thousands are in hiding. The February 2014 U.N. Commission of Inquiry implicated China for its \"rigorous policy\" of repatriating North Korea defectors back to their country, with China accused of aiding and abetting crimes against humanity. China's representative to the U.N. Human Rights Council dismissed the COI report as divorced from reality. Since the 1990s, China has been actively cooperating with North Korea to repatriate political refugees, contravening the U.N. Refugee Convention by labeling them as \"illegal economic migrants\" and deporting them. China's policy towards North Korean defectors diverges from international norms by treating them as \"illegal economic migrants\" and deporting them instead of granting asylum. Beijing's stance is based on a repatriation treaty signed in 1986 and revised in 1998. Assisting the refugees is also illegal in China, but if they reach foreign embassies or consulates, they may be allowed to leave the country. Once back in North Korea, defectors face imprisonment, torture, and even executions. Beijing allows North Korean defectors to leave the country if they reach foreign embassies or consulates. This is to avoid imprisonment, torture, and executions they face back home. Beijing's policy of repatriation is to maintain ties with North Korea and prevent destabilization in its northeastern provinces. The North Korean Human Rights Act (NKHRA) was passed in 2004, authorizing funds for human rights efforts in North Korea and linking nonhumanitarian assistance to human rights improvements. This act was signed by President George W. Bush and aimed to improve the flow of information in North Korea. The North Korean Human Rights Act (NKHRA) included provisions for U.S. nonhumanitarian assistance to be tied to human rights progress in North Korea. It mandated the appointment of a Special Envoy on Human Rights in North Korea, allowed North Koreans to seek asylum in the U.S., and required the State Department to assist with their applications. The act has been reauthorized multiple times, with adjustments made to the language. The North Korean Human Rights Act (NKHRA) was reauthorized by Congress in 2008, 2012, and 2018, with changes made each time. The 2018 reauthorization bill emphasized increasing freedom of information into North Korea and required additional reporting on efforts to resettle North Korean refugees in the United States. President Trump signed the bill into law on July 20, 2018. President Trump signed the North Korean Human Rights Act reauthorization bill into law on July 20, 2018, which included provisions for distributing media devices and instructions for radio broadcasts by the Broadcasting Board of Governors. Analysts have raised concerns about North Korea's overseas workers, citing their harsh working conditions and exploitation for generating hard currency. The State Department's Trafficking in Persons Report has consistently highlighted North Korea's overseas labor program, noting instances of forced labor among North Korean workers sent abroad. North Korean laborers sent abroad face conditions of forced labor, living and working under exploitative conditions akin to \"state-sponsored slavery.\" They work long hours, with the regime taking a significant portion of their earnings, contributing millions to billions of dollars annually to prop up the country's regime. North Korea's overseas-labor program has a long history, with the regime reportedly taking a significant portion of workers' earnings, contributing millions to billions of dollars annually to prop up the country's economy. The Trump Administration has pressured foreign governments to expel North Korean laborers. The Trump Administration has pressured foreign governments to expel North Korean laborers and passed laws to prohibit North Korean goods from entering the United States. The US provided over $1.2 billion in assistance to North Korea between 1995 and 2008. Between 1995 and 2008, the United States provided North Korea with over $1.2 billion in assistance, with 60% for food aid and 40% for energy assistance. The U.S. government stopped aid in early 2009, tying energy assistance to progress in the Six-Party Talks, which broke down in 2009. Technical assistance was also provided for nuclear disablement until April 2009. Congress enabled the President to give expanded assistance in 2008. In 2008, Congress enabled the President to provide technical assistance to North Korea for nuclear disablement. However, after North Korea's actions in 2009, Congress rejected the Obama Administration's requests for additional funds. U.S. food aid ended in early 2009 due to disagreements with Pyongyang. The U.S. ended food aid to North Korea in early 2009 due to disagreements over monitoring. North Korea has since appealed for international support. The abrogated Leap Day Agreement aimed to provide food aid for vulnerable groups. Nearly 7,700 U.S. personnel from the Korean War are still unaccounted for. North Korean officials engaged with U.S. Congress in the early 1990s. In the early 1990s, North Korean officials engaged with U.S. Congress to discuss the recovery of U.S. prisoners of war-missing in action (POW-MIAs) in North Korea. In 1996, North Korea and the United States agreed to conduct joint investigations to recover the remains of thousands of U.S. servicemen unaccounted for during the Korean War. 33 joint investigations were conducted from 1996 to 2005 for these POW-MIAs. The U.S. military and the Korean People's Army conducted joint investigations from 1996 to 2005 to recover remains of POW-MIAs from the Korean War. Despite recovering 229 sets of remains and identifying 107, operations in North Korea faced difficulties. In 2005, the DOD suspended all joint field activities due to North Korea's nuclear intentions and safety concerns for U.S. members. Between 1996 and 2005, the DOD's Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office provided North Korea with over $20 million for assistance in recovering remains of POW-MIAs from the Korean War. Talks between the United States and North Korea on the joint recovery program resumed in 2011, leading to an agreement in October 2011. However, in January 2012, DOD announced a mission to return to North Korea, but Pyongyang's rocket launch announcement disrupted the plans. In January 2012, DOD planned a mission to return to North Korea, but Pyongyang's rocket launch announcement disrupted the plans. The United States has not engaged in Joint Field Activities (JFAs) with the KPA since May 2005. In October 2014, North Korean state media warned about the potential damage to U.S. POW-MIAs remains, indicating a desire for broader bilateral negotiations with Washington. North Korea's warning about construction activities and floods likely signaled a desire for broader bilateral negotiations with the US. The Department of Defense prioritizes recovering the remains of missing US soldiers from the Korean War. Trump and Kim committed to recovering POW/MIA remains at the 2018 Singapore summit, with North Korea recently turning over 55 cases of remains to the United Nations Command. According to Trump, the repatriation of remains was a last-minute addition to the summit's agenda. In late July, North Korea handed over 55 cases of remains to the U.S. military for examination by the DPAA. North Korea's delay in transferring the remains was reportedly due to their request for payment, which the United States does not provide. The largest proportion of aid to North Korea since the mid-1990s famines has come from government contributions to emergency relief programs. Despite turbulent relations between the U.S. and DPRK governments, some U.S.-based NGOs are able to maintain good working relationships with their North Korean counterparts and continue to operate through periods of tension. NGOs play smaller roles in capacity building and people-to-people exchanges in areas such as agriculture, health, informal diplomacy, information science, and education. Some NGOs, including academic and religious organizations, operate in North Korea with a focus on humanitarian aid and promoting peaceful relations through people-to-people ties. Many NGOs working in North Korea aim to promote peaceful relations with the country, but have faced challenges due to tighter U.S. and international sanctions since 2016. The Trump Administration's restrictions on U.S. citizens traveling to North Korea have also impacted their operations.
