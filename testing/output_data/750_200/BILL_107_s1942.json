    "content": "The \"Biodiesel Promotion Act of 2002\" is also known as the Act. It provides incentives for biodiesel use as a fuel through a new section in the Internal Revenue Code. The Biodiesel Promotion Act of 2002 provides incentives for biodiesel use as a fuel through a biodiesel fuels credit determined by the biodiesel mixture credit. This credit is calculated based on the biodiesel mixture rate for each qualified biodiesel mixture and the number of gallons of the mixture used by the taxpayer in the taxable year. The Biodiesel Promotion Act of 2002 offers incentives for biodiesel use as fuel through a biodiesel fuels credit determined by the biodiesel mixture rate. The biodiesel mixture rate is 1 cent for each whole percentage point of biodiesel in the mixture, not exceeding 20 percentage points. A qualified biodiesel mixture is a blend of diesel and biodiesel sold by the taxpayer producing it. A qualified biodiesel mixture is a blend of diesel and biodiesel sold by the taxpayer producing it for use as fuel in a trade or business. Biodiesel used in the production of the mixture is eligible for incentives under the Biodiesel Promotion Act of 2002. The tax credit for biodiesel mixtures is only available for sales or use in the taxpayer's trade or business for the taxable year. Casual off-farm production is not eligible for the credit. The credit amount is coordinated with the exemption from excise tax on biodiesel. The tax credit for biodiesel mixtures is reduced to account for any benefit from the excise tax exemption. Biodiesel is defined as monoalkyl esters of long chain fatty acids from virgin vegetable oils for compression-ignition use. The term \"biodiesel\" refers to monoalkyl esters of long chain fatty acids derived from various virgin vegetable oils for use in diesel engines, including oils from corn, soybeans, sunflower seeds, cottonseeds, canola, crambe, rapeseeds, safflowers, flaxseeds, rice bran, and mustard seeds. Registration requirements must be met for biodiesel to qualify. To qualify as biodiesel, it must meet registration requirements set by the EPA under the Clean Air Act and ASTM D6751 standards. Imposition of tax on persons who separate biodiesel from qualified biodiesel mixture or use the mixture other than as fuel. Tax is imposed on individuals who separate biodiesel from a qualified mixture or use it for purposes other than fuel. The tax amount is based on the biodiesel mixture rate and the number of gallons in the mixture. All relevant laws and penalties apply to this tax as if it were imposed under a different section. Tax is imposed on individuals for biodiesel use or separation. The tax amount is based on the biodiesel mixture rate and gallon quantity. Rules similar to section 52 apply for estates and trusts. Taxpayers can elect to not apply the biodiesel fuels credit for any taxable year. Taxpayers can elect to not apply the biodiesel fuels credit for any taxable year before the 3-year period from the last date for filing the return. The election must be made as per regulations by the Secretary. This section does not apply to fuel sold after December 31, 2012. The credit is considered part of the general business credit under Section 38(b) of the Code. The biodiesel fuels credit is part of the general business credit under Section 38(b) of the Code. No carryback of the biodiesel fuels credit is allowed before January 1, 2003. The biodiesel fuels credit cannot be carried back before January 1, 2003. The biodiesel fuels credit cannot be carried back before January 1, 2003. Additionally, amendments are made to sections 40A and 6501(m) of the tax code, including the addition of a new paragraph and item in the table of sections. The amendments made to section 40A include the use of biodiesel as fuel and a reduction in motor fuel excise taxes on biodiesel mixtures, effective for taxable years starting after December 31, 2002. The tax rate for qualified biodiesel mixtures is reduced under subsection (a). Diesel fuel used in producing biodiesel mixtures also qualifies for a reduced tax rate. The tax rate for qualified biodiesel mixtures is reduced under subsection (a) by an amount determined based on the biodiesel mixture rate and the percentage of biodiesel in the mixture. The tax rate for qualified biodiesel mixtures is reduced by an amount equal to 100 percent minus the percentage of biodiesel in the mixture. Definitions and rules from section 40A apply. Conforming amendments are made to Section 4041 for biodiesel mixtures. The tax rate for qualified biodiesel mixtures is reduced by the percentage of biodiesel in the mixture, as defined in section 40A. Section 4041 of the tax code is amended to reflect this reduction. The tax code is amended to provide a payment to individuals using diesel fuel to produce qualified biodiesel mixtures, as defined in section 40A, in their trade or business. The tax code is amended to provide a payment to individuals using diesel fuel to produce qualified biodiesel mixtures, as defined in section 40A, in their trade or business. The amendments made by this subsection apply to fuel sold after December 31, 2002, and before January 1, 2013. Amounts equivalent to reductions in Highway Trust Fund receipts are transferred from the Commodity Credit Corporation funds to offset the impact of these changes. The tax code amendments provide payments to individuals using diesel fuel for biodiesel mixtures. Transfers from Commodity Credit Corporation funds offset reductions in Highway Trust Fund receipts. The Secretary of the Treasury makes estimates for transfers to reflect any errors."
