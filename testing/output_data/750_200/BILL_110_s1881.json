    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Americans with Disabilities Act Restoration Act of 2007\". Congress finds that the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 was intended to establish a clear prohibition of discrimination based on disability and provide broad coverage and effective remedies. However, Supreme Court decisions have narrowed the scope of protection, leaving out individuals Congress meant to protect. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 aimed to protect individuals with physical and mental impairments from discrimination, recognizing their right to fully participate in society. However, Supreme Court decisions have limited the Act's scope, excluding some individuals Congress intended to protect. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 was based on the definition of disability from the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which included actual and perceived limitations imposed by society. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 broadened the definition of disability to include actual and perceived limitations imposed by society, as highlighted by the Supreme Court's decision in School Board of Nassau County v. Arline. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 expanded the definition of disability to include physical or mental impairments, as Congress recognized that adverse actions are often unrelated to the limitations caused by the impairment. However, the Supreme Court's ruling in Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. has not interpreted the term \"disability\" broadly as expected. The Supreme Court has interpreted the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 narrowly, creating a demanding standard for qualifying as disabled. This has led to the exclusion of individuals who have mitigated the effects of their impairments, contrary to congressional intent. The Supreme Court has narrowed the scope of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 by excluding individuals who have mitigated their impairments. The purpose of the Act is to restore broad protection against discrimination. The curr_chunk discusses the need for strong, enforceable standards to address discrimination and restore the broad scope of protection under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, in response to Supreme Court decisions that have narrowed the class of people protected from discrimination. The curr_chunk clarifies that the protection of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 should be available for all individuals facing adverse treatment based on impairment or prejudiced attitudes. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 protects individuals facing adverse treatment due to impairment or prejudiced attitudes, societal barriers, and lack of accommodations. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ensures reasonable modifications to policies, practices, procedures, accommodations, and services. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ensures reasonable modifications to policies, practices, procedures, accommodations, and services. SEC. 3. FINDINGS IN AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT OF 1990. Section 2(a) of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 is amended to emphasize that physical and mental disabilities are natural parts of human experience and should not hinder a person's right to fully participate in society. Discrimination often prevents individuals with disabilities from participating despite their talents, skills, abilities, and desire to do so. Individuals with disabilities face discrimination and have been historically treated unequally, restricted, and marginalized in society. This amendment highlights the need to ensure their full participation without hindrance. Individuals with disabilities have faced discrimination and marginalization in society. Classifications and selection criteria excluding them should be strongly disfavored and only permitted for compelling reasons, not based on prejudice or stereotypes about disability. SEC. 4. DISABILITY DEFINED. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12102) is amended to define disability as a physical or mental impairment, a record of such impairment, or being regarded as having an impairment. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 is amended to define disability as a physical or mental impairment, without considering mitigating measures or their impact. The term 'mitigating measure' refers to any treatment, medication, device, or measure used to lessen the impact of an impairment. The term 'mitigating measure' refers to any treatment, medication, device, or measure used to lessen the impact of an impairment, including prescription medications, personal aids, assistive technology, reasonable accommodations, and auxiliary aids and services. The term 'mental impairment' refers to any mental or psychological impairment. The term 'mental impairment' includes mental or psychological disorders such as mental retardation, organic brain syndrome, emotional or mental illness, or specific learning disability. The term 'physical impairment' includes physiological disorders, cosmetic disfigurement, or anatomical loss affecting neurological, musculoskeletal, or special sense organs. The term 'record of a physical or mental impairment' refers to a history of or misclassification as having a physical or mental impairment involving various body systems such as neurological, musculoskeletal, special sense organs, respiratory, cardiovascular, reproductive, digestive, genitourinary, hemic and lymphatic, skin, and endocrine. The term 'regarded as having a physical or mental impairment' means being perceived or treated as having such an impairment, regardless of whether the individual actually has one. SEC. 5. ADVERSE ACTION. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 is amended to include discrimination against individuals using mitigating measures or experiencing side effects as discrimination under the Act. SEC. 6. DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF DISABILITY. SEC. 6 of the Americans with Disabilities Act is amended to prohibit discrimination on the basis of disability. SEC. 7 of the Americans with Disabilities Act is amended to define a qualified individual with a disability and clarify rules for discrimination allegations. Section 501 of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 is amended to ensure broad construction of the Act's provisions for comprehensive prohibition of discrimination based on disability. Regulations by the Attorney General, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and Secretary of Labor are required within 180 days of the Americans with Disabilities Act Restoration Act of 2007. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 2007 requires regulations to be issued by various agencies to implement the provisions of the Act, including sections 3 and 4. Additionally, the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board must issue supplementary guidelines. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 2007 mandates the issuance of regulations by agencies to implement the Act's provisions. The Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board must also issue supplementary guidelines to complement existing design requirements for accessibility. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 2007 requires agencies to issue regulations for implementation. Federal regulations and guidance for the Act, including defining disability, are to be respected by administrative agencies, officers, and courts in related legal actions."
