    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Safety, Accountability, and Funding Efficiency for Transportation Act of 2007\". It includes findings related to transportation. The \"Safety, Accountability, and Funding Efficiency for Transportation Act of 2007\" emphasizes the importance of conducting cost-benefit analysis before procuring architectural and engineering services for transportation projects to ensure taxpayers receive safe and cost-effective services. In the Act, definitions for \"architectural, engineering, and related services\" and \"private contract\" are provided. The curr_chunk defines terms related to government contracts for surface transportation projects, including private contract, government agency, Secretary, and surface transportation project. The curr_chunk defines a surface transportation project as eligible for assistance under title 23, United States Code, a capital project under title 49, United States Code, and any other project related to surface transportation deemed appropriate by the Secretary. The curr_chunk focuses on cost-benefit analysis in relation to surface transportation projects eligible for assistance under title 23, United States Code and title 49, United States Code. For surface transportation projects eligible for federal funds, government agencies can enter into private contracts for architectural, engineering, and related services over $100,000 if a cost-benefit analysis is conducted. The analysis must include a description of the services to be performed under the contract. The private contract under subsection (a) must include a description of services, cost estimates for procuring the services, and cost estimates for government agency performance. The private contract must detail the costs attributed to the services, including staff salaries, office facilities, equipment, and materials. It should also determine if the services would be procured more quickly through a private contract or by the government agency. The private contract should include details on costs, equipment, materials, and benefits for government agency employees. It should also estimate the cost of resuming service by the government agency. SEC. 5. DISCLOSURE OF RESULTS OF COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS. Government agencies must disclose cost-benefit analysis results for private contracts at least 30 days before finalizing the contract. This includes submitting results to the Secretary for review, providing them to interested parties, and making them publicly available, including online publication. SEC. 6. COMMENTS. Within 15 days of a government agency publishing cost-benefit analysis results for a private contract, employees and interested parties can submit written comments disputing the accuracy of the results. Agency employees can also submit competitive bids to provide the services outlined in the contract. When procuring architectural, engineering, and related services for surface transportation projects using Federal funds, government agencies must follow specific procedures outlined in title 40, United States Code. Additionally, specialty, emergency, and temporary work are addressed in separate provisions. The Secretary may waive the application of this Act for private contracts at the request of a government agency if the work is of an emergency, specialty, or intermittent nature and cannot be performed by government employees to avoid underutilization."
