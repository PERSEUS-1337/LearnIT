    "content": "The \"American Family Act of 2017\" establishes a fully refundable Child Tax Credit by eliminating the existing credit and inserting a new section 36C in the Internal Revenue Code. The \"American Family Act of 2017\" introduces a new Child Tax Credit, allowing a credit against the tax imposed for the taxable year based on the age of qualifying children. The Child Tax Credit introduced by the \"American Family Act of 2017\" allows a deduction of 120 percent of the dollar amount for qualifying children. The credit amount is reduced based on the taxpayer's modified adjusted gross income exceeding a threshold amount. The term 'modified adjusted gross income' is the adjusted gross income increased by any amount excluded from gross income under specific sections. The threshold amount varies based on filing status: $110,000 for joint returns, $75,000 for individuals not married, and $55,000 for married individuals filing separately. The term 'applicable amount' in this context refers to a calculation involving the credit allowable under subsection (a) divided by a specific product. Marital status is determined under section 7703 for the purpose of this calculation. The term 'qualifying child' in subsection (c) refers to a child under 19 years old who meets the criteria in section 152(c), excluding certain non-citizens. The term 'qualifying child' in subsection 152(c) refers to a child under 19 years old who meets specific criteria, excluding certain non-citizens. Inflation adjustments apply to the $3,000 amount in subsection (a)(1) for taxable years after 2017. The tax credit amount shall be increased annually based on the cost of living adjustment for the calendar year, rounded to the nearest multiple of $50. Identification requirements for qualifying children must be met. The tax credit amount is adjusted annually based on the cost of living and rounded to the nearest multiple of $50. Identification requirements for qualifying children must be met, including providing their name and taxpayer identification number on the tax return. No credit shall be allowed under this section if the taxpayer's identifying number was issued after the due date for filing the return. Additionally, no credit is allowable for a taxable year less than 12 months, except in cases of a taxpayer's death. Taxpayers who improperly claimed credit in a prior year will not be eligible for the credit. No credit allowed under this section for any taxable year in the disallowance period, which is 10 years after a fraud determination. Taxpayers may be denied credit under this section if there was fraud or intentional disregard of rules and regulations in prior claims. Taxpayers denied credit under this section due to deficiency procedures must provide necessary information for eligibility in subsequent years. The credit allowed for a taxable year will be reduced by any advance payments received for that year. The tax code allows for the reduction of tax liability by the amount of advance payments received for a taxable year under section 7527A. If the advance payments exceed the allowable credit, the tax imposed for that year will be increased by the excess amount. \"SEC. 7527A allows for advance payment of child tax credit, with excess payments increasing tax liability.\" The Secretary will establish a program for advance monthly payments of the credit allowed under section 36C to taxpayers, with limitations on the total amount per taxpayer during the taxable year. The program allows advance monthly payments of the credit under section 36C to taxpayers, limited to the excess of the credit amount over the estimated tax imposed by subtitle A, reduced by allowable credits. The program described allows advance monthly payments of the credit under section 36C to taxpayers, with efforts to apply the limitation of section 36C(b) to payments made under the program. Conforming amendments are made to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by removing the item related to section 24 in subchapter A of chapter 1 of subtitle A.
