NTIA received $4.35 billion for a competitive broadband grant program, including infrastructure grants, public computer capacity expansion, and grants for broadband service adoption. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act allocated $7.2 billion for broadband grant and loan programs split between NTIA/DOC and RUS/USDA. NTIA received $4.35 billion for a competitive grant program, including infrastructure grants, public computer capacity expansion, and grants for broadband service adoption. The NTIA grant program is called the Broadband Technology Opportunity Program (BTOP). $2.5 billion was allocated to RUS/USDA for broadband grants, loans, and loan/grant combinations, with a requirement that 75% of the area served must be rural. The Broadband Initiatives Program (BIP) is part of the RUS broadband grant and loan program for urban areas with populations over 50,000. Funding rounds for ARRA broadband projects were announced in 2009 and 2010, with a deadline for all funding to be awarded by September 30, 2010. $302 million of unobligated BTOP money was rescinded by P.L. 111-226 in 2010. The ARRA mandated that all funding for broadband projects be obligated and awarded by September 30, 2010. As of October 1, 2010, all ARRA broadband funds have been awarded. This report focuses on the distribution of ARRA broadband funding, with a breakdown of applications and awards data. The first funding round was announced on July 1, 2009, with projects falling into categories such as last mile and middle mile infrastructure. The ARRA mandated that all funding for broadband projects be obligated and awarded by September 30, 2010. Projects under BTOP included last mile, middle mile, public computer centers, and sustainable broadband adoption. The ARRA mandated that all funding for broadband projects be obligated and awarded by September 30, 2010. Projects under BTOP included last mile, middle mile, public computer centers, and sustainable broadband adoption. Broadband projects could focus on providing access to the general public or specific vulnerable populations, demonstrating an increase in demand for broadband services. BIP projects could target last mile remote areas, last mile nonremote areas, or middle mile infrastructure. NTIA and RUS released data on applications received during the first round on September 9, 2009. On September 9, 2009, NTIA and RUS released data on applications received during the first round application period. Over 2,200 applications requested nearly $28 billion in funding for projects in all 50 states, five territories, and the District of Columbia. The total federal funding requested was seven times the amount available in the first funding round. On January 15, 2010, NTIA and RUS announced the second and final round of ARRA broadband funding totaling $4.8 billion. On January 15, 2010, NTIA and RUS released NOFAs for the second round of ARRA broadband funding, totaling $4.8 billion. $2.6 billion was allocated for BTOP and $2.2 billion for BIP. Changes were made based on feedback from the first round, including separate NOFAs for each agency and the option for applicants to choose between BTOP and BIP. In the second round of ARRA broadband funding, NTIA/BTOP focused on middle mile projects for anchor institutions, while RUS/BIP focused on last mile projects. BTOP shifted towards Comprehensive Community Infrastructure grants, and BIP removed the \"Remote Last Mile\" category, offering a standard grant/loan combination. In the second round of ARRA broadband funding, BIP eliminated the \"Remote Last Mile\" project category and offered a standard grant/loan combination for all last mile and middle mile projects. The requirement for projects to cover \"unserved\" or \"underserved\" areas was removed, and projects were required to cover at least 75% rural areas without High Speed Access broadband service. Eligible BTOP projects only required an eligible entity and a completed application. In the second round of ARRA broadband funding, BIP introduced new grant programs like Satellite Projects, Rural Library Broadband, and Technical Assistance. NTIA received 867 applications for second round funding, totaling $11 billion in requested federal funding. In the second round of ARRA broadband funding, NTIA and RUS received a total of 1643 applications requesting nearly $11.2 billion in federal funds. This included applications for Comprehensive Community Infrastructure, Sustainable Broadband Adoption, Public Computer Centers, and middle mile projects. In the second round of ARRA broadband funding, NTIA and RUS received a total of 1643 applications requesting $22.2 billion in federal funds. This is 26% less than the first round in both the number of applications and 21% less in funding requested. RUS also received applications for Satellite Projects, Technical Assistance, and Rural Library Broadband. NTIA and RUS announced awards for 553 projects in total. As of October 1, 2010, NTIA and RUS completed all BTOP and BIP award announcements, totaling $7.5 billion in federal funding for 553 projects. This included 233 BTOP projects ($3.9 billion) and 320 BIP projects ($3.6 billion), with $6.2 billion in grant funding and $1.3 billion in loan funding. Awards data breakdown includes project categories, broadband technology deployed, and state-by-state distribution of funding. Table 2 and Table 3 provide breakdowns of awards data by project category and program. Approximately 51% of broadband infrastructure funding went to middle mile projects, including Comprehensive Community Initiative and public safety grants, while 49% was awarded to last mile projects, which includes satellite grants. Middle mile projects are mainly BTOP-funded, while last mile projects are primarily funded by BIP, which offered loan funding. Middle mile projects, mainly BTOP-funded, focus on broadband infrastructure deployment, while last mile projects, primarily funded by BIP, prioritize loan funding. 93% of loan funding was awarded to last mile projects. Fiber projects make up 56% of all funded infrastructure projects, with most projects involving a combination of fiber and wireless technologies. Projects involving multiple technologies, including fiber and wireless, account for about two-thirds of all infrastructure projects. Last mile project technologies breakdown: 47% fiber, 23% DSL, 17% wireless, 6% multiple, 3% cable modem, 1% satellite. Tables in the Appendix show state-by-state breakdown of funding for BTOP and BIP projects. Funding is associated with the service area covered by the project. The funding for broadband projects is allocated per capita by state, with NTIA and RUS overseeing the progress of the projects. Projects must be completed within two to three years. The Administration requested $23.7 million for NTIA's grant management office in FY2011. The Administration requested $23.7 million for NTIA's grant management office in FY2011. Additionally, a $20 million addition to the Salaries and Expenses account was included in the Continuing Appropriations and Surface Transportation Extension Act, 2011. NTIA awarded a $5 million contract to ASR Analytics to measure the impact of BTOP grants on broadband availability and adoption. The 112th Congress is likely to provide oversight on NTIA and RUS efforts to monitor funded projects. The FCC's National Broadband Plan recommends expanding federal funding for broadband deployment in unserved areas. Insights from funded BTOP and BIP projects could inform Congress on whether broadband grant and loan programs should be continued, modified, reduced, expanded, or eliminated. The funding patterns and trends from BTOP and BIP projects could provide insights into the success and failures of such programs, informing decisions on national broadband policy."
