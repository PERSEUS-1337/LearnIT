    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Prostate Research, Outreach, Screening, Testing, Access, and Treatment Effectiveness Act of 2010\" or the \"PROSTATE Act\". Congress finds that prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among men, with over 190,000 new diagnoses and 27,000 deaths in 2009. Approximately 2,000,000 Americans are living with prostate cancer, and younger men are also at risk. Racial and ethnic disparities exist in the prevalence of the disease. Prostate cancer in early middle age can be more aggressive, with significant racial and ethnic disparities. African-Americans have double the mortality rates compared to White population. Underserved rural populations have higher mortality rates, and telehealth can help improve access to quality care for prostate cancer. Advances in telehealth can aid in diagnosing and treating prostate cancer, with urologists playing a key role. Despite progress in research, many questions remain unanswered regarding disparities in disease etiology, access to care, and community education. The causes of prostate cancer are still unknown. Causes of prostate cancer are unknown, leading to difficulty in distinguishing between aggressive and indolent forms early on. This results in significant overtreatment, with no durable treatments once the cancer has metastasized. Up to 54% of cases may be overdiagnosed, leading to unnecessary treatment. Prostate cancer cases may be overdiagnosed, leading to significant overtreatment. More accurate tests can reduce physical, psychological, financial, and emotional trauma for patients and save billions in healthcare costs. This area of healthcare has been identified as high volume and high cost by Medicare. Prostate cancer research and health care programs should be coordinated across Federal agencies to improve accountability and encourage the translation of research into practice. This will help identify and implement best practices for effective prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of the disease. Prostate cancer coordination and education. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs, in collaboration with the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, must establish an Interagency Prostate Cancer Coordination and Education Task Force within 180 days. This task force will focus on summarizing advancements in prostate cancer research relevant to diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. The Interagency Prostate Cancer Coordination and Education Task Force will compile best practices for prostate cancer diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. They will also consider guidelines for screening men over 74 on a case-by-case basis, taking into account quality of life and family history. Additionally, they will share and coordinate information on Federal research and health care program activities. The Interagency Prostate Cancer Coordination and Education Task Force will focus on improving research and health care programs for prostate cancer. This includes identifying gaps in research, promoting translation of research into practice, and collaborating to maximize federal efforts for those affected by or diagnosed with prostate cancer. The Interagency Prostate Cancer Coordination and Education Task Force aims to develop a comprehensive strategy for collaborative research and health care programs focused on prostate cancer, including innovative approaches to address knowledge gaps in the field. The Interagency Prostate Cancer Coordination and Education Task Force aims to develop innovative approaches to study emerging scientific opportunities, outline key research questions, methodologies, and knowledge gaps, ensure consistent action as outlined by the Public Health Service Act, develop a coordinated message related to screening and treatment for prostate cancer, and update educational and beneficiary materials for Federal health programs. The Prostate Cancer Task Force will submit recommendations to the Secretary of Veterans Affairs regarding changes to research and health care programs within two years of its establishment. This includes improving the research portfolio of various federal agencies for strategic planning. The Prostate Cancer Task Force aims to ensure strategic planning for research and health care programs across federal agencies, eliminating unnecessary duplication and promoting public participation in decisions related to prostate cancer. The Prostate Cancer Task Force aims to increase public participation in decisions related to prostate cancer research and health care programs, disseminate information effectively, and expand partnerships between public and private entities for collaborative efforts. The Prostate Cancer Task Force aims to increase collaboration between public and private entities for research and health care programs, assess cost savings and efficiencies, recommend promising efforts for expansion, and identify priority action items. The Prostate Cancer Task Force, composed of representatives from various Federal agencies, aims to coordinate a uniform message on prostate cancer screening and treatment. The Prostate Cancer Task Force coordinates prostate cancer screening and treatment with representatives from various Federal agencies, appointing expert advisory panels for input and concurrence. The Prostate Cancer Task Force appoints expert advisory panels from medical, research, and delivery communities for input on prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment. Meetings are held at least twice a year, with recommendations submitted to Congress by the Secretary. The Prostate Cancer Task Force meets less than twice a year, with recommendations submitted to Congress by the Secretary. The Federal Advisory Committee Act applies to the Task Force, with an exception regarding the termination of advisory committees. The Prostate Cancer Task Force meets occasionally to make recommendations to Congress, with regulations under the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs, in coordination with other departments, will establish a program to coordinate and intensify prostate cancer research. This program will focus on developing advances in diagnostic methods, understanding the disease's causes, and improving screening tests. The program aims to improve prostate cancer research by conducting additional tests to distinguish between indolent and aggressive disease, understanding lifestyle factors contributing to higher rates of prostate cancer, and expanding basic research into molecular and cellular mechanisms. The establishment of a Prostate Cancer Advisory Board aims to improve prevention efforts, expand basic research, identify novel treatment agents, establish clinical registries, and assess appropriate imaging modalities. The Prostate Cancer Advisory Board accelerates research data sharing and new medicine delivery. The Underserved Minority Grant Program awards grants for research and integrates existing knowledge. The research outlined in subsection (a) integrates existing knowledge from comparative effectiveness research and addresses disparities in prostate cancer incidence and mortality rates among racial and ethnic minorities and men with a family history of prostate cancer, as well as barriers to care and clinical trial participation for underserved populations. The research integrates existing knowledge and addresses disparities in prostate cancer incidence among minorities and men with a family history. Outreach and education efforts are needed to raise awareness in these communities for appropriate access to imaging modalities. SEC. 5. TELEHEALTH AND RURAL ACCESS PILOT PROJECT. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will establish telehealth pilot projects to analyze clinical outcomes and cost effectiveness in underserved areas, including African-Americans, Latin-Americans, American Indians, and rural populations. Projects aim to improve specialist care coordination and utilize tumor boards for patient counseling. Eligible entities will be selected by the Secretary. The Secretary will select eligible entities in underserved areas, prioritizing African-Americans, Latin-Americans, and rural populations for telehealth pilot projects. Evaluation of the projects will be conducted to improve specialist care coordination and utilize tumor boards for patient counseling. The Secretary will evaluate the effective delivery of care for prostate cancer in underserved areas through telehealth services, improving nonmedical providers' capacity to offer health services. The Secretary will assess the provision of health services for prostate cancer in underserved areas, including innovative medical home models and telehealth services with tumor boards for better patient counseling. The Secretary will assess the provision of health services for prostate cancer in underserved areas, including the use of tumor boards for patient counseling. A report on the outcomes of pilot projects, cost savings, efficiencies, and recommendations for expanding telehealth services will be submitted to Congress within 12 months. SEC. 6. EDUCATION AND AWARENESS. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will develop a national education campaign for prostate cancer, including written materials and public service announcements to encourage men to seek screening. The campaign will address racial disparities and ensure availability of materials in communities with higher incidence rates. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will provide materials and public service announcements to address racial disparities in prostate cancer incidence and mortality rates, especially in communities with higher rates and men with a family history of the disease. Grants will be awarded to nonprofit entities for testing outreach and education strategies. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2011 through 2015 is provided to carry out the Act."
