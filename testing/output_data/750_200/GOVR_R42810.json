    "content": "The Honoring America's Veterans and Caring for Camp Lejeune Families Act of 2012 (H.R. 1627, P.L. 112-154) is an omnibus bill with provisions impacting various veterans programs. It reflects a compromise agreement by House and Senate Committees on Veterans Affairs on multiple bills reported during the 112th Congress. This report provides information on the provisions of P.L. 112-154 by program, benefit, or topic. The report details provisions of P.L. 112-154 by program or benefit, focusing on the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) healthcare system for veterans based on eligibility factors like veteran status, disabilities, income, and POW status. The Veterans' Health Care, Training, and Small Business Loan Act of 1981 (P.L. 97-72) provided special authority for the VA to treat veterans for disorders related to Agent Orange and ionizing radiation exposure, despite lack of definitive scientific evidence according to the Institutes of Medicine (IOM). In 1993, Congress passed P.L. 103-210 to authorize the VA to provide health care for Persian Gulf War veterans possibly affected by exposure to toxic substances. Camp Lejeune, North Carolina had contaminated water-supply systems in the early 1980s. P.L. 112-154 addressed the chemical exposure at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina by providing VA health care services eligibility for certain veterans stationed there from 1957 to 1987 due to contaminated water. Family members stationed at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina from 1957 to 1987 are eligible for medical care for specific illnesses due to contaminated well water, although there is insufficient evidence to directly link these illnesses to military service during that period. The VA will cover medical expenses for these conditions. The VA is the final payer for eligible family members' health insurance. The State Veterans' Home program is a federal-state partnership for nursing home care facilities, with the VA providing grants and per diem payments. Basic eligibility criteria for nursing home care is set by the VA, while state law governs management and admission criteria for State Veterans' Homes. State laws govern the management and admission criteria for State Veterans' Homes, allowing each home to decide on admitting veterans. The VA pays the full cost of care for veterans with a 70% or more service-connected disability or whose need for nursing home care is related to a service-connected condition if they are in a VA facility or contracted private nursing home. The Veterans Benefits, Health Care, and Information Technology Act of 2006 (P.L. 109-461) equalized the cost of nursing home care for veterans with a 70% service-connected disability, regardless of the care setting. It also allowed for higher per diem rates for State Veterans Homes providing care to these veterans. The Veterans Benefits, Health Care, and Information Technology Act of 2006 (P.L. 109-461) equalized nursing home care costs for veterans with a 70% service-connected disability. It allowed higher per diem rates for State Veterans Homes caring for these veterans, but they were not eligible for funding from other federal sources. Some state veterans' nursing homes reported receiving smaller reimbursements that did not cover the actual cost of care. P.L. 112-154 requires the VA to contract with SVHs to provide nursing home care for veterans with service-connected conditions. The VA is required to contract with State Veterans Homes (SVHs) to provide nursing home care for veterans with service-connected conditions or a disability rating of 70% or higher. The reimbursement methodology will be developed in consultation with SVHs. Additionally, SVHs can request a contract that replicates the previous reimbursement methodology. In June 2011, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported about 300 sexual assault incidents to the VA police from 2007 to 2010. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found 300 sexual assault incidents reported to the VA police from 2007 to 2010, including rape, inappropriate touching, and forced medical examinations. Many incidents were not reported to VA leadership or the VA Office of the Inspector General due to a lack of centralized reporting system. VA is required to establish a comprehensive policy on reporting and tracking sexual assault. The VA is required to establish a comprehensive policy on reporting and tracking sexual assault incidents at VA medical facilities, as mandated by Section 106 of P.L. 112-154. This policy should consider the impact on veterans' mental health and substance abuse treatments, and the VA's ability to refer veterans to these services. An interim report on the progress of developing this policy must be submitted to Congress. The VA is required to establish a comprehensive policy on reporting and tracking sexual assault incidents at VA medical facilities. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has become a \"signature wound\" of Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) due to increased blast injuries from improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and other explosives. The number of blast injuries from explosives has increased in OEF/OIF, leading to more cases of TBI. Advances in protective equipment and combat medicine have reduced fatalities. Health care professionals are better at diagnosing TBI now. The total number of veterans with TBI is unknown due to difficulties in identification and some veterans not accessing VA healthcare services. The number of veterans with Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is unknown due to difficulties in identification and some not accessing VA healthcare services. Current law requires the VA to provide comprehensive rehabilitative care to veterans with TBI to maximize their independence. The VA is mandated to provide rehabilitative care to veterans with TBI to enhance their independence and mental health. Telemedicine is utilized for medical purposes when distance separates participants. Telehealth, a broader concept than telemedicine, involves the use of electronic communication and information technologies for medical purposes when distance separates participants. It supports long-distance clinical health care, patient education, and health administration beyond traditional medical encounters. Telemental health involves providing behavioral health services using communication technology, including clinical assessment, psychotherapy, and psychiatry, to patients remotely. It describes the use of various technologies by clinicians to deliver mental health care to patients who are miles away. In the Department of Defense, telemental health is known as telebehavioral health. The VA has been a leader in telehealth since 1977, using it to provide care to veterans in rural areas. Telehealth offers benefits as an alternative to traditional care delivery. Telehealth provides care to veterans in rural areas where travel to VA hospitals is difficult. Research shows it offers benefits as an alternative to in-person treatment and can be cost-effective. VA is required to carry out a teleconsultation program for remote mental health and TBI assessments in facilities lacking resources. Training opportunities in telemedicine are also mandated for medical residents in VA facilities utilizing telemedicine. The VA provides training in telemedicine to medical residents in VA facilities. Veterans with service-connected conditions rated at 50% or more disabled do not pay copayments for treatment, including for nonservice-connected conditions. No copayments are charged for certain outpatient services in VA health care. Veterans with no service-connected conditions or receiving care for nonservice-connected conditions may be required to pay copayments for outpatient services, with $15 for primary care visits and $50 for specialty care visits. Certain outpatient services are exempt from copayments, including VA health fairs, screenings, counseling, and hospice care. The Department of Veterans Affairs may waive copayments for telehealth consultations. The VA is authorized to provide service dogs to hearing or mobility-impaired veterans. The VA is authorized to provide service dogs to veterans with mental illnesses, including PTSD, as part of various legislative acts. The VA is authorized to provide service dogs to veterans with physical or mental injuries, including PTSD, as part of legislative acts. Section 109 of P.L. 112-154 allows accredited service dogs access to VA facilities. The Office of Rural Health (ORH) was established in 2006 to address disparities in services for rural veterans. The VA established the Office of Rural Health (ORH) in 2006 to reduce disparities in services for rural veterans. In FY2009, the VA opened three Veterans Rural Health Resource Centers (VRHRCs) to develop special practices and products for facilities nationwide. These Centers serve as field-based clinical laboratories testing new outreach and care models. The Western Center in Salt Lake City, UT is a VRHRC that serves as a field-based clinical laboratory experimenting with new outreach and care models. Section 110 of P.L. 112-154 requires VRHRCs to improve understanding of challenges faced by rural veterans, identify disparities in healthcare availability, formulate programs to enhance healthcare delivery, and develop special practices for rural veterans. The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (P.L. 99-272) authorized the VHA to bill veterans and health insurers for nonservice-connected care to help cover medical service costs. It also introduced means testing for veterans seeking care for nonservice-connected conditions. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-33) allowed the VHA to retain third-party payments in the VA's Medical Care Collections Fund (MCCF) for providing medical services to veterans without fiscal year limitations. It also granted the VA the authority to change its basis of billing insurers to increase third-party collections. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-33) allowed the VA to provide medical services for veterans without fiscal year limitations and change its billing basis to \"reasonable charges\" to increase third-party collections. In FY2004, the Administration requested consolidating medical collections accounts into one MCCF as recommended in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2004. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2004 recommended that collections from various funds be deposited into the MCCF for medical services for veterans. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2005 provided the VA with permanent authority to deposit funds from these accounts into the MCCF, which are available until expended. The MCCF receives funds for medical services for veterans, which can be spent in any fiscal year and are available until expended. The VA is required to develop a plan to identify and collect billable third-party revenue for the MCCF, including effective processes, policies, procedures, and employee training. The VA is required to ensure billing and collection using current authorities, train employees responsible for billing or collection, set fee revenue goals, and implement an effective monitoring system. Additionally, the VA is conducting a three-year initiative to assess treating Vet Centers as VA facilities for beneficiary travel reimbursement. The VA is conducting a three-year initiative to assess treating Vet Centers as VA facilities for beneficiary travel reimbursement. This reimbursement authority will be valid for three years and limited to veterans in highly rural areas traveling to and from their nearest Vet Centers. The VA Secretary must issue a report to Congress within 180 days of enactment on the beneficiaries and analysis of the initiative. The VA provides reimbursement for mileage, special mode transport, and common carrier transport for veterans traveling to VA or VA authorized health care. Pre-authorization is required for ambulance and common carrier expenses, except in medical emergencies. Previous payment authorities resulted in higher rates for ambulance services than allowed by Medicare, prompting the VA to address the situation. The VA proposed using local Medicare ambulance rates to reimburse providers, resulting in cost savings. The Vow to Hire Heroes Act of 2011 allowed VA to pay the lesser of the actual amount charged or the Medicare rate for ambulance services, unless a contract is in place. The Vow to Hire Heroes Act of 2011 allowed VA to pay the lesser of the actual amount charged by the ambulance provider or the applicable Medicare rate for ambulance services, unless VA has a contract in place. Section 704 of P.L. 112-154 makes a technical correction to authorize VA to reimburse ambulance providers for authorized services. Section 704 of P.L. 112-154 authorizes VA to reimburse ambulance providers for authorized transportation at the lesser of the actual charge or the local Medicare rate when no contract is in place. The new reimbursement method applies to all situations except for unauthorized non-VA emergency care. The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 established means testing for veterans seeking care for nonservice-connected conditions. Veterans report household income to determine eligibility for VA health care based on income and copayments. The VA uses household income to determine eligibility for health care and copayments. P.L. 112-154 updates the Specially Adapted Housing Program for veterans with service-connected disabilities. The Specially Adapted Housing Program offers grants for veterans with mobility impairments and blindness or loss of hand use. The grants can also be used to adapt a family member's home. The dollar limit for mobility impairment grants is higher, and both types are available for severe burn injuries. Section 202 of P.L. 112-154 expands qualifying disabilities for mobility impairment grants. Section 202 of P.L. 112-154 expands qualifying disabilities for mobility impairment grants to cover veterans or servicemembers who have lost use of one or more lower extremities, affecting balance and propulsion, requiring aids for ambulating. Veterans or servicemembers must be approved for assistance under this provision by the end of FY2013. Section 203 of P.L. 112-154 changes the measure of blindness for grants from 5/200 visual acuity to 20/200 vision in the better eye. Section 204 of P.L. 112-154 increases the maximum assistance for grants to $63,780 for \u00a72101(a) and $12,756 for \u00a72101(b). The new law aligns the blindness measure to 20/200 vision in the better eye with corrective lens. The new law under P.L. 112-154 increases the maximum assistance for grants to $63,780 for \u00a72101(a) and $12,756 for \u00a72101(b. The VA Secretary will adjust the statutory award limits annually based on a cost-of-construction index. Veterans can use grants to modify family members' homes temporarily, known as Temporary Residence Adaptation (TRA). The Temporary Residence Adaptation (TRA) grant allows veterans to modify family members' homes temporarily. The maximum TRA grants have been increased under P.L. 112-154, with the new limits being $28,000 for \u00a72101(a) and $5,000 for \u00a72101(b). These limits will be adjusted annually based on a cost-of-construction index. The TRA grants for veterans' home modifications have been increased under P.L. 112-154, with annual adjustments based on a cost-of-construction index. The authority for TRA grants has been extended until December 31, 2022, and exceptions to grant limits are provided for homes substantially damaged in disasters. The VA Loan Guaranty Program under P.L. 112-154 provides assistance for disabled veterans or servicemembers whose previously-adapted homes are substantially damaged in disasters. Assistance includes funds to acquire another suitable home, with a maximum benefit set at the cost to repair or replace the property exceeding insurance coverage or statutory grant maximums. The VA Loan Guaranty Program provides assistance for disabled veterans or servicemembers whose homes are damaged in disasters. The program helps them acquire another suitable home by covering costs exceeding insurance coverage or statutory grant maximums. The VA Loan Guaranty Program assists veterans in acquiring homes by covering costs exceeding insurance coverage or grant maximums. Veterans must occupy the property as their home to be eligible for the loan guaranty, with fees based on factors like down payment amount and military service history. Fees may be waived for certain veterans and surviving spouses. Section 206 of P.L. 112-154 expands loan guaranty eligibility to include surviving spouses of veterans who die while receiving compensation for a service-connected disability rated totally disabling. Spouses must meet specific duration requirements for the disability rating. The loan guaranty eligibility for surviving spouses of veterans who die while receiving compensation for a service-connected disability rated totally disabling has specific duration requirements. Surviving spouses who qualify based on this provision will not need to pay the guaranteed loan fee. P.L. 112-154 allows dependent children of veterans called away for active duty to satisfy the occupancy requirement for a loan guaranty. It also makes permanent the programs for guaranteeing adjustable rate and hybrid adjustable rate mortgages. The VA began guaranteeing adjustable rate mortgages under P.L. 102-547 in 1992. P.L. 112-154 modified the law regarding loan guaranty fee waivers for veterans with service-connected disabilities. The new law allows disability compensation eligibility based on pre-discharge examination or review of existing medical evidence to avoid long waits for examinations. The change in Section 702 of P.L. 112-154 aims to expedite disability compensation eligibility by using existing medical records instead of waiting for examinations. It also addresses guaranteed loan fees, maximum guaranty amounts, and loan sales securities for veterans. The VA increased the maximum loan guaranty amount for housing in high-cost areas, allowing for loans up to 115% of the area median home price or $625,500. This change was implemented from October 1, 2016 to October 1, 2017. The loan limit can be as high as 115% of the area median home price, not exceeding 150% of the conforming loan limit ($625,500). The maximum guaranty amount was temporarily increased through P.L. 110-389 until 2011 and then through P.L. 112-154 until 2014. In high-cost areas, the VA can guarantee loans up to 175% of $625,500, or $1,094,625. The VA can guarantee loans up to 175% of $625,500, or $1,094,625 in high-cost areas. The VA's authority to bundle and sell vendee loans has been extended through December 31, 2016. Prior to P.L. 112-154, the VA used Enhanced Use Lease (EUL) process to lease unused property for VA mission-related purposes, charging fair consideration including in-kind payments. EULs were used for housing homeless veterans and other purposes. The VA used Enhanced Use Lease (EUL) process for various purposes, including housing homeless veterans and providing facilities like child development centers, parking, golf courses, senior housing, assisted living, and nursing homes. P.L. 112-154 now limits EUL properties to be used only for \"supportive housing\" for homeless or at-risk veterans and their families. The VA's Enhanced Use Lease (EUL) process is now limited to \"supportive housing\" for homeless or at-risk veterans and their families. This includes various types of housing such as transitional, permanent, and single room occupancy (SRO) housing, congregate living, independent living, or assisted living. Leases entered into before January 1, 2012, are subject to previous laws, and any consideration received by the VA for an EUL must be in cash at fair value. The VA is required to release a yearly report on consideration received for EULs. The VA's Enhanced Use Lease (EUL) process is now limited to \"supportive housing\" for homeless or at-risk veterans and their families. Consideration for EULs must be in cash at fair value, and the VA is required to release a yearly report on consideration received. The Grant and Per Diem program authorizes the VA to make grants for transitional housing for homeless veterans. The Grant and Per Diem program provides capital grants for facilities to be used as service centers or transitional housing for homeless veterans. Grantees are reimbursed for providing housing and supportive services at a per diem rate of $38.90 per day. Grants can also be used for construction of service centers and transitional housing. Section 301 of P.L. 112-154 allows VA Grant and Per Diem funding to be used for construction of service centers and transitional housing, in addition to acquisition and rehabilitation of existing property. Grantees can also utilize Low Income Housing Tax Credits in conjunction with the funding. The law specifies that grantees may receive funds from other sources as long as the project is operated by a private nonprofit organization, which now includes for-profit limited partnerships or limited liability companies with a nonprofit general partner or manager. The definition of private nonprofit organization now includes for-profit limited partnerships or limited liability companies with a nonprofit general partner or manager. The VA Grant and Per Diem program is authorized at $250 million for FY2013 and $150 million for subsequent fiscal years, targeting homeless veterans with special needs. In 2001, Congress created a Grant and Per Diem program to target homeless veterans with special needs. The program now includes male veterans with dependent children, eliminates the requirement for grantees to already be providers, allows funds to be used for services to dependents, and extends authorization level to $5 million per fiscal year through FY2013. The Health Care for Homeless Veterans program provides outreach, medical care, and referrals for homeless veterans, including those with mental illnesses. The HUD-VASH program is a collaboration between the VA and HUD to support homeless veterans. The amendment to P.L. 112-154 allows homeless veterans, regardless of mental illness, to be eligible for the HCHV program. HUD-VASH is a joint program between the VA and HUD where PHAs distribute Section 8 vouchers for homeless veterans, with VA medical centers providing case management. P.L. 112-154 also requires the VA to consider contracts with other entities to assist veterans in finding housing. The VA may enter contracts with other entities to help veterans find housing and connect them with services. This can occur when there is a shortage of affordable housing, a veteran needs more assistance than the VA can provide, or they do not live near a VA facility. Section 305 of P.L. 112-154 extends the authorization for programs that serve homeless veterans, including the Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program (HVRP) and Supportive Services for Veteran Families (SSVF). HVRP helps homeless veterans find employment, while SSVF assists very low-income veterans and their families in transitioning from homelessness to housing. The SSVF program assists very low-income veterans transitioning from homelessness to housing. P.L. 112-154 authorizes $300 million for the program in FY2013, up from $100 million in FY2012. The Survivors' and Dependents' Educational Assistance Program (DEA) provides educational benefits to dependents of servicemembers disabled or deceased due to military service. DEA participants receive 45 months of benefits. Section 401 of P.L. 112-154 allows DEA-eligible individuals additional benefits. The Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008 (Post-9/11 GI Bill) provides educational assistance to eligible servicemembers and veterans who served after September 10, 2001, and their eligible family members. DEA participants can receive up to 81 months of entitlement by combining benefit programs. The Post-9/11 GI Bill and MGIB-AD provide educational assistance to eligible servicemembers and veterans. Reports on these programs are required annually by Congress. The VA Secretary must report annually to Congress on the Post-9/11 GI Bill and the DEA, starting from November 13, 2013, through January 1, 2021. The Defense report should include information on the impact of GI Bill benefits on recruitment and retention in the Armed Forces, cost coverage for education, necessity for future recruitment, active duty eligibility requirements, and recommendations for changes. The VA report should cover the extent of Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits. The VA report must include information on the usage of Post-9/11 GI Bill and DEA benefits, program expenditures, student outcomes, and recommendations for administrative and legislative changes. Section 402 repeals the biennial reporting requirement for the Secretary of Defense and the VA Secretary on the MGIB-AD. Claimants appealing a benefits decision can submit additional evidence to support their claim, which the Board of Veterans' Appeals must send to the original agency. Under Section 501 of P.L. 112-154, claimants appealing benefits can submit additional evidence to support their claim. The Board of Veterans' Appeals no longer needs to send this evidence to the original agency for initial review, unless the claimant requests it. This change aims to expedite the appeal process by eliminating delays caused by waiting for the local VA office to review newly submitted evidence. The VA office's initial review of newly submitted evidence will be waived unless requested by the claimant, with the BVA conducting the review instead. This provision takes effect 180 days after the law's enactment on August 6, 2012. Prior to P.L. 112-154, the VA lacked authority to allow court-appointed representatives or caregivers to sign applications on behalf of claimants for benefits adjudication. Section 502 of P.L. 112-154 now grants the VA specific authority for this purpose. Section 502 of P.L. 112-154 grants the VA authority to allow court-appointed representatives, caregivers, or attorneys to sign benefit claim applications on behalf of claimants. Prior to this, the VA was obligated to make reasonable efforts to gather private medical records identified by the claimant. Section 505 of P.L. 112-154 allows the VA to waive this duty in certain cases. Section 505 of P.L. 112-154 permits the VA to waive its duty to assist requirement when there is sufficient evidence for maximum benefit award. It encourages claimants to submit relevant private medical records to prevent unnecessary time and resource expenditure. The Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 clarifies that surviving spouses are entitled to benefits if a veteran dies while receiving compensation. Additionally, if a pending claim is approved after the veteran's death, the spouse can receive those benefits for the month of the veteran's death. The Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 requires the VA to notify claimants of evidence needed for their claims. The written notice includes information on disability compensation and how ratings are determined. This notice is sent to veterans even if they have received the same information before. Section 504 of P.L. 112-154 removes certain requirements for VCAA notices, allowing for more efficient notification methods and waiving notification requirements in certain cases. The VA has developed the Fully Developed Claim (FDC) process to expedite disability claims, allowing for efficient notification methods and waiving notification requirements in certain cases. The effective date of a claim is typically when the VA receives the application, and claims generally expire after one year. The Fully Developed Claim (FDC) process expedites disability claims by allowing veterans to establish an effective date for their claim up to one year before the VA receives the application. This gives veterans time to gather evidence before submitting their claim. The Fully Developed Claim (FDC) process allows veterans to establish an effective date for their claim while gathering evidence before submission. A change in effective date for original FDC disability claims is available for three years. Joint application forms for VA survivor benefits and Social Security are required, and filing with either agency constitutes an application with both. Section 503 of P.L. 112-154 permits, rather than requires, the Secretary of the VA and the Social Security Commissioner to use joint application forms. The Improved Disability Pension program provides a monthly cash benefit to low-income elderly or totally disabled veterans with active military service during a period of war. Section 503 of P.L. 112-154 allows the Secretary of the VA and the Social Security Commissioner to develop joint application forms for survivor benefits with both agencies. Any document filed with either agency indicating an intent to apply for survivor benefits is considered an application with both agencies. The Improved Disability Pension program increases the maximum annual benefit for married couples who are both veterans and require regular aid and attendance. The maximum annual benefit is raised from $30,480 to $32,433. Income received by the veteran or surviving spouse reduces the maximum cash benefit amount for both the Improved Disability Pension and the Improved Death Pension. Reimbursements for casualties are excluded when calculating income for benefit purposes. The exclusion for calculating income for Death Pension benefits includes reimbursements for casualty losses and expenses for replacement or repair of equipment, vehicles, items, money, or property. Disabled veterans and servicemembers may qualify for VA assistance to purchase automobiles or adaptive equipment. The VA Secretary can provide assistance to a veteran for the purchase of a second automobile if the first one was destroyed due to a disaster and the veteran is not compensated by insurance. The VA's Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment (VR&E) Program offers employment services for veterans with disabilities. It also provides independent living services for those unable to work. Section 701 of P.L. 112-154 expands VR&E provisions for veterans affected by disasters. Veterans in the program may receive a subsistence allowance during the program and for two months. Section 701 of P.L. 112-154 extends the subsistence allowance for veterans in the VR&E program by an additional two months for those displaced by disasters. It also waives the annual participation limit for veterans affected by disasters. Section 601 of P.L. 112-154 increases restrictions on demonstrations at veterans' funerals, amending 38 U.S.C. \u00a72413 to impose time, place, and manner restrictions. Section 601 of P.L. 112-154 imposes time, place, and manner restrictions on demonstrations at funerals of servicemembers and veterans, including a minimum distance requirement and a specific time frame before and after the funeral. Section 601 of P.L. 112-154 imposes time, place, and manner restrictions on demonstrations at funerals of servicemembers and veterans, including a minimum distance requirement and a specific time frame before and after the funeral. The minimum distance for demonstrations has been increased, and statutory damages for violations range from $25,000 to $50,000. Section 602 of the same act prohibits the reservation of gravesites at Arlington National Cemetery before an individual's death, with the President having the authority to waive this prohibition. The President has the authority to set aside areas in Arlington National Cemetery to honor veterans and servicemembers missing in action. Monuments or markers can be established, with requirements outlined in P.L. 112-154. A monument in memory of individuals or military events cannot be established until 25 years after their last day of service. A monument in memory of individuals or military events cannot be established until 25 years after their last day of service. The Secretary of the Army can waive the 25-year requirement after public and congressional notification. Additionally, a monument sponsored by a nongovernmental entity in Arlington National Cemetery requires an independent study of other locations and consultation with relevant committees. The Secretary of the Army consults with relevant committees for monument placement in Arlington National Cemetery. The VA provides certificates to eligible survivors of deceased veterans upon request. The Presidential Memorial Certificate is provided to eligible survivors of deceased veterans who were discharged under honorable conditions. Eligible survivors can include next of kin, relatives, friends, or authorized representatives. Section 603 of P.L. 112-154 expands eligibility to include persons who die in active military, naval, or air service. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act offers protections for servicemembers whose military service may impact their ability. The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) provides protections for servicemembers who may face financial difficulties due to their military service. It does not forgive all debts or eliminate contractual obligations, but it suspends civil claims and protects against default judgments. The SCRA also includes provisions to prevent eviction of military members and their dependents from rental or mortgaged property. The SCRA provides various protections for military members, including a 6% cap on interest, eviction prevention, insurance safeguards, and tax relief. Amendments have been made since its enactment in 2003, with ongoing proposed changes in Congress. The SCRA has been amended multiple times since 2003, with proposed changes still being introduced in Congress. Most recently, Section 710 of P.L. 112-154 extended protections related to mortgages and foreclosures until December 31, 2014. Specifically, this section covers servicemembers who entered into property transactions subject to mortgages, trust deeds, or other security loans before active military service. If the servicemember is unable to make payments due to military service, the provision prevents the vendor from exercising any rights under the contract. The SCRA, as amended, protects servicemembers from property foreclosure or seizure during military service and for one year after, unless under a court order or agreement. Section 701 of the SCRA requires a report to Congress on protections within 540 days of enactment. Section 703 of P.L. 112-154 mandates a VA report within 180 days on evaluating VBA employees processing benefit claims. The plan is to evaluate and provide training for employees at the Veterans Benefits Administration who process disability compensation and pension benefit claims. Special authority was granted to the VA to conduct competitions for small businesses owned by service-disabled and other veterans. The VA was granted special authority under the Information Technology Act of 2006 to conduct competitions for small businesses owned by service-disabled and other veterans. Eligibility for contracting preferences is limited to firms listed in a VA database, and misrepresentation of status can lead to debarment from government contracting. Section 502 of P.L. 112-154 allows for debarment from VA contracting for firms that misrepresent their status as veteran-owned or service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses. Debarments are imposed as punishment and are known as statutory debarments. Section 706 clarifies that debarment is only for cases of willful misrepresentation. Section 706 of P.L. 112-154 amends Section 502 to clarify that debarment is to be imposed only in cases where status has been \"willfully and intentionally\" misrepresented, with a minimum debarment period of five years. It also establishes time frames for debarment actions and defines the criteria for \"principals\" involved. Section 706 of P.L. 112-154 sets time frames for debarment actions and includes the debarment of \"principals\" for a minimum of five years. It requires the VA to start a debarment action within 30 days of determining willful misrepresentation and complete it within 90 days. The VA Secretary must report on conferences attended by 50 or more people costing $20,000 or more. Federal contractors with contracts over $100,000 must report annually to the Department of Labor. Every federal contractor and subcontractor with a contract value of $100,000 or more must report annually to the Department of Labor (DOL) on total employment, new employees, and the number of qualified veterans. P.L. 112-154 requires the DOL Secretary to establish a website for public disclosure of this information. Additionally, P.L. 112-154 directs the VA Secretary to establish the VetStar program to recognize businesses' contributions to veterans' employment."
