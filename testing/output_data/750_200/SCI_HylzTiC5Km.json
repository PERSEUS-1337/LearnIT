Autoregressive image models have limitations in generating large images with global semantic coherence and exactness of detail. SPN addresses the challenge by generating images as a sequence of image slices. The Subscale Pixel Network (SPN) is a conditional decoder architecture that generates images as a sequence of slices, capturing spatial dependencies efficiently. It uses multidimensional upscaling to grow images in size and depth, achieving state-of-the-art results in image generation tasks. The Subscale Pixel Network (SPN) is a conditional decoder architecture that generates high fidelity large scale samples on the basis of datasets. Autoregressive models have shown superior scores on held-out data in various domains such as text, audio, images, and videos. These models excel in producing targets with high fidelity and generalizing well on unseen data. Autoregressive models have achieved state-of-the-art fidelity in various domains, except for large-scale image generation where long-range structure and semantic coherence are lacking. The relationship between MLE scores and sample fidelity poses challenges for high-fidelity image generation. Unlike adversarial methods, MLE improves held-out scores but may not always enhance visual fidelity. Autoregressive models, like MLE, aim to improve visual fidelity in image generation by supporting the entire empirical distribution. However, the high dimensionality of large images poses challenges in learning dependencies among positions and surrounding contexts. Autoregressive models aim to improve visual fidelity in image generation by learning dependencies among positions and surrounding contexts. This requires large amounts of memory and computation for representations at each position. Multidimensional upscaling is used to map subimages to target resolutions, generating unconditional samples at full 8-bit depth. The aim is to learn the full distribution over 8-bit RGB images up to 256 \u00d7 256 size with high fidelity. Focus is on visually salient subsets of the distribution, including sub-images of smaller size and a few most salient bits. The aim is to learn the full distribution over 8-bit RGB images up to 256 \u00d7 256 size with high fidelity, focusing on visually salient subsets like sub-images of smaller size and a few most salient bits. Multidimensional Upscaling is used to map between subsets by upscaling images in size or depth, training three networks on small size, low depth image slices subsampled. The Subscale Pixel Network (SPN) architecture is developed to train decoders for upscaling small size, low depth image slices to the original resolution of 128 \u00d7 128 8-bit RGB images. Three networks are trained: a decoder for small size images, a size-upscaling decoder, and a depth-upscaling decoder. The SPN addresses difficulties in training the decoders and divides images into subsets for processing. The Subscale Pixel Network (SPN) architecture addresses difficulties in training decoders for upscaling small size image slices. It divides images into sub-images and generates them one slice at a time, capturing a form of size upscaling. SPN consists of a conditioning network and a decoder that predicts a target slice based on context embedding. The Subscale Pixel Network (SPN) consists of a decoder that predicts target image slices based on context embedding. It can act as an implicit or explicit size upscaling network, with shared weights for image slices. The SPN's performance is extensively evaluated on image generation benchmarks like CelebAHQ-256 and ImageNet up to 256 in size. Depth upscaling methods are compared quantitatively and from a fidelity perspective on CelebAHQ-256 and ImageNet benchmarks up to 256 in size. State-of-the-art results are achieved on CelebAHQ-256 and ImageNet-64, with MLE baselines established for ImageNet-128 and ImageNet-256. The benefits of multidimensional upscaling and the Subscale Pixel Network (SPN) are highlighted, showing similar visual fidelity to GANs in CelebAHQ-256 samples. The Subscale Pixel Network (SPN) demonstrates similar visual fidelity to GANs in CelebAHQ-256 samples and produces successful samples on unconditional ImageNet-128. The SPN and multidimensional upscaling have a striking impact on sample quality, setting a fidelity baseline for future methods. The Subscale Pixel Network (SPN) achieves high visual fidelity in image generation by using a deep neural network to generate color images in a specific order. This ordering method allows for compact encoding of long-range dependencies in large images. The ordering method in the Subscale Pixel Network (SPN) divides large images into equally sized slices, enabling compact encoding of long-range dependencies. It also induces a spatial structure and allows for consistent application of the same decoder to all slices. This ordering is the two-dimensional analogue of the one-dimensional subscale. The Subscale Pixel Network (SPN) divides large images into smaller slices, enabling self-attention without local contexts. The ordering method creates a two-dimensional structure with a scaling factor S, generating interleaved slices specified by row and column offsets. The Subscale Pixel Network (SPN) divides large images into interleaved slices specified by row and column offsets. The subscale ordering captures size upscaling implicitly and can also perform size upscaling explicitly by training a single slice decoder on subimages. The Subscale Pixel Network (SPN) can generate images by training a single slice decoder on subimages and using a subscale ordering. This ordering can act as a full image model and a size upscaling model. The Parallel Multi-Scale BID12 ordering involves doubling pixels in an image at every stage using distinct neural networks in parallel. Multidimensional upscaling expands not only the height and width but also the channel depth of an image in stages. The depth upscaling process involves generating bits of an image in stages using distinct neural networks. We do not share weights among the networks at different stages. Lower significance bits are only generated after more significant bits have been generated in a previous stage. Depth upscaling involves generating image bits in stages using separate neural networks without weight sharing. The goal is to focus on visually salient image parts unaffected by less predictable elements. This method is related to Grayscale PixelCNN, which models 4-bit greyscale images from colored images. Existing AR approaches require significant computation and memory. Existing AR approaches require significant computation and memory, especially for large images. The quadratic memory requirements of self-attention become limiting for images larger than 32 \u00d7 32 and impractical for 256 \u00d7 256 color images. Mitigating these requirements often sacrifices global context in favor of local neighborhoods. The Subscale Pixel Network (SPN) addresses challenges in modeling large images by incorporating subscale ordering and choosing a scaling factor for image slices. Global context is often sacrificed for local neighborhoods in existing approaches due to computational limitations. The Subscale Pixel Network (SPN) uses a scaling factor to obtain image slices of a consistent size, ensuring constant memory and computation requirements as image size changes. The SPN architecture consists of an embedding part for slices at preceding metapositions to condition the decoder for the current slice being generated. The Subscale Pixel Network (SPN) utilizes an embedding part with a convolutional neural network for slices at preceding metapositions to condition the decoder for the current slice being generated. The slices are ordered along the channel dimension using empty padding slices to maintain relative meta-positions, achieving equivariance. The embedding architecture in the Subscale Pixel Network ensures equivariance by aligning slices in the meta-grid and maintaining input tensor depth. It includes meta-position and pixel intensity embeddings, and utilizes self-attention layers in the context embedding network. The decoder in the architecture combines masked convolution and self-attention to process the target slice in raster-scan order, using an initial 1D self-attention network to gather context information from the slice. The slice tensor is reshaped into a 1D tensor for processing. The architecture combines masked convolution and self-attention to process the target slice in raster-scan order. An initial 1D self-attention network gathers context information from the slice, reshaped into a 1D tensor for processing. The output is then reshaped back into a 2D tensor and used as conditioning input to a Gated PixelCNN network for modeling the target slice with full masking over pixels and channel dimensions. The Gated PixelCNN network models the target slice with full masking over pixels and channel dimensions, resulting in significantly lower memory requirements. The entire previously generated context is captured at each position of the decoder, and the log-likelihood decomposes as a sum over slices. An unbiased estimator of the log-loss is obtained by uniformly sampling a choice of target slice and evaluating its logprobability conditioned upon previous slices. In maximum likelihood learning, a Monte Carlo estimate is used for log-loss with backpropagation gradients. The SPN can upscale input tensors by initializing with an externally generated subimage, ensuring consistency between initialization and training subimages.

It can also be used to upscale the depth of image channels by dividing the image into slices and concatenating them along the channel dimension.

Samples with depth upscaling show significant semantic coherence. Multidimensional upscaling increases the overall success rate of the samples. At 256 \u00d7 256, high-fidelity samples of celebrity faces from the CelebAHQ dataset are produced, showing significant improvement in quality compared to other models. Achieved MLE scores are notably better than previously reported scores. Samples for 8-bit CelebAHQ-256 are showcased in FIG6, with additional samples in Figures 7, 8, and 9 in the Appendix.
