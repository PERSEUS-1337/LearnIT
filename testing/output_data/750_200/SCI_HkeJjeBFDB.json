To deploy compact models effectively, reducing performance gap and enhancing robustness to perturbations is crucial. Noise plays a significant role in improving neural networks training by addressing generalization and robustness goals. By introducing noise at input or supervision levels, the model's generalization and robustness can be improved. Techniques like \"Fickle Teacher\" and \"Soft Randomization\" show significant enhancements in generalization by utilizing noise sources. Adding Gaussian noise to the student model's output from the teacher on the original image enhances adversarial robustness significantly. Random label corruption also has a surprising impact on model robustness. This study emphasizes the benefits of incorporating noise in knowledge distillation and encourages further research in this area. The design of Deep Neural Networks for real-world deployment requires consideration of memory, computational requirements, performance, reliability, and security, especially in resource-constrained devices or applications. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for real-world deployment must consider memory, computational requirements, performance, reliability, and security. Compact models are needed for resource-constrained devices like self-driving cars. Model performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data is crucial for reliability. Robustness against malicious attacks is also essential. Various techniques have been proposed to address these challenges. In the study, the focus is on knowledge distillation as a method for training smaller networks under the supervision of larger pre-trained networks. This interactive learning approach mimics the softened softmax output of the teacher model, improving model performance and ensuring reliability under distribution shift and robustness against malicious attacks. In the study, knowledge distillation involves training smaller networks under the supervision of larger pre-trained networks by mimicking the teacher model's softened softmax output. This approach improves model performance but there is still a significant performance gap between the student and teacher models. Capturing knowledge from the larger network and transferring it to a smaller model remains an open question for reducing the generalization gap. Incorporating methods into the knowledge is crucial for real-world deployment suitability. Incorporating methods inspired by neuroscience on human learning, our proposed approach aims to improve the robustness of student models in knowledge distillation. This draws from the concept of neuroplasticity, emphasizing the importance of connections between neurons for learning. Neuroplasticity is essential for learning, as children learn through collaboration and interaction with their environment. Cognitive biases and trial-to-trial response variation play a significant role in decision-making, leading to sub-optimal outcomes. Introducing constructive noise in collaborative learning can deter cognitive biases like memorization and over-generalization in neural networks, by mimicking trial-to-trial response variation in humans. Introducing noise in knowledge distillation can improve learning by deterring cognitive bias in neural networks. This study analyzes the effects of various noise types on model generalization and robustness in the teacher-student collaborative learning framework. The study explores the effects of adding different noise types in the teacher-student collaborative learning framework to enhance generalization and robustness of the student model. It introduces a method called \"Fickle Teacher\" that transfers teacher model uncertainty to the student using Dropout. Additionally, Gaussian noise in knowledge distillation significantly improves the student model's adversarial robustness. Soft Randomization is a novel approach using Gaussian noise in knowledge distillation to enhance the student model's adversarial robustness significantly while minimizing the drop in generalization. Random label corruption is also shown to improve adversarial robustness with minimal impact on generalization. Noise has been a common regularization technique to improve generalization performance. Noise is a common regularization technique used to improve generalization performance in deep neural networks. Various noise techniques, such as Dropout and injecting noise to the gradient, have been shown to be crucial for non-convex optimization. Various randomization techniques inject noise in the model during training and inference to improve robustness against adversarial attacks. Randomized smoothing transforms classifiers into smooth classifiers with certifiable l2-norm robustness guarantees. Label smoothing enhances deep neural network performance across various tasks, although it may impair performance according to M\u00fcller et al. (2019). Label smoothing improves deep neural network performance, but it may impair knowledge distillation according to M\u00fcller et al. (2019). Adding constructive noise to the knowledge distillation framework could lead to lightweight, well-generalizing models with enhanced robustness to adversarial and natural perturbations. The CIFAR-10 dataset was chosen for empirical analysis due to its prevalence in knowledge distillation and robustness research, allowing for extensive experimentation. In studying noise addition in knowledge distillation using CIFAR-10 dataset, the Hinton method was employed to train the student model. Experiments were conducted on Wide Residual Networks (WRN) with normalization of images and standard training scheme. To evaluate the generalization of models, ImageNet images from the CINIC dataset were used. For adversarial robustness, the Projected Gradient Descent attack was employed, and robustness to corruptions and perturbations was tested using CIFAR-C dataset. In the study, noise was added to the output logits of the teacher model in the student-teacher learning framework of knowledge distillation to analyze its impact on generalization and robustness. Gaussian noise with variance proportional to the output logits was applied, with a range of [0 - 0.5]. Adding noise to the output logits of the teacher model in the student-teacher learning framework improved generalization to CIFAR-10 test set but slightly reduced out-of-distribution generalization to CINIC-ImageNet. Adversarial and natural robustness of the models showed a slight increase. Knowledge distillation to the student model was impaired when the teacher model was trained with label smoothing. Our method improves the distillation process by adding noise to the student model's softened logits, inspired by brain variability. Dropout is used in the teacher model to introduce variability in the supervision signal. Using dropout in the teacher model introduces variability in the supervision signal, leading to different output predictions for the same input image. This method differs from previous approaches like knowledge distillation and principled uncertainty estimates obtained from deep learning networks. Our proposed method involves calibrating a student model with the same architecture as the teacher model using dropout as a source of uncertainty encoding noise. Instead of averaging Monte Carlo simulations, we use the logits returned by the teacher model with activated dropout to train the student for more epochs. This helps the student generalize better on unseen and out-of-distribution data, and achieve higher generalization to PGD. Training the student model with dropout using our scheme significantly improves in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization over the Hinton method, even when the teacher model's performance decreases after a dropout rate of 0.2. The student model's performance improves up to a dropout rate of 0.4, even when the teacher model's performance decreases after 0.2. Adding trial-to-trial variability enhances PGD Robustness and natural robustness, supporting the hypothesis that noise injection helps distill knowledge to the student model. The injection of noise from the exponential family like Gaussian or Laplace noise enhances adversarial robustness but reduces generalization. A novel method proposes adding Gaussian noise to the input image while distilling knowledge to the student model, aiming to retain adversarial robustness gains observed with randomized training. Training the student model with random Gaussian noise, while using the teacher model trained on clean images, can maintain adversarial robustness gains and mitigate generalization loss. The method involves minimizing a loss function in the knowledge distillation framework, with parameters \u03b1 and \u03c4. Testing with six Gaussian noise levels showed increased adversarial robustness and decreased generalization, with the proposed method outperforming others. Our proposed method enhances adversarial robustness and generalization compared to training with Gaussian noise alone. It achieves 33.85% adversarial robustness at \u03c3 = 0.05, compared to 3.53% for the student model. Additionally, it improves robustness to common corruptions such as noise and blurring as noise intensity increases. The method enhances adversarial robustness and generalization by improving robustness to noise and blurring corruptions as Gaussian noise intensity increases. It also shows improvements in robustness for weather and digital corruptions, except for fog and frost, contrast, and saturation. The robustness changes at different intensities, with lower noise levels increasing robustness for frost before decreasing at higher intensities. This method allows for increased adversarial robustness with lower noise intensity while maintaining low generalization loss compared to other training methods. The proposed method suggests using lower noise intensity to increase adversarial robustness while minimizing generalization loss. It involves randomly changing target labels to incorrect classes during training, inspired by cognitive bias in humans and over generalization in deep neural networks. The method involves introducing various types of noise such as Gaussian noise, impulse noise, and blur to improve the tolerance of deep neural networks to noisy labels. Random label noise is used to prevent overconfidence in predictions and discourage memorization, which has not been explored extensively in previous studies. The study explores the impact of random label corruption on model generalization by introducing various types of noise. This includes Gaussian noise, impulse noise, and blur at different levels of the teacher and student models. The study investigates the effect of random label corruption on model generalization at different levels of teacher and student models. When corruption is only used during knowledge distillation to the student, generalization improves even at high corruption levels. However, when corruption is used for training both teacher and student models, generalization decreases. Knowledge distillation tends to outperform the teacher model, especially at high levels of label corruption. The study found that random label corruption can impact model generalization, with knowledge distillation outperforming the teacher model at high corruption levels. Training with 5% random labels increased adversarial robustness significantly. Adversarial robustness increased with up to 40% random label corruption but slightly decreased at 50%. This phenomenon warrants further investigation. Incorporating variability in knowledge distillation through noise at input or supervision levels improves generalization and robustness. Fickle teacher enhances in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization, while soft randomization boosts adversarial robustness significantly. Soft randomization improves adversarial robustness of student model trained with Gaussian noise, reducing drop in generalization. Random label corruption increases robustness significantly and improves generalization. Injecting noises to increase trial-to-trial variability in knowledge distillation shows promise for training compact models. The framework proposed by Hinton et al. involves using a final softmax function with a raised temperature and smooth logits from the teacher model as soft targets for the student model. This method aims to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence between output probabilities, enhancing generalization and robustness of neural networks. The hyperparameters \u03c4 and \u03b1 represent temperature and balancing ratio in the logit output of a teacher model. Neural networks generally perform well when test data matches training data distribution. However, real-world models often face domain shift, impacting generalization. Test set performance alone is not sufficient for evaluating model generalization. ImageNet is used to measure out-of-distribution performance. To evaluate model generalization, test set performance alone is not enough. ImageNet from the CINIC dataset is used to measure out-of-distribution performance, approximating a model's performance on 2100 images per CIFAR-10 category. Deep Neural Networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Neural Networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing a threat to their deployment in the real world. Research focuses on evaluating and defending against these attacks. In the study, models are defended against adversarial attacks using the Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attack. The PGD-N attack adds random noise within an epsilon bound to the original image and adjusts the image in the direction of loss with a step size, clipping it within the epsilon bound and valid image range. The study focuses on defending models against adversarial attacks using Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attack, which adds random noise within an epsilon bound to the original image. The model needs to be robust to both adversarial attacks and naturally occurring perturbations in the test environment. Recent works have shown that Deep Neural Networks are vulnerable to commonly occurring perturbations in the real world. Recent studies have highlighted the vulnerability of Deep Neural Networks to real-world perturbations, leading to significant degradation in classifier accuracy. Gu et al. (2019) found that state-of-the-art classifiers are brittle to minute transformations in video frames, termed natural robustness. They suggest that robustness to synthetic color distortions can serve as a proxy for natural robustness. In their study, researchers found robustness to synthetic color distortions as a proxy for natural robustness. They use common corruptions and perturbations in CIFAR-C as a proxy for natural robustness, emphasizing the trade-off between generalization and adversarial robustness. It is crucial to test the effect of norm bounded perturbations on model generalization and robustness to distribution shifts. Recent studies have shown that adversarially trained models can have a negative impact on natural robustness, especially when subjected to semantics-preserving transformations. Adversarial training improves robustness to certain perturbations but may compromise performance against others commonly found in real-world scenarios. Recent studies have shown that adversarially trained models improve robustness to mid and high frequency perturbations but at the expense of low frequency perturbations. There is a trade-off between adversarial robustness and generalization, as highlighted in previous studies. To exploit the uncertainty of the teacher model, random swapping noise methods are proposed. Random swapping noise methods are proposed to exploit the uncertainty of the teacher model for a sample. Two variants are suggested: Swap Top 2 and Swap All, which improve in-distribution generalization but harm out-of-distribution generalization. These methods do not significantly impact robustness. Training the student model with dropout in a distillation scheme requires more epochs to converge and capture the teacher model's uncertainty. Different dropout rates necessitate varying numbers of training epochs, with corresponding reductions in learning rate at specific intervals.

Adversarial Robustness: Noise on the supervision from teacher improves student accuracy on unseen data but not generalization to out-of-distribution data. Various types of noise such as Gaussian, impulse, shot, speckle, defocus blur, motion blur, zoom blur, brightness, fog, frost, snow, spatter, and contrast are considered.
