    "content": "The Act titled \"Protecting the Second Amendment and Hunting Rights on Federal Lands Act of 2008\" allows for possessing or carrying firearms and ammunition in units of the National Park System and the National Wildlife Refuge System. Congress finds that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to bear arms and that firearms are used for self-defense over 2,000,000 times a year in the US. States expanding firearm rights for self-defense have seen a decrease in firearm-related crime. Federal regulations currently prohibit firearm possession in National Park and Wildlife units. Regulations prohibit firearm possession in units of the National Park System and the National Wildlife Refuge System, often hindering individuals from exercising their second amendment rights. Laws regarding firearms in these units differ from Federal and State laws. Federal law should clarify that the second amendment rights of an individual in units of the National Park System or the National Wildlife Refuge System will not be infringed. Federal law should protect the right of individuals to keep and bear firearms and ammunition in units of the National Park System and the National Wildlife Refuge System, without any federal regulations restricting them based on their location.

The term \"hunting\" includes hunting, trapping, netting, and fishing, while the term \"management plan\" encompasses various planning documents. Management plans for Federal land must cover hunting, trapping, netting, and fishing activities. The term \"management plan\" includes comprehensive plans for land use.
