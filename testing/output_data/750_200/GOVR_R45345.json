    "content": "Whistleblowing in the Intelligence Community (IC) involves reporting violations of law, mismanagement, waste of resources, abuse of authority, or threats to public health and safety. The key difference for IC whistleblowers is the need to protect classified information. The Intelligence Community (IC) recognizes whistleblowing as a way to save money, ensure ethics, and prompt corrective action. Protections are only for lawful disclosures, not for leaking classified information to the media or foreign entities. Whistleblower safeguards do not cover policy disagreements. The Intelligence Community (IC) recognizes whistleblowing as a way to save money, ensure ethics, and prompt corrective action. Protections are only for lawful disclosures, not for leaking classified information to the media or foreign entities. Whistleblower safeguards do not cover policy disagreements. Whistleblower protections do not apply to differences of opinion over policy, strategy, analysis, or priorities for intelligence funding or collection unless there is a reasonable concern over legality or constitutionality. Protections also do not protect against adverse personnel or security clearance decisions if the agency can show it would have taken the same action without the protected disclosure. Congress and the executive branch have defined procedures for IC whistleblowers to make protected disclosures while ensuring security. IC whistleblowers have procedures for protected disclosures, with differing opinions on transparency and protections. The Director of National Intelligence provides guidance for whistleblowers, including IC contractors, Armed Forces members, and federal employees. Protections have evolved to address concerns about reprisal and adequacy for contractors. The Intelligence Community whistleblower protections have evolved over time to address concerns about reprisal and adequacy for contractors. The first specific legislation was the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998, which lacked specific protections. Subsequent provisions in the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 and Presidential Policy Directive (PPD)-19 aimed to provide protections for IC whistleblowers. In Fiscal Year 2010, provisions were made to protect IC whistleblowers, but they were general and varied in implementation standards. PPD-19, signed in 2012, offered specific protections in response to concerns about reprisals against IC whistleblowers. The Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 and ICD-120 further solidified these protections. Additionally, 10 U.S.C. \u00a71034 provides whistleblower protections for Armed Forces members in the IC. In January 2018, Congress passed P.L. 115-118 amending the National Security Act of 1947 and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 to address gaps in protections for Intelligence Community (IC) contractors. The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998 (ICWPA) assists IC whistleblowers excluded from the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989. The ICWPA of 1998 was created to help whistleblowers in the Intelligence Community who are not covered by the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989. It allows IC government employees or contractors to report complaints or urgent concerns to the Inspector General of their agency. This amendment addressed gaps in previous acts of Congress and aimed to improve the flow of necessary information. The ICWPA of 1998 allows IC government employees or contractors to report complaints to the Inspector General of their agency. The IG must report credible complaints to the CIA Director or head of the establishment, who then reports to congressional intelligence committees within 7 days. The ICWPA of 1998 allows IC government employees or contractors to report complaints to the Inspector General of their agency, who must then report to the congressional intelligence committees within 7 days. If the IG fails to report or does so inaccurately, the employee or contractor can directly submit the complaint to Congress after following certain procedures. The ICWPA does not provide specific protections for whistleblowers from reprisal. The IC whistleblowers can report complaints to Congress through the relevant IC agency IG, but there are no specific provisions for protecting them from reprisal. The IAA for FY2010 included the first general provisions for whistleblower protection, establishing the Office of the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community. Section 405(a)(1) of the IAA added a new Section 103H to the National Security Act of 1947, allowing lawful disclosures to the IGIC. Section 103H(g) of the National Security Act of 1947 authorized the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community to receive and investigate complaints or information regarding violations of laws, rules, mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or threats to public health and safety. The Inspector General of the Intelligence Community can receive and investigate complaints or information about violations of laws, rules, mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or threats to public health and safety. The identity of the employee making the complaint will not be disclosed without their consent, except in certain unavoidable circumstances. No reprisal should be taken against the employee for making a complaint or disclosing information. The Inspector General of the Intelligence Community can investigate complaints about violations of laws, rules, mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or threats to public health and safety. No reprisal should be taken against the employee for making a complaint or disclosing information. Section 405 covers contractors as well as federal employees of IC elements, giving the Inspector General access to any employee or contractor needed for their duties. The Inspector General of the Intelligence Community can investigate complaints about violations of laws, rules, mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or threats to public health and safety. Employees or contractors of the intelligence community can report complaints or information to the Inspector General without fear of reprisal. The Inspector General has access to any employee or contractor necessary for their duties. PPD-19, signed by President Obama in 2012, provides protections for IC whistleblowers who make lawful disclosures to the CIA Inspector General. It specifically protects employees with access to classified information from reprisals for disclosing information to a supervisor. PPD-19 protects IC whistleblowers from reprisals for making lawful disclosures of violations of laws or regulations, mismanagement, waste of funds, or abuse of authority to specified officials. PPD-19 protects IC whistleblowers from reprisals for disclosing violations of laws, mismanagement, waste of funds, or abuse of authority. It prohibits reprisals affecting access to classified information or involving personnel actions against the whistleblower. IC elements must certify a process for employees to challenge retaliatory actions, ensuring security of classified information. The review process under PPD-19 allows employees to seek a review of personnel actions believed to be reprisals for lawful disclosures, ensuring security of classified information. The IC Inspector General determines if reprisal occurred and makes recommendations for corrective action, which the agency head must consider. The agency head is not required to accept an IG's recommendation for corrective action. IC agencies must certify to the DNI that they have a review process allowing employees to appeal actions related to access to classified information without facing retaliation. PPD-19 permits whistleblowers to request an external review by an IG panel chaired by the IGIC if the agency review process is exhausted. If the panel rules in favor of the employee, the agency must consider but is not obligated to accept the panel's recommendation for corrective action. The IG panel can recommend corrective action in favor of the employee, but the agency is not required to accept it. PDD-19 mandates annual reporting of IG determinations and recommendations to congressional intelligence committees. Title VI of the FY2014 IAA provides statutory protections for IC whistleblowers. Training on whistleblower protections is required for employees with access to classified information. Title VI of the FY2014 IAA (P.L. 113-126) provides statutory protections for IC whistleblowers against personnel or security clearance actions in reprisal for protected disclosures. Section 601 protects whistleblowers from retaliation for lawful disclosures to specified individuals or entities. Title VI of the FY2014 IAA (P.L. 113-126) provides statutory protections for IC whistleblowers against retaliation for lawful disclosures to specified individuals or entities, including the General of the Intelligence Community, the head of the employing agency, appropriate inspector general, and congressional intelligence committee. The legislation defines lawful disclosure as a violation of federal law, mismanagement, waste of funds, abuse of authority, or danger to public health and safety. Section 602 of Title VI of the FY2014 IAA protects government employee whistleblowers from retaliatory revocation of security clearance for making lawful disclosures. It also requires the development of appeal policies for decisions affecting a whistleblower's security clearance. This provision allows the whistleblower to retain their employment status pending the appeal outcome. ICD-120, Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection, provides protections against reprisal for IC employees making protected disclosures. It excludes members of the Armed Forces and does not mention contractors. The provision allows whistleblowers to retain their government employment status during the appeal process. ICD-120 provides protections for IC employees who make protected disclosures, including contractors and members of the Armed Forces. It allows whistleblowers to maintain their employment status during the appeal process for security clearance decisions related to lawful disclosures. The provision in ICD-120 allows whistleblowers to maintain their employment status during pending decisions. It also includes provisions for employees alleging reprisals to request an External Review Panel chaired by the IGIC. Additionally, there are requirements for IC-wide communications and training on whistleblower protections. Section 1034 of Title 10 U.S. Code provides protections against retaliation for protected communications by members of the Armed Forces within the IC elements. Section 1034 of Title 10 U.S. Code allows members of the Armed Forces within the IC elements to make protected communications to various entities without fear of retaliation. The curr_chunk discusses the protection of members of the Armed Forces who make protected communications, specifying prohibited personnel actions in reprisal and enabling the DOD to mitigate hardship for those facing reprisals. It also requires periodic updates to Congress and the whistleblower during investigations into protected communications. The curr_chunk discusses the requirement for periodic updates during investigations into protected communications and the need for uniform standards for investigations of prohibited personnel actions. It also addresses the inconsistency in coverage of contractors in existing whistleblower protection legislation. The ICWPA of 1998, IAA protections for contractors, and Title VI of the IAA of 2014 cover whistleblower complaints for contractors. Efforts in Congress led to P.L. 115-118 amending the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in 2018 to address gaps in protections for IC contractors. Senator McCaskill introduced S. 2002 in 2017, but no further action was taken. Senator McCaskill introduced S. 2002 on October 24, 2017, to provide protections for IC employees from retaliation for making protected disclosures. The bill included provisions for a complaint process but did not progress further in the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. Senator McCaskill introduced S. 794 on May 18, 2015, to extend protections for contractor employees on contracts with IC elements who make whistleblower complaints. The bill did not progress further. In January 19, 2018, Congress passed P.L. 115-118, amending the National Security Act of 1947 to provide protections for IC contractor whistleblowers. Section 110 of the Federal Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 amended existing whistleblower protections to allow IC contractors to make lawful disclosures to designated individuals within the contracting agency, as well as to the DNI, IGIC, and congressional intelligence committees. These protections mirror those for IC employees under Title VI of the IAA for FY2014. Section 110 of the Federal Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 provides clear protections for IC contractors who make lawful complaints against any retaliatory personnel actions, including appointment, promotion/demotion, disciplinary actions, and more. These protections extend to complaints involving violations of Federal laws, rules, or regulations. Section 110 of the Federal Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 provides protections for IC contractors who report violations of Federal laws, rules, or regulations, including unauthorized access to classified information, mismanagement of funds, abuse of authority, or threats to public health and safety. These protections also apply to contractors of the FBI, similar to those for IC employees under Title 50, U.S. Code. Section 110 of the Federal Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 provides protections for IC contractors who report violations of Federal laws, rules, or regulations, including unauthorized access to classified information, mismanagement of funds, abuse of authority, or threats to public health and safety. H.Amdt. 894, 113th Congress, redirected $2 million to fund the IC Whistleblower and Source Protection Directorate within the OIGIC to support hiring investigators and support. The OIGIC established the Protection Directorate to investigate fraud, waste, and abuse by hiring investigators and support staff. While not specifically for whistleblowers, it addresses underfunded capabilities to follow up on complaints effectively."
