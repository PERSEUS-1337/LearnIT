    "content": "The Act titled \"Medicare Drug Formulary Protection Act\" allows for the removal of covered Part D drugs from the prescription drug plan formulary. The Medicare Drug Formulary Protection Act limits the removal or change of covered Part D drugs from the prescription drug plan formulary starting in 2006. Starting in 2006, the PDP sponsor of a prescription drug plan cannot remove a covered Part D drug from the formulary or impose restrictions on its coverage, except at the beginning of each period. Starting in 2006, a prescription drug plan sponsor cannot remove a covered Part D drug from the formulary or impose restrictions on its coverage, except at the beginning of each plan year, with some flexibility for new therapeutic uses and newly covered drugs for newly enrolled individuals. In 2006, a prescription drug plan sponsor cannot remove a covered Part D drug from the formulary or impose restrictions on its coverage for individuals enrolling after the enactment date. The drug coverage may be restricted (such as through preferred status, usage restriction, step therapy, prior authorization, or quantity limitation) from enrollment date to December 31 of the following plan year, with exceptions for new therapeutic uses and newly covered Part D drugs. The Secretary may allow for new therapeutic uses and newly covered Part D drugs, with exceptions for brand name drugs with generic alternatives approved under section 505(j) of the Food and Drug Cosmetic Act. The Drug Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355(j)) applies to brand name drugs that go off-patent or have clinical warnings issued by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs. The Commissioner of Food and Drugs issues clinical warnings that impose restrictions or limitations on drugs, or if a drug is determined to be ineffective. PDP sponsors of prescription drug plans must provide notice of any removal or changes. Each PDP sponsor offering a prescription drug plan must provide annual notice of changes in formulary and coverage restrictions to affected parties. Each PDP sponsor offering a prescription drug plan must provide annual notice of changes in formulary or coverage restrictions to enrollees during the annual coordinated election period for the plan year. The amendment will apply to annual coordinated election periods after the enactment of the Act."
