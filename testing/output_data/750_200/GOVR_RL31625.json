    "content": "Title VI of the Higher Education Act authorizes grants to institutions for enhancing foreign language and area studies instruction. This program has a historical role in establishing area studies departments in colleges and universities. The FLAS program, supported by federal government grants, has a long history of promoting foreign language and area studies in colleges and universities. It prioritizes diplomacy, national security, and trade competitiveness, especially in regions not commonly included in American curricula. Recent interest in FLAS has grown due to concerns about terrorism from foreign regions and the need for greater expertise in these areas. Title VI programs, part of the Higher Education Act, are being considered for reauthorization by the 110th Congress. The program received $93.1 million in FY2007 and $95.6 million in FY2008. Specific activities supported under Title VI are listed in Table 1, along with grant sizes and budget requests. The focus is on promoting expertise in regions not commonly included in American curricula, driven by concerns about terrorism and national security. The Higher Education Act's Title VI programs received funding of $93.1 million in FY2007 and $95.6 million in FY2008. The U.S. Department of Education has discretion in allocating funds among specific activities under Title VI, with separate authorization levels for Parts A, B, and C. Grants are typically awarded on a multi-year basis, with obligations for future years. The Higher Education Amendments of 1998 authorized Title VI at \"such sums as necessary.\" The Higher Education Act's Title VI programs received funding of $93.1 million in FY2007 and $95.6 million in FY2008. The statutory authorities in the HEA expired at the end of FY2004; however, they have been recently extended and currently remain effective. The last specific authorization was for FY1999, at $80 million for Part A, $18 million for Part B, and $10 million for Part C. No more than 10% of Part A funds may be used for Undergraduate International Studies and Foreign Language Programs. Approximately three-fifths of the funds from the Higher Education Act's Title VI programs are used for National Language and Area Centers (NLACs) and FLAS Fellowships. NLAC grant recipients also receive grants for FLAS Fellowships, making them the core activities supported under Title VI. Other activities funded under Title VI are smaller-scale supplementary programs. The core activities supported under Title VI of the Higher Education Act include National Language and Area Centers (NLACs) and FLAS Fellowships, with funds allocated on a competitive basis emphasizing excellence in selection. Other smaller-scale supplementary programs serve more specific goals or support the primary programs. The selection of National Language and Area Centers, FLAS Fellowship recipients, and Language Resource Centers under Title VI is based on excellence and equitable distribution of grants. Funding provisions specify the languages or world regions for specialization, such as Arabic or Central Asian studies. The FY2002 Department of Education Appropriations Act and FY2004 Consolidated Appropriations Resolution specified the languages and world regions for Title VI funds, omitting earmarks from previous years. The FY2002 Department of Education Appropriations Act and FY2004 Consolidated Appropriations Resolution specified the languages and world regions for Title VI funds, omitting earmarks from previous years. The Resolution and conference report retained provisions directing Title VI funds to specific world regions and languages to sustain investments in training experts with foreign language proficiency and cross-cultural skills in strategic areas important to national security interests. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005 (P.L. 108-447) and conference report (H.Rept. 108-792) do not impose constraints on language emphasis or fund distribution for strategic world areas important to national security interests, including southeast Asia and Africa. One percent of the total appropriation is earmarked for program evaluation, national outreach, and information dissemination, with $1,500,000 allocated for an independent review of Title VI programs by the National Research Council. The National Research Council conducts evaluations of HEA Title VI programs, with reports from the National Foreign Language Center being significant sources. Funds from the International Research and Studies program can be used for assessing program effects and utilizing graduates. The NFLC has received funds to develop the \"Evaluation of Exchange, Language, International and Area Studies (EELIAS) Project.\" The NFLC received funds to develop the \"Evaluation of Exchange, Language, International and Area Studies (EELIAS) Project\" to meet evaluation and assessment needs of HEA Title VI and Fulbright-Hays program. The project includes developing performance indicators, an Internet-based data reporting system, and evaluating Title VI programs. The NFLC received funds for the \"Evaluation of Exchange, Language, International and Area Studies (EELIAS) Project\" to develop performance indicators, an Internet-based data reporting system, and evaluate Title VI programs. The project aims to assess the need for advanced foreign language and international studies and the capacity of IHEs to meet those needs. Internal and external evaluations of each program will be conducted over a five-year period (1998-2003). The report \"National Security in the 21st Century: The Role of Title VI/Fulbright-Hays in Supporting National Language Capacity\" evaluated the impact of foreign language components of HEA Title VI and the Fulbright-Hays program. It found that Title VI support is critical for maintaining the nation's capacity in less commonly taught languages with strategic importance for the United States. IHEs receiving Title VI NLAC grants enroll 59% of all graduate students. The report highlighted the importance of Title VI support in maintaining the nation's capacity in less commonly taught languages with strategic importance for the United States. IHEs receiving Title VI NLAC grants enroll a significant percentage of graduate students in these languages and have supported the development of textbooks. The Higher Education Act may be up for reauthorization during the 110th Congress, with potential debates on related issues. There is a growing interaction between American society and cultures worldwide, leading to national security concerns. It is important for the nation to provide education and support for people to acquire advanced knowledge of languages and cultures of concern. Foreign nations and cultures have recently gained significant national attention and concern. It is crucial to provide ongoing support for instruction in all of the world's major languages and cultures, including those of current concern like Afghanistan. The focus should not only be on \"critical\" foreign languages and cultures with major security or trade interests, but also on many minor ones to prepare for future concerns. The federal government may need to consider providing support for instruction in critical foreign languages and cultures, focusing on colleges, universities, and federally-operated institutions. The federal government operates two foreign language schools, the Defense Language Institute Foreign Language Center in Monterey, California, and the Foreign Service Institute School for Language Studies in Arlington, Virginia, to meet direct foreign language requirements. Title VI provides grants to IHEs for educational programs in specific subject areas, differing from the HEA's student aid approach. The HEA focuses on providing student aid based on financial need and leaves subject selection to students. Title VI, unlike other institutional aid, supports instruction in specific subject fields and offers fellowships in that field. It is one of the few HEA programs focused on specific subject areas, requiring specific justification. Title VI is a HEA program focused on specific subject areas, particularly foreign languages and regions, important for national security and economic competitiveness. Supporters argue that maintaining research and instructional programs in these areas is a national priority. Maintaining research and instructional programs in critical foreign language and area studies is a national priority, supported in federally-operated institutions and colleges accessible to the public. Skills in foreign languages and cultures are essential for national defense, diplomacy, international trade, and increasing understanding of foreign nations among the public. Research is needed to expand understanding of foreign cultures and improve foreign language methods. The importance of maintaining research and instructional programs in critical foreign language and area studies is emphasized, with a focus on the role of institutions of higher education in expanding understanding of foreign cultures and improving language instruction methods. Collaboration between American and foreign educational institutions is crucial for the quality of FLAS programs, which may be easier to establish in colleges and universities compared to federal institutions. Support for specific subject areas under HEA Title VI is not unique when considering other federal agencies besides the Department of Education. Various federal agencies provide support to institutions of higher education for specific subject areas on a larger scale than HEA Title VI, such as health care education by the National Institutes of Health and science and mathematics education. Support for specific subject areas under HEA Title VI is not unique when considering other federal agencies. Various agencies provide support for health care education, science, and mathematics education, perceived as of special national interest and worthy of federal support. It could be argued that if enough students are interested, institutions of higher education will provide adequate instruction without targeted federal subsidies. If aid like that under Title VI is necessary, it may be deemed necessary to some extent. Private foundations have occasionally provided significant levels of support for foreign language and area studies. Efforts could be made to utilize the language skills of recent immigrants in the United States. Colleges and universities are interested in offering a wide range of courses and programs. Title VI programs receive support from various sources including colleges, universities, private foundations, and corporations. However, individual institutions struggle to offer instruction in rare languages like Pashto or Farsi. Proponents argue that national support is necessary for funding such critical language studies. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of national support, specifically through programs like Title VI, for funding critical language studies. It highlights the need for federal aid to ensure ongoing support for languages and world regions that may not receive sufficient funding from individual institutions. The report focuses on Title VI of the HEA, the largest federal support for FLAS in U.S. colleges. It questions the coordination of Title VI with other programs and suggests consolidation for improved efficiency. Title VI aims to coordinate federal programs in foreign language, area studies, and international studies. Programs like the Fulbright-Hays Act, NSEP, Gilman International Scholarship, and others are aligned with Title VI's goals. The Fulbright-Hays Act, along with other programs like NSEP and Gilman International Scholarship, authorizes various international exchange activities administered by the Department of State. These exchanges involve graduate students, scholars, and professionals in different fields, not limited to foreign language and area studies. The Fulbright-Hays programs, relevant to HEA Title VI, support foreign travel activities for American graduate students and professors. These activities include faculty research abroad, doctoral students conducting dissertation research, and group seminars abroad, exclusively for U.S. citizens or nationals. The Fulbright-Hays programs support foreign travel activities for American graduate students and professors, focusing on improving FLAS instruction in American colleges and universities. The NSEP, under the David L. Boren National Security Education Act, provides aid for international education and foreign language studies for American undergraduate and graduate students. The NSEA provides scholarships, grants, and fellowships for American undergraduate and graduate students to study in \"critical\" foreign countries and languages. A trust fund of $150 million was established in FY1992 for this purpose. The NSEA provides funding for scholarships, grants, and fellowships for American students to study in critical foreign countries and languages. Recipients are required to work in national security positions or higher education related to their field of study. Institutional grants support instructional and exchange programs. The institutional grants awarded through the NSEA focus on supporting instructional and exchange programs involving less commonly taught languages and disadvantaged/minority students in international education. A revised strategy for these grants was announced in 2003. A revised strategy for institutional grants, including a Flagship Language Initiative, was announced in 2003 to support advanced study of critical foreign languages. The National Security Education Program (NSEP) complements existing programs and includes a service requirement. The National Security Education Program (NSEP) includes a service requirement and supports travel grants to undergraduate students. Administered by the Department of Defense's National Defense University, it focuses on critical nations, disciplines, and subject areas for national security. The National Security Education Program (NSEP) is overseen by the National Security Education Board (NSEB) at the Defense's National Defense University. Critical areas for national security are determined by the Board, with administration handled by non-governmental organizations like the Institute of International Education (IIE) and the Academy for Educational Development (AED). The NSEP, overseen by the NSEB, is administered by IIE and AED for undergraduate and graduate fellowship competitions. In FY1995, the program faced potential elimination but was ultimately reduced to a $75 million trust fund. Annual funding for NSEP was set at $8 million in FY2003. The NSEP funding was reduced to $75 million in FY1995 and set at $8 million annually in FY2003. NSEP has a service requirement, focuses on national security-related FLAS skill needs, is financed via a trust fund, and supports international travel for undergraduate students. Administered by DOD, it is smaller in scale compared to HEA Title VI. The NSEP is a small program administered by DOD, not ED, offering scholarships of up to $5,000 for undergraduate students with financial need. Eligible students must be recipients of Pell Grants and can use the scholarship for travel, tuition, and study abroad expenses. The Gilman program provides study abroad opportunities for undergraduate students from low-income families who are Pell Grant recipients. Preference is given to first-time study abroad students, and there are no restrictions on subjects or regions, except for Cuba or countries under travel warnings. The program aims to enable students who may not otherwise have the means to study abroad. The Gilman program offers study abroad opportunities to low-income Pell Grant recipients, with a focus on enabling students who may not have the means to study abroad. Administered by the Department of State through the Institute of International Education, the program awarded 179 scholarships in the 2002-2003 academic year. FIPSE, authorized by Title VII, Part B of the HEA, supports innovative approaches in U.S. postsecondary education. It offers specific programs like the North American Mobility in Higher Education, U.S.-Brazil Higher Education Consortia, and European Community-United States Cooperation in Higher Education. Grants are provided to U.S. IHEs through competition to form consortia with foreign institutions. The Cooperation Program in Higher Education and Vocational Education and Training offers multi-year grants to U.S. IHEs to form consortia with foreign institutions for student and staff exchange, curriculum development. Funding levels for FY2002 are $2,043,000 for North American Mobility, $1,495,000 for U.S.-Brazil Consortia, and $2,254,000 for European Community-United States Cooperation Program. The European Community-United States Cooperation Program in Higher Education and Vocational Education and Training may benefit from consolidation under a coordinated national strategy to enhance efficiency. Coordination among these programs could be important, although the scale of other programs discussed is smaller than Title VI. The potential consolidation of programs like Fulbright-Hays, FIPSE, and NSEP under a single coordinating or advisory board could enhance coordination and efficiency. These programs are similar to activities funded by HEA Title VI and are currently administered by ED's Office of Postsecondary Education Programs. National Strategy for the European Community-United States Cooperation Program in Higher Education and Vocational Education and Training could also benefit from consolidation for increased efficiency. The NSEP has unique characteristics that distinguish it from other programs, such as emphasizing national security needs and having a service requirement for aid recipients. Coordination with Title VI and related programs may be more consistent with NSEP's purposes than consolidation, especially for scholarship and fellowship programs. Currently, coordination is achieved through representation on the National Security Education Board by a designee of the Secretary of Education. The National Security Education Program (NSEP) coordinates with Title VI through representation on the National Security Education Board. However, questions arise about the efficiency of maintaining a separate program like NSEP, especially with its reduced trust fund. The Gilman International Scholarship Program also funds undergraduate travel abroad but lacks NSEP's national security focus and service requirements. The Gilman International Scholarship Program funds undergraduate travel abroad but lacks NSEP's national security focus and service requirements. Consider transferring the Gilman program to the Department of Education and incorporating it under the Undergraduate International Studies and Foreign Language Programs of HEA Title VI. Proposals could establish a multi-agency board or independent federal entity to coordinate all federal programs related to foreign language and international studies. A proposal suggests transferring the Gilman International Scholarship Program to the Department of Education and incorporating it under the Undergraduate International Studies and Foreign Language Programs of HEA Title VI. It also recommends establishing a federal entity to coordinate all federal programs related to foreign language and international studies, including long-range planning for FLAS specialists. Currently, there is a question about increasing coordination between IHEs funded by HEA Title VI and federal agencies offering language instruction. This includes coordinating HEA Title VI fellowships and institutional grants with the foreign language needs of federal government agencies, as well as sharing resources and coordinating instructional programs between federal language training institutions and IHEs supported by Title VI. Currently, HEA Title VI grants are dispersed across various languages and regions, including critical areas like the Middle East and South Asia. The NLAC and FLAS Fellowship grant recipients reflect a balance among different world regions, with grants for both frequently and infrequently studied areas in U.S. IHEs. The HEA Title VI grants are distributed across various languages and regions, including critical areas like the Middle East and South Asia. There is a need to identify a stable group of languages or regions that are infrequently taught in American IHEs for targeted Title VI funding. This raises questions about decision-making regarding fund allocation for different activities, languages, or regions. The distribution of HEA Title VI grants across various languages and regions, including critical areas like the Middle East and South Asia, raises questions about decision-making regarding fund allocation for different activities, languages, or regions at American IHEs. The scale of federal support for FLAS studies under this program extends substantially beyond federal funds being matched with non-federal resources. The HEA Title VI grants for FLAS studies attract additional funds from various sources, but there are concerns about whether the program is adequately meeting national needs. Opponents argue against increased targeting of grants for critical languages and regions. Opponents argue against increased targeting of HEA Title VI grants for critical languages and regions, citing uncertainty in predicting future needs and advocating for a comprehensive approach to grant distribution. IHEs are encouraged to submit proposals for new Title VI grants to support the study of various languages and regions. Efforts to quantify national needs are challenging, with an annual survey linked to the NSEP providing some insight into federal language needs. The annual series of reports on federal language needs identifies a wide range of languages, regions, and disciplines crucial for national security. Another study by the General Accounting Office focused on language needs in four federal departments and agencies. The General Accounting Office's study highlighted shortages of translators, interpreters, diplomats, and intelligence specialists with critical foreign language skills in key federal agencies. These shortages have negatively impacted agency operations and hindered various national security efforts."
