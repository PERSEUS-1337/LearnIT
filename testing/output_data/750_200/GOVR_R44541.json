The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) defines TBML as disguising crime proceeds through trade transactions by falsifying prices, quantities, or quality of imports/exports. This process is used by terrorist groups to finance activities and conceal money sources and beneficiaries. Trade-based money laundering (TBML) involves disguising crime proceeds through trade transactions by falsifying prices, quantities, or quality of imports/exports. Financial institutions can be implicated in TBML schemes when used to settle, facilitate, or finance international trade transactions. In June 2015, the U.S. Department of the Treasury issued reports on money laundering and terrorist financing risks. The U.S. Department of the Treasury issued reports in 2015 on money laundering and terrorist financing risks. The National Money Laundering Risk Assessment highlighted trade-based money laundering (TBML) as a significant challenge, with TBML schemes capable of laundering billions of dollars annually. Treasury mentioned over 17,000 Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) related to potential TBML activity between January 2004 and May 2009. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) reported over 17,000 Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) from January 2004 to May 2009, detailing potential trade-based money laundering (TBML) activities totaling $276 billion. Criminal organizations and terrorist financiers exploit the international financial system and cash couriers to conceal their illicit activities within the complex trade and finance system. The international trade and finance system's size and complexity make it difficult to detect suspicious trade transactions due to various foreign exchange transactions, trade financing arrangements, and the co-mingling of legitimate and illicit funds. Money launderers exploit vulnerabilities in letters of credit and other financial arrangements to launder funds, using trade-based money laundering (TBML) techniques in combination with other money laundering methods. Trade-based money laundering (TBML) involves using cross-border trade to launder funds. TBML techniques vary in complexity and are often combined with other money laundering methods to obscure the money trail. Common TBML activities include misrepresenting the price, quality, or quantity of goods during transit. Basic TBML techniques include over- and under-invoicing of goods and services, which is a commonly used method for laundering funds across borders. By invoicing below market value, funds can be shifted between exporters and importers. Trade-based money laundering involves using cross-border trade to launder funds. One common method is by invoicing goods or services below market value to shift funds between exporters and importers. This can also be done by invoicing at a price higher than market value to transfer value between parties. These transactions require collusion and can have significant tax implications. Trade-based money laundering involves using cross-border trade to shift funds between exporters and importers through invoicing goods or services below or above market value. Collusion is required for these transactions, which can have significant tax implications. Complex products and those traveling through supply chains are more likely to be used in these activities to complicate the determination of true market value. Multiple invoicing of goods and services allows money launderers or terrorist financiers to justify multiple payments for the same transaction, using multiple financial institutions to make these payments. Money launderers can justify multiple payments for the same goods or services, increasing complexity by using multiple financial institutions. They can also manipulate prices and quantities of goods and services to evade detection. Collusion between exporters and importers can lead to over- and under-shipments, or even no shipments at all. Money launderers can manipulate the quantity, quality, and type of goods and services in trade transactions to create discrepancies and deceive banks and financial institutions. This can involve colluding with exporters and importers to falsify shipping and customs documents, leading to \"phantom\" transactions. The Black Market Peso Exchange (BMPE) is a common trade-based money laundering technique used by Colombian drug traffickers to disguise billions in drug profits. TBML is recognized as a prevalent form of international money laundering and a method used by terrorist organizations for value transfer and reconciliation. Trade-based money laundering (TBML) is a common method used by terrorist organizations for value transfer and reconciliation. It is less understood compared to traditional money laundering methods but can have significant consequences for international commerce and government revenue. The National Money Laundering Risk Assessment highlights TBML's destructive impact on legitimate commerce. According to ICE HSI, TBML poses a serious threat to global trade. The National Money Laundering Risk Assessment warns that Trade-based Money Laundering (TBML) can severely impact legitimate commerce by allowing transnational criminal organizations to sell imported goods at below-market prices to expedite the money laundering process. This practice not only disadvantages legitimate businesses but also hinders entrepreneurship and reduces government tax revenue. Trade-based Money Laundering (TBML) hinders entrepreneurship and reduces government tax revenue by allowing criminal organizations to sell goods at below-market prices, exploiting global trade trends. Advances in communication, lower transportation costs, and interconnected economies facilitate this illicit activity. The digital revolution, global value chains, and urbanization have interconnected economies, creating new market opportunities. Organized crime has expanded into these markets, diversifying into profitable activities with low detection risks. Criminal groups adapt to global market trends, as highlighted in a report by the OECD. According to the OECD's report, illicit trade has evolved to include new activities and trade methods to avoid detection. Criminal groups have found ways to connect production to distant consumers, creating economies of scale and efficiencies similar to legitimate trade. This illegal trade poses challenges for law enforcement and could have significant economic and development impacts, especially in developing countries. Illicit trade presents challenges for law enforcement and has wide-ranging economic consequences, especially in developing countries. Criminal organizations and terrorist groups can exploit the international trade system with low risk of detection. FATF identifies vulnerabilities in the trade system, including the enormous volume of trade flows that obscure individual transactions. According to FATF, vulnerabilities in the trade system include the enormous volume of trade flows, complexity in foreign exchange transactions, comingling illicit funds with legitimate business cash flows, limited verification procedures, and resources for customs agencies to detect illegal trade transactions. According to FinCEN, trade-based money laundering (TBML) activity is increasing globally, with Mexico and China being the most frequently identified countries involved. Panama, the Dominican Republic, and Venezuela also show rapid growth in potential TBML activity. Limited resources hinder customs agencies' ability to detect illegal trade transactions. According to the U.S. Department of State's 2016 report, TBML concerns have been identified in various countries including Afghanistan, Australia, Brazil, China, India, Mexico, Pakistan, and Singapore, among others. The State Department also noted TBML activities in Trinidad and Tobago unrelated to terrorist financing. The State Department's Country Reports on Terrorism 2015 highlighted TBML activities in Trinidad and Tobago, which are associated with significant revenue losses, corruption, and money laundering. Anecdotal case studies have shown links to known terrorist groups and non-state armed groups. The Treasury Department's June 2015 National Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment found that trade-based money laundering (TBML) is not a dominant method for terrorist financing, despite anecdotal cases involving terrorist groups like Hezbollah. The assessment highlighted that the primary methods for moving money to terrorists are through physical cash movement and the banking system. The Treasury Department's National Terrorist Financing Risk Assessment in June 2015 found that terrorist organizations primarily use physical cash movement and the banking system for financing. Cash movement accounted for 28% of cases, while movement through banks, licensed MSBs, and unlicensed money transmitters made up the rest. Checks, wire transfers, and TBML accounted for the remaining 15%. In its latest Country Reports on Terrorism, the State Department identified TBML as a terrorism-related concern in Tunisia and Syria, particularly as a technique used by hawala brokers in conjunction with corrupt customs and immigration officials. Hawala refers to an informal method for transferring funds that is commonly used in parts of the Middle East and South Asia where the formal banking system has limited presence. Informal value transfer systems like hawala involve trusted money brokers who quickly and reliably disburse funds to clients. These systems are preferred for their lower cost but are seen as lacking transparency by government authorities and vulnerable to abuse by terrorist groups. The State Department's 2016 annual report on money laundering and financial crimes identified specific countries vulnerable to trade-based money laundering/terrorist financing schemes, such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Lebanon. In Lebanon, individuals are involved in a scheme involving trade in vehicles and weapons to launder drug proceeds linked to Hezbollah. Individuals are engaged in a trade-based money laundering scheme involving vehicles and weapons to launder drug proceeds linked to Hezbollah. U.S. law enforcement traced money wires from Jordanian and Lebanese entities to domestic vehicle dealerships in the United States. The purchased vehicles are exported to Lebanon and Jordan, sometimes with weapons hidden inside. While the transactions in the U.S. appear legitimate, the ultimate destination of the vehicles is unknown, and the proceeds may be funneled back to Hezbollah in Lebanon. TBML schemes are prevalent in Paraguay's Tri-Border Area with Brazil and Argentina, where a lucrative cross-border cigarette smuggling market is used for money laundering, benefiting criminal organizations, corrupt officials, and potentially terrorist groups. In the United Arab Emirates, TBML schemes may support sanctions-evasion networks and terrorist groups in various countries. In the United Arab Emirates, TBML schemes may support sanctions-evasion networks and terrorist groups in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and Somalia. The Lebanese Canadian Bank was designated as a primary money-laundering concern for aiding Hezbollah in drug and money laundering schemes involving TBML. The narcotics trafficking and money laundering network moved illegal drugs from South America to Europe and the Middle East via West Africa. They laundered hundreds of millions of dollars monthly through accounts at LCB and trade-based money laundering involving consumer goods worldwide, including through used car dealerships in the United States. The scheme involved wire transfers to U.S. banks to purchase used cars, which were then shipped to countries in West Africa. The proceeds from the car sales were repatriated back to Lebanon through bulk cash deposits among exchange houses. The Hezbollah-linked drug trafficking network laundered proceeds through a BMPE-styled scheme involving Asian-supplied consumer goods in Latin America. Funds for the goods were funneled through LCB's U.S. correspondent accounts. LCB's banking license was revoked in 2011, and its assets were sold to Societ\u00e9 Generale de Banque au Liban. The Banque du Liban revoked LCB's banking license in September 2011, and its former shareholders sold assets to Lebanese Societ\u00e9 Generale de Banque au Liban. Individuals linked to an illicit network faced financial sanctions and investigations in the U.S. Cash payments from narcotics trafficking were laundered through a BMPE scheme involving a Los Angeles toy wholesaler. The toy company received cash payments from Colombian and Mexican narcotics trafficking, which were laundered through a BMPE scheme. The cash deposits were kept under $10,000 to avoid reporting requirements. The company used the cash to buy toys from China, which were then exported to Colombia. The Colombian pesos from toy sales were used to reimburse the drug traffickers. Some employees had previously worked for a company involved in a similar scheme. The employees of Woody Toys had connections to Angel Toy Company, implicated in a toys-for-drugs scheme. The investigation benefitted from trade data sharing between the US and Colombia through Trade Transparency Units. Another money laundering scheme in the early 2000s involved cash couriers and money transfer services. In the early 2000s, a money laundering scheme involving cash couriers, money transfer services, and trade finance mechanisms was managed by an Indian national living in Dubai. The individual operated businesses in Dubai and affiliates in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the United States, opening letters of credit for importers to benefit affiliated exporters in India and other locations. The individual operated businesses in Dubai and affiliates in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the United States, opening letters of credit for importers to benefit affiliated exporters in India and other locations. These LCs were opened with inflated export values and drug trafficking funds, remitted to exporters in India under the guise of trade financing. The individual facilitated trade in banned goods by falsifying trade documents through his network of businesses in India, exporting goods at market value. Funds were moved offshore through hawala operators to settle the difference in value. To evade restrictions on banned goods from India, trade documents were falsified with inflated values. Hawala operators were used to reconcile the true and fraudulent values. U.S. government responses to trade-based money laundering include participation in the Financial Action Task Force and regulatory measures by the Treasury Department. The Department of Homeland Security's Trade Transparency Units are also utilized. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) was established in 1989 to develop AML/CFT guidelines. It consists of 34 member countries and 2 regional organizations. FATF conducts annual self-assessments and mutual evaluations to ensure compliance with its guidelines. Member countries failing to comply may be suspended. In 1990, FATF issued 40 recommendations to combat money laundering. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) issued 40 recommendations in 1990 to combat money laundering. The U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes leads the U.S. delegation to FATF, supporting global efforts against money laundering and terrorist financing. The United States strongly supports the FATF in centralizing efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. The U.S. delegation includes members from various government departments and financial regulators, developing U.S. positions and implementing actions domestically to meet commitments to the FATF. In 2012, FATF members adopted a revised set of the FATF 40 Recommendations, integrating CFT guidelines. The FATF adopted revised recommendations in 2012 and updated them in 2015 to include CFT guidelines and address new threats. The new mandate aims to enhance global surveillance of criminal and terrorist activities, strengthen partnerships with the private sector, and raise standards in low capacity countries. The revised recommendations by FATF aim to raise standards, address new threats, and strengthen obligations, especially in low capacity countries. The new standards focus on higher-risk situations, transparency requirements for beneficial ownership, and control of legal entities to combat tax transparency, corporate governance, and criminal activities. Recommendations to counter trade-based money laundering are not included. The FATF revised recommendations aim to address tax transparency, corporate governance, and criminal activities, but do not include specific recommendations to counter trade-based money laundering (TBML). Despite recognizing the increased opportunities for abuse in the international trade and financing system, the FATF has issued stand-alone reports on TBML and best practices. Surveys show a lack of comprehensive data on the extent of the TBML issue. Surveys by the FATF show a lack of comprehensive data on TBML. Most jurisdictions do not identify TBML separately from money laundering and lack training to detect TBML activities. FATF recommends developing training for detecting TBML. The FATF recommends jurisdictions develop specific training programs for detecting TBML, focusing on financial and trade data analysis to identify anomalies and criminal activities. FinCEN issues advisories and special measures to combat TBML, red-flagging activities indicative of money laundering for financial institutions. FinCEN issues advisories to help financial institutions detect trade-based money laundering (TBML) activities, providing red flags and specific guidance based on law enforcement experience. In May 2014, FinCEN issued an updated advisory on TBML, highlighting increased activity involving funnel accounts after restrictions on U.S. currency in Mexico. The advisory emphasized the need for consistent reporting of suspected TBML, including the use of specific abbreviations on SARs. The advisory warns about funnel accounts, where multiple cash deposits are made in one area below reporting thresholds and withdrawn in another area quickly. It also mentions red flags associated with Mexican criminal organizations. FinCEN has started using Geographic Targeting Orders more frequently to track such activities. In 1988, Geographic Targeting Orders (GTOs) were authorized to impose time-limited recordkeeping and reporting requirements on financial institutions or businesses in specific areas to aid in identifying criminal activity. GTOs can only last for a maximum of 180 days and violators may face civil or criminal penalties. Recent GTOs have been used to combat trade-based money laundering (TBML), such as one issued in April 2015 for Miami-based electronics exporters. The GTO issued for Miami-based electronics exporters lowered cash reporting thresholds to $3,000 and required additional recordkeeping for transactions. FinCEN aimed to combat TBML schemes by Sinaloa and Los Zetas organizations. The GTO was renewed for 180 days in October 2015. In October 2015, FinCEN renewed a GTO targeting businesses in the Los Angeles Fashion District to combat drug traffickers exploiting the fashion industry for illegal activities. The GTO lowered cash reporting to $3,000 and imposed additional recordkeeping requirements. FinCEN, under the USA PATRIOT Act, can require U.S. financial institutions to take regulatory special measures against entities deemed to be of \"primary money laundering concern.\" These measures range from enhanced due diligence to prohibiting certain accounts. This action may align with other Treasury Department actions, including those by the Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC). In April 2013, FinCEN designated two Lebanese exchange houses, Halawi Exchange and Rmeiti Exchange, as primary money laundering concerns due to their involvement in a large-scale TBML scheme. According to U.S. government information, Halawi Exchange and Rmeiti Exchange were designated as primary money laundering concerns for their involvement in a TBML scheme and providing services for an international narcotics trafficking network linked to Hezbollah. ICE/HSI established the first Trade Transparency Unit in Washington, DC in 2004. Homeland Security Investigations (ICE/HSI) established the first Trade Transparency Unit in Washington, DC in 2004 to examine trade anomalies and financial irregularities in domestic and foreign trade data. TTUs identify instances of TBML, customs fraud, contraband smuggling, and tax evasion for further law enforcement investigation, often with funding support from the Department of State's Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL). TTUs have been set up in various countries with the help of HSI and Treasury. The State Department, HSI, and Treasury have established Trade Transparency Units (TTUs) in various countries to combat trade-based money laundering (TBML). These TTUs aim to develop an international network similar to the Egmont Group of FIUs. The 2007 National Money Laundering Strategy prioritized attacking TBML and called for ICE-led TTUs to facilitate trade data exchange. The State Department notes a growing number of TBML investigations stemming from TTU activities, with over $1 billion seized so far. The State Department reports a growing number of TBML investigations from TTU activities, with over $1 billion seized. The 114th Congress has addressed TBML in hearings focusing on specific terrorist groups like Hezbollah and regional security priorities in Latin America. Policy responses to anti-money laundering and terrorist financing have also been discussed in general hearings. The 114th Congress has shown interest in the links between trade-based money laundering (TBML) and terrorist financing. Witnesses in hearings have raised concerns about the effectiveness of U.S. and international efforts to combat TBML, including the role of trade transparency units (TTUs) and resources allocated to them. Discussions have also touched on the potential connection between U.S. trade policy, free trade agreements, and commitments to combat TBML through the establishment of TTUs. The 114th Congress has been interested in the links between trade-based money laundering (TBML) and terrorist financing. Some policymakers are concerned about these links, citing examples implicating Hezbollah in TBML schemes. In December 2015, the Congress enacted the Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015 to impose additional financial restrictions on Hezbollah-linked foreign financial activities. The 114th Congress enacted the Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015, directing the President to impose financial restrictions on Hezbollah-linked foreign financial institutions. OFAC issued a final rule for implementing the Act on April 15, 2016. OFAC issued a final rule for implementing the Hizballah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015 on April 15, 2016. President Obama is committed to imposing sanctions on Hezbollah operatives and supporters. The Treasury Department intends to implement the Act robustly while preserving the Lebanese financial system. Congress may continue to monitor Hezbollah's financing activities. The Financing Prevention Act of 2015 aims to address trade-based money laundering (TBML) while preserving the Lebanese financial system. Congress is monitoring the implementation of the Act and other financial tools to combat TBML. Hearings have discussed TBML, with one specifically focusing on the topic.
