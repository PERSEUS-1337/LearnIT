    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Business Supply Chain Transparency on Trafficking and Slavery Act of 2015\". The Congress finds and expresses its sense regarding the issue. Congress finds that in 2014, the Department of Labor identified 136 goods from 74 countries made by forced labor and child labor. The United States, as the largest importer, faces increasing demands for information on human rights impact of products. Consumers lack standing to enforce provisions of the Smoot Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 in US courts. The Smoot Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 allows civil action in US courts to enforce a provision against goods made with forced or convict labor. There is a broad exception for goods not produced in sufficient quantities in the US. Fewer than 40 enforcement actions have been recorded in the past 80 years. Federal laws provide mechanisms to prevent and punish forced labor, slavery, and human trafficking. Federal laws aim to prevent and punish forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor in the stream of commerce, but face challenges due to limited scope and lack of information on tainted supply chains. The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2003 and the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2005 allow for the termination of Federal contracts with contractors involved in these crimes. The Victims Protection Act of 2005 (Public Law 109-164) allows for the termination of Federal contracts if a contractor engages in trafficking or forced labor. It also grants U.S. courts jurisdiction over Federal employees involved in these crimes abroad. Federal courts abroad have jurisdiction over Federal employees, contractors, or subcontractors involved in severe forms of trafficking or forced labor. Executive orders and legislation have prohibited these individuals from engaging in trafficking-related activities. Federal contractors, subcontractors, and their employees are prohibited from engaging in trafficking-related activities such as charging labor recruitment fees, confiscating passports, and using fraudulent recruitment practices. They must also maintain an anti-trafficking compliance plan. Employees must maintain an anti-trafficking compliance plan with a complaint mechanism to prevent subcontractors from engaging in trafficking. Congress recognizes forced labor, slavery, and human trafficking as severe abuses for profit. The legislative framework to prevent goods produced by forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor from entering the US commerce is inadequate. Legislation is needed to inform consumers about products free from these abuses, allowing businesses and consumers to avoid supporting them unintentionally. Consumers can prevent supporting crimes by avoiding tainted products in the supply chains. SEC. 3.
