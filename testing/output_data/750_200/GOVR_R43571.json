    "content": "Federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs have been in place since the National Defense Education Act of 1958. These programs offer borrowers the opportunity to have their student loan debt forgiven or repaid in exchange for service in certain professions or occupations. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs have been enacted to forgive or repay student loan debt in exchange for work in specific fields or meeting certain conditions. Over 50 federal programs exist, with around 30 operational as of October 1, 2017. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs, also known as cancellation or discharge programs, involve the federal government forgiving, canceling, or discharging a portion of a borrower's student loan debt or making loan payments on their behalf. These benefits are often tied to completing a period of employment in public service or certain occupations, but are increasingly being offered as part of income-driven repayment plans. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs are offered as part of income-driven student loan repayment plans. These programs aim to provide financial incentives for entering public service or high-need professions, as well as offer debt relief to borrowers who have not fully repaid their student loans after an extended period of time. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs provide debt relief to borrowers of federal student loans who enter public service or specific professions, or repay their loans through an income-driven repayment plan. Other forms of debt relief, such as loan discharge for disabled borrowers, may also be available. Loan forgiveness programs offer debt relief to federal student loan borrowers in public service or specific professions, or through income-driven repayment plans. Other forms of debt relief include loan discharge for disabled borrowers, closure of borrower's school, false certification of eligibility, unauthorized loans, unpaid refunds, successful defense to repayment, and bankruptcy discharge. The NDSL was one of the earliest federal student loan programs to offer loan forgiveness. The NDSL program, established in response to the Soviet Union's Sputnik satellite launch in 1957, aimed to improve education programs for national security. The NDSL program was created by Congress in response to national security concerns following the Soviet Union's Sputnik satellite launch. It provided low-interest loans to college students and included a student loan forgiveness component to encourage more teachers in U.S. schools. The NDSL program was established by Congress to provide low-interest loans to college students and included a student loan forgiveness component for teachers in U.S. schools. Eligible teachers could have up to half of their student loans cancelled, with benefits targeted at those teaching low-income students or students with disabilities. Loan forgiveness was also available to individuals in Head Start programs and those serving in the Armed Forces. The NDSL program, established by Congress, provided low-interest loans to college students with a student loan forgiveness component for teachers, individuals in Head Start programs, and those serving in the Armed Forces. Borrowers could have a portion of their loans canceled based on years of public service completed. The program was later renamed the Federal Perkins Loan Program and other federal student loan forgiveness programs were established for different professions. Several federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs were established after the NDSL program, targeting borrowers in various professions and high-need areas. One such program, the Health Professions Student Loan Program, offered loan forgiveness for medical practitioners in underserved areas. Currently, there are over 50 student loan repayment and forgiveness programs in existence. The report identifies over 50 federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs authorized by federal law. It provides brief descriptions of these programs for policymakers, not intended to be comprehensive. For detailed information on a specific program, readers are encouraged to refer to additional resources. The report outlines over 50 federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs authorized by federal law. These programs are designed to provide debt relief to borrowers through various criteria such as service types, professions, locations, or repayment plans. Detailed information can be found in additional resources like federal statutes, regulations, and agency guidance. The report outlines over 50 federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs authorized by federal law, providing debt relief through various criteria such as service types, professions, locations, or repayment plans. These programs have unique characteristics and are funded differently, with varying borrower eligibility criteria and benefit amounts. The report describes various federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs, each with unique criteria for debt relief. Borrowers must meet specific requirements such as working in certain professions or locations for a set period to qualify for benefits. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs require borrowers to work in specific roles or locations for a set time or repay based on income-driven plans. After the specified period, some or all of the qualifying student loan debt is forgiven. The availability of benefits may be included in the loan terms. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs differ in how benefits are provided to borrowers. Loan forgiveness is considered an entitlement to qualified borrowers, while loan repayment benefits are discretionary and subject to fund availability. Loan forgiveness benefits are broadly available to borrowers of qualified loans. Loan forgiveness benefits are available to borrowers of qualified loans and are considered entitlements. Borrowers who meet the eligibility criteria set forth in the loan terms and conditions are entitled to these benefits, which are funded through mandatory appropriations. Loan forgiveness benefits are funded through mandatory appropriations and are accounted for as part of federal student loan subsidy costs. There are two categories of loan forgiveness: for public service employment and following income-driven repayment. Loan repayment programs offer debt relief for specific service, profession, or location. The entity administering a loan repayment program typically repays some or all of the borrower's student loan debt. Loan forgiveness programs involve the entity administering a loan repayment program repaying some or all of the borrower's student loan debt. These programs are separate from federal student loan programs and are designed to address employment needs or help federal agencies recruit and retain qualified employees. Loan repayment benefits are offered to address shortages in specific occupations or locations and help federal agencies recruit and retain qualified employees. These benefits are discretionary and subject to fund availability. Recipients may incur federal income tax liability. The types of debt relief programs examined in this report vary in terms of federal income tax liability. Debt forgiven under an employment-focused loan forgiveness program is usually excluded from gross income for tax purposes, while debt forgiven under income-driven repayment or public service employment may be included in gross income, leading to tax liability for the borrower. Repayment or forgiveness for public service employment may result in income tax liability for the borrower. Three categories of debt relief programs are examined: loan forgiveness for public service employment, loan forgiveness following income-driven repayment, and loan repayment for public service employment. Eligible loans may be included in federal loan forgiveness. Three categories of loans eligible for federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs: 1. Federal student loans under Title IV of the Higher Education Act administered by the Department of Education. 2. Student loans under Title VII and Title VIII of the Public Health Service Act administered by the Department of Health and Human Services. 3. Private education loans. Private education loans may also be eligible for federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs, in addition to federal student loans under Title IV of the Higher Education Act and student loans under Title VII and Title VIII of the Public Health Service Act. Federal student loans are currently only made through the Direct Loan program authorized under Part D of Title IV. Federal student loans were previously made through the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program and the Federal Perkins Loan program, in addition to the Direct Loan program authorized under Part D of Title IV. FFEL program loans had terms similar to Direct Loan program loans. The Federal Perkins Loan program was authorized under Part E of Title IV. Until September 30, 2017, federal student loans were made through the Federal Perkins Loan program under Part E of Title IV. In the Direct Loan program, government loans are funded with federal capital, administered by ED, and managed by federal contractors. The FFEL program involved nonfederal lenders using nonfederal capital to originate, hold, and service loans. Nonprofit guaranty agencies oversaw federal loan insurance and loan forgiveness benefits. During the period when the FFEL and Direct Loan programs operated, loans were made through each program with similar borrower terms. Differences included availability of loan forgiveness benefits. Perkins Loans were made by institutions of higher education with federal capital. In the Perkins Loan program, institutions of higher education served as lenders and were responsible for originating and servicing loans. Direct Subsidized Loans are available to undergraduate students with financial need in the Direct Loan program. In the Direct Loan program, Direct Subsidized Loans are available to undergraduate students with financial need. The federal government subsidizes these loans by not charging interest while the borrower is enrolled at least half-time, during a grace period before repayment, and during deferment periods. Borrowing limits apply, and in FY2017, 6.2 million Direct Subsidized Loans were issued. In FY2017, 6.2 million Direct Subsidized Loans totaling $21.5 billion were made available to undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. Direct Unsubsidized Loans are non-need-based loans that can be used to cover a student's cost of attendance. The borrower is responsible for paying all the interest on these loans. In FY2017, 8.1 million Direct Unsubsidized Loans totaling $49.8 billion were made available. Borrowers are responsible for paying all accrued interest, with the option to defer payments until the loan enters repayment status. Direct PLUS Loans are for parents of dependent undergraduate students and graduate/professional students. In FY2017, Direct PLUS Loans were available for parents of undergraduate students dependent on them for financial support, as well as graduate and professional students. These non-need-based loans can be used to cover postsecondary education expenses not covered by the student's EFC. Borrowing limits are based on the COA of the student minus their estimated financial assistance from other sources. In FY2017, Direct PLUS Loans totaling $12.5 billion were made to parents of undergraduate students and $9.9 billion to graduate and professional students. Direct Consolidation Loans allow borrowers to combine federal student loans into a single loan. Consolidation Loans can include loans from various federal student loan programs like Direct Loan, FFEL, HPSL, LDS, NSL, and HEAL. This feature is important for loan forgiveness and repayment programs. Consolidation Loans combine various federal student loan types to extend forgiveness and repayment benefits. Direct Consolidation Loans have fixed interest rates based on the weighted average of consolidated loans. In FY2017, 0.9 million Direct Consolidation Loans totaling $48.8 billion were issued, including Perkins Loans. In FY2017, 0.9 million Direct Consolidation Loans totaling $48.8 billion were made, including Perkins Loans available to undergraduate and graduate students. Perkins Loans have a fixed interest rate of 5% per year and offer loan cancellation for certain public service work. In FY2017, approximately 253,000 Perkins Loans totaling $782.23 million were made. HRSA, within HHS, offers low-interest rate loans to health professions students in dentistry, optometry, pharmacy, podiatric medicine, and veterinary medicine. In academic year 2016-2017, a total of 20,849 loans were provided for approximately $162.8 million. The program offers low interest rate loans to full-time students pursuing degrees in dentistry, optometry, pharmacy, podiatric medicine, or veterinary medicine. Administered by schools, it is for financially needy US citizens, nationals, or lawful permanent residents. In 2016-2017, HRSA estimated 6,842 loans totaling $64.2 million. Additionally, the program provides 5% fixed interest rate loans to full-time students pursuing degrees in allopathic or osteopathic medicine, administered by individual medical schools. Participants must be US citizens, nationals, or lawful permanent residents. The Primary Care Loan Program offers low-interest loans to students pursuing degrees in allopathic or osteopathic medicine. Participants must be US citizens, nationals, or lawful permanent residents and commit to completing a residency and practicing in a primary care field for 10 years. Loan recipients who do not meet the service requirements face a higher interest rate of 7%. In 2016-2017, HRSA estimated making 252 loans totaling $17.8 million. The Primary Care Loan Program offers low-interest loans to students from disadvantaged backgrounds pursuing degrees in various healthcare fields. Recipients must commit to practicing in primary care for 10 years. Failure to meet service requirements results in a higher interest rate of 7%. In 2016-2017, HRSA estimated making 252 loans totaling $17.8 million. The Primary Care Loan Program offers low-interest loans to students pursuing healthcare degrees in fields like nursing, optometry, podiatry, pharmacy, or veterinary medicine. Administered by individual schools, the program selects financially needy students who are U.S. citizens, nationals, or lawful permanent residents. In 2016-2017, HRSA estimated making 1,619 loans totaling $21.7 million for various healthcare fields. The Nursing Faculty Loan Program provides loans to registered nurses pursuing graduate studies to become nursing school faculty. Administered by nursing schools, the program offers loan forgiveness options. In 2016-2017, HRSA estimated making 1,998 loans totaling $27.3 million. The Health Education Assistance Loans (HEAL) program, authorized in Title VII, Part A-I of the PHSA, no longer makes new loans but continues to administer outstanding loans for various healthcare degrees. The Health Education Assistance Loans (HEAL) program no longer issues new loans but manages existing loans for healthcare degrees such as veterinary medicine, optometry, podiatry, public health, pharmacy, chiropractic, and graduate programs in health administration and allied health professions. Borrowers are still responsible for loan payments. Student loans are also offered by private financial institutions, state-supported programs, and institutions of higher education. Private education loans, also known as alternative loans, are offered by private financial institutions, state-supported programs, and institutions of higher education. The terms and conditions of these loans are determined by the lender. Some federal loan repayment programs may offer benefits to borrowers of certain types of private education loans. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs aim to provide debt relief to eligible borrowers. Student loan forgiveness and repayment programs offer debt relief to eligible borrowers based on specific criteria. These programs have unique characteristics and features, categorized into three groups with qualifying criteria. Various program components help classify and examine the different relief options available. The curr_chunk discusses program components used to classify debt relief programs, including types of qualifying service, borrower economic circumstances, debt relief amounts and timing, and exclusions or limitations on benefits. It presents the primary categories of debt relief programs in order of availability to borrowers. For program-specific details, refer to Appendix A. This section outlines the primary categories of debt relief programs based on their availability to borrowers. It starts with loan forgiveness entitlement programs, followed by programs for public service and income-driven repayment plans. Next are programs for broad public service or employment needs, which are limited in availability and scale compared to loan forgiveness programs. Loan forgiveness for public service employment provides debt relief to qualified borrowers in certain occupations or public service. These programs are more narrowly targeted and smaller in scale compared to other loan repayment programs. Loan forgiveness for public service employment offers debt relief to qualified borrowers in specific occupations or with certain employers. These benefits are entitlements written into federal student loans and are potentially available to a large number of borrowers. Table 1 summarizes the various forgiveness programs available, highlighting eligibility criteria such as single specified employer, multiple eligible employers, or no specific employer requirement. The table summarizes forgiveness programs for public service employment, detailing eligibility criteria based on employer and occupation requirements, as well as economic circumstances during repayment. Programs are ranked by size of benefits provided. Table 1 ranks forgiveness programs by benefit size and outlines eligibility criteria based on service type and occupation. Loan forgiveness benefits are available to a wide range of borrowers, but specific criteria must be met, such as completing a certain service or entering a particular profession. Teachers are eligible for all three programs, while Federal Perkins Loan Cancellation is also open to those in specific public service roles. Loan forgiveness programs are available to teachers, law enforcement personnel, public defenders, and individuals in public service roles. Service commitments typically range from 1 to 10 years for partial or full benefits. Loan forgiveness programs require a minimum service commitment period, ranging from 1 to 10 years. These programs provide debt relief to borrowers who repay federal student loans based on their income for an extended period but have not fully repaid their debt. The benefits are entitlements written into the terms of widely available federal student loans. Loan forgiveness programs for federal student loans are available to qualified borrowers, distinct from public service employment programs. Table 2 summarizes various forgiveness programs based on income-driven repayment, organized by eligibility start date. These programs do not group borrowers by availability or financial scope like those in Table 1. Table 2 shows that income-driven repayment programs offer loan forgiveness to a wide range of eligible borrowers, without grouping them by availability or financial resources. Income-driven repayment programs offer loan forgiveness to borrowers who meet income-driven qualifications, without specific employer or occupational requirements. Borrowers must make monthly payments towards their federal student loans for 20 to 25 years, based on factors like debt amount, family size, and income. Monthly payments are capped at a percentage of discretionary income. Income-driven repayment programs offer loan forgiveness based on factors like student loan debt, family size, and income. Monthly payments are capped at a percentage of discretionary income. Public service employment can also provide debt relief benefits to borrowers in specific occupations or employers. Loan repayment programs for public service employment are used to meet employment needs or shortages and help government agencies recruit and retain qualified employees. These programs are not entitlements and are available to a limited number of qualified borrowers, subject to program funds. Loan repayment programs for broad employment needs or shortages are available to qualified borrowers on a limited scale, subject to program funds. Table 3 summarizes these programs, indicating benefits for borrowers employed with specified employers, multiple eligible employers, or no specific employer. Loan repayment programs are available to borrowers employed with specified employers, multiple eligible employers, or no specific employer, as well as those in specified occupations or multiple eligible occupations. Economic circumstances may also be a factor in qualifying for these programs. The table organizes programs by operational status and administering department or agency. Table 3 displays various employment needs addressed by 19 loan repayment programs, with a focus on health-related occupations. In total, there are 19 loan repayment programs, with 15 targeting health-related occupations, including addressing health care provider shortages and health care faculty needs. Other targeted occupations include legal professions and large animal veterinarians providing emergency services. Borrowers can fulfill service obligations by working for multiple employers within the same class of employers. Loan repayment programs allow borrowers to work for multiple employers within the same class, often in underserved areas. Service commitments typically last between one and five years, targeting specific occupations like health care providers and legal professionals. These programs aim to recruit and retain federal government employees to meet agency-specific needs. Loan repayment programs for federal government employees are narrowly targeted to meet agency-specific needs and are potentially the smallest in scale. Information on the programs' scale is often not readily available, but the Office of Personnel Management reports on the number of agencies participating, beneficiaries, and benefits received. Table 4 summarizes various federal government employee loan repayment programs, detailing eligibility criteria such as agency-specific benefits, occupational requirements, and qualification criteria. Table 4 summarizes federal government employee loan repayment programs based on eligibility criteria, including agency-specific benefits and occupational requirements. Programs are organized by operational status and administering department. Unlike Table 1, these programs are not grouped by availability or financial resources due to inconsistent data. Table 4 summarizes federal government employee loan repayment programs, including 25 programs operated by federal agencies to recruit and retain qualified employees. 8 programs are specifically for members of the Armed Forces, with varying availability to employees within agencies or specific occupations. Loan repayment programs in federal agencies vary in availability, with some open to any employee while others are specific to designated fields or occupations. Participants must commit to serving for a minimum period, typically between one and five years. Borrowers in loan repayment programs must serve for a minimum period of one to five years, with eligibility based on economic circumstances. Programs may consider economic status at borrowing or during repayment for benefits. Some loan repayment programs consider borrowers' economic circumstances at borrowing or during repayment to determine eligibility for benefits, such as debt relief based on income percentage or disadvantaged background. Loan forgiveness amounts vary among programs. Loan repayment programs consider borrowers' economic circumstances and expected monthly loan payment. Programs offer loan forgiveness or repayment benefits based on specific criteria. Benefits can include forgiving the entire outstanding balance, repaying a flat dollar amount, or a percentage of the loan. Some programs forgive the entire amount of an individual's outstanding student loans. Several programs offer to forgive the entire amount of an individual's outstanding student loans by requiring a certain number of payments towards the balance. Employers may also provide repayment benefits in the form of a flat dollar amount, either as a lump sum or regular payments. Some loan forgiveness and repayment programs offer payments in lump sums or regular installments. Programs may also provide flat rates based on the type of service. Restrictions may apply, and defaulters are usually ineligible for benefits. Repayment programs have restrictions that may limit benefits for defaulters. Some programs require U.S. citizenship for eligibility and penalize borrowers who do not complete their service term. Some federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs penalize borrowers for not completing their service term or for benefiting from multiple programs for the same service. For example, the Stafford Loan Forgiveness for Teachers program does not allow benefits if the same service is used for other programs like PSLF or AmeriCorps Education Awards. Some loan forgiveness and repayment programs have eligibility requirements such as being a U.S. citizen, national, or legal permanent resident. Certain programs may not allow benefits if already receiving benefits from another program, but eligibility may be possible once obligations are fulfilled. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs have eligibility requirements based on citizenship and immigration status. Federal student loans under the Higher Education Act are only available to U.S. citizens, nationals, legal permanent residents, and specified eligible noncitizens. Programs like the PSLF program are restricted to specific types of loans, such as Direct Loan program loans. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs have eligibility requirements based on citizenship and immigration status. Availability of benefits for defaulted loans depends on certain characteristics. For example, in the Direct Loan Stafford Loan Forgiveness for Teachers program, borrowers may be ineligible for teacher loan forgiveness on defaulted loans. In the Stafford Loan Forgiveness for Teachers program, borrowers may be ineligible for teacher loan forgiveness on defaulted loans. However, loan forgiveness may be granted to borrowers who have made satisfactory repayment arrangements. In the Perkins Loan Cancellation program, borrowers of defaulted loans may qualify for loan forgiveness under certain conditions. Clawback provisions in federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs may require participants to repay benefits if they fail to complete service obligations. Repayment amounts can vary, including the benefit received plus interest or punitive fees. In federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs, participants may be required to repay benefits received, plus interest and punitive fees. Student loan debt forgiven or repaid on a borrower's behalf is typically included in gross income for federal income taxation, but there are exceptions for certain instances. Student loan forgiveness and repayment benefits may be excluded from gross income for federal income taxation under certain instances, as specified by authorizing statutes. For example, the HEA excludes forgiven Federal Perkins Loans from gross income. Student loan forgiveness and repayment benefits may be excluded from gross income if certain conditions in IRC Section 108(f) are met. Loans must have been borrowed for education, contain cancellation terms for work in specific professions, and be made by specified lenders. Additionally, exclusions are provided for the National Health Service Corps. The loan forgiveness and repayment benefits must meet specific conditions outlined in IRC Section 108(f). Exclusions are provided for certain loan programs, including the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment program and state programs under the Public Health Service Act. If the requirements are not met, individuals are responsible for paying income tax on the forgiven or repaid loan amounts. Many loan forgiveness and repayment programs offer funds to offset tax liability for borrowers. Excluding these benefits from gross income can help recipients avoid significant taxation. However, there is debate over the revenue loss from excluding student loan debt forgiveness and repayment from taxation. In FY2017, revenue was lost due to the exclusion of income from student loan debt forgiveness and repayment from taxation. Researchers debate the effectiveness of these benefits in encouraging borrowers to enter specific fields or government service. Key issues include whether individuals would enter these fields without loan forgiveness and if student loan debt is the main barrier. The effectiveness of student loan forgiveness and repayment programs in encouraging individuals to enter specific fields or government service is debated. Key issues include whether student loan debt is the main barrier and if individuals would enter these fields without the prospect of loan forgiveness or repayment. Additionally, the cost of these programs to the federal government relative to the benefits received is another aspect to consider. The analysis discusses the effectiveness of loan forgiveness and repayment programs in influencing individuals' career choices and the costs incurred by the federal government. It considers whether recipients would have entered qualifying service without these programs. The effectiveness of loan forgiveness and repayment programs in influencing career choices and the lack of evaluations for federal programs like NIH's Intramural Research Program. The NIH's loan repayment component aims to encourage medical research careers at the NIH and in general. Recipients were more likely to continue medical research at the NIH. The NIH's loan repayment program aims to encourage medical research careers, with recipients more likely to continue in the field. The program may be meeting its goals, but other factors also influence individuals' decisions to stay in medical research positions. Some individuals may have chosen certain fields or positions even without loan repayments, making the program potentially ineffective. For example, in recent years, law school graduates facing limited job opportunities may opt for public interest or government jobs. Some law school graduates may choose public interest or government jobs due to limited private sector opportunities, regardless of loan repayment benefits. However, evidence suggests that in some cases, participants would not have taken certain positions without loan repayment programs. For instance, healthcare providers in rural areas would still practice there even without loan repayment awards. The NIH found that participants in its loan repayment program were more likely to stay due to the attractive benefit, especially physicians with competing job offers. This demonstrates the importance of loan repayment as a recruitment and retention tool. Other federal agencies have also seen the benefits of loan repayment programs. The NIH found that loan repayment programs are effective at recruiting and retaining staff. However, some aspects of program design may undermine its effectiveness, such as uncertain funding leading to availability of benefits being uncertain for individuals. Job applicants may not know if they will receive a loan repayment award until after accepting a job. A recruitment incentive may be hard to determine as job applicants are unsure if they will receive a loan repayment award until after accepting a job. Loan repayment amounts may not be sufficient to attract individuals to certain professions. Researchers suggest that successful loan repayment programs should offer meaningful financial benefits to offset education costs. The Government Employee Student Loan Repayment Program (GESLRP) requires participants to pay federal income taxes on the loan repayment amount, which can be up to 39%. This tax liability makes the program less attractive to participants compared to if benefits were tax-exempt. The Government Employee Student Loan Repayment Program requires participants to pay federal income taxes on the loan repayment amount, which can account for 39% of the repayment. Some agencies suggest that this tax liability makes the program less attractive to participants. Additionally, the short-term nature of many programs may lead to turnover and a less stable workforce for employers. Individuals with service obligations have been found to have shorter tenures in a position compared to those without obligations. Some researchers found that individuals with service obligations have shorter tenures in a position. The assessment of loan forgiveness and repayment programs questions if student loan debt influences career choices. Debt may not always impact career decisions significantly, as other factors play a role. Researchers have found that career choices are complex, with debt having little effect on job choices. Various deterrents, such as lower compensation and geographic limitations, can impact student interest in specific fields. The National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program offers benefits to physicians in primary care, but other reasons may also deter them from entering the field. Physicians may not choose primary care medicine due to lower compensation, preference for specialties, or reluctance to take on administrative duties. Debt levels can also influence career decisions, especially for certain racial and ethnic groups. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs are available to address this issue. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs provide financial incentives for individuals to enter lower-paying fields like primary care medicine, but the amount received is generally far less than the lifetime earnings gap between primary care and specialty physicians. This disparity cannot fully offset the $3.5 million difference in lifetime earnings between the two specialties. Physicians in primary care earn $3.5 million less than specialty physicians, making it difficult for loan repayments to compensate for the earnings gap. Research shows that high levels of debt influence job choices, with graduates often opting for higher-paying positions to offset their debt burden. Researchers have found that undergraduates with higher debt levels tend to choose higher salary jobs over education-related or nonprofit fields. Law school debt levels may play a secondary role in job choices, with demographic characteristics being a more dominant factor. The decision-making process for law school graduates in choosing occupations after graduation may be influenced more by demographic characteristics than by student loan repayment programs. There is a question of whether loan forgiveness programs lead students to take on more debt for their education expenses. Forgiveness programs like income-driven repayment plans and PSLF encourage students to finance more of their education with loans. Monthly payments are based on income, not amount owed, and borrowers may receive forgiveness of their entire loan balance after meeting certain conditions. Forgiveness programs like income-driven repayment plans and PSLF tie payments to income, not debt amount, and offer loan forgiveness after meeting specific conditions. Monthly payments are limited to a portion of discretionary income, and some argue this may lead to student over-borrowing and less sensitivity to education costs. Some argue that forgiveness programs like income-driven repayment plans and PSLF may lead to student over-borrowing and less sensitivity to education costs. The costs incurred by the government for loan forgiveness and repayment benefits depend on the program structure. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs have three categories of costs: loan subsidy costs, appropriated program costs, and administrative costs. These programs offer benefits incorporated into federal student loans, classified as federal credit programs. The federal credit programs consist of federal direct loans and loan guarantees, with costs funded through mandatory appropriations. The costs are measured based on estimated long-term costs to the government, as required by the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990. The federal budget reflects the costs of making or guaranteeing loans, including the subsidy cost of loans and administrative costs. Loan subsidy cost is the estimated present value of cash flows from the government, less the cash flows to the government, resulting from a direct loan or loan guarantee. The loan subsidy cost is the estimated present value of cash flows from the government, less the cash flows to the government, resulting from a direct loan or loan guarantee. A positive cost means a cost to the government, while a negative cost means the government earns a positive return. Loan forgiveness benefits alter expected cash flows and increase program costs. Loan forgiveness benefits, such as Stafford Loan Forgiveness to Teachers in the Direct Loan program, result in a decrease in cash flows to the government as a portion of the borrower's loan balance is discharged. This leads to an increase in loan subsidy costs for the program. Loan forgiveness benefits reduce cash flows to the government by discharging a portion of the borrower's loan balance, leading to increased loan subsidy costs for the program. The estimated cost of providing these benefits is accounted for in the fiscal year the loan was made. Other examples include the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program and loan forgiveness after completing the maximum repayment period in income-based repayment plans. Loan forgiveness programs like PSLF and forgiveness after the maximum repayment period in IBR and ICR plans are funded through appropriations for the fiscal year. Early loan repayment may impact subsidy costs, which can be funded through discretionary or mandatory appropriations. Funding for loan forgiveness programs is provided through discretionary or mandatory appropriations. Availability of benefits depends on appropriations and fund availability, leading to potential limitations in extending benefits to all eligible borrowers. Examples of programs funded through discretionary appropriations include GESLR and JRJ Loan Repayment. The Perkins Loan Cancellation benefits are unique in their funding method, specified in loan terms and conditions. Eligible borrowers must be granted loan forgiveness by the institution. The Perkins Loan program offers unique loan forgiveness benefits, funded through discretionary appropriations. Despite no recent funding, qualified borrowers continue to have their loans canceled. Since FY2009, qualified borrowers have had their Perkins Loans canceled without funding being appropriated. Institutions absorbing costs of loan cancellation without reimbursement from the federal government. ED maintains reimbursement records for eligible institutions. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs are considered programmatic costs funded through appropriations. Administrative costs are accounted for separately, with variation in funding across different agencies. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs are funded through annual appropriations, with variation in how administrative costs are funded across different agencies. Limited information is available on the actual costs to the government of these programs, with some programs only having estimates of future forgiveness amounts or number of loans. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs are funded through annual appropriations, with limited information available on the actual costs to the government. Data on debt relief provided and number of recipients is presented for some programs in Appendix A. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs are funded through annual appropriations, with limited information available on the actual costs to the government. Data on debt relief provided and number of recipients is presented for some programs in Appendix A. For the Direct Loan Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, estimated costs to the government were $1.5 billion over FY2008-FY2012, with $1.2 billion associated with loans made prior to FY2008. In FY2008, the Department of Education (ED) did not provide estimates of the number of borrowers expected to receive loan forgiveness benefits. For the Revised Pay-As-You-Earn (REPAYE) repayment plan, approximately 6 million borrowers will be eligible, with an estimated cost of $15.4 billion. In the Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) repayment plan, ED estimated costs in a 2012 NPRM. The availability of the REPAYE plan would cost approximately $15.4 billion, while the PAYE plan was estimated to cost $2.1 billion over a 10-year period. Approximately 1.67 million borrowers were estimated to elect the PAYE plan, with 400,000 expected to receive loan forgiveness. The average original loan balance of borrowers receiving forgiveness was also estimated. The Education Department estimated that borrowers receiving loan forgiveness under the PAYE plan would have an average original loan balance of $39,500. Additionally, borrowers under the IBR plan for post-July 1, 2014 cohorts were projected to have an average of $41,000 in loans forgiven. The number of borrowers realizing forgiveness benefits under the IBR plan for pre-July 1, 2014 was not provided. The Education Department estimated that borrowers under the IBR plan for pre-July 1, 2014 cohorts would have some portion of their student loan debt forgiven after 25 years. For the FY2009 cohort, 44,000 borrowers were estimated to have debt forgiven, and for the FY2012 cohort, 52,000 borrowers were estimated to have debt forgiven after 25 years. The Education Department estimated that borrowers under the IBR plan would have some debt forgiven after 25 years. Congress may explore whether changes should be made to federal student loan forgiveness and repayment programs. Several issues related to loan forgiveness and repayment programs may be examined, such as the availability of multiple programs for borrowers engaging in similar activities, the potential financial benefits for borrowers, and the effectiveness of existing programs in achieving their intended purposes. Multiple student loan forgiveness and repayment programs may overlap if they have similar goals and activities, leading to potential duplication of benefits and administrative costs. Individuals could qualify for benefits under multiple programs, raising questions about the efficiency of government spending. Multiple student loan forgiveness and repayment programs may overlap, potentially leading to duplication of benefits and administrative costs. Recipients could qualify for benefits from multiple sources for the same service performed, raising concerns about government spending efficiency. An individual working in a federal agency may receive up to $10,000 per year in loan repayment benefits under the Government Employee Student Loan Repayment program (GESLRP) and qualify for forgiveness of the remainder of their student loan debt after 10 years of service with 120 monthly payments under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program (PSLF). This could result in receiving benefits from two programs simultaneously. The GESLRP offers benefits towards qualifying for loan forgiveness under the PSLF. Overlapping programs may result in individuals receiving benefits from multiple programs for the same service. For example, the NELRP and NFLRP provide repayment benefits to nurse faculty at accredited nursing schools. The Nursing Faculty Loan Repayment Program (NFLRP) and the Nurse Education Loan Repayment Program (NELRP) offer repayment benefits to nurse faculty at accredited nursing schools. Both programs aim to increase the number of qualified nursing faculty and are administered by the Department of Health and Human Services. However, NFLRP grants money to nursing schools to establish their own loan repayment programs, creating potential administrative burdens for HRSA. The Nursing Faculty Loan Repayment Program (NFLRP) and the Nurse Education Loan Repayment Program (NELRP) may be creating an administrative burden on the HRSA by offering double benefits to the same group of individuals. Congress may need to consider combining, altering, or abolishing these programs to avoid duplication. Loan forgiveness and repayment programs aim to encourage individuals to enter specified jobs. Many loan forgiveness and repayment programs aim to recruit individuals for specific jobs or public service. Some programs may provide windfalls to individuals who would have entered the field regardless of benefits available, as there are no limits on forgiveness amounts under certain plans. Some loan forgiveness programs have no limits on forgiven amounts, such as the Direct Loan Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. Concerns have been raised about individuals borrowing more than they otherwise would, especially with non-need-based PLUS Loans for graduate and professional students. Some individuals may borrow larger amounts under PLUS Loans for graduate and professional students, knowing loan forgiveness is possible. Congress may consider setting limits on forgiven amounts. Loan forgiveness programs aim to attract skilled employees to specific fields. Loan repayment programs can be ineffective if they do not influence individual employment decisions, but they may be somewhat effective in creating career pipelines or retaining skilled employees. Congress could improve program effectiveness by implementing more sensitive funding controls. To enhance the effectiveness of loan repayment programs, Congress could consider implementing more specific funding controls to tailor programs to individual needs. Insufficient data are available to assess the impact of federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs on achieving their objectives. Limited data is available on federal loan forgiveness and repayment programs to assess their effectiveness in achieving program objectives. For some programs, data will only be available once borrowers apply for benefits, with no benefits awarded yet due to the lengthy qualification period. For example, in the PSLF program, borrowers must work in public service for 10 years and make 120 monthly payments before becoming eligible for forgiveness benefits. Borrowers must work in public service for 10 years and make 120 monthly payments to be eligible for loan forgiveness under the PSLF program. Limited data is available on the forgiveness benefits received under the program, as borrowers only became eligible to apply for benefits on October 1, 2017. Borrowers may choose not to document their employment in public service jobs, making it difficult to project future participation in the program. Loan forgiveness is also available for borrowers. Loan forgiveness is available for borrowers who repay according to income-driven repayment plans for extended periods. However, longitudinal data on participants are not collected beyond what is necessary for program administration. This limits the availability of data to verify eligibility for forgiveness benefits. Longitudinal data on participants is not collected beyond program administration needs, making it difficult to verify continued employment eligibility for forgiveness benefits. Improved data collection is necessary to assess program effects and potential design changes for effectiveness. Improved data collection is necessary to assess program effects and potential design changes for effectiveness, especially considering the variation in types and amounts of student loan debt that may qualify for debt relief across different programs. Consideration might be given to imposing limitations on the types and amounts of student loan debt that qualify for loan forgiveness and repayment programs, especially with the increase in non-need-based loan aid availability. Concerns have been raised about incentives for students to over-borrow due to the availability of these programs. Concerns have been raised about student borrowers potentially over-borrowing due to the availability of loan forgiveness programs. Should limits be set on the amount or type of student loan debt eligible for debt relief? In 2016, 34 federal agencies provided employees with loan repayment benefits under the GESLRP, which allows agencies to administer their own student loan repayment programs with varying selection criteria.
