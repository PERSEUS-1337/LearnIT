The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to include a new section on Health Insurance Availability for Children. Subtitle L--Health Insurance Availability for Children, CHAPTER 101--HEALTH INSURANCE AVAILABILITY FOR CHILDREN, Sec. 9901 - Excise tax on failure to meet requirement of access to coverage, Sec. 9902 - Requirement of access to coverage, Sec. 9903 - Definitions. Imposition of a tax on group health plans and insurers for failing to meet coverage requirements. The tax amount is 25 percent of each premium received for group health plan failures. The tax imposed on group health plans and insurers for failing to meet coverage requirements is 25 percent of each premium received. For self-insured plans, the cost of coverage is treated as the premium received. The tax imposed on insurers offering individual health insurance coverage is 25 percent of the total premiums paid for the plan year in which the failure occurs. No tax is imposed if the failure is not discovered through reasonable diligence. No tax will be imposed on any failure if it is established that the persons involved did not know, or could not have known with reasonable diligence, about the failure. Additionally, no tax will be imposed if the failure is corrected within 30 days and was due to reasonable cause, not willful neglect. If a failure to comply with tax regulations is due to reasonable cause and corrected within 30 days of discovery, the Secretary may waive part or all of the tax imposed. The tax imposed may be waived if payment is excessive relative to the failure. This section does not apply to governmental or church plans. Liability for the tax falls on the responsible party, such as the group health plan. The tax imposed on a group health plan falls on the plan, while the tax imposed on an insurer offering health insurance coverage falls on the insurer. SEC. 9902 requires access to coverage. Each group health plan must offer qualifying coverage for qualifying young dependents of participants. The offer should be made when a person first becomes a qualifying young dependent and annually thereafter. Similarly, insurers in the individual market must offer qualifying coverage for individuals under 21 years of age. Insurance coverage in the individual market must provide qualifying coverage for individuals under 21 years of age, residing in the United States, and a citizen or national of the United States.
