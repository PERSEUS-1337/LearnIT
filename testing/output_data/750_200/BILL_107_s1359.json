    "content": "The \"Facilitating Access to Speedy Transmissions for Networks, E-commerce and Telecommunications (FASTNET) Act\" is the short title of the legislation. The purpose of the Act is to facilitate access to speedy transmissions for networks, e-commerce, and telecommunications. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 aimed to promote competition and reduce regulation in telecommunications markets nationwide. It recognized the unique circumstances of local exchange carriers with fewer than two percent of the Nation's subscriber lines. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 aimed to reduce regulation for carriers with less than two percent of nationwide subscriber lines, enabling them to deploy advanced services in less populated areas efficiently. Existing regulations often burden these carriers disproportionately, hindering their competitive initiatives. Reducing regulatory burdens on carriers with less than two percent of nationwide subscriber lines will allow them to deploy advanced services and compete more effectively in less populated regions of the country. This will enable them to respond to market conditions and accelerate the deployment of advanced telecommunications services. The Act aims to accelerate the deployment of advanced services and promote competition in the telecommunications industry for the benefit of consumers nationwide by reducing regulatory burdens on local exchange carriers with less than two percent of subscriber lines. This will enhance carriers' ability to respond to market conditions and deploy advanced services more quickly in less densely populated regions. The Act aims to reduce regulatory burdens on local exchange carriers with less than two percent of the Nation's subscriber lines, improving their flexibility and allowing them to redirect resources to increase investment in initiatives. SEC. 3. DEFINITION. Section 3 of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended to define a \"two percent carrier\" as an incumbent local exchange carrier with fewer access lines compared to other carriers. The \"two percent carrier\" is an incumbent local exchange carrier with fewer than two percent of the Nation's subscriber lines installed nationwide. SEC. 4. REGULATORY RELIEF FOR TWO PERCENT CARRIERS. Title II of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended by adding a new part IV concerning reduced regulatory requirements for two percent carriers. The Commission must consider the impact of regulatory requirements on two percent carriers when adopting rules for incumbent local exchange carriers. If the Commission fails to do so, they cannot enforce the rule against two percent carriers until they evaluate the burden separately. The Commission must consider the impact of regulatory requirements on two percent carriers when adopting rules for incumbent local exchange carriers. They cannot enforce the rule against two percent carriers until a separate evaluation is performed. This section does not require a separate evaluation if the rules do not apply to two percent carriers or if they are exempted. Size-based differentiation among carriers mandated by this Act, chapter 6 of title 5, United States Code, the Commission's rules, or any other provision of law is not prohibited. The Act prohibits size-based differentiation among carriers as mandated by various laws and regulations. The provisions of this section apply to any rule adopted after the enactment date. SEC. 282. LIMITATION OF REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. The Commission is limited in requiring a two percent carrier to file cost allocation manuals or ARMIS reports, except for section 224 purposes. The carrier must certify annually that its cost allocation complies with Commission rules. This limitation does not restrict the Commission's authority. The Commission's authority to access information under specific sections is preserved for two percent carriers, with limitations on requiring cost allocation manuals or ARMIS reports. The carrier must certify compliance annually, but this does not restrict the Commission's authority. The Commission's authority over two percent carriers is maintained, with restrictions on requesting certain documents. Carriers must certify compliance annually. The Commission does not require any two percent carrier to establish a separate affiliate for various services, and carriers are not required to maintain separate operations or personnel. SEC. 284. Participation in tariff pools and price cap regulation. SEC. 284 outlines the participation in tariff pools and price cap regulation. The provision states that a two percent carrier can choose to participate or withdraw from a common line tariff for a specific study area without being obligated to do so for other areas. The carrier must give 60 days notice of its intent, and the election is binding for one year. A two percent carrier can elect to be regulated by the Commission under price cap rate regulation for one or more study areas. The election is binding for one year from the date of the election. \"SEC. 285. DEPLOYMENT OF NEW TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES BY TWO PERCENT COMPANIES.\" The Commission allows two percent carriers to introduce new interstate telecommunications services with only one day's notice, without needing approval for the rate structure. The term 'new interstate telecommunications service' refers to a service not previously offered by the carrier. The term 'interstate telecommunications service' refers to a new class or subclass of service offered by a two percent carrier that expands service options for ratepayers. \"SEC. 286. ENTRY OF COMPETING CARRIER.\" Pricing Flexibility: A two percent carrier can de-average its interstate switched or special access rates, file tariffs with one day's notice, and file contract-based tariffs immediately upon certifying facilities-based entry by an unaffiliated carrier in its service area. This applies even if the carrier is subject to rate-of-return regulation. The Commission will regulate a two percent carrier as a streamlined pricing regulation upon receiving a certification that a local exchange carrier or its affiliate, or a local exchange carrier owned by a governmental authority, is engaged in facilities-based entry within the two percent carrier's service area. The Commission will regulate a two percent carrier as non-dominant and will not require tariffing of its interstate service offerings if a governmental authority is engaged in facilities-based entry within the carrier's service area. Additionally, the carrier can participate in the common line tariff by electing to include its study areas. The National Exchange Carrier Association or any successor tariff administrator can include study areas in the tariff. Definitions include facilities-based entry as providing local telephone exchange switching and service to at least one unaffiliated customer. The term 'contract-based tariff' refers to a tariff based on a service contract between a carrier and one or more customers, including contract terms, service descriptions, and volume commitments. The contract-based tariff includes details such as minimum volume commitments, contract prices, volume discounts, and other regulations affecting the contract rate. The term 'service area' has the same meaning as in section 214(e)(5). \"SEC. 287. SAVINGS PROVISIONS.\" The text chunk states that the Commission's authority under sections 201 through 208 is not restricted, rural telephone companies' rights are not diminished, and state authority over intrastate communications service is not limited by the provisions in this part. The Commission's authority under sections 201 through 208 is not restricted, rural telephone companies' rights are not diminished, and state authority over intrastate communications service is not limited by the provisions in this part. Charges, classifications, practices, services, facilities, or regulations for or in connection with intrastate communications service by wire or radio of any carrier are included. SEC. 5. LIMITATION ON MERGER REVIEW. Amendment to the Communications Act of 1934 sets a deadline for making public interest determinations in mergers involving two percent carriers. The Commission must make required determinations and rule on any waiver petitions or requests related to the merger. The Amendment to the Communications Act of 1934 mandates the Commission to make public interest determinations in mergers involving two percent carriers. The Commission must rule on waiver petitions or requests related to the merger within 60 days of the application submission. If no action is taken within the specified period, the application is deemed approved without conditions. The Commission must rule on waiver petitions or requests related to mergers involving two percent carriers within 60 days of application submission. If no action is taken within this period, the application is deemed approved without conditions. Additionally, a two percent carrier can elect to apply section 284 to local exchange facilities acquired through a merger or acquisition subject to the review deadline. The provisions of this section apply to applications submitted to the Commission after the date of enactment. Pending applications will be subject to these requirements as if filed on the enactment date. SEC. 6. TIME LIMITS FOR ACTION ON PETITIONS FOR RECONSIDERATION OR WAIVER. Section 405 of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended to include expedited action requirements. The Commission must issue an order granting or denying petitions within 90 days. Failure to act within this period results in the relief sought being deemed granted. The Commission must act on petitions within 90 days, or relief will be deemed granted. Failure to act results in a stay of enforcement until a decision is made. The Commission must act on petitions within 90 days, or relief will be deemed granted. Any order issued or grant of a petition for waiver will be final and may be appealed. The provisions apply to petitions submitted after the enactment date, while pending petitions will be subject to the new requirements. Petitions for reconsideration or waiver pending with the Commission on the date of enactment of this Act will be subject to the new requirements as if they were filed on that date. SEC. 7. NATIONAL SECURITY AND LAW ENFORCEMENT EXCEPTIONS. The 60-day and 90-day time periods under sections 310 and 405 of the Communications Act of 1934 do not apply if an Executive Branch agency with national security, law enforcement, or public safety jurisdiction submits a written filing to the Federal Communications Commission. The FBI advises the FCC that a petition or application may have national security, law enforcement, or public safety concerns that cannot be resolved within the 60-day or 90-day time period."
