    "content": "The federal K-12 education legislation, starting from the Improving America's Schools Act in 1994 to the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, focused on granting flexibility to grantees. The NCLB expanded existing flexibility authorities and introduced new ones for state and local administration of federal K-12 education programs. This report outlines these authorizations and will be updated periodically to include significant developments. This report provides an overview of authorizations for state and local flexibility in administering federal K-12 education programs. It defines \"flexibility\" as the authority to waive federal program requirements for eligible state or local aid recipients. This flexibility may be granted in exchange for meeting accountability requirements related to program outcomes, including the consolidation of multiple programs. The flexibility granted for federal K-12 education programs includes provisions for consolidation of programs and transfer of funds, as well as the authority to waive program requirements. These authorities mainly apply to programs authorized by the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). The report focuses on federal aid to K-12 education, specifically the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) will not be discussed. The ESEA programs are authorized through FY2008, and potential amendments are being considered by the 110th Congress. The report will be updated regularly to reflect legislative changes. The report focuses on federal aid to K-12 education under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). The 110th Congress is considering potential amendments to extend ESEA programs authorized through FY2008. The report will be regularly updated to reflect legislative developments. The report discusses special flexibility authorities for ESEA and related federal K-12 programs, including waivers for accountability requirements. It analyzes issues specific to individual authorities and concludes with cross-cutting issues regarding these flexibility authorities. The report discusses accountability requirements for federal K-12 education programs, which aim to ensure that funds are used in line with program purposes. These programs offer specific requirements like pupil eligibility and fund allocation, while also allowing flexibility in areas like instructional methods. Federal K-12 education programs focus on student populations with special needs, specific instructional services, innovative approaches, and subject areas like math or science. These programs offer flexibility in fund usage and instructional methods. Federal K-12 education programs, categorized into innovative instructional approaches, specific subject areas, and comprehensive school reform, are often referred to as \"categorical\" programs. However, the Innovative Programs authority of ESEA Title V-A is considered a \"block grant\" due to its support for a broad range of activities. The ESEA Title V-A Innovative Programs authority is considered a \"block grant\" for supporting a wide range of activities. Federal requirements and non-regulatory policy guidance are important for state and local recipients of federal aid. Program regulations, derived from federal statutes, supplement statutory language in the Code of Federal Regulations to provide guidance on complex issues prioritized by the U.S. Department of Education. An example is ESEA Title I-A requirements regarding curriculum. The U.S. Department of Education prioritizes specific actions for grantees, especially in cases where statutory text lacks guidance. Regulations are issued for aid programs, with some statutes explicitly requiring ED to publish regulations. Additionally, non-regulatory policy guidance, like \"Dear Colleague\" letters, is also provided for many programs. Non-regulatory policy guidance, such as \"Dear Colleague\" letters from the U.S. Secretary of Education, provides specific answers to program-related questions for grantees. While not legally binding, grantees may perceive this guidance as helpful in clarifying fund usage and pupil selection. The use of \"non-regulatory\" guidance can be perceived as more complex than intended. Grantees may treat this guidance as equivalent to regulations, even if not explicitly required to do so. Analogous to this is the establishment of \"competitive priorities\" by ED for grant programs, where certain applications receive preferential consideration. In grant competitions, ED sets priorities for applications to receive preferential consideration in awarding grants, such as serving schools with high percentages of low-income students. These priorities, published in the Federal Register, increase the likelihood of receiving support. The Department of Education (ED) sets priorities in grant competitions, published in the Federal Register, to increase the likelihood of receiving support. Regulations for federal education programs have become less voluminous over the years, with some programs having no regulations at all, relying on statutory guidance instead. The Department of Education (ED) provides non-regulatory policy guidance for ESEA programs, with regulations becoming less detailed over the years. For example, regulations for ESEA Title I-A post-IASA in 1994 focused on standards, assessments, accountability, schoolwide programs, private school participation, and fund allocation within states and LEAs. This minimalist approach continued after the NCLB of 2001. The Department of Education (ED) has adopted a minimalist approach to regulating ESEA Title I-A programs, focusing on key topics such as standards, assessments, accountability, schoolwide programs, private school participation, and fund allocation within states and LEAs. The Secretary intends to issue nonregulatory guidance to address legal and policy issues under the Title I programs instead of extensive regulations. The Secretary of Education plans to issue nonregulatory guidance for Title I programs, informing schools and other parties about the flexibility within the statute's requirements for K-12 education assistance programs. This guidance aims to establish accountability for federal grant recipients in meeting program goals. Federal aid grantees are expected to demonstrate accountability for the appropriate use of funds by showing evidence that program goals are being met. This includes ensuring funds are focused on eligible localities, pupils, and purposes to promote equal educational opportunities. The federal aid funds are focused on eligible localities, pupils, and purposes to promote equal educational opportunities. Outcome accountability ensures funds are used effectively to improve student achievement and enhance K-12 instruction, while fiscal accountability ensures financial integrity and prevents supplanting of state or local funds. Specific types of requirements for federal aid funds include targeting resources on high need pupil groups, limiting fund uses to high priority services, ensuring funds supplement state and local resources, enhancing parental participation, implementing staff qualifications, and reporting program activities to parents and the public. The federal aid funds have specific requirements for the treatment of pupils in non-public schools, staff qualifications, reporting program activities, meeting student achievement goals, and evaluating instructional services. Violations may result in repayment of funds or being prohibited from receiving further grants. Limited sanctions may apply for states or LEAs that fail to meet requirements. Sanctions are rarely invoked for states or LEAs that fail to meet requirements for federal education assistance. General requirements apply to all recipients, including those related to civil rights and student privacy. These requirements are outlined in the Education Department General Administrative Regulations (EDGAR) and financial management circulars published by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). LEAs participating in federal child nutrition programs must comply with various requirements, such as providing free or reduced-price school lunches to low-income students. Additionally, federal regulations from agencies other than the Department of Education may also apply to LEAs and schools in their capacity as employers. State and local educational agencies have wide latitude in using federal education assistance, with matters like grade levels and instructional techniques left to their discretion. Requirements for instructional methods under programs like NCLB are usually broad, allowing for state and local discretion. Program-specific requirements under NCLB and related programs are often criticized for restrictions on fund commingling and resource use. Restrictions on fund commingling and resource use under NCLB and related programs include limitations on the use of resources purchased with federal program funds for activities other than those conducted under that program, requirements to target aid on certain types of pupils or schools, eligibility thresholds for special forms of flexibility, and outcome accountability requirements. These restrictions aim to establish fiscal accountability and target aid on pupils and schools with the greatest incidence of poverty. Restrictions on instructional resource use target aid on pupils and schools with the greatest poverty incidence. Eligibility thresholds for flexibility programs have rationales discussed later. Outcome accountability requirements aim to improve federally supported education services. The federal education services aim to improve outcomes by shifting focus from other requirements. However, state and local perspectives may find these requirements inflexible, especially for low enrollment LEAs. The categorical approach of larger ED programs may lead to unintended effects like fragmentation of services for disadvantaged and LEP pupils. The categorical approach of larger ED programs may lead to unintended effects like fragmentation of services for disadvantaged and LEP pupils, with challenges in coordinating special program instruction and inefficient use of resources. The traditional federal categorical approach in education has been criticized for leading to fragmented instruction and focusing more on resources than on improving student achievement. Implementing federal programs in states with varying policies and demographics can also pose challenges. Some problems with categorical program structures and requirements may stem from misunderstandings of federal statutes or strict state interpretations. State and local officials often complain about constraints on federal fund use, despite efforts to focus aid on needy students. A 1998 GAO report highlighted these issues. The 1998 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report found that local education officials struggle with obtaining current and concise information on federal requirements for K-12 education assistance. They also expressed concerns about inadequate sources of technical assistance. The GAO report found that LEA staff struggle to comply with federal requirements due to inadequate information sources. They also worry about the costs of meeting administrative responsibilities and timelines. LEA staff face challenges in meeting federal education program requirements, including timelines and logistical issues. Waivers are available for certain program requirements, but they have limitations in terms of what can be waived and who is eligible. Some federal education programs offer waivers for specific requirements, with varying levels of flexibility and accountability. Waivers can be requested on a case-by-case basis or granted as \"blanket\" authority. Additionally, school-level flexibility in fund usage is provided under the schoolwide program authority of ESEA Title I-A. The use of funds under federal programs is provided with flexibility under the schoolwide program authority of ESEA Title I-A, the Innovative Programs block grant, and for small, rural LEAs. Five types of special flexibility were initiated before the NCLB of 2001, with additional forms of flexibility discussed in the succeeding section. Under Ed-Flex, ED can delegate authority to SEAs in participating states to waive requirements under selected ESEA programs. Initially authorized for six states in 1994, expanded to 12 states in 1996, and modified in 1999 to remove the cap on participating states. The Ed-Flex authority, initially authorized for six states in 1994 and expanded to 12 states in 1996, was modified in 1999 to remove the cap on participating states. Technical amendments were made in 2001, and the authority was extended in 2006 until the next reauthorization of ESEA Title I, Part A. Ten states obtained Ed-Flex status under the modified legislation. No state has been granted Ed-Flex authority since January 2002. Ed-Flex authority was initially granted to 10 states, including Delaware, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Vermont. The authority was set to expire in 2007, but recent congressional action extended it until reauthorization legislation is enacted. No state has received Ed-Flex authority since January 2002. States with Ed-Flex authority granted under P.L. 106-25 retain it until ESEA Title I, Part A is reauthorized. P.L. 109-211 does not allow for extension of Ed-Flex authority beyond these 10 states. Participating states must waive state and federal requirements for LEAs and schools, meet curriculum and performance standards under ESEA Title I-A, and monitor performance of waived entities. States with Ed-Flex authority must monitor LEAs and schools for compliance with performance standards under ESEA Title I-A. They are required to submit annual reports to the Department of Education on outcomes. Ed-Flex applies to various federal programs under ESEA Titles I-A, I-B-3, I-C, I-D, I-F, II-A, II-D-1, and III-B-4. The Ed-Flex authority allows states to waive certain administrative requirements of federal programs under ESEA, including Title I-A, I-B-3, I-C, I-D, I-F, II-A, II-D-1, and III-B-4. This authority also extends to programs such as the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act. The Ed-Flex statutes allow participating states to waive some administrative requirements of federal programs under ESEA, including Title I-A, I-B-3, I-C, I-D, I-F, II-A, II-D-1, and III-B-4, as well as the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act. Certain requirements related to fiscal accountability cannot be waived unless the Secretary of Education is satisfied that the underlying purposes are met. The Ed-Flex statutes allow states to waive administrative requirements of federal programs under ESEA, including Title I-A, I-B-3, I-C, I-D, I-F, II-A, II-D-1, and III-B-4, as well as the Carl D. Perkins Act. Waivers may include maintaining spending levels, supplementing state and local funds, ensuring comparable funding in all schools, equitable participation by private school pupils and teachers, parental involvement, school selection requirements, and civil rights compliance. LEAs or schools in Ed-Flex states must apply for waivers through their SEA. LEAs or schools in Ed-Flex states must apply for waivers through their SEA, providing required information. SEAs cannot waive their own requirements and must ensure the purposes of statutory requirements are met. Local waivers can be terminated if student performance is inadequate or declines for two consecutive years. Student performance must justify continuation, or if declined for two consecutive years, waivers can be terminated. States must submit annual reports on granted waivers, including effects on student performance. ED will make state reports available to Congress and the public, summarizing effects on state reform efforts and pupil performance. The report summarizing state reports on the effects of Ed-Flex waivers on state reform efforts and pupil performance lacked information on the use of Ed-Flex authority by states or programmatic impacts. No subsequent annual reports have been published by ED. No subsequent annual reports have been published by ED. Federal education program flexibility authority includes waivers granted by the U.S. Secretary of Education to SEAs or LEAs. The most commonly used waiver authority is in Title IX, Part D of the ESEA, allowing the Secretary to waive requirements for programs authorized by the ESEA upon request from SEAs, LEAs, Indian tribes, or schools. The U.S. Secretary of Education can waive requirements for programs authorized by the ESEA upon request from SEAs, LEAs, Indian tribes, or schools. Waiver requests must include specific educational goals and methods for measuring progress. Certain requirements cannot be waived under the ESEA Title IX-D case-by-case waiver authority. The ESEA Title IX-D waiver authority has limitations on what requirements can be waived, including prohibitions on using funds for state school finance programs, religious worship or instruction, certain sex education programs, and charter school eligibility. This authority does not have the same flexibility as the Ed-Flex program. The ESEA Title IX-D waiver authority allows waivers for up to four years, extendable if it improves student achievement. Waivers can be terminated if pupil performance is inadequate or outcomes do not justify continuation. The ESEA Title IX-D waiver authority allows waivers for up to four years, extendable if it improves student achievement. Waivers can be terminated if pupil performance is inadequate or outcomes do not justify continuation. The Secretary of Education must publish a notice of the decision to grant a waiver in the Federal Register. The Department of Education had failed to publish such notices for several years, but eventually did so in response to a memorandum from the Office of the Inspector General. Between January 2002 and December 2006, the Department of Education granted a total of 197 waivers under ESEA Title IX-D, with the majority being waivers of administrative cost limitations for Indian education grants. Additionally, some waivers were related to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, while others allowed states to participate in pilot programs. Between January 2002 and December 2006, the Department of Education granted a total of 197 waivers under ESEA Title IX-D. 45 waivers were granted for various reasons, including Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, pilot programs, and accountability provisions under ESEA Title I-A. Waivers allowed exceptions to ESEA Title I-A requirements for fiscal accountability or school selection and allocation. The Secretary must submit annual reports on waiver effects and effectiveness to Congress. Another waiver authority applies to schools in the Public Charter Schools program under ESEA Title V, Part B. The PCS waiver authority under the Public Charter Schools program allows for waivers of any requirement over which the Secretary of Education has administrative authority, except for requirements related to the definition of a charter school eligible for PCS funds. This authority is used infrequently and for limited purposes. Schools participating in the ESEA Title I-A program with 40% or more low-income students can conduct schoolwide programs with flexibility in fund usage. This allows federal aid to improve services for all students, rather than just the most disadvantaged. Schoolwide programs under Title I-A and other federal education programs can improve services for all students, not just the most disadvantaged, by addressing the needs of intended beneficiaries and complying with regulations. Funds must supplement, not supplant, other federal and non-federal funds. Title I-A and other federal program funds must supplement, not supplant, other funds received by schools. Commingling or flexibility in fund use is allowed for schoolwide programs under IDEA, but programmatic requirements must still be met. The schoolwide program authority primarily impacts Title I-A, as other programs usually focus on LEAs rather than individual schools. The ability to use Title I-A funds on a schoolwide basis, combining them with state and local funds without separate accounting, is a significant form of flexibility compared to traditional \"targeted assistance\" programs. This flexibility primarily impacts Title I-A, as other federal programs typically focus on LEAs rather than individual schools. The schoolwide program flexibility of using Title I-A funds with state and local funds without separate accounting is a significant change from traditional targeted assistance programs. This flexibility has led to a rapid growth in schoolwide programs, with a large majority of Title I-A schools and pupils now participating in them. The NCLB reduced the eligibility threshold for schoolwide programs from 50% to 40% of pupils from low-income families. This change allowed more high poverty schools to operate schoolwide programs, as all pupils in these schools are considered disadvantaged and in need of special assistance. The NCLB reduced the eligibility threshold for schoolwide programs to 40% of pupils from low-income families, allowing more high poverty schools to provide special assistance to all disadvantaged students. This change raises questions about the equity of selecting only the lowest-achieving students for Title I-A services and the adequacy of funding to impact overall school services in these schools. The Rural Education Achievement Program (REAP) under ESEA Title VI-B allows small, rural LEAs to transfer funds among selected ESEA programs. There is limited evidence on the achievement effects of expanding schoolwide programs, especially for schools just meeting the new threshold. The Rural Education Achievement Program (REAP) under ESEA Title VI-B allows certain rural LEAs with specific criteria to combine or transfer funds from selected ESEA programs. This flexibility is relevant for LEAs with low attendance or in sparsely populated counties. Funds received under various ESEA Titles can be used for authorized activities to provide flexibility for small LEAs with limited grant amounts. Small, rural LEAs often receive small grants that are insufficient to support effective programs. They can combine and transfer funds among limited program activities for better use. This \"REAP Flex\" authority provides similar flexibility to small LEAs as the Transferability authority under NCLB, allowing them to use 100% of their funds. The small, rural LEA authority allows for transferring funds from ESEA Titles III and IV-B, providing flexibility to use 100% of funds and access supplementary grants for various purposes. According to a study by ED in July 2007, participation in REAP Flex is widespread among eligible LEAs, with approximately 51% participating in the rural LEA flexibility authority. Funds are often transferred from ESEA Titles II-A and IV-A to Titles I-A and V-A for various purposes. Rural LEAs often utilize REAP Flex to transfer funds from ESEA Titles II-A and IV-A to Titles I-A and V-A for school improvement activities. There is confusion between REAP Flex and general Transferability authority among some LEAs. The ESEA Title V-A program administered by the ED is considered a block grant, providing flexibility to states and LEAs in using federal aid funds for a wide range of educational activities. Block grants in education cover a wide range of activities and student types, offering flexibility to states and LEAs in fund usage. Title V-A, a block grant program, was consolidated in 1981, with funds allocated based on population aged 5-17, ensuring no state receives less than 0.5% of total grants. Title V-A funds are allocated to states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico based on their population aged 5-17, with a minimum grant of 0.5% to each state. SEAs must distribute most funds to LEAs using state-developed formulas that consider enrollment, high-cost pupils, and disadvantaged families. The specific minimum percentage of funds that must be suballocated to LEAs varies depending on the program's aggregate funding level. All states must suballocate to LEAs an amount equal to at least 85% of the grant they received under this program for FY2002. Most states are to suballocate 100% of their Title V-A grants in excess of the FY2002 level. States must suballocate 100% of their Title V-A grants above the FY2002 level to LEAs, except for states receiving the minimum grant amount, which must suballocate 50%. States can retain up to 15% for administrative costs, with the rest used for specified programs like pupil assessments, achievement standards, charter schools, and public school choice policies. The curr_chunk discusses the use of Title V-A funds by LEAs for various innovative assistance programs, including charter schools, same gender schools, and school improvement programs. LEAs have flexibility in choosing from 27 different types of programs. Title V-A funds can be used by LEAs for various innovative assistance programs, including charter schools, same gender schools, school improvement programs, and programs to improve academic achievement. The flexibility in program selection is due to broad categories of authorized fund use, making Title V-A a block grant. Title V-A funds are considered a block grant due to broad authorized fund use categories. The program was first enacted in 1981 as Chapter 2 of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act, consolidating over 40 federal K-12 education programs in response to a Reagan Administration proposal for a broader block grant. Chapter 2 of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act was a legislative response to a Reagan Administration proposal for a broad block grant consolidating federal K-12 education programs. While the block grant initially reduced the number of programs, new categorical programs were authorized soon after, including aid for magnet schools. A 2000 study found that 58% of recipient LEAs benefited from the program. Based on a study by the ED, 58% of LEAs used Title V-A funds for instructional materials, 39% for educational technology, and 34% for academic services. Large LEAs focused on teacher development and school improvement. Funding was not often directed towards high-need students or schools. The Title V-A program funding has declined significantly over the years, from $442 million in FY1982 to $99 million in FY2007. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2008 provided zero funds for Title V-A, indicating a possible termination of the program. Efforts were not frequently targeted at high-need pupils or schools, with decisions on fund use influenced by long-term LEA plans and individual school priorities. Title V-A program funding has declined significantly over the years, with limited support from constituencies. Direct appropriations have been supplemented by funds transferred under REAP Flex and Transferability authorities, likely becoming the only source of funding for the program. Limited information on the effects of Title V-A services has led to reduced incentives to maintain funding for the program. Title V-A has received less favorable treatment in funding decisions compared to programs with demonstrated targeting of funds or improved educational outcomes, especially for high need pupil groups. ESEA Title V-A was amended by NCLB to require states to submit annual summaries on how the assistance is contributing to student academic improvement. Title V-A was amended by the NCLB to require states to submit annual summaries on how assistance is improving student academic achievement. SEAs and LEAs can increase funding by transferring funds from other federal programs. Additional provisions provide flexibility to states and LEAs. The NCLB includes provisions that offer increased flexibility to states and LEAs, such as authority for consolidated applications, plans, or reports for various programs, and the ability to consolidate certain funds for administrative purposes. These provisions have a marginal impact compared to other flexibility authorities. The No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLB) introduced flexibility authorities for ESEA programs, including the ability for LEAs to transfer up to 50% of their funds. Title VI, Part A, Subpart 2 of the ESEA, as amended by the NCLB, allows most LEAs to transfer up to 50% of their formula grants among four ESEA programs. LEAs failing to meet state AYP requirements can only transfer 30% of their grants among these programs. Title I-A allows LEAs failing to meet state AYP requirements to transfer only 30% of their grants among specific programs to address the failure. States can transfer up to 50% of program funds among selected programs, excluding administrative funds. LEAs subject to corrective actions under Title I-A cannot transfer funds. The Transferability authority allows states to transfer funds among specific programs, excluding administrative funds. The total appropriations for the programs subject to this authority amount to approximately $3.5 billion in FY2008. LEAs can access this authority without the need for specific application or approval. The Transferability authority allows states to transfer funds among specific programs, excluding administrative funds, totaling approximately $3.5 billion in FY2008. LEAs can access this authority without specific application or approval. Transferred funds must still adhere to program requirements, cannot be shifted across fiscal years, and affected programs will continue to exist. The range of purposes for transferred funds is broad, including the Innovative Programs block grant. The Transferability authority allows states to transfer funds among specific programs, totaling $3.5 billion in FY2008. Funds cannot be transferred across fiscal years, and affected programs will continue to exist. Participation in Transferability is relatively modest, with 12-16% of LEAs participating in 2005-2006. There is confusion at the LEA level regarding REAP Flex and Transferability authorities, with conflicting reports on the use of Transferability. LEAs mostly moved funds from ESEA Title II-A and Title IV-A to Titles I-A and V-A through Transferability. Many LEAs used Transferability to shift funds from ESEA Title II-A and Title IV-A to Titles I-A and V-A, aiming to target resources better and compensate for reductions in formula grants. Some LEAs cited reasons for not participating, such as lack of information or satisfaction with existing flexibility levels. The new State and Local Flexibility Demonstration Act allows up to seven states to consolidate their state administration and activity funds under various federal programs. The State and Local Flexibility Demonstration Act allows states to consolidate funds from various federal programs for five years, granting flexibility in fund usage beyond specific program activities. States risk losing this authority if they fail to meet AYP requirements for two consecutive years. States granted authority to consolidate funds for five years, subject to meeting AYP requirements. Authority may be terminated if terms are not met. Renewal possible if requirements are fulfilled. States to enter agreements with 4-10 LEAs, half with child poverty rates above 20%. States have the authority to consolidate funds for five years, contingent on meeting AYP requirements, with the possibility of renewal if terms are fulfilled. They must enter agreements with 4-10 LEAs, half of which have child poverty rates above 20%. LEAs consolidating funds must align with state's fund usage. States can specify purposes for LEAs' use of funds under the ESEA Title V-A Innovative Programs block grant. Under the ESEA Title V-A Innovative Programs block grant, State-Flex authority has only been granted to Florida, which later withdrew without implementing its plan. No state has participated in the State-Flex program yet. Local-Flex authority allows up to 80 LEAs to consolidate funds under certain conditions. LEAs, along with 4-10 LEAs per state under state flexibility demonstration, can consolidate funds from various programs for five years, with a 4% limit for administration. Failure to meet AYP requirements for two consecutive years will result in losing this authority. Under the state and local flexibility demonstration programs, LEAs can consolidate funds for five years with a 4% limit for administration. Failure to meet AYP requirements for two consecutive years or comply with the agreement terms will result in losing this authority. Certain requirements, such as civil rights and fiscal accountability, cannot be waived. Under the state and local flexibility demonstration programs, LEAs can consolidate funds for five years with a 4% limit for administration. Certain requirements, such as civil rights and fiscal accountability, cannot be waived. However, other program requirements can be waived for consolidated funds. Seattle, Washington, the only LEA to participate in the Local-Flex program, had its eligibility suspended for failing to make AYP for two consecutive years. Seattle has applied for a new Local-Flex agreement. Seattle's participation in the Local-Flex program has been suspended due to failing to make AYP for two consecutive years. The program has seen little interest overall, with only one LEA participating and no states in State-Flex. The Local-Flex program in Seattle has been suspended due to not meeting AYP for two years. Limited interest in the program was reported, with only one LEA participating and no states in State-Flex. Major barriers to participation included additional responsibilities, limited organizational capacity, and lack of information dissemination. A new round of competition for these programs began on March 18, 2004. The Federal Register announced a new round of competition for State-Flex and Local-Flex programs, with no set deadline. Participants would receive preference in future grant competitions due to their comprehensive planning to improve teacher quality and student achievement. State-Flex and Local-Flex programs aim to improve teacher quality and student achievement, especially for disadvantaged students. These programs offer flexibility in fund usage, with only a few program requirements to follow. Up to seven states and 4-10 LEAs can participate in these programs. The State-Flex and Local-Flex programs have limited participation, with only a few states and LEAs eligible. Despite multiple invitations, interest in these programs has been low. State-Flex authority is restricted in how funds can be used, requiring states to still meet administrative responsibilities. The State-Flex and Local-Flex programs have limited participation, with states responsible for meeting administrative responsibilities. The share of funds for state administration varies among programs, with ESEA Title I-A at 1% and Safe and Drug-Free Schools at 26.5%. States have influence over funds consolidated by LEAs. The State-Flex and Local-Flex programs give states influence over funds consolidated by LEAs, with Safe and Drug-Free Schools receiving 26.5% of funds. Participating LEAs in the state demonstration program may have diminished flexibility due to alignment with state fund use and state authority over Title V-A funds. The State-Flex and Local-Flex programs give states authority over LEA use of Title V-A funds. The inclusion of the ESEA Title V-A Innovative Programs block grant in the Local-Flex authority is of limited significance. Comparing the flexibility authorities in the final provisions to earlier versions of the legislation shows similarities to the House version authorizing local flexibility demonstrations. The NCLB legislation, similar to the House version of H.R. 1, authorizes local flexibility demonstrations in up to 100 LEAs. The Senate version of H.R. 1 had broader state and local flexibility/performance agreement authority, but was not included in the final legislation. The Senate-passed version would have provided significantly greater flexibility than the enacted legislation. The Senate-passed version of H.R. 1 would have provided greater flexibility than the enacted State-Flex and Local-Flex authorities, with increased outcome accountability. The scope of the flexibility/performance agreement authority was limited to 7 participating states and 25 LEAs in other states. The agreement authority for the flexibility/performance agreement was similar to State-Flex and Local-Flex, with 7 participating states and 25 LEAs. The range of ESEA programs subject to the flexibility authority was broad, including programs like Title I-A grants for Education of the Disadvantaged. The ESEA programs, such as Title I-A grants for Education of the Disadvantaged, and Limited English Proficient/Immigrant Education, allowed funds to be used for various authorized activities. Participating states had the authority to reallocate funds among LEAs to target concentrations of poor children, unlike State-Flex. The State-Flex program does not provide the authority to reallocate funds among LEAs to target concentrations of poor children, unlike the ESEA programs. The Senate version of H.R. 1 requires states and LEAs to exceed AYP goals by a statistically significant amount, ensuring achievement gains are not due to random variations in pupil scores. The report concludes with an analysis of cross-cutting issues related to special flexibility in education. These flexibility authorities allow states and LEAs to use federal aid funds according to their own priorities, aiming to prevent random variations in pupil achievement scores. Special flexibility authorities in education increase states' and LEAs' ability to use federal aid funds according to their priorities, with limitations on participation and program requirements that can be waived. The Transferability authority, Innovative Programs block grant, and Title I-A schoolwide programs allow states and LEAs to waive federal program requirements in exchange for accountability based on pupil achievement outcomes. These flexibility authorities, especially those under NCLB, aim to increase attention to outcome accountability requirements amidst higher overall accountability standards. Flexibility authorities, including those from NCLB, offer increased accountability and flexibility for ESEA programs. Transferability is utilized by 12-16% of LEAs, while REAP Flex is popular among small, rural LEAs. Reporting requirements on authority usage and impact are common. The current flexibility authorities for small, rural LEAs include reporting requirements on usage and impact, but there is limited information on the specific impact on pupil achievement. Selected cross-cutting issues and common characteristics are discussed, raising questions about addressing primary concerns of states and LEAs regarding federal fund use and administrative burdens. The ESEA Title I-A schoolwide program authority is broad but limited to schools with above-average low-income pupil rates. The Secretarial waiver authorities require individual requests to the U.S. Secretary. The Secretarial waiver authorities for programs other than Title I-A are limited, requiring individual requests to the U.S. Secretary of Education. LEAs must apply to their SEAs for waivers under the Ed-Flex authority. Fund Transferability authority allows states and LEAs to transfer up to 50% of funds received, but all program requirements must still be met. Rural LEA flexibility authority is only available to select low-enrollment LEAs. The rural LEA flexibility authority is limited to exceptionally low-enrollment LEAs, with a restricted amount of funds subject to State-Flex authority. Local-Flex authority is available in a maximum of 80 LEAs, with a low rate of participation due to limited flexibility. Certain requirements, such as fiscal accountability, cannot be waived under these authorities. The flexibility authorities for LEAs have limitations, including requirements that cannot be waived such as fiscal accountability and ESEA Title I-A standards. These authorities do not cover Title I-A and do not allow fund reallocation among LEAs. The 1999 GAO report found that the flexibility authorities enacted at that time do not address the main regulatory burdens of states and LEAs, such as requirements under IDEA, ADA, child nutrition programs, and environmental regulations. Some SEA staff view Ed-Flex as having limited value due to the few programs and requirements that can be waived. Some SEA staff view Ed-Flex as of limited value due to the few programs and requirements that can be waived, while others believe it encourages innovation and flexibility. The new authorities enacted in 2001 and 2002 have been adopted during a period of increased flexibility in federal program requirements. The NCLB has provided increased flexibility for LEAs and schools in using funds, especially in schoolwide programs. The special authorities described above offer relatively marginal additional flexibility in this context. The NCLB has provided increased flexibility for LEAs and schools in using funds, especially in schoolwide programs. Waivers granted under pre-NCLB authorities have been used for few purposes, some not related to innovation or reform. Limited information is available on the use of new forms of flexibility authorized under the NCLB. The NCLB has granted increased flexibility for LEAs and schools in using funds, especially in schoolwide programs. Waivers granted under pre-NCLB authorities have been used for few purposes, some not related to innovation or reform. The ESEA Title IX-D authority has been used for a growth model pilot for determining AYP. Under the NCLB, LEAs and schools have more flexibility in using funds, particularly in schoolwide programs. Recent studies show that flexibility authority is often used to reallocate funds from Title II-A and IV-A to Titles I-A and V-A to offset reductions in formula grants and target resources more effectively. Many LEAs use flexibility authorities to compensate for reductions in formula grants under ESEA Title I-A and V-A, target resources on schools failing to meet progress standards, and utilize funds with high flexibility. Pre-NCLB waivers were commonly used to waive requirements such as the low-income pupil percentage threshold for Title I-A schoolwide program eligibility. The pupil percentage threshold for ESEA Title I-A schoolwide program eligibility was reduced under NCLB. Title I-A funds are targeted within LEAs on schools with high numbers of low-income pupils. Deadlines for standards and assessments adoption and implementation under ESEA Title I-A are specified. Limitations on funds use for teacher recruitment and training programs like CSR and Eisenhower Professional Development Programs are in place. Schoolwide programs offer flexibility in fund usage under various federal programs, but concerns arise for schools with low percentages of low-income students. Granting authority to these schools may limit program scope and impact, as funding is based on the number of low-income students. Title I-A grant is based on the number of children from low-income families, making it challenging for a modest program to have a significant schoolwide impact. There is no systematic evidence that schoolwide programs are more effective than targeted assistance programs in improving education for disadvantaged pupils. Waivers to maintain or expand Title I-A participation could disperse funds among low-poverty schools, reducing the focus on high-poverty schools. Ed-Flex allows restrictions on waivers for ESEA Title I-A school selection. Ed-Flex allows waivers for ESEA Title I-A school selection, potentially dispersing funds among low-poverty schools and reducing the focus on high-poverty schools. Waivers may delay meeting deadlines for implementing ESEA Title I-A requirements, impacting outcome accountability. LEAs and states often request waivers to focus teacher hiring on early grades and form consortia for small LEAs with insufficient CSR grants. Following the enactment of NCLB, waivers were frequently requested to accommodate strict limitations on the use of funds for various local conditions, such as teacher hiring in early grades, forming consortia for small LEAs, and allocating teacher training funds for mathematics and science instruction. These waivers were used to adjust to specific requirements and limitations on the use of funds before NCLB. Following the enactment of NCLB, waivers were commonly used to adjust to specific limitations on fund usage for various local conditions. The NCLB made some previous uses of flexibility authorities like Ed-Flex less relevant. The schoolwide program eligibility threshold was lowered to 40% of pupils from low-income families nationwide. The CSR and Eisenhower programs were consolidated into a more flexible ESEA Title II program supporting teacher and principal recruitment and training. Substantive waivers under ESEA Title IX-D have been limited. Limited substantive waivers have been granted under the ESEA Title IX-D post-NCLB. States with Ed-Flex authority have submitted reports on waivers granted, but the information provided has been of limited value. No reports have been published on the purposes or effects of waivers under the Ed-Flex authority. Limited substantive waivers have been granted under the ESEA Title IX-D post-NCLB. No reports have been published on the actual purposes or effects of waivers under the Ed-Flex authority enacted in 1999. Anecdotal information on achievement effects was included in a 1999 ED report, primarily focused on whether affected LEAs or schools met state AYP standards. Supporters of special flexibility authorities often highlight broader evidence of their impact on state and local public education systems. Supporters of special flexibility authorities often point to evidence of their impact on state and local public education systems. A 1998 ED report on Ed-Flex concluded that it supports standards-based reform by facilitating program coordination and streamlining administration. Ed-Flex allows states to streamline program administration by reducing paperwork and focusing on outcomes to improve student achievement. Limited data shows positive impacts on pupil achievement in states, LEAs, or schools with special flexibility granted. The limited data on improved pupil achievement outcomes in states, LEAs, or schools with special flexibility granted raises questions about the conclusions made by ED. Will there be enough information available to analyze the benefits and impact of special flexibility authorities on pupil achievement? Statutes allow flexibility in education, but there is a lack of information from ED on the use and effects of waivers. This hinders the evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of these flexibility authorities. The increased emphasis on outcomes associated with special flexibility authorities may not fully substitute for other forms of accountability requirements, such as targeting services on priority activities or high need pupil groups. Special flexibility authorities in this report are a combination of goals set by states and LEAs, either through programs like Ed-Flex or State-Flex/Local-Flex authority, and meeting state AYP requirements under ESEA Title I-A. Some programs, like the Innovative Programs block grant, lack a direct link between flexibility authority and outcome accountability. Evidence from a GAO study shows states granted Ed-Flex authority under previous legislation. The GAO study found that states granted Ed-Flex authority differed in clarity and specificity of outcome goals. Five states had no specific objectives for LEAs or schools granted waivers, with limited ED oversight of implementation. The GAO study found that ED oversight of Ed-Flex implementation by states was limited, with varying degrees of detail in the information provided. The current flexibility authorities do not require substantial additional outcome accountability for participating LEAs and states beyond meeting AYP requirements. The Ed-Flex implementation does not require additional outcome accountability for participating LEAs and states beyond meeting AYP requirements. However, there is increased emphasis on consequences for failing to meet these requirements under NCLB. States implementing AYP and NCLB requirements face consequences for non-compliance, with special flexibility authorities having an added incentive to meet the requirements to maintain eligibility. This enhances outcome accountability, aligning with the nature of these authorities. The special flexibility authorities described in the report may have limited additional flexibility and increased outcome accountability. These provisions are influenced by recent legislation like NCLB, which expands outcome accountability requirements and flexibility in federal aid funds for all states, LEAs, and schools. Some argue for high degrees of state and local flexibility in using federal K-12 education aid funds. Some proponents advocate for increased state and local flexibility in using federal K-12 education aid funds without the need for additional outcome accountability requirements. Critics may argue against granting special flexibility authorities without sufficient justification. Critics argue that granting special flexibility authorities without sufficient justification may not lead to improved pupil outcomes. They are concerned that these authorities lack accountability provisions and are often used for purposes that do not increase program effectiveness."
