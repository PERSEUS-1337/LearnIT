    "content": "The text discusses the relationship between model generalization and local properties of the optima, specifically focusing on the Hessian and higher-order \"smoothness\" terms. A metric is proposed to score the generalization capability of the model, along with an algorithm to optimize the perturbed model. Deep models, such as those used in computer vision applications, have shown effectiveness. Deep models, used in computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing, have millions of parameters but still generalize well. Model generalization is related to the complexity of the hypothesis space, contradicting classical learning theory. The generalization ability of over-parameterized models is related to the complexity of the hypothesis space. Empirical observations show that even complex hypothesis spaces can lead to simple solutions. The generalization capability is also influenced by the spectrum of the Hessian matrix at the solution, with large eigenvalues often resulting in poor model generalization. The Hessian matrix at the solution affects model generalization, with large eigenvalues leading to poor performance. Different metrics measure solution \"sharpness\" and its connection to generalization. Some Hessian-based sharpness measures are problematic, especially in RELU-MLP models. The geometry of RELU-MLP parameters can be altered through re-parameterization. Bayesian analysis, specifically using Taylor expansion to approximate the posterior, has been explored. BID34 penalizes sharp minima using the Hessian of the loss function to determine optimal batch size. BID4 connects PAC-Bayes bound and Bayesian marginal likelihood, offering an alternative view on Occam's razor. BID19, BID7, BID28, and BID29 utilize PAC-Bayes bound for analysis. The PAC-Bayes bound is used to analyze the generalization behavior of deep models, including the impact of sharp and flat minima on classification boundaries. BID28 suggests incorporating the local property of the solution into the analysis. The paper explores the relationship between model generalization and the local \"smoothness\" of a solution from a PAC-Bayes perspective. It discusses using the difference between perturbed loss and empirical loss as a sharpness metric and optimizing the PAC-Bayes bound for better model generalization. The paper examines the connection between model generalization and solution smoothness from a PAC-Bayes viewpoint. It introduces a new metric for generalization based on the Hessian of the loss function and proposes a perturbation-based algorithm utilizing Hessian estimation to enhance model generalization in supervised learning. The proposed algorithm utilizes Hessian estimation to improve model generalization in supervised learning within the PAC-Bayes scenario. It considers probability measures over the function class F and aims to minimize expected loss through random samples and functions. The PAC-Bayes theory suggests that the empirical loss is bounded by the KL divergence between D f and \u03c0 f. This bound holds for any fixed distribution over the parameters W, with probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b4 over the draw. The PAC-Bayes bound connects generalization with local properties around the solution w through perturbation u. It optimizes \u03b7 to scale approximately as BID33, ensuring a small perturbation level for better generalization. The text discusses the importance of finding an optimal perturbation level for better generalization in machine learning models. It introduces the concept of local smoothness assumption and connects it with the Hessian matrix to improve model generalization rigorously. In this section, the local smoothness assumption is introduced along with the main theorem. The focus is on defining a neighborhood set around a reference point, with a particular type of radius \u03ba i (w * ) = \u03b3|w * i | + . This assumption is necessary to control the deviation of the optimal solution in the empirical loss. The text discusses the Hessian Lipschitz condition for a twice differentiable function and its importance in modeling smoothness. It also introduces a theorem related to uniform perturbation. The text introduces the importance of the Hessian Lipschitz condition for a smooth function and presents Theorem 2, which shows that with carefully chosen perturbation levels, the expected loss of a uniformly perturbed model can be controlled. The bound on perturbation levels is related to the diagonal element of Hessian, Lipschitz constant, neighborhood scales, number of parameters, and samples. Perturbation should be more along \"flat\" coordinates. Truncated Gaussian perturbation is discussed in the next section. If the loss function satisfies the local Hessian Lipschitz condition, perturbation around a fixed point can be bounded. If the empirical loss function satisfies the local Hessian Lipschitz condition, perturbations around a fixed point can be bounded up to the third order. For perturbations with zero expectation, the \"posterior\" distribution of model parameters is a uniform distribution. The distribution supports vary for different parameters. The \"posterior\" distribution of model parameters is a uniform distribution with varying supports for different parameters. Perturbed parameters are bounded, and the empirical loss function satisfies the local Hessian Lipschitz condition. The third order term is bounded, but the over-parameterization phenomenon is not explained. Lemma 3 states that the loss function is bounded, model weights are constrained, and with certain probabilities, perturbed random variables can be uniformly distributed. The experiment treats \u03b7 as a hyper-parameter, but optimization for the best \u03b7 can be done through a weighted grid search. In the experiment, \u03b7 is treated as a hyper-parameter. Theorem 2 discusses building a weighted grid over \u03b7 for optimization. The proof details are in Appendix C and D.5. Re-parameterization of RELU-MLP in BID2 shows that scaling the Hessian spectrum does not affect model prediction and generalization with cross entropy loss. Our bound does not assume cross entropy loss or RELU-MLP model. The optimal perturbation levels scale inversely with parameters, changing approximately with a logarithmic factor. Lemma (3) shows that optimal \u03c3 * leads to logarithmic functions for \u2207 2L (w), \u03c1, and w *. The optimal perturbation levels scale inversely with parameters, changing with a logarithmic factor. Lemma (3) shows that optimal \u03c3 * leads to logarithmic functions for \u2207 2L (w), \u03c1, and w *. This leads to small changes in the bound for RELU-MLP with the re-parameterization trick. Additionally, heuristic-based approximations and empirical observations are introduced in the following sections. The PAC-Bayes based Generalization metric, pacGen, is derived by replacing the optimal \u03c3 * and using |w i | + \u03ba i (w) to approximate \u03c4 i. The metric assumes local convexity and can be calculated on every point. To calculate it on real-world data, estimation of the diagonal elements of the Hessian \u2207 2L and the Lipschitz constant \u03c1 of the Hessian is required. The efficiency concern is addressed by approximating \u2207 and estimating \u03c1 using the Hessian of a randomly perturbed. The Hessian and Lipschitz constant \u03c1 are estimated for efficiency. Adam is followed for optimization. The neighborhood radius \u03ba is set to 0.1. Batch size is varied with a fixed learning rate of 0.1. Test loss and training loss gap increases with batch size. Proposed metric \u03a8 is plotted in Figure 2. The gap between test loss and training loss increases as batch size grows. The proposed metric \u03a8 \u03ba (L, w * ) follows the same trend. Experiment with fixed batch size of 256 and varying learning rate shows that as learning rate decreases, the gap between test loss and training loss increases. \u03a8 \u03ba (L, w * ) shows a similar trend to the generalization gap. The proposed metric \u03a8 \u03ba (L, w * ) shows a similar trend to the generalization gap when running the model on CIFAR-10. Adding noise to the model for better generalization has been successful both empirically and theoretically. Optimizing the perturbed empirical loss E u [L(w + u)] instead of just minimizing the empirical lossL(w) can lead to better model generalization power. The algorithm introduces a systematic way to perturb model weights based on the PAC-Bayes bound, optimizing the perturbed empirical loss E u [L(w + u)] for better model generalization power. The exponential smoothing technique from Adam is used to estimate the Hessian \u2207. The algorithm treats \u03b7 as a hyper-parameter and acknowledges that in applications, \u2207L \u00b7 u won't be zero, especially with only 1 trial of perturbation. If the gradient \u2207L is close to zero, the first order term can be ignored. The algorithm perturbs model weights based on the PAC-Bayes bound, optimizing the perturbed empirical loss for better generalization. It perturbs parameters with small gradients below a certain threshold and decreases perturbation as epochs increase. Results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet using Wide-ResNet BID36 are compared in FIG6. The algorithm perturbs model weights based on the PAC-Bayes bound to optimize the perturbed empirical loss for better generalization. Results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet using Wide-ResNet BID36 are compared in FIG6. The chosen model has a depth of 58 and a widen-factor of 3, with dropout layers turned off. Different optimization methods and parameters are used for each dataset, with specific learning rates and batch sizes specified. The algorithm perturbs model weights based on the PAC-Bayes bound to optimize the perturbed empirical loss for better generalization. SGD and Adam are used as optimizers for Tiny ImageNet and CIFAR respectively, with specific learning rates. The effect of perturbation is observed using the validation set as the test set for Tiny ImageNet. The comparison between perturbation and dropout methods in the context of model generalization shows that perturbation with perturbedOPT leads to better results than dropout. Perturbation applies different levels of perturbation based on local smoothness structures, while dropout uses a single dropout rate for all parameters. This difference results in improved accuracy on the validation set while maintaining model generalization. The text discusses the relationship between model generalization and the smoothness of the solution in the PAC-Bayes framework. It highlights that the generalization power of a model is linked to the Hessian, smoothness of the solution, parameter scales, and training sample size. The perturbation level scales inversely with the square root of the Hessian, which mitigates the scaling effect in the re-parameterization suggested by BID2. This work is the first to rigorously integrate the Hessian in the model generalization bound. The text discusses integrating the Hessian in the model generalization bound, proposing a new metric and perturbation algorithm based on it. Empirical results show the algorithm acts as a regularizer for better performance on unseen data. This section details a toy example in a 2-dimensional sample set from a mixture of 3. The toy example in a 2-dimensional sample set from a mixture of 3 Gaussians is discussed. A 5-layer MLP model with sigmoid activation and cross entropy loss is used, with shared weights and no bias terms. The model has only two free parameters w1 and w2, trained on 100 samples. The model in the toy example has two free parameters w1 and w2, trained on 100 samples. The loss function plot shows many local optima, with a sharp one and a flat one. The colors on the loss surface represent the generalization metric scores (pacGen), where a smaller metric value indicates better generalization power. The metric scores (pacGen) around the global optimum, indicated by a green bar, suggest possible poor generalization capability compared to the local optimum indicated by a red bar. The color on the bottom plane represents an approximated generalization bound considering both loss and generalization metric. The local optimum, despite slightly higher loss, has a similar overall bound to the \"sharp\" global optimum. The red bar indicates a local optimum with slightly higher loss but a similar overall bound to the \"sharp\" global optimum. The sharp minimum approximates the true label better but has complex structures in its predicted labels, while the flat minimum produces a simpler classification boundary. Truncating the Gaussian distribution is necessary as the inequality requires bounded perturbation. After truncating the Gaussian distribution for bounded perturbation, the event P(E) \u2265 1/2 is considered. Coefficients are bounded with i w 2 i \u2264 \u03c4, and the prior is chosen as N(0, \u03c4 I). The bound is approximated with \u03b7 = 39 using inequality (8), and after truncation, the variance decreases. The bound for the truncated Gaussian becomes smaller. After truncating the Gaussian distribution for bounded perturbation, the variance decreases. For any w * \u2208 R m satisfying assumption 1, with probability at least 1 \u2212 \u03b4 over n samples, the model weights are bounded by i w 2 i \u2264 \u03c4. The lemma states that the loss function l(f, x, y) \u2208 [0, 1] and the random variables are distributed as truncated Gaussian. The extra term \u03b7 can be optimized over a grid for a tighter bound. After truncating the Gaussian distribution for bounded perturbation, the variance decreases. The lemma states that the loss function is in the range [0, 1] and the random variables follow a truncated Gaussian distribution. An extra term \u03b7 can be optimized over a grid for a tighter bound. The proof involves optimizing over \u03c3 to minimize a specific equation, with a focus on monotonically increasing terms. The proof involves optimizing over \u03c3 to minimize a specific equation, focusing on monotonically increasing terms. The lemma states that the loss function is in the range [0, 1] and random variables follow a truncated Gaussian distribution. An extra term \u03b7 can be optimized over a grid for a tighter bound. The quadratic term on the right side of inequality FORMULA10 is further bounded by extrema of the Rayleigh quotient. The quadratic term in inequality FORMULA10 is bounded by extrema of the Rayleigh quotient, consistent with observations on model generalization. The inequality holds even with correlated perturbations, and a lemma introduces a \u03c1-Hessian Lipschitz condition for local optimal w*. The proof of Lemma 5 shows that the quadratic term in the inequality is bounded by extrema of the Rayleigh quotient, even with correlated perturbations. This section includes figures comparing dropout. The section compares dropout with a proposed perturbation algorithm, showing results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet datasets with varying dropout rates. The perturbation algorithm does not assume independence among perturbations, unlike dropout which uses a Bernoulli distribution. The study compares dropout with a perturbation algorithm on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet datasets. The wide resnet model used has a depth of 58 and a widenfactor of 3. Different dropout rates and perturbation parameters are tested, with varying optimization algorithms and batch sizes. The study compared dropout with a perturbation algorithm on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet datasets using a wide resnet model. Different dropout rates and perturbation parameters were tested, showing improved accuracy with added dropout. Dropout rate of 0.3 worked best for CIFAR-10, while 0.1 worked better for CIFAR-100 and Tiny ImageNet due to the need for more regularization in CIFAR-10. The perturbed algorithm outperformed dropout in experiments on CIFAR-10 due to its ability to apply varying levels of perturbation based on local smoothness structures, while dropout uses a single rate for all parameters."
