It protects U.S. shipyards, carriers, and sailors but is debated for increasing costs and limiting ship availability. The Jones Act, part of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, mandates that vessels transporting cargo within the U.S. must be U.S.-built, owned, and crewed. It has been a contentious issue in recent Congresses due to its impact on building merchant vessels in U.S. shipyards, debates over Puerto Rico's economic challenges, the sinking of the ship El Faro, and discussions about domestic transportation of oil and natural gas. The law's effectiveness in achieving national security goals has also been questioned. The Jones Act of 1920 mandates that vessels transporting cargo domestically in the U.S. must be U.S.-built, owned, and crewed. In May 2018, the Office of Management and Budget requested public comment on federal requirements in the maritime sector to increase efficiency and reduce regulatory burdens. The Jones Act of 1920 requires that cargo transported domestically in the U.S. must be on vessels that are U.S.-built, owned, and crewed. This law originated from legislation dating back to the First Congress in 1789, which favored U.S.-flag fleets over foreign fleets by imposing lesser duties on domestically built and owned vessels. In 1817, Congress enacted a precursor to the Jones Act by disallowing foreign-owned vessels from transporting domestic cargo between U.S. ports. This prohibition was later extended to vessels transporting passengers domestically in 1886. The United States initially had a shipbuilding advantage due to ample timber but lost it as wooden ships were replaced by iron steamships. Congress debated how to address the decline in the U.S. foreign shipping share. As wooden sailing ships were replaced by iron steamships, the advantage shifted to Scotland and England. Congress debated how to respond to the decline in U.S. foreign trade carried by U.S. vessels. The \"free ship\" movement proposed allowing foreign-built vessels to sail under the U.S. flag, but opponents argued that the higher cost of U.S. crews would hinder a resurgence in trade. Since 1912, the domestic build requirement has mainly applied to vessels for domestic voyages, with Congress enacting a measure allowing foreign-built ships in U.S.-flag international service. In the late 1800s, Congress considered but did not pass bills to permit foreign-built ships in domestic trade, tightening coastwise transport language in response to shippers' efforts to avoid costly U.S. vessels. In response to shippers' attempts to avoid high-cost U.S. vessels, Congress tightened the language concerning coastwise transport. In 1891, a shipper loaded merchandise on a foreign-flag ship bound for Antwerp, Belgium, before transferring it to another foreign-flag ship bound for Los Angeles to save on freight charges compared to using a U.S.-built ship directly. In response to shippers' attempts to avoid high-cost U.S. vessels, Congress tightened the coastwise transport laws. Shippers used foreign-flag ships to save on freight charges by routing cargo through foreign ports. Congress amended the coastwise law in 1893 and 1898 to prohibit this practice. Despite the amendments, U.S. shippers continued to use foreign-flag vessels in the Alaska trade by moving cargo between the United States and Vancouver, Canada, by rail. In the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, Senator Wesley Jones sought to require Alaska-bound cargo to move through the Port of Seattle by amending coastwise laws to cover shipments by land and water. The debate over building ships in the US versus foreign countries was part of the discussion leading to the passage of the Jones Act. The Jones Act of 1920 debated the relative cost of building ships in the US versus foreign countries, with concerns raised about the higher cost of domestically built ships. The Act aimed to promote the American merchant marine by removing restrictions on American merchants acquiring ships, whether built domestically or abroad. To promote the American merchant marine, it is necessary to remove restrictions on American merchants acquiring ships at the lowest price to compete globally. This includes allowing them to buy ships from the open market for both coastwise and overseas trade. The American flag can be bought cheaply compared to other flags, but if American merchants are restricted to buying ships only from American builders for coastwise trade, US-built ships will cost more. US iron and steel manufacturers were able to compete successfully when they had to, and the same can be true for shipbuilders. Reports show that US-built ships cost 20% more in 1922, increasing to 50% in the 1930s, and doubling in price compared to foreign-built ships in the 1950s. In the 1950s, U.S. shipyard prices were double those of foreign yards, and by the 1990s, they were three times the price of foreign yards. Today, a U.S.-built tanker may cost four times the global price of a similar vessel, while a U.S.-built container ship could cost five times the global price. This cost differential is a concern for Department of Defense officials overseeing military sealift ships. The military has found building sealift ships domestically to be unaffordable. The military has modified its plan to build sealift ships domestically due to cost concerns. Instead, they will purchase more used foreign-built cargo ships. U.S. shipyards do not compete on price or vessel characteristics with foreign shipyards. U.S.-flag ships have higher operating costs compared to foreign-flag ships, primarily due to higher crewing costs. The operating cost differential is estimated to be over $6 million per ship per year. U.S.-flag ships have an operating cost differential estimated to be over $6 million per ship per year compared to foreign-flag ships, including crewing, insurance, and maintenance costs. The Merchant Marine Act of 1920 addressed surplus government cargo ships from World War I and outlined maritime policy goals. The Merchant Marine Act of 1920 addressed surplus government cargo ships from World War I and outlined enduring maritime policy goals for the United States. The law emphasized the need for a well-equipped merchant marine owned and operated by U.S. citizens to support national defense and commerce. The Merchant Marine Act of 1920 emphasized the importance of developing a merchant marine owned by U.S. citizens to support national defense and commerce. This policy reflected the United States' emerging power status at the time, especially during World War I when European nations faced ship shortages due to the war effort. The Jones Act, part of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, requires U.S. citizen crewing for domestic waterborne shipments to ensure the country has its own merchant marine. It does not apply to international trade, which is mostly carried by foreign-flag ships. If a Jones Act ship is owned by a U.S. corporation, 75% of the stock must be owned by U.S. citizens. The Jones Act mandates that U.S. citizen crewing is required for domestic waterborne shipments. For Jones Act ships owned by a U.S. corporation, 75% of the stock must be owned by U.S. citizens. U.S. territories like the U.S. Virgin Islands, America Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands are exempt from the Jones Act, allowing foreign-flag ships to transport cargo between these islands and other U.S. points. Puerto Rico is exempt for passengers but not for cargo. Vessels traveling between Guam and other U.S. points must be U.S.-owned and -crewed but do not need to be U.S.-built. The Coast Guard enforces the U.S.-build requirement for vessels and U.S. ownership of carriers. The Coast Guard enforces the U.S.-build requirement for vessels, U.S. ownership of carriers, and U.S. crewing for Jones Act operators. Customs and Border Protection determines maritime activity under the act and defines \"transportation\" and \"U.S. points\" for voyages. The Jones Act requires the use of \"U.S.-built\" vessels for maritime activities, with the Coast Guard determining what qualifies as U.S.-built. Congress has not provided a clear definition, leaving this decision to the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard determines what constitutes a U.S.-built vessel based on specific criteria for hull and superstructure components. Machinery and outfitting do not impact this determination. For oceangoing ships, U.S. shipyards can import engines from foreign manufacturers as engines are considered components attached to the hull, not integral to the hull's structure. The imported parts must be attached to the vessel in a U.S. shipyard, not overseas. The Coast Guard allows certain parts of the hull to be manufactured abroad, as long as they are attached in a U.S. shipyard. The weight limit for foreign components is 1.5% of the steel weight of the hull and superstructure. Certain components like propellers, stern bulbs, bulbous bows, rudders, and watertight closures can be imported as long as they do not exceed the steel weight limit. Steel products in standard forms can also be imported with no weight limit. The Coast Guard permits certain foreign components in vessel construction as long as they do not exceed the steel weight limit. Custom shaping of steel must be done in a U.S. shipyard. Confirmation from the Coast Guard is sought by shipyards to ensure compliance with the Jones Act. \"Determination letters\" detail permissible foreign components. The Coast Guard allows foreign components in vessel construction within steel weight limits. Shipyard unions sued the Coast Guard in 2007 over the interpretation of the statute, but the court sided with the Coast Guard citing consistency with Treasury Department's interpretation since the late 1800s. The shipyard unions' lawsuit was prompted by a Philadelphia shipyard's partnership with a South Korean shipbuilder, begun in 2004, to use the Korean builder's ship designs and other procurement services to build a series of Jones Act tankers and container ships. General Dynamics NASSCO of San Diego has also partnered with Daewoo Shipbuilding since 2006. The Philadelphia shipyard partnered with a South Korean shipbuilder to use their designs and procurement services for building Jones Act ships. General Dynamics NASSCO of San Diego also partnered with Daewoo Shipbuilding for vessel designs and materials. The use of foreign components was argued to reduce ship costs and benefit the domestic fleet. The shipyards argued that using foreign components would lower ship costs and benefit the domestic fleet. The United States is the largest cruise ship market, but most Americans board foreign-flag cruise ships due to Jones Act exemptions for ships visiting distant foreign ports. In 1910, a legal opinion stated that cruise ships visiting foreign ports like Aruba or Curacao do not need to comply with the Jones Act. A 1985 rule by the U.S. Customs Service allowed foreign-flag cruise ships to visit U.S. ports if they also include a visit to a nearby foreign port. Customs allowed foreign-flag cruise ships to make round trips from a U.S. port and visit other U.S. ports as long as they include a visit to a nearby foreign port. Passengers must stay on the cruise until it returns to the original dock. The Jones Act is not violated if the main purpose of the voyage is not domestic transportation of passengers. Another type of passenger vessel excursion involves visits to no other ports for activities like whale watching, diving, gambling, shopping, or fishing. Passenger vessel excursions, known as \"voyages to nowhere,\" involve activities like whale watching, diving, gambling, shopping, or fishing. If these vessels stay within 3 miles of U.S. territorial waters, they must be Jones Act-compliant. However, if they journey beyond 3 miles into international waters, they are not required to comply with the Jones Act. CBP's interpretation of the Jones Act exempts vessels from compliance if they go beyond 3 miles into international waters, based on various historical rulings. However, charter fishing boats must still be Jones Act-compliant even in international waters. CBP's interpretation of the Jones Act defines a passenger as anyone aboard a vessel who is not a crew member or owner, regardless of payment. This means that even yacht owners entertaining guests or construction companies transporting workers must comply with the Jones Act regulations. The Jones Act requires business clients on vessels to comply with regulations. CBP's interpretations impact lightering and offshore supply vessels in the oil market. Lightering vessels can be foreign-flagged if within 3 nautical miles of shore in U.S. territorial waters. Many lightering areas in the Gulf of Mexico are 60 to 80 miles offshore, allowing foreign-flagged vessels. Lightering operations in the Delaware Bay and other areas within the 3-mile zone require Jones Act-compliant vessels. OSVs servicing offshore oil rigs must also be Jones Act-compliant due to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act of 1953 extending U.S. waters 200 miles offshore. In 2008, Congress required that only oil rigs attached to the seabed are considered \"U.S. points,\" allowing foreign-flagged vessels to service mobile offshore drilling units not attached to the seabed. In 2008, Congress required that OSVs servicing MODUs be U.S.-owned and -crewed, but not necessarily U.S.-built. The Jones Act compliance for OSVs depends on whether they are transporting supplies/workers or installing equipment for the oil rig. CBP defines \"vessel equipment\" as necessary for navigation, operation, or maintenance. In 2008, Congress mandated that OSVs servicing MODUs must be U.S.-owned and -crewed, but not necessarily U.S.-built. The Jones Act compliance for OSVs depends on their role in transporting supplies/workers or installing equipment for the oil rig. CBP defines \"vessel equipment\" as necessary for navigation, operation, or maintenance. Vessels involved in installing rig equipment or conducting geophysical surveying can be foreign-flagged, as well as \"flotels\" providing living quarters for construction workers. In 2017, CBP proposed that most activities by OSVs fall under the Jones Act, but withdrew the proposal after reviewing comments. Some question if the Jones Act applies to offshore wind farms beyond 3 miles from shore. Wind farm developers follow CBP's interpretations of the Jones Act for OSVs and oil rigs. The Department of Energy noted the nonavailability of Jones Act-compliant Tower Installation Vessels (TIVs). The Department of Energy has highlighted the lack of Jones Act-compliant Tower Installation Vessels (TIVs) as a challenge for offshore wind farm development, especially in deeper waters. U.S. wind developers either import equipment or use Jones Act-compliant vessels alongside non-compliant TIVs for installation. The CBP interpretation of the Jones Act allows for non-compliant vessels to transport equipment to foreign ports for processing before being transported back to U.S. ports. For example, a Texas oil producer ships gasoline to a Bahamian facility for blending with imported petroleum. The Jones Act allows non-compliant vessels to transport products to foreign ports for processing before being brought back to U.S. ports. For instance, a Texas oil producer ships gasoline to a Bahamian facility for blending with imported petroleum, which is then shipped to New York. This process is distinguished from previous cases by the transformation of the product into a new one at an intermediate foreign port. The interpretation of the Jones Act has precedent in a 1964 Customs Service ruling involving California rice processed in the U.S. Virgin Islands before being shipped to Puerto Rico on foreign-flag ships. Congress has enacted provisions since 1920 to tighten Jones Act requirements and exempt certain maritime activities. In 1935, vessels sold to foreign owners or registered under a foreign-flag were forbidden from requalifying as Jones Act-eligible. In 1940, Congress expanded the Jones Act to cover towing vessels and salvage vessels operating in U.S. waters. In 1988, Congress specified that waterborne transport of valueless material requires the use of a Jones Act-qualified vessel. In 1988, Congress specified that waterborne transport of valueless material requires use of a Jones Act-qualified vessel (P.L. 100-329). Congress has enacted exemptions to the Jones Act, waiving restrictions when no Jones Act-qualified operator is available in a particular market. In 1984, Congress exempted passenger travel between Puerto Rico and any other U.S. port from the Jones Act if no Jones Act-qualified operator was available. This exemption allows foreign-flag cruise ships to transport passengers between the U.S. mainland and the island. Congress has also permitted foreign-flagged LNG tankers to provide domestic service in 1996 and 2011 due to the lack of Jones Act fleet options, but no ship owners have utilized these exemptions. Congress has enacted exemptions for Jones Act-qualified vessels due to spikes in demand, such as for iron ore during the 1940s and a bumper grain harvest in 1951. In 1996, an exemption was made for vessels in oil spill cleanup operations when there is a shortage of Jones Act-qualified vessels available. In 1971 and 1965, Congress enacted exemptions to the Jones Act for innovative vessel designs used in foreign trade with domestic legs, including Lighter Aboard Ship (LASH) technology and movement of empty containers between U.S. ports. In 1965, Congress exempted the movement of empty containers between U.S. ports from the Jones Act, allowing foreign-flagged container carriers to reposition their empty equipment along U.S. coastlines. Jones Act-compliant ships are needed for transshipment of loaded international containers, impacting the development of marine highways or short sea shipping routes. Transshipment of international containerized cargo by feeder ships is common. The Jones Act requires U.S.-built, -crewed, and -owned ships for transshipment of international containerized cargo. Lack of transshipment services increases demand for rail and road connections to ports. Congress has enacted exemptions for specific vessels identified by name and registration number. Since 1989, Congress has granted exemptions to the Jones Act for 133 specific vessels in 16 legislative acts, typically without specifying the reason or details of the vessels. Since 1989, Congress has granted waivers to 133 vessels under the Jones Act in 16 legislative acts, often without specifying vessel details. These waivers are usually found in maritime-related legislation and are not typically for commercially significant vessels. An exception was in 2011 when waivers were granted to three LNG tankers built in the US in the late 1970s. In 2011, waivers were granted to three LNG tankers built in the US in the late 1970s due to technicalities in meeting Jones Act requirements. Specific conditions were placed on how the vessels could be used. Domestic shipping restrictions were waived during World War I and World War II, as well as in 1950 during the Korean War. During World War II, Congress enacted a provision allowing waivers for national defense. This authority has been used in various conflicts and natural disasters to expedite oil shipments and fuel resupply. The executive branch has waived the Jones Act for fuel resupply after natural disasters using the \"national defense waiver\" authority. MARAD checks vessel availability before granting waivers, and foreign-flag vessels have been used due to a lack of heavy-lift vessels in the Jones Act fleet. The lack of heavy-lift vessels in the Jones Act fleet has led to national defense waivers being granted, allowing foreign-flag vessels to transport specific cargo. Waivers have been issued for transporting a radar system from Texas to Hawaii and an oil rig from the Gulf Coast to Alaska. In contrast, a waiver request to transport replicas of Christopher Columbus's ships was denied in 1992. CBP has denied Jones Act waivers for heavy-lift vessels transporting replicas of Christopher Columbus's ships, citing the high standard of \"national defense\" justification. Waivers have been granted for other specific cargo transport, such as a radar system and an oil rig. In 1976, some Members of Congress sought to extend the Jones Act to the U.S. Virgin Islands due to concerns about the vulnerability of offshore supply lines. The largest refinery in North America was located in the U.S. Virgin Islands at that time, supplying petroleum products to the U.S. Northeast. In 2014, northeast refineries considered seeking a Jones Act waiver to ship crude oil from Texas. The United States exported 40-80 million barrels of crude oil per month on foreign-flag tankers in 2018, while importing 150 million barrels per month from overseas sources on foreign-flag tankers. Additionally, about 15 million barrels per month were shipped domestically on Jones Act tankers. The United States exports crude oil on foreign-flag tankers and imports from overseas sources. LNG is also exported by ship, with Puerto Rico seeking a Jones Act waiver for bulk shipments from the U.S. mainland. There are no LNG tankers in the Jones Act fleet. Trinidad and Tobago is requesting a 10-year waiver of the Jones Act to receive LNG shipments from the U.S. mainland. The Jones Act covers various types of vessels, including oceangoing ships. As of March 2018, there were 99 oceangoing ships in the Jones Act-compliant fleet. As of March 2018, the Jones Act-compliant fleet consists of 99 oceangoing ships, with tankers being the largest category. There are 57 tankers in the fleet, including those carrying Alaskan crude oil and medium-sized product tankers. The dry cargo fleet includes container ships, roll on/roll off vessels, and dry bulk vessels. Additionally, there are general-cargo vessels in the fleet. The Jones Act-compliant fleet consists of 99 oceangoing ships, including tankers, container ships, roll on/roll off vessels, and dry bulk vessels. The fleet also includes general-cargo vessels supplying subsistence harbors along Alaska's coast. The number of oceangoing ships in the fleet has decreased significantly since 1950, with a notable drop in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The U.S. merchant marine fleet saw a decline in size in the late 1950s and early 1960s. In 1967, Secretary of Transportation Alan Boyd criticized the fleet as \"too small, too old, and too unproductive.\" The Jones Act has faced calls for repeal, with domestic ships carrying less freight compared to railroads and pipelines. Ships have lost market share to railroads and pipelines, despite their economic advantages. Ocean carriers can move more cargo efficiently without the need for rights-of-way. Many shippers prioritize lower costs over speed, making ships a viable option for domestic trade routes like Alaska and Hawaii. The Jones Act fleet operates in domestic trade routes serving Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico where shippers have few alternatives. While it has preserved a U.S. maritime industry, it has not met the goal of increasing the nation's commerce carried by the merchant marine. Congress amended the policy goals in the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 to include providing shipping service on essential routes. The Merchant Marine Act of 1936 amended policy goals to include providing shipping service on essential routes and having the safest and most suitable vessels. However, the Jones Act fleet does not appear to achieve these goals, as not all ship designs are represented. The Jones Act fleet lacks certain types of vessels like \"project cargo\" or \"heavy-lift\" vessels for carrying oversized equipment. The Department of Defense has used waivers to move such cargo on foreign-flag vessels. The Jones Act fleet lacks project cargo and heavy-lift vessels, leading to the need for waivers to move oversized equipment on foreign-flag vessels. Jones Act operators face challenges in competing for international shipments due to higher costs. The oceangoing Jones Act fleet has two inactive dry bulk ships, possibly due to their age, which is twice the economic life of global fleet ships. The sole Jones Act-qualified chemical tanker was built in 1968. The Jones Act fleet lacks project cargo and heavy-lift vessels, leading to the need for waivers to move oversized equipment on foreign-flag vessels. The sole Jones Act-qualified chemical tanker was built in 1968. No LNG tankers are in the Jones Act fleet despite new domestic markets from the shale gas boom. The high cost of U.S.-built and U.S.-crewed ships has led to the development of a unique vessel design called an articulated tug barge (ATB), with over 150 ATBs estimated to be operating in the Jones Act trades. The unique vessel design, an articulated tug barge (ATB), is used in the Jones Act trades. ATBs are more capable than flatwater barges in handling sea swells due to a hinge between the tug and barge. However, they are less reliable and efficient over longer voyages compared to tanker ships. The notch between the barge and tug creates more resistance through the water. ATBs sailing closer to the coasts could pose a higher risk of grounding and provide less time to prevent spilled oil from reaching shorelines. ATB crews may not be qualified to sail. The El Faro, a Jones Act general cargo ship that sank in a hurricane in 2015, had open lifeboats instead of closed lifeboats with auto launchers required on newer ships. The Coast Guard forbade its sister ship from sailing due to concerns about its condition. The Coast Guard forbade the sister ship of the El Faro from sailing due to concerns about its condition, leading to worries about the rest of the U.S.-flag fleet being in substandard condition. The fleet is significantly older than the global average, increasing the risk of breakdowns. The Jones Act fleet is significantly older than the global average, increasing the risk of breakdowns. In February 2019, the crew of the 46 year-old containership Matsonia found a crack in the hull. New ships were needed to comply with tighter regulations. The Jones Act oceangoing fleet has seen a decrease in the number of older ships, with just over one-third now being 21 years old or older. The Great Lakes fleet, on the other hand, consists of older dry bulk ships and large barges carrying iron ore, limestone, coal, and cement. The U.S. fleet includes 1,000-foot freighters, the largest ships in operation. The U.S. fleet on the Great Lakes consists of 33 dry bulk ships and large barges carrying iron ore, limestone, coal, and cement. These ships are among the largest operating on the Great Lakes, with the largest ones built between 1972 and 1981. The second-largest class of ships, around 700 feet in length, is older, with some vessels dating back to the 1940s or 1950s. Ships operating in freshwater, like the Great Lakes, have longer lifespans compared to oceangoing vessels. Jones Act-compliant Great Lakes ships are narrower for their length due to the dimensions of the Soo Locks. The Canadian Great Lakes fleet's age is similar to the Jones Act fleet, with the youngest ship built in 1985. Canada imposed a 25% tariff on newly constructed imported ships, halting new additions to the fleet. The import tariff was repealed in 2010. Canada imposed a 25% tariff on imported ships, halting new additions to the Canadian fleet. The tariff was repealed in 2010, leading to the construction of over 35 new dry bulk ships for service on the Great Lakes. Thousands of tugs and barges transport dry and liquid bulk commodities on inland rivers, dominated by corn, soybeans, and coal movements. Since 1990, overall tonnage on the system has been flat or declining slightly, with one of the leading manufacturers of river barges ceasing operation in April 2018 due to decreased demand for coal deliveries by barge. The Dredging Act of 1906 requires U.S.-built, -operated, and -crewed vessels for dredging in U.S. waters, prompted by dredging work in Galveston Bay, TX after a 1900 hurricane. The 1906 Dredging Act requires U.S.-built, -operated, and -crewed vessels for dredging in U.S. waters. In 1988, the Jones Act was amended to include valueless material as \"merchandise,\" necessitating dredge spoil transportation in Jones Act-qualified vessels. This requirement increases the cost of dredging U.S. harbors significantly. The cost of dredging U.S. harbors has substantially increased over the last decade, despite a rise in federal spending. Factors such as limited dredging vessels, higher fuel and material costs, labor expenses, and stricter environmental regulations contribute to the cost escalation. The U.S. privately owned fleet is older and smaller compared to leading European dredging firms. The U.S. privately owned fleet is much older and smaller compared to leading European dredging firms, with European firms having a fleet of hopper dredges three to four times larger in capacity. When the Army Corps bids harbor work requiring a hopper dredge, one of the four U.S. firms is the sole bidder over a third of the time. The European fleet is younger, and when the Army Corps bids harbor work needing a hopper dredge, a U.S. firm is often the sole bidder. Insufficient dredges can cause delays in projects, with mobilization costs being significant. Foreign firms use heavy-lift vessels for transport, which are not available in the Jones Act fleet. In 2017, the offshore supply vessel fleet consisted of about 1,800 vessels, mainly working in the Gulf of Mexico. Annual construction averaged 32 vessels over the last decade, with a range between 4 and 53 vessels. Foreign-built vessels with dynamic positioning propulsion systems are used for construction in deeper waters where anchoring is not possible. The Jones Act fleet lacks vessels with dynamic positioning propulsion systems for construction work in deep waters. This poses challenges for installing wind towers and serving as a naval auxiliary in times of war or national emergency. Congress has designated other fleets for sealift support since 1920, but Jones Act ships' crew are still considered part of the mariners available for crewing. In 2014, Congress directed the Department of Transportation and the Department of Defense to develop a national sealift strategy, which has yet to be issued. Jones Act mariners crewing oceangoing ships are crucial for military sealift support, but the shrinking U.S. mariner pool raises concerns about crewing a reserve sealift fleet. The Jones Act mariners crew oceangoing ships and are crucial for military sealift support. They have six months of shore leave per year and would crew a reserve fleet of government-owned cargo ships for military sealift purposes. The crew consists of about 3,380 merchant mariners, which is 29% of the total mariner pool needed for the reserve fleet. The U.S.-flag privately owned international fleet and the Military Sealift Command fleet would provide mariners to crew the government-owned reserve fleet. MARAD estimates a shortfall of about 1,800 mariners for prolonged sealift efforts. MARAD estimates a shortfall of about 1,800 mariners for prolonged sealift efforts, as the mariner pool is barely sufficient for an immediate surge and insufficient for a longer sealift effort. This has been a consistent finding of sealift officials for decades, even when the mariner pool was larger in the past. For example, in 2004, the Department of Defense Transportation Command found a similar shortfall when the mariner pool was 16,900, and in 1991, when the mariner pool was 25,000. In 2004, the RRF had 59 ships and 16,900 mariners. In 1991, the RRF had 96 ships and 25,000 mariners. The mariner pool has been consistently insufficient for prolonged sealift efforts. The RRF, MSC, and MSP were established for military sealift, with predominantly foreign-built ships. The RRF currently has 46 ships. The RRF, MSC, and MSP are military sealift programs with predominantly foreign-built ships. The RRF consists of 46 ships on standby with a skeleton crew of 600 mariners, requiring an additional 1,200 mariners once activated. MSC ships are controlled by TRANSCOM and mostly crewed by civilian mariners. MSP ships were established by Congress in 1996. The MSP ships, established by Congress in 1996, receive a $5 million operating subsidy per vessel annually for American crews. They heavily rely on government cargoes reserved for them under the \"cargo preference\" law. MARAD advocates for the U.S. maritime industry, ensuring military utilization of MSP ships before MSC ships. Jones Act operators must use more expensive U.S.-built ships. The military prioritizes using MSP ships over MSC ships, which are more cost-effective foreign-built vessels. There is a suggestion to require domestically built sealift fleet to share the higher cost nationally. This would make coastwise ships more competitive with railroads. The higher cost of domestically built sealift fleet would be shared nationally, making coastwise ships more price-competitive with other transportation modes. This would increase the mariner pool for sealift support and boost repair and maintenance work for U.S. shipyards. The sealift ships could be designed to military specifications for flexible capabilities. The military sealift fleet consists of ships with ramps or cranes for unloading cargo at underdeveloped ports, product tankers for fuel, Ro/Ro ships for tanks and trucks, and container ships for ammunition. The military prefers versatile ships, while the commercial fleet leans towards specialized and larger ships for cost efficiency. The trend in the commercial fleet is towards specialized and larger ships with low operating costs, replacing general cargo and break-bulk ships. Container ships without onboard cranes are now common, leading to a lack of experience in operating cargo cranes for commercial mariners. The largest container ships require more depth than many ports can provide. Ro/Ro ships have been replaced by \"pure car\" ships. The trend in the commercial fleet is towards specialized and larger ships with low operating costs. Container ships without onboard cranes are now common, leading to a lack of experience in operating cargo cranes for commercial mariners. The largest container ships require more depth than many ports can provide. Ro/Ro ships have been replaced by \"pure car\" ships. Cost pressures have induced commercial carriers to install engines that minimize fuel costs by operating at lower speeds, which may not be suitable for military purposes. More stringent sulfur emission regulations have prompted ship operators to convert to LNG-fueled engines or install scrubbers, impacting cargo space. The regulations have led ship operators to switch to LNG-fueled engines or install scrubbers, impacting cargo space. There is a growing disparity between military vessel designs and commercial carriers, as well as in crew skill sets. The Merchant Marine Act of 1970 aims to maintain a shipyard industrial base with the ability to build and repair ships. The Merchant Marine Act of 1970 aims to maintain a shipyard industrial base with the ability to build and repair ships. U.S. shipyards face challenges in achieving economies of scale due to low production rates, with gaps between orders for container ships. One shipyard that builds only commercial ships reported a decline in employment and no vessels under construction as of March 31, 2019.

The Navy's plan to recapitalize the reserve fleet includes building new vessels in domestic shipyards, repairing ships to extend their service life, and purchasing used, foreign-built ships due to cost and time constraints. Repairing vessels has been more expensive and time-consuming than projected, prompting consideration of accelerating the purchase of foreign-built ships. The Jones Act and Tariff Act of 1930 aim to support U.S. shipyards by imposing duties on repairs done on U.S. flag ships in foreign yards. Despite the 50% duty, many U.S.-flag international trading ships still opt for repairs in foreign yards due to lower costs compared to domestic shipyards. This trend was confirmed by a U.S.-flag operator in 2018."
