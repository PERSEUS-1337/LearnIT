The Corps maintains navigation channels, harbors, locks, and dams on these waterways. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers manages the Inland Waterway System, covering 25,000 miles and handling half of all national freight. The Corps funds maintenance and construction through appropriations and user fees, with costs shared for new construction or major rehabilitation. The current funding model for the Inland Waterway System is facing challenges as the existing revenue source is insufficient to cover nonfederal costs of major capital expenditures, leading to federal taxpayers covering more than half of these costs. This shortfall is limiting new and ongoing construction projects on inland waterways. The current funding model for the Inland Waterway System is facing challenges as federal taxpayers cover more than half of the costs. Changes to the financing system are needed to support new construction projects. Recent proposals suggest increasing fuel tax and federal share for inland waterway costs. The user industry supports a plan to raise the fuel tax and increase the federal share for inland waterway costs. Inland waterways have been used for commercial transport since before the nation's founding, with federal support beginning in the early 1800s. Inland waterways have been used for commerce since before the nation's founding, with federal support starting in the early 1800s. While other forms of transportation have reduced reliance on waterways, they still play a significant role in the nation's transportation network, accounting for 4%-5% of total commercial tonnage shipped annually. Inland waterways are a vital transportation route for bulk goods over long distances, especially for grain, oilseed exports, coal, petroleum, chemicals, metals, cement, sand, and gravel. Despite projections of increased traffic, actual usage has remained steady. Actual traffic on inland waterways has remained somewhat flat over the last 20 years in terms of both tonnage and ton-miles, despite projections of increased traffic. Overall freight tonnage for all modes of domestic shipping has increased at an average annual rate of 1.2% from 1997 to 2007 and is expected to double over the next 25 years. Inland waterway traffic is projected to increase at a slower rate compared to rail and highway shipping. The federal government invests in inland waterways due to their value to the nation, with almost all tonnage transported through the Mississippi and Ohio River System. Inland waterway traffic is projected to increase at a slower rate compared to rail and highway shipping over the next 25 years. The federal government invests in inland waterways for their national value, with significant funding provided through the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Legislation in the 1970s and 1980s introduced user cost-sharing requirements, transforming inland waterway financing. The Inland Waterways Revenue Act of 1978 and the Water Resources Development Act created the current financing framework. The Inland Waterways Revenue Act of 1978 and the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 transformed inland waterway financing by introducing a fuel tax on commercial barges, cost-share requirements for projects, and a trust fund to hold revenues for construction investments. The Inland Waterways Revenue Act of 1978 introduced a fuel tax on commercial barges and established the Inland Waterways Trust Fund to fund construction investments. This increased financial responsibility for commercial operators on the inland waterway system. The Inland Waterways Revenue Act of 1978 introduced a fuel tax on commercial barges, gradually increasing to $0.10 per gallon by FY1986. WRDA 1986 authorized further increases to $0.20 per gallon by 1994, with a 50/50 cost-sharing process for inland waterway construction projects. The Inland Waterways Revenue Act of 1978 introduced a fuel tax on commercial barges, gradually increasing to $0.10 per gallon by FY1986. WRDA 1986 established a cost-sharing process for inland waterway construction projects, with 50% funding from the IWTF and 50% from the Treasury's General Revenue fund. Expenditures from the IWTF for construction projects require authorization from Congress and annual discretionary appropriations. Operations and maintenance costs remain a 100% federal responsibility. WRDA 1986 authorized projects funded by the IWTF with 100% federal funding for inland waterway costs, excluding construction and major maintenance. Congress has made appropriations for these projects in annual bills. The Inland Waterways Users Board (IWUB) was established by WRDA 1986 as a federal advisory committee with 11 members representing shipping interests on inland waterways. Federal funding for operations and maintenance costs, which often exceed construction and rehabilitation costs, is a key part of policy discussions related to inland waterways. The Inland Waterways Users Board (IWUB) was established by the Advisory Committees Act in Section 302 of WRDA 1986. It consists of 11 members representing shipping interests on inland waterways, with a focus on tonnage shipped. The board meets three times a year to make recommendations to the Secretary of the Army and Congress on IWTF projects. The IWTF balance has fluctuated significantly between 1986 and 2011, peaking at $413 million in 2002. Between 1986 and 2011, the IWTF balance fluctuated significantly, peaking at $413 million in 2002. The executive branch proposed fee increases on the user industry, but Congress did not enact these proposals. From FY2005, appropriations from the IWTF increased as the Bush Administration requested greater investments in IWTF-funded projects. Beginning in FY2005, appropriations from the IWTF increased significantly as the Bush Administration requested and Congress appropriated greater investments in IWTF-funded projects. These expenditures exceeded fuel tax collections and interest on the IWTF balance, causing balances to fall sharply from 2005 to 2010. Congress implemented \"stopgap\" measures to prevent the balance from reaching unsustainable levels. To prevent the balance from falling to unsustainable levels, Congress implemented \"stopgap\" measures such as exempting major rehabilitation projects from cost-sharing requirements in FY2009 and providing over $400 million in construction funding for inland waterway projects under ARRA. These measures helped limit costs to the IWTF for ongoing projects. The IWTF balance has stabilized due to Congress implementing measures like exempting funding from cost-share requirements and limiting appropriations to expected fuel tax revenues. Without changes to IWTF financing, funding for new projects will be extremely limited in the future. Funding for new inland waterways projects is expected to be limited without changes to IWTF financing. Most funding is projected to go to the Olmsted Locks and Dam project, potentially increasing the project backlog. Concerns have been raised about structural inefficiencies and inequities in the Corps project planning process. Complaints have been raised by fuel tax payers regarding inefficiencies and inequities in the Corps project planning process for inland waterways investments. Reforms were implemented in FY2006 to address concerns, including risk-based cost estimates and prioritized funding for projects at high risk of cost overruns. Several reforms have been made to the project delivery process, such as risk-based cost estimates and prioritized funding for high-risk projects. While improvements have been recognized, there are calls for additional structural reforms to the planning process, with concerns raised about cost overruns and project planning issues, particularly at the Olmsted Locks and Dam project. The estimated cost for the Olmsted project has significantly increased over time due to design and method changes. The estimated cost for the Olmsted project has increased significantly over time, with the previously authorized cost of $775 billion being increased to $2.9 billion in 2013. The project was 49% complete as of January 1, 2013, with the lock components already finished. The dam and demolition components are expected to be completed in 2020 and 2024, respectively. Concerns about the solvency of the IWTF and the equity of the financing system for fuel-taxed inland waterways have been raised. The Olmsted project components are expected to be completed in 2020 and 2024. Concerns about the solvency of the IWTF and the financing system for fuel-taxed inland waterways have led to recent proposals by the Bush and Obama Administrations. A new recommendation to raise revenues for the IWTF has been presented to Congress, along with a user industry proposal that differs significantly by implementing a fuel tax increase and requiring an increased federal share. The user proposal, different from the Administration's, suggests increasing the fuel tax and requiring a higher federal share for some inland waterway investments. Past Administrations, like Bush and Obama, have proposed raising commercial user fees on inland waterways. In 2008, the Bush Administration proposed a lock usage fee to replace the fuel tax and generate more revenue for the IWTF. In 2008, a legislative proposal was submitted to Congress to replace the fuel tax with a lock usage fee for commercial barges, generating additional revenue for the IWTF. The fee would phase in charges based on lock chamber size and tie IWTF balances to user fees after 2012. The Bush Administration argued for a shift in user fees towards lock users. The Bush Administration proposed shifting user fees towards lock users to improve equity in waterborne commerce investments. However, both the House and Senate appropriations committees rejected this approach, citing concerns about the burden it would pose on lock users. Congress provided temporary relief through stopgap measures and requested the executive branch to reconsider its approach. The Obama Administration proposed new user fees for inland waterways in its budget requests to Congress, aiming to increase efficiency and revenues by reducing traffic at high-traffic locks. However, Congress rejected the proposal in its consideration of FY2010 appropriations. The Obama Administration proposed user fees to increase efficiency and revenues by reducing traffic at locks. Congress rejected the proposal in FY2010 appropriations. Recent budgets continue to suggest user fees to supplement fuel tax revenues, with Congress generally rejecting the proposals. The FY2013 and FY2014 budgets assumed $80 million in new revenues from inland waterways. The Obama Administration proposed user fees to increase efficiency and revenues by reducing traffic at locks. Recent budgets suggested user fees to supplement fuel tax revenues, with Congress generally rejecting the proposals. The FY2013 and FY2014 budgets assumed $80 million in new revenues from inland waterways, but none of these proposals have been enacted. The 2011 Obama Administration plan for deficit reduction included a new inland waterway financing structure with a two-tier annual fee. The Obama Administration proposed a two-tier annual fee for commercial shippers to increase revenues and efficiency by reducing traffic at locks. The fee would be set by the Corps to achieve revenue targets, with vessels using locks paying a higher fee. The Administration did not specify the fee amount but outlined revenue targets in proposed legislation. The Obama Administration proposed a two-tier annual fee for commercial shippers to increase revenues and efficiency by reducing traffic at locks. The fee would be set by the Corps to achieve revenue targets, with vessels using locks paying a higher fee. The Administration did not specify an amount for the fee but instead stipulated revenue targets to be achieved, estimating approximately $1 billion in additional revenues for the IWTF over 10 years. The proposal included adding 39 individual segments to the existing inland waterway system. The Obama Administration proposed a two-tier annual fee for commercial shippers to increase revenues and efficiency by reducing traffic at locks. The fee would be set by the Corps to achieve revenue targets, with vessels using locks paying a higher fee. Most proposed new segments are contiguous with the current system of inland waterways, but are not likely to achieve significant new revenues. The Inland Waterways Users Board (IWUB) adopted and transmitted to Congress a proposal of its own in 2010. The IWUB report, representing the preferred alternative of the inland waterway user industry, was introduced as legislation in the 112th and 113th Congress. It was prepared at the request of the IWUB and some Corps employees, but not formally endorsed by the Corps or the Administration. Many of its recommendations have been opposed by the Obama Administration. The IWUB report recommended a new financing system and proposed changes for inland waterways, including increasing user fees and the federal share of costs. The Obama Administration opposed many of these recommendations. The IWUB report recommends increasing the Federal Share of Inland Waterway Costs, modifying cost-share requirements, shifting to more General Revenue funding for projects, increasing overall spending on inland waterways, and involving IWUB in project planning. The report also suggests adopting prioritization criteria and raising the inland waterway fuel tax rate. The IWUB report proposes increasing the inland waterway fuel tax rate by $0.06-$0.09 per gallon, depending on fuel tax collections. This would generate approximately $112 million per year in fuel tax revenues for the IWTF, an increase from the current $85 million annually. Most of the new revenue would be saved for future years. The IWUB report suggests raising the inland waterway fuel tax by $0.06-$0.09 per gallon, aiming to generate around $112 million annually. The new revenue would be saved for future use, with a shift towards more federal funding for inland waterway projects. The IWUB report recommends increasing federal investments in inland waterways and reducing cost-sharing projects. It suggests exempting dam-related expenses and locks rehabilitation projects under $100 million from cost-sharing requirements. Additionally, a cap on IWTF funds usage is proposed to prevent construction cost overruns. Critics argue that this could lead to hidden costs, as all overruns are currently shared between the federal government and IWTF. The IWUB report proposes increasing federal funding for inland waterways and reducing cost-sharing for certain projects. This would shift the overall cost-share for IWTF projects, increasing the federal share from 50% to around 70% for some projects over the next 25 years. The report also suggests capping IWTF funds to prevent construction cost overruns. The IWUB report proposes an overall increase in funding for inland waterways, with full funding requiring annual expenditures averaging $380 million, a significant increase over historical averages. This includes increases in funding from the IWTF and the General Revenue fund. Total expenditures since 1994 have averaged $234 million annually, with FY2011 expenditures estimated at approximately $170 million. The proposed increase in funding for inland waterways would require approximately $380 million annually, with federal funding covering 74% of the total amount needed over the first five years. Initially, most of the increase would come from the General Revenue fund to rebuild the trust fund balance, with a gradual shift towards trust fund contributions around 2020. The report proposes increased funding for inland waterways projects, with federal funding covering 74% of the required investments over the first five years. By 2020, funds from the trust fund would gradually increase, but more new funding would still be needed from the federal government. The report also suggests reforms to improve cost-effectiveness of IWTF projects overseen by the Corps, including increased involvement of the IWUB in project delivery. The report recommends increasing IWUB involvement in Corps project delivery for IWTF investments, appointing representatives to project design teams, obtaining sign-off on project plans, and providing status updates. These changes are sought by IWUB as nonfederal cost-sharers. The IWUB seeks increased involvement in Corps project delivery for IWTF investments, including appointing representatives to project design teams and obtaining sign-off on project plans. Concerns about conflicts of interest and federal control of planning process may arise. Specific projects will receive funding once proposed changes to the financing system are implemented. The report prioritized projects based on asset condition, performance impact, and system improvement. Final funding decisions would still be made by Congress or the Corps. The proposal aims to increase project selection likelihood by recommending Corps involvement. The proposal suggests criteria for selecting inland waterway projects to increase likelihood of selection. Some advocate for shifting costs from the federal government to users due to disparities in spending. The Congressional Budget Office found that the current uniform tax on the inland waterway system does not cover fixed operational costs, leading to distortions in maintenance costs. They recommended implementing a user fee structure to increase economic efficiency, even though it would raise costs for waterways with low traffic-to-expense ratios. Several entities have proposed significant increases to inland waterway fees to achieve savings for the federal government. A coalition of taxpayer watchdog and environmental organizations recommended Congress increase user contributions for inland waterway expenditures in its 2011 \"Green Scissors\" report. Several organizations proposed increasing user fees for inland waterways to save money for the government. The \"Green Scissors\" report suggested raising fees, estimating $1 billion in savings over five years. The National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform also recommended making inland waterways \"self-funding,\" with projected savings of $500 million over five years. Additionally, the CBO proposed increasing user fees to cover construction, operations, and maintenance costs. The CBO proposed increasing user fees on inland waterways to cover costs, saving $4 billion over 10 years. The proposal aims to shift more financing responsibility to users but lacks specific fee structure recommendations. The CBO proposed new user fees for inland waterways, including annual licensing fees, congestion pricing, tolls, and lockage fees. These proposals aim to address ongoing issues with the IWTF by altering the current financing system and increasing investment levels. Congress must decide on the level of new investment needed for the inland waterway system. The current financing system for inland waterways is under scrutiny by Congress, with questions about the level of investment needed, potential changes to fuel taxes, and cost-share arrangements for projects. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 made limited changes to inland waterways financing. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 (P.L. 113-121) made changes to inland waterways financing, including project delivery recommendations, federal responsibility for rehabilitation costs under $20 million, reduced cost-sharing for the Olmsted Locks and Dam Project, and efforts to provide more information about inland waterways. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 made changes to inland waterways financing, including project delivery recommendations, reduced cost-sharing for the Olmsted Locks and Dam Project, and efforts to provide more information about inland waterways policy options. The bill also authorized studies on revenue collection efficiency, potential use of bonds and new fees, and convened a stakeholder roundtable to evaluate alternatives for the future of inland waterways. The House Appropriations Committee funded the Olmsted Project with reduced cost-sharing requirements under the WRRDA, allowing for significant funding for other inland waterways construction projects. However, it is believed that these changes will not be enough to finance all necessary waterway upgrades in the long-term. Some support the enactment of user proposals to address this issue. Some support the enactment of user proposals, such as H.R. 1149 (the WAVE4 Act), to address the long-term solvency of the IWTF by authorizing fuel tax increases and altering cost-sharing. The bill proposes a $0.06 per gallon increase to the fuel tax and shifts the responsibility of dam construction and rehabilitation costs to the federal government. Another bill suggests a $0.09 per gallon fuel tax increase and lowers the threshold for federal responsibility to $50 million for rehabilitation expenditure. These proposals aim to address the long-term solvency of the IWTF. Some proposals suggest a fuel tax increase and shifting dam construction and rehabilitation costs to the federal government, aiming to address the long-term solvency of the IWTF. Commercial users argue for additional investment in federal waterways due to aging infrastructure, capacity expansion needs, and environmental benefits of inland waterway shipping. Environmental externalities associated with inland waterway shipping are debated by various groups, with some advocating for increased federal funding while others argue against it. Despite disagreements, most agree that the current financing system for inland waterways is insufficient for future needs. Most entities agree that the current financing system for inland waterways is inadequate for future needs. The Corps may only have funding for one lock replacement project through FY2016, leading to potential delays in construction projects without new revenue or federal appropriations. The Corps may put projects on hold regardless of urgency due to aging infrastructure, particularly locks past their 50-year design age. This has led to increased lock unavailability, prompting calls for increased investment in inland waterways. User industries are leaning towards new lock construction and expanded capacity over maintenance. In recent years, there has been an increase in both scheduled and unscheduled lock unavailability. User industries prefer new lock construction and expanded capacity over ongoing maintenance. Environmental groups argue against new investments, stating that regular maintenance can extend the life of existing locks for an additional 50 years at a lower cost than new construction. They believe that the costs of new lock construction outweigh the benefits. Environmental groups argue that regular maintenance can extend the life of existing locks for an additional 50 years at a lower cost than new construction. They believe that the costs of new lock construction greatly exceed the benefits and can be overcome by small-scale and nonstructural improvements. The Corps notes that new navigation alternatives depend greatly on unpredictable traffic forecasts from future trade scenarios. The Corps has avoided specific projections for inland waterway freight traffic, but the Department of Transportation projects a 2% annual increase in waterway traffic between 2010 and 2035. Total domestic freight traffic is expected to increase by 70% by 2020, with the majority of the increase on freight rail and highway traffic. Annual waterway traffic is projected to increase by 2% between 2010 and 2035. Efficiency improvements in inland waterways could reduce pressure on highway and rail shipments. Future lock upgrades or new construction may boost demand for inland waterways, depending on external factors. Some groups question the need for new lock construction based on traffic projections. Some groups question the need for new lock construction based on traffic projections, noting flat or decreasing traffic at certain locks. Critics argue that previous traffic projections by the Corps were overly optimistic. The Corps has not used projected traffic increases to justify changes in investments on inland waterways. Shipping interests advocate for increased investment in inland waterways due to their overall value. Shipping interests advocate for increased investment in inland waterways, citing studies that show barge shipping is more efficient and environmentally friendly than rail or highway transportation. Industry research indicates that railroads are 28.3% less fuel-efficient than inland waterways, and that waterborne freight transportation emits significantly fewer greenhouse gases per mile. Inland waterways are argued to be more environmentally friendly and fuel-efficient than rail or highway transportation. Studies show that barge shipping emits fewer greenhouse gases per mile and offers benefits like reduced highway congestion and noise. However, taxpayer and environmental groups question the accuracy of industry fuel-efficiency calculations, pointing out factors like directional constraints of river flow that are not always considered. Environmental groups argue that considering factors like circuity and using specific fuel efficiency data for different modes of transportation can provide a more accurate comparison. They also highlight the negative impact of inland waterway projects on riparian habitat and species due to structural changes like locks, dams, and levees. The construction and expansion of inland waterways, including locks, dams, and levees, can negatively impact riparian habitat and species by altering natural flows and causing bank erosion. Congress is considering changes to the system that finances these investments, including proposed options for additional revenue. Congress is considering changes to the system that finances investments in inland waterways, including proposals for additional revenue such as an increase to the fuel tax, new annual fees, lock usage fees, or toll systems. The IWUB's proposed fuel tax increase aims to rebuild the trust fund balance and fund new investments. The IWUB proposes a fuel tax increase to rebuild the trust fund balance and fund new investments. Some groups argue against the proposal due to increased federal cost share responsibilities. The Obama Administration's 2011 proposal suggested new user fees for commercial users on the inland waterway system. The Obama Administration's 2011 proposal aims to raise new fees from commercial users on the inland waterway system to address inadequate revenues. The proposed system includes fuel taxes and new fees for non-lock users, with lock users paying even higher fees. Additionally, new waterway segments would be added to the list of fuel-taxed waterways to further increase revenues. The Administration argues that commercial shippers, as the primary beneficiaries of waterway investments, should continue to pay. The Obama Administration's 2011 proposal aims to raise new fees from commercial users on the inland waterway system to address inadequate revenues. The Administration argues that commercial shippers, as the primary beneficiaries of waterway investments, should continue to pay for new capital investments. The IWUB and Congress have previously rejected lock usage fees and similar proposals, opposing the new Administration proposal targeting individual segments, as it goes against the idea of the inland waterways as a whole system. The user industry opposes the proposed fee increase for inland waterways, arguing that it disrupts the system's interconnected benefits. They also object to the delegation of fee-setting authority to the Secretary of the Army. Congress has considered alternative revenue sources in the past, such as lock usage fees and other supplements to the fuel tax. Lock usage fees, annual licensing fees, tolls, ton-mile charges, and lock charges for congested areas have been proposed as alternatives to the fuel tax for raising revenues on inland waterways. The concept of \"capital recovery\" was included in 1978 legislation but not enacted. User industry opposes fee increase and delegation of fee-setting authority to the Secretary of the Army. The 1978 legislation included the concept of \"capital recovery\" through user fees to recover government investments. User fees could adjust automatically based on IWTF balance or be structured to recover capital costs at individual facilities. This concept is also present in the Obama Administration proposal. The Obama Administration proposal includes user fees tied to trust fund balances after FY2022, with concerns raised about the difficulty of planning for constantly changing taxes and potential cost increases. Congress could explore options like automatic inflation adjustments to enhance revenue stream reliability for inland waterways. An automatic inflation adjustment could be considered to increase revenue reliability for inland waterways, potentially through a fuel tax increase or new lockage fee. This adjustment aims to boost future revenues and counter the decreased purchasing power of IWTF funds since 1994. However, concerns exist about hidden tax increases in the future. Without a long-term solution for the IWTF revenue shortfall, Congress may need to intervene to ensure the trust fund's solvency. If no long-term solution is implemented for the IWTF revenue shortfall, Congress may need to take action to ensure the trust fund's solvency. Options could include capping withdrawals at current fuel tax revenues or temporarily halting new contracts. These measures would limit investments in the inland waterway system. Congress may also consider exempting some IWTF investments from cost-sharing requirements, similar to past exemptions, but this would come at an additional cost to taxpayers. The WRDA 1986 established cost-sharing requirements for inland waterway projects, with construction and major lock rehabilitation being cost-shared. WRDA 1992 later established that \"major rehabilitation\" projects would also be cost-shared. Congress is considering whether the current cost-share arrangement is balanced. The WRDA 1986 and WRDA 1992 established cost-sharing requirements for inland waterway projects, with major rehabilitation defined as upgrades requiring over $8 million in funding. The IWUB proposal aims to modify cost-sharing arrangements by shifting funding for dams and minor rehabilitation to 100% federal funding. The IWUB proposes shifting funding for dams and minor rehabilitation projects to 100% federal funding, with a new threshold of $100 million for major lock rehabilitation projects. This would greatly increase the number of federally funded maintenance and rehabilitation projects. The IWUB proposes to increase federal funding for maintenance and rehabilitation projects by setting a new threshold of $100 million, shifting the responsibility for cost overruns to the federal government. Critics argue that this change would ultimately shift the overall costs of inland waterway projects towards the federal government. The IWUB's proposed changes would shift costs for inland waterway projects towards the federal government, changing the cost-share arrangement to 68% federal, 32% non-federal. While some support this shift to distribute the burden, others argue that the IWTF already receives significant federal funding. The IWUB's proposed changes would increase federal funding for inland waterway projects, potentially raising federal costs to over 90% of the total expenses. Currently, the federal government covers about 80%-85% of these costs annually. The federal government currently covers 80%-85% of the costs for the inland waterway system. Proposed changes may increase federal funding to over 90%, with user fees also contributing to the expenses. Some argue for shifting more costs to users and away from the federal government. Some groups advocate for shifting more costs to waterway users, suggesting they pay for construction, rehabilitation, operations, and maintenance expenses currently covered by the federal government. These proposals, previously rejected by Congress, may be reconsidered amidst government cost-cutting efforts. The IWUB has proposed reforms to increase its involvement in Corps IWTF planning processes and improve project prioritization. Industry users believe these reforms will reduce cost overruns, which have been a problem in the past due to inaccurate construction schedules and costs. The Corps' previous study identified factors contributing to cost overruns in IWTF projects, including inaccurate construction schedules and costs, general cost escalation, and non-optimal funding. Concerns about conflicts of interest may arise from the degree of involvement by non-federal entities in the planning process. Congressional attention may focus on the Corps' prioritization method for inland waterway projects, as investments have been considered in isolation without a formal set of criteria for decision-making. The IWUB report proposes a priority ranking system for IWTF investments, aiming to change the current practice of project selection being left to the Corps, Administration, and Congress. The report recommends this system be regulated, potentially impacting Congress's role in project funding decisions. If a system for prioritizing investments is regulated, Congress's role in project funding decisions could be limited to providing authorizations and overall funding levels, changing its previous direct involvement in directing Corps projects. The role of Congress in directing Corps projects may change to focus on authorizations and funding levels, aligning with federal project allocation approaches for other agency programs like the EPA's state revolving fund programs."
