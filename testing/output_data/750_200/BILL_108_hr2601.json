    "content": "The \"Public Domain Enhancement Act\" may be cited as the short title of this legislation. The findings section of the Act is also included. The Congress finds that the copyright clause in the United States Constitution grants Congress the power to promote the progress of science and arts by securing exclusive rights to authors for limited times, providing an economic incentive for creating and disseminating ideas. \"The copyright term is limited to prevent permanent deprivation of the public from an artist's work. Both commercial and noncommercial creators rely on a healthy public domain.\" Both commercial and noncommercial creators benefit from a healthy public domain, using it for various purposes such as publishing titles, creating new productions, and generating materials for schools, museums, and libraries. The public domain is utilized by schools, museums, and libraries for educational and cultural materials. Media sources like the World Wide Web also benefit from public domain content. Current copyright law protects works from 1923 onwards, but older works are often no longer commercially available. Older works between 55 and 75 years old may not retain commercial value but can still be useful for historians, artists, and teachers. However, current copyright laws prevent these abandoned works from entering the public domain for many years, hindering their potential for building upon and preserving by commercial and noncommercial entities. The existing copyright system hinders abandoned works from entering the public domain, contrary to the intent of the Framers of the Constitution and Congress. It is necessary to establish a mechanism for abandoned American copyrights to enter the public domain. Establishing a maintenance fee for published United States works is necessary to allow abandoned American copyrights to enter the public domain.
