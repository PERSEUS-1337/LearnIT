    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Electricity and Environmental Technology Research and Development Act.\" Congress finds that reliable, affordable, increasingly clean electricity is crucial for powering the growing US economy. The use of electrotechnologies, environmental concerns, competitive electricity markets, and rising energy prices highlight the importance of clean electricity. Coal, currently generating over half of US electricity, is the most abundant fossil energy resource in the country. Coal accounts for over half of US electricity generation and is the most abundant fossil energy resource in the country, comprising more than 85% of all fossil resources. Investments in emissions control technology have reduced pollutants from coal-based facilities by 21% in the past 30 years, despite a nearly tripled use of coal for electricity generation. New technologies for converting coal into electricity can reduce emissions by 21% despite increased coal use. Improved efficiency in electricity generation facilities can allow continued coal use and preserve other energy resources. Initial deployment of new coal generation technologies can improve efficiency by up to 50% and eliminate health-threatening emissions. The initial commercial deployment of new coal generation technologies poses risks in a competitive market, but can improve efficiency by up to 50%. Continued research for near-zero emissions in coal-based generation is crucial. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"cost and performance goals\" refers to the goals established under section 4. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy. SEC. 4. TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT. The Secretary will assess technologies for coal use in electricity generation, chemical feedstocks, and transportation fuel in 2007, 2015, and 2020, consulting with various industry representatives. The Secretary will assess technologies for coal use in various industries, including electric utilities, transportation, and equipment manufacturers, consulting with industry representatives and relevant agencies within 120 days of enactment. The Secretary will issue draft cost and performance goals for public comment within 120 days of enactment, and submit final goals to Congress within 180 days. SEC. 5. STUDY. The Secretary, in cooperation with other agencies, must report to Congress every 2 years on technologies and costs for achieving specific goals. The curr_chunk discusses the development and demonstration of technologies to achieve cost and performance goals, along with recommendations for technology development programs and additional authorities needed. The Secretary will consider expert advice from representatives of relevant entities to develop recommendations for additional authorities needed to achieve cost and performance goals in technology development programs. The Secretary will carry out a program of research, development, demonstration, and commercial application of coal-based technologies to achieve cost and performance goals under various Acts. Authorization of appropriations for the Secretary to carry out sections 4, 5, and 6 is set at $100,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2002 through 2012. This funding is in addition to existing authorizations and does not cap Department of Energy fossil energy research and development and clean coal technology appropriations. Additionally, there is a Clean Coal Power Commercial Applications Initiative. The Secretary will establish a clean coal power commercial applications initiative to demonstrate advanced coal-based technologies for new or existing power plants, including coproduction plants. The technologies must advance efficiency, environmental performance, and cost competitiveness beyond current standards. New technologies may also be included. The Secretary will transmit a plan to Congress within 120 days of the enactment of the Act, outlining program elements, technical milestones, and demonstration activities for advanced coal-based technologies, including those not previously envisioned for commercial applications. The plan will outline program elements, technical milestones, and demonstration activities for advanced coal-based technologies at facilities with at least 50 megawatts nameplate rating to achieve design efficiency improvements. The Act aims to improve environmental performance in coal-based technologies by implementing new alternative technologies or significant improvements in controlling sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, or mercury at facilities with at least 50 megawatts nameplate rating. The Act aims to improve environmental performance in coal-based technologies by implementing new alternative technologies for recycling coal combustion wastes and capturing carbon dioxide at lower costs than current technologies. The Act aims to implement new technologies for recycling coal combustion wastes and capturing carbon dioxide at costs below current technologies. The Act aims to implement new technologies for recycling coal combustion wastes and capturing carbon dioxide at costs below current technologies. Financial assistance is provided under Section 9. The Secretary will solicit proposals for projects at new or existing facilities to achieve performance levels outlined in the plan. Projects may demonstrate an efficiency improvement of at least 3 percentage points compared to current operations. The Act requires a reduction in emissions without increasing potential to emit pollutants like sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and carbon monoxide. For coal with high sulfur emissions, a 5% reduction is mandated. The Act mandates a reduction in emissions without increasing potential to emit pollutants like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide. For coal with high sulfur emissions, a 5% reduction is required. The Act requires reductions in emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and particulate matter based on specific limits per million British thermal units of heat input. The Act mandates emission reductions for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and particulate matter based on specific limits per million British thermal units of heat input. Additionally, emission levels for pollutants specified in the Clean Air Act's new source performance standards may apply if they are lower than the specified limits. The Act mandates emission reductions for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and particulate matter based on specific limits per million British thermal units of heat input. Financial assistance will be provided to projects demonstrating cost reductions in utilizing advanced coal-based technology or producing coal combustion byproducts with increased economic value and no additional emissions. Financial assistance is provided by the Secretary for projects that reduce costs in coal utilization for energy generation, enhance coal competitiveness, meet specific criteria, and apply technologies relevant to 25% of coal-based electricity facilities. The Federal government provides financial assistance for projects that reduce costs in coal utilization for energy generation, enhance coal competitiveness, and meet specific criteria. The Federal share of project costs should not exceed 50%. $100,000,000 is authorized annually for the Secretary to carry out these projects from 2002 to 2012. The Secretary is authorized $100,000,000 annually from 2002 to 2012 for fossil energy programs. Unobligated funds and funds from clean coal technology projects can also be used."
