    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature acknowledges the Fixing America\u2019s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act, which provides long-term funding certainty for surface transportation and mandates the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to award certain grants through rulemaking. The FAST Act includes grant programs for states that meet requirements for impaired driving interventions, such as 24/7 Sobriety programs. The Legislature aims to authorize a statewide 24/7 Sobriety program in California to qualify for FAST Act grant funding and additional NHTSA funding. Section 23582.5 of the Vehicle Code allows courts to order individuals convicted of DUI offenses to participate in a 24/7 Sobriety program as a condition of probation, parole, or sentence if certain criteria are met. The court may require a person arrested for DUI to enroll in a 24/7 Sobriety program as a condition of release on bond if certain criteria are met. A person with a suspended or revoked driving privilege can enroll in a 24/7 Sobriety program to obtain a restricted driving privilege if certain conditions are met, including committing a violation within 10 years of a previous DUI conviction. The restricted driving privilege may be granted with conditions such as participation in the 24/7 Sobriety program instead of or in addition to an ignition interlock device program. A person subject to this subdivision must participate in the 24/7 Sobriety program for a minimum of one year. A \"24/7 Sobriety program\" requires participants to abstain from alcohol or controlled substances, undergo frequent testing, and face immediate sanctions for violations. The program must be evidence-based, meeting specific criteria. Evaluation research shows that the 24/7 Sobriety program produces positive results attributed to the program itself, peer-reviewed by experts, and endorsed by federal agencies or respected research organizations. Participants may also be required to participate in other driving-under-the-influence programs as mandated by California law. The court shall prioritize testing methods that sanction violations promptly. Participants must pay program costs based on their ability to pay. Programs cannot exceed 180 days unless the defendant tests positive for alcohol or drugs or misses a test. The court can impose a program up to 180 days only if the defendant tests positive for alcohol or drugs or misses a test. The Office of Traffic Safety must include provisions for the 24/7 Sobriety program in its highway safety plan. The department will establish uniform data collection and reporting statewide.
