    "content": "The Act titled \"Securing Opioids and Unused Narcotics with Deliberate Disposal and Packaging Act of 2018\" or the \"SOUND Disposal and Packaging Act\" introduces safety-enhancing packaging and disposal features for certain drugs. The Secretary may issue orders requiring the implementation of technologies to reduce drug abuse risks for certain drugs identified in a covered application. Prior consultation is required before issuing such orders. The Secretary must consult with stakeholders before issuing orders to implement technologies for reducing drug abuse risks. Technologies required should be proportionate to the specific risk of abuse or misuse of the drug listed in the application. The Secretary must consult with stakeholders before issuing orders to implement technologies for reducing drug abuse risks. Orders may provide options for implementing or modifying technologies, controls, or measures to reduce the risk of abuse or misuse of the drug listed in the application. The Secretary must consult stakeholders before issuing orders to implement technologies for reducing drug abuse risks. Orders may provide options for implementing or modifying required technologies, controls, or measures, and incorporate standards for packaging or disposal from recognized organizations or the FDA website. The FDA may issue orders to address drug abuse risks for specific drug classes after consulting stakeholders. Holders of covered applications must submit proposed changes to comply with the order in a timely manner. Holders of covered applications must submit proposed changes to comply with FDA orders within 180 calendar days, or a longer period specified by the Secretary, or a requested alternative date if submitted within 60 calendar days of the order. Holders of covered applications must implement approved changes within 90 calendar days of supplement approval or a longer period determined by the Secretary. The Secretary may approve a longer period for implementing changes in covered applications if requested by the holder, to meet federal requirements. Alternative technologies and controls can be proposed and approved by the Secretary. The Secretary may approve alternative technologies, controls, or measures for packaging, storage, or disposal of drugs if supported by data showing they can mitigate abuse or misuse risks to the same extent as specified measures in the order. The Secretary may approve alternative technologies, controls, or measures for packaging, storage, or disposal of drugs to mitigate abuse or misuse risks. Disputes regarding submitted supplements can be appealed using specified dispute resolution procedures. In this section, a 'covered application' refers to an application for approval of a drug containing an opioid listed in schedule II or III. 'Relevant stakeholders' may include scientific experts in the drug manufacturing industry. The Controlled Substances Act defines 'relevant stakeholders' as including scientific experts in the drug manufacturing industry, brand and generic drug manufacturers, standard development organizations, wholesalers, distributors, payers, healthcare providers, pharmacists, pharmacies, poison centers, and representatives from various government agencies and organizations. The Drug Enforcement Agency, Medicaid Services, and other relevant stakeholders are involved in drug regulation. Amendments are made to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act regarding drug approval and application requirements. Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act now require additional information in Abbreviated New Drug Applications for opioids listed in schedule II or III under the Controlled Substances Act. Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act now require additional information in Abbreviated New Drug Applications for opioids listed in schedule II or III under the Controlled Substances Act. The Act specifies that applicants must propose technologies, controls, or measures for drug packaging or disposal that offer comparable protections to those required for the applicable listed drug. Additionally, grounds for refusing to approve an Abbreviated New Drug Application have been expanded to include these new requirements. Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act now require additional information in Abbreviated New Drug Applications for opioids listed in schedule II or III under the Controlled Substances Act. Applicants must propose technologies, controls, or measures for drug packaging or disposal that offer comparable protections to those required for the applicable listed drug. The Act also specifies grounds for refusing to approve an Abbreviated New Drug Application if these requirements are not met. The labeling for drug packaging or disposal must include technologies, controls, or measures to mitigate abuse or misuse, as required by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The labeling requirements for drug packaging or disposal, as mandated by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, do not affect permissible labeling changes or conditions of use for new drugs, nor do they prevent approval of abbreviated new drug applications. The FDA regulations do not limit the type of data the Secretary of Health and Human Services can request for making determinations under section 505-2 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Comptroller General of the United States must submit a report within 12 months of the Act's enactment. The Comptroller General of the United States will submit a report to Congress within 12 months of the Act's enactment, containing evidence on the effectiveness of in-home controlled substance disposal products and barriers to their use by patients and consumers. The report to Congress will include information on the availability and barriers to use of disposal products and packaging technologies for controlled substances, as well as federal oversight of in-home disposal products. The report to Congress will include details on federal oversight of controlled substance packaging technologies, including identification of overseeing agencies and recommended technologies. The report to Congress will include details on federal oversight of controlled substance packaging technologies, recommended technologies like unit dose packaging, packaging with set durations, and their effectiveness in preventing diversion of prescribed controlled substances. Recommendations will also cover site-of-use and in-home controlled substances. The report to Congress will include recommendations on federal oversight of controlled substance disposal products and packaging technologies, evaluating their efficacy and potential Federal Government role in oversight. The House of Representatives passed the bill on June 19, 2018. Karen L. Haas attested to it as the Clerk."
