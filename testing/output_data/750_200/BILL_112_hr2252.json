The Congress finds that police are not legally liable for failing to protect individual citizens, as courts have ruled that their obligation is to protect the public in general. Former Florida Attorney General Jim Smith highlighted that police only responded to a fraction of calls for help in Dade County, while the Department of Justice reported a significant number of violent crimes where police failed to respond promptly. In 1989, there were 168,881 crimes of violence with delayed police response. Over 2,400,000 people in the US use firearms for self-defense annually, showing a higher rate of protection than harm. Over 2,400,000 people in the US use firearms for self-defense annually. 192,000 cases involve women defending against sexual abuse. 92 percent of self-defense incidents involve only brandishing or warning shots, with less than 8 percent resulting in injury or death to the attacker. Law-abiding citizens are often prosecuted for using firearms in self-defense. In 2001, two brothers in Maryland were involved in a fatal shooting while protecting their lives and livelihood. The grand jury decided not to press criminal charges. The brothers, after encountering burglaries at their concrete business, armed themselves and stayed overnight in their warehouse. When the burglars returned, the brothers shot and killed one burglar and injured two others. The injured men were charged with burglary, along with two others connected to previous burglaries at the warehouse. In a previous month, burglaries occurred at the brother's warehouse, causing concern as a gun was stolen. In 2008, a store clerk in Waukegan, Illinois, shot and injured a robber, potentially facing criminal charges for not having a firearm owner's identification card. In September 2009, a Lithonia homeowner from Dekalb County, Georgia, was charged with aggravated assault for shooting someone trying to break into his home. The individual did not have a firearm owner's identification card and would face a State firearms violation. Illinois law prohibits employees from carrying guns in a place of business unless they are the owner or have proprietary interest. In January 2004, a homeowner in Wilmette, Illinois, was charged and convicted for owning handguns in violation of the village handgun ban. A homeowner in Wilmette, Illinois was charged and convicted for owning 2 handguns and violating the village handgun ban ordinance. He faced a potential $750 fine for not renewing his firearm owner's identification card after shooting a home intruder.

The homeowner in Wilmette, Illinois confronted an intruder who entered the house twice. The homeowner shot the intruder, who then stole the family's car to go to the hospital. The intruder was charged with residential burglary and possession of a stolen vehicle. The courts have granted immunity to police officers using firearms in duty. Law-abiding citizens using firearms for self-defense should not face lawsuits from violent felons. The right to obtain firearms for security and use them in defense of self, family, or home is protected by law. The right to obtain firearms for security and use them in defense of self, family, or home is reaffirmed for individuals not prohibited by law. This includes using firearms in defense against imminent serious bodily harm, during a violent felony, or in defense of one's home during the commission of a felony by another person. The right to use firearms for self-defense, including in defense of one's home during a felony, is protected. The term \"firearm\" includes shotguns, rifles, and handguns. Individuals whose rights are violated can take legal action against the United States or any State. Individuals whose rights are violated can take legal action in any United States district court against the United States, any State, or any person for damages, injunctive relief, and attorney's fees. The action must be brought within 5 years of discovering the violation."
