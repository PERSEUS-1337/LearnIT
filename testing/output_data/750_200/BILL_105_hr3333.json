    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Nuclear Non-Proliferation Policy Act of 1998\". The Congress finds that the proliferation of nuclear weapons is a major threat to national security since the end of the Cold War and breakup of the Soviet Union. The United Nations also recognizes the proliferation of all weapons of mass destruction as a threat to international peace. The United Nations recognizes the threat of nuclear weapons proliferation and has committed to preventing it. The establishment of the United Nations Special Commission on Iraq set an important precedent. Several nations besides the declared nuclear weapon states are pursuing nuclear capabilities, leading to regional nuclear arms races that increase the risk of nuclear weapon use. Conditions at nuclear weapons complexes are deteriorating. Regional nuclear arms races are a significant concern for the future use of nuclear weapons. Deteriorating conditions at Russian nuclear sites have raised worries about tracking and securing nuclear materials, increasing the risk of proliferation. Belarus and Kazakhstan signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1993. Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in the 1990s. Iraq had a secret nuclear weapons program aided by dual-use exports. North Korea and the United States exchanged nuclear agreements in October 1994. In October 1994, North Korea and the United States signed an agreement to exchange nuclear technology. Brazil, Argentina, and South Africa had nuclear weapons programs. Brazil, Argentina, and South Africa had nuclear weapons programs, but all three countries have renounced nuclear weapons, accepted IAEA safeguards, and acceded to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The United States' security interests align with the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty. The United States supports various nuclear weapons free zones, including the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty and the African Nuclear Weapons Free Zone Treaty. The IAEA plays a crucial role in countering proliferation and strengthening its safeguard system. The United States supports immobilizing plutonium for energy and mixing it with low-enriched uranium for commercial nuclear reactors. Plutonium from dismantled warheads poses storage and disposal challenges and could be used for nuclear weapons if obtained by unauthorized parties. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty aims to prevent further nuclear proliferation and has been extended indefinitely. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978 reaffirmed the US commitment to the treaty and called for strengthening the international nonproliferation regime. The United States aims to strengthen controls over nuclear equipment transfer and prevent the spread of nuclear weapons worldwide through a comprehensive nonproliferation policy. The United States aims to strengthen controls over nuclear equipment transfer and prevent the spread of nuclear weapons worldwide through a comprehensive nonproliferation policy, outlined in SEC. 3. The United States aims to reduce nuclear proliferation by pursuing objectives such as placing fissile materials under international controls, ratifying the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, and ending the production of new nuclear warheads through agreements with Russia. Pakistan is set to sign a treaty to reduce nuclear proliferation. The United States aims to end the production of new nuclear warheads through agreements with Russia and other countries, with a goal of reducing strategic nuclear arsenals to 2,000 to 2,500 warheads each. Additional enforceable multilateral agreements are also sought to reduce nuclear arsenals globally. The United States aims to reduce nuclear arsenals through multilateral agreements, including halting the production of weapons-usable fissile materials and placing existing stockpiles under international controls by January 1, 2008. The United States aims to reduce nuclear arsenals through multilateral agreements, including halting production of weapons-usable fissile materials and placing existing stockpiles under international controls by January 1, 2008. Strengthen IAEA safeguards to verify compliance with nonproliferation commitments and enhance nuclear export controls in the US and other supplier nations. The United States and other nuclear supplier nations impose sanctions on entities contributing to nuclear proliferation, increase transparency on nuclear export licenses, and ratify the IAEA's Strengthened Safeguards System program. They also aim to reduce incentives for countries to acquire nuclear weapons by reducing regional tensions, strengthening security agreements, and urging the UN Security Council to enforce nonproliferation agreements. The curr_chunk encourages the UN Security Council to play a larger role in enforcing nuclear nonproliferation agreements. It suggests forming agreements with other nuclear weapon states for a \"no first use\" policy and immediate assistance to NPT parties under nuclear attack. Additionally, it proposes a verifiable bilateral agreement with Russia to dismantle all tactical nuclear weapons. The curr_chunk calls for ratifying nuclear-free zone treaties, monitoring North Korea's nuclear activities, and starting negotiations on START III. The curr_chunk emphasizes the need to prevent North Korea from restarting its weapons program and to initiate formal negotiations on START III between the United States and the Russian Federation. SEC. 4. REQUIREMENTS FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF POLICY. The President must report to Congress annually on actions taken to implement policy objectives, including those of the Russian Federation and other countries, and obstacles encountered. The President must report annually to Congress on actions taken to implement policy objectives, including those of other countries and institutions, and obstacles encountered. Each report should be unclassified, with a classified appendix if needed. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"fissile materials\" refer to highly enriched uranium and plutonium, \"highly enriched uranium\" is uranium enriched to 20% or more in U-235, \"IAEA\" stands for the International Atomic Energy Agency, \"IAEA safeguards\" are safeguards in an agreement with the IAEA, and \"no first use\" policy means not being the first to use nuclear weapons in a conflict. (5) \"no first use\" policy means not being the first to use nuclear weapons in a conflict;\n(6) \"non-nuclear weapon state\" refers to any country without nuclear weapons;\n(7) \"Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty\" is the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons signed in 1968;\n(8) \"nuclear weapon state\" is a country defined as a nuclear-weapon state by the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. The terms \"START I treaty,\" \"START II treaty,\" and \"START III treaty\" refer to specific treaties signed by the United States and other countries regarding the reduction and limitations of strategic offensive arms. The \"START III treaty\" refers to the Treaty on Further Reductions and Limitations of Strategic Offensive Arms, discussed between President Clinton and President Yeltsin in March 1997."
