    "content": "Most civilian federal employees are covered by either the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) or the Federal Employees' Retirement System (FERS). CSRS covers employees hired before 1984, while FERS covers those hired in 1984 or later. CSRS enrollees do not pay Social Security taxes or earn benefits, while FERS enrollees do. Both systems allow contributions to the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), but only FERS enrollees receive employer matching contributions. ERISA does not apply to CSRS and FERS, which are governmental retirement plans. ERISA protects spouses and former spouses of private-sector plan participants, requiring a joint and survivor annuity as the default benefit. In a defined benefit pension plan, a joint and survivor annuity with a 50% survivor benefit is required. A retirement plan must comply with a qualified domestic relations order (QDRO) to divide benefits in a divorce. Written consent of both spouses is needed for a married participant in a defined contribution plan to name a beneficiary other than their spouse. The default form of annuity in a defined contribution plan must be a joint and survivor annuity. Retirement benefits for federal employees under Title 5 of the United States Code require a joint and survivor annuity, similar to ERISA for private-sector plans. Written consent of the participant and spouse is necessary to waive the survivor annuity. Under ERISA and Title 5, written consent of the participant and spouse is required to waive the survivor annuity. ERISA allows pension payments to a former spouse to begin when the plan participant reaches retirement age, while Title 5 prohibits this until retirement. The participant must retire before any part of a CSRS or FERS annuity can be paid to a former spouse. ERISA requires written consent from a spouse to designate beneficiaries in defined contribution plans. ERISA requires written consent from a spouse to designate beneficiaries in defined contribution plans, while federal regulations allow participants in the Thrift Savings Plan to name anyone as the plan beneficiary without spousal consent. State court decrees can award former spouses of federal employees a share of retirement annuities. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) will pay only the benefits specified in a court order regarding a federal employee's retirement annuity. State court decrees can award former spouses of federal employees a share of retirement annuities, with specific requirements outlined in Title 5. OPM will divide a retired employee's monthly annuity as directed by a court order related to divorce, annulment, or legal separation. Payments will only be divided after OPM receives the court order and the employee has separated from federal service and applied for an annuity. Former spouses can receive a share of the retirement annuity once the employee is eligible. The right of a former spouse to receive a share of a retired federal employee's retirement annuity terminates when the retired employee dies. To receive a survivor annuity, the retiree must have elected it for the former spouse or a court order must specify it. A former spouse may receive a CSRS survivor annuity if the employee elected it or if a court decree requires it. A CSRS survivor annuity is 55% of the retired worker's single-life annuity. The retired worker's annual pension is reduced to fund the joint and survivor annuity. The spouse or former spouse is entitled to a survivor annuity equal to 55% of the worker's full annuity. The total CSRS survivor annuities paid to spouses and former spouses cannot exceed 55% of the single-life annuity. The sum of CSRS survivor annuities paid to the employee's spouse and former spouses cannot exceed 55% of the single-life annuity. If a survivor annuity has been awarded to a former spouse, the current spouse is not entitled unless the former spouse has died or remarried before age 55. A survivor annuity paid to a former spouse terminates upon their death or remarriage before age 55, with an exception for remarriage prior to age 55. The survivor annuity paid to a former spouse terminates upon their death or remarriage before age 55, with an exception for remarriage prior to age 55 if the marriage lasted at least 30 years. An employee's election or court order for a survivor annuity can only be modified before retirement or death. The survivor annuity for a former spouse can only be modified before the employee retires or dies. A court order for a survivor annuity will not be honored if the former spouse waived their right. Refunding retirement contributions forfeits the right to a CSRS annuity. State courts can block refunds if a former spouse is awarded a share of the annuity. FERS is generally exempt from state court proceedings, but a FERS annuity can be affected by court orders. Section 8470 of Title 5 exempts FERS from state court proceedings, but Section 8467 allows division of a FERS retirement annuity between a federal annuitant and former spouse based on a court decree of divorce, annulment, or legal separation. OPM will divide the annuity as directed by the court order, with payments to the former spouse only after OPM receives the order. Division of a federal employee's retirement annuity will occur after separation from federal service and eligibility. OPM will not divide a federal employee's retirement annuity until they have separated from federal service, are eligible for an annuity, and have applied for it. A former spouse's right to receive a share of the annuity ends upon the retiree's death. To receive a survivor annuity, the retiree must have elected it for the former spouse or a court order must specify it. Federal employees can elect a FERS survivor annuity for a former spouse under Section 8445 of Title 5. A federal employee can elect a FERS survivor annuity for a former spouse under Section 8445 of Title 5. The survivor annuity is equal to 50% of the worker's full annuity before a reduction is taken into account. This reduction funds the joint and survivor annuity, which reduces the retiree's single-life annuity amount by 10%. The survivor annuity for a worker's spouse or former spouse is 50% of the worker's full annuity before any reduction. The total amount of FERS survivor annuities for a spouse and former spouses cannot exceed 50% of the single-life annuity. If a former spouse has been awarded the full survivor annuity, the current spouse is not entitled to it unless the former spouse dies or remarries before age 55. The survivor annuity for a former spouse terminates if they remarry before age 55, unless the marriage lasted at least 30 years. If the remarriage ends, the annuity restarts. If a former spouse remarries before age 55, the survivor annuity terminates unless the marriage lasted at least 30 years. In case of death, divorce, or annulment, the annuity restarts in the same amount. A court order for a survivor annuity to a former spouse can be modified before the employee retires or dies. OPM will not honor a court order if the former spouse waived their right to a survivor annuity. If an employee in FERS dies after 18 months but less than 10 years of service, the spouse is eligible for a lump-sum survivor benefit. If an employee dies after completing at least 10 years of service, the surviving spouse receives a lump sum and an annuity equal to 50% of the annuity earned at the time of death. The lump-sum survivor benefit may be paid to a former spouse or divided between a current and former spouse as per a court order. A separating employee forfeits the right to receive a FERS annuity if they elect to receive a refund of contributions to the retirement system. A state court can block this refund if a former spouse has been awarded a share of the employee's FERS retirement annuity. An employee can designate beneficiaries for their TSP account balance by filing Form TSP-3 with the Thrift Board. Wills or estate planning documents are not recognized by the Thrift Board. A married participant can designate beneficiaries for their TSP account by filing Form TSP-3 with the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board. Spouse's consent is not required for beneficiary designation. Written consent is needed from a spouse for certain actions like taking a loan or withdrawing money from the TSP account. For CSRS participants, spouse notification is required but written consent is not. The TSP requires written consent from a spouse for certain actions like taking a loan or withdrawing money after leaving federal employment. Spouses of FERS participants are entitled to a joint and survivor annuity with 50% survivor benefit, but must waive this right in writing before the participant can withdraw funds. State court orders of divorce, annulment, or legal separation are recognized by the TSP for property settlements. The TSP recognizes state court orders for property settlements in cases of divorce, annulment, or legal separation. Federal employees in FERS can participate in Social Security, and former spouses may be eligible for benefits if certain conditions are met. If a former spouse remarries, they may lose eligibility for benefits unless the subsequent marriage ends. If a former spouse of a worker insured by Social Security remarries, they generally cannot collect benefits on the worker's record unless the subsequent marriage ends by death, divorce, or annulment. However, the divorced spouse can receive widow or widower benefits if the marriage lasted at least 10 years. Survivor benefits end if the divorced spouse remarries before age 60, unless the later marriage ends. Remarriage does not affect Social Security survivor benefits for the deceased worker's children."
