In August 2013, Islamist-led mobs burned and destroyed Christian properties in Egypt after the government led by the Muslim Brotherhood was removed. The succeeding government, under President Sisi, ordered the army to rebuild the damaged churches at government expense. President Sisi ordered the Egyptian armed forces to swiftly repair all affected churches in recognition of the historical role played by Coptic Christians during the 2013 sectarian violence. He made an appearance at a Coptic Christmas liturgy in January 2015 and promised to renovate the churches that were burned in 2016. The Egyptian military and private citizens have restored a total of 49 out of 78 churches and Christian buildings damaged during the August 2013 sectarian violence. President Sisi promised to fix all affected buildings by next year and expressed gratitude for the support from the Pope and the Coptic community. In August 2013, sectarian violence in Egypt led to damage to 78 churches and Christian buildings. Private citizens have restored 23 buildings, leaving 29 still in need of restoration as of September 6, 2016. A new law in August 2016 imposed restrictions on church construction, often leading to violence against Christians. In El-`Our, Minya, protests erupted in March 2015 over the building of a new church. In El-`Our, Minya, violence erupted as villagers protested the construction of a new church honoring Egyptian Christians beheaded by Da'esh militants in Libya. Protestors armed with Molotov cocktails besieged the existing village church, setting it on fire. Protestors armed with Molotov cocktails attacked a church and a Christian-owned vehicle in El-`Our, Minya. Egyptian government officials use informal reconciliation sessions to address sectarian violence, but outcomes are often unfavorable to religious minorities. The Coptic Christians in Egypt, who have been indigenous for over 2,000 years, face unfavorable outcomes in reconciliation sessions that hinder their access to the judicial system. The Coptic Church is the largest Christian community in the Middle East, and US diplomatic leadership plays a significant role in protecting religious minorities globally. The International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 emphasizes the importance of condemning violations of religious freedom and promoting this fundamental right globally. Religious freedom is crucial for democracy, individual liberty, and stability. The United States prioritizes promoting democracy for individual liberty and stability in its engagement with other countries.
