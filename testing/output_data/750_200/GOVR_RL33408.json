    "content": "The process for the President to direct the use of nuclear weapons is called Nuclear Command and Control (NC2). NC2 involves the President exercising authority over nuclear weapon operations of military forces, government activities supporting those operations, and multinational actions. The infrastructure supporting this authority is the Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS). The Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS) is the infrastructure that supports the President and his Unified Command Commanders in exercising authority over nuclear weapon operations. It includes facilities, equipment, communications, procedures, and personnel integrated for planning, directing, and controlling these operations to provide the President with all capabilities required. The Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS) supports the President's authority over nuclear weapons operations and is part of Continuity of Government activities. Congress reviews Department of Defense's plans to sustain and modernize the NCCS, including findings from past nuclear posture reviews. Increased momentum is seen in implementing the 2001 Nuclear Posture Review findings. The Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS) supports the President's authority over nuclear weapons operations. Congress may revisit the structure of the NCCS in light of potential nuclear challenges from China, North Korea, or Iran. The NCCS may need a different structure due to potential nuclear challenges from China, North Korea, or Iran. The addition of non-nuclear responses and active defenses could lead to complex requirements. Legacy systems supported by other user agencies may need to be retired as recommended in the 2006 QDR. Despite its strategic and budgetary implications, the NCCS is often not well understood or given much attention. The NCCS, despite its strategic and budgetary implications, is often not well understood or given much attention. This report will describe NCCS platforms and functions, discuss its current role in light of the 2001 NPR and 2006 QDR, examine issues related to its role, and review proposed modernization initiatives. The NMCS, the priority component of the Global Command and Control System, supports the Secretary of Defense and Joint Chiefs of Staff. The National Military Command System (NMCS) is the priority component of the Global Command and Control System, providing command and control of the armed forces to the National Command Authorities (NCA) and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS). It includes command nodes such as the National Military Command Center (NMCC). The National Military Command System (NMCS) includes the National Military Command Center (NMCC) as the primary location for national command and control. The NMCC is responsible for monitoring nuclear forces and ongoing military operations, led by a General or Admiral. Additionally, the National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC) can serve as a backup if ground-based command centers are destroyed. The National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC) serves as a survivable airborne backup to the NMCC's command and control capabilities. It consists of modified Boeing 747-200B aircraft based at Offutt AFB in Nebraska, with hardened communications against Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP). The NAOC can include a crew of up to 114 people and has both Extremely High Frequency (EHF) and Very Low Frequency-Low Frequency (VLF/LF) links. The National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC) and other facilities like Site-R and USSTRATCOM Global Operations Center (GOC) are hardened against Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) and serve as backup locations for essential emergency actions. USSTRATCOM provides personnel and day-to-day administration, while the Air Force's Air Combat Command serves as the program's resource manager. The USSTRATCOM Global Operations Center (GOC) at Offutt AFB, Nebraska serves as a backup to the NMCS for emergency actions and as the command center for the USSTRATCOM Commander. It is protected against EMP, has its own emergency power supply, and is staffed 24/7 by teams led by a Senior Controller. The USSTRATCOM Airborne Command Post (ABNCP) is a fleet of modified Boeing 707 aircraft with a crew of 22, including aircrew, communications operators, and battlestaff personnel. Each ABNCP is led by a General or Admiral, known as the Airborne Emergency Action Officer (AEAO). The aircraft serves as a survivable airborne backup for the USSTRATCOM GOC and has the ability to communicate launch codes directly to ICBM launch facilities as the Airborne Launch Control System (ALCS). The E-6B aircraft, also known as the Airborne Command Post (ABNCP), fulfills key missions as the Airborne Launch Control System (ALCS) and the Take Charge And Move Out (TACAMO) relay for Navy ballistic missile submarines. It can communicate launch codes to ICBM launch facilities and directives to submarines using various communication systems. The ABNCP communicates using UHF or EHF satellite systems. USSTRATCOM provides battlestaff personnel, while Navy's STRATCOMM Wing One provides aircraft and communications operators. The MCCC is a convoy of trucks serving as a backup to USSTRATCOM GOC or ABNCP. The President has the sole authority to direct the use of nuclear weapons. The NCCS has evolved to meet the President's requirements. The Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS) serves the President's requirements for advice and decision making for strategic nuclear forces. One of its major functions is situation monitoring, which involves monitoring strategic intelligence for indicators of upcoming events or threats. The NCCS centers include an intelligence cell linked to classified national intelligence systems for anticipating crises. Situation monitoring involves tracking indicators like weather and potential attacks, with a focus on quickly verifying missile launches. The NCCS process involves quickly verifying missile launches and determining the origin, size, and potential targets of an attack using dual phenomenology. Decision making regarding nuclear weapons deployment involves consultation with senior commanders. The President consults with senior commanders and advisors to make decisions on employing nuclear weapons. The system must provide connectivity for continuous updates to ensure the best information for decision-making. Data on the readiness of nuclear deterrent forces is crucial for decision makers in both daily operations and crisis situations. Force management is essential for decision-making regarding the readiness of nuclear deterrent forces. This process collects and presents crucial information on forces available, locations, and maintenance/supply status in easily understandable formats for key leadership. Force direction involves nuclear surety to prevent unauthorized use of nuclear weapons and positive control for command and control. Nuclear surety involves controls to prevent unauthorized use of nuclear weapons, while positive control ensures instructions to launch reach forces and are carried out. Force direction includes employing and ending hostilities. National Military Command System Connectivity is crucial for achieving these goals in the nuclear employment environment. The National Military Command System (NCCS) must be survivable and reliable to support connectivity between decision makers and forces during critical events. Survivability can be achieved through hardening, mobility, redundancy, or concealment. It should work properly without generating false alarms. The NCCS must be reliable, secure, and resistant to potential adversaries with asymmetric capabilities like computer attacks. Security ensures authorized access and authentic communications, protecting against jamming, interference, and hostile listening. The Nuclear Command and Control System (NCCS) must be secure to prevent hostile interception of communications, especially as potential adversaries use asymmetric capabilities like computer attacks. The 2001 Nuclear Posture Review highlighted the importance of nuclear command and control in deterrence. Congress mandated the review to include the role of nuclear forces in US military strategy, policy requirements for a credible deterrence posture, and the relationship among US nuclear forces. The curr_chunk discusses the policy requirements and objectives for the United States to maintain a safe, reliable, and credible nuclear deterrence posture, including the relationship among nuclear deterrence policy, targeting strategy, and arms control objectives. It also covers the levels and composition of nuclear delivery systems, the nuclear weapons complex, and the active and inactive nuclear weapons stockpile needed for implementing the US national and military strategy. The curr_chunk discusses the need for modernizing the nuclear weapons complex and stockpile to align with US national and military strategy. Assistant Secretary Crouch highlighted changes in the global environment post-Cold War as a driving factor for the Nuclear Posture Review. The NPR was driven by changes in the global environment post-Cold War, aiming to reduce dependence on offensive nuclear forces for deterrence and address emerging threats from WMD proliferation and ballistic missiles. A \"capabilities based approach\" was deemed necessary to counter these unpredictable threats. The NPR aimed to address emerging threats from WMD proliferation and ballistic missiles by adopting a \"capabilities based approach\" to provide a wider range of options for the President. This approach led to the creation of a \"new triad\" of capabilities, including nuclear and non-nuclear offensive forces, as well as active and passive defensive forces. The new triad in the NPR includes offensive forces, passive defensive forces, and a responsive weapons infrastructure. Command, control, intelligence, and planning are central to the triad, aiming to enhance precision, adaptability, and deterrence against emerging threats. The NPR emphasizes the need for improved command and control capabilities to enhance precision, adaptability, and deterrence against emerging threats. This includes integrating nuclear and non-nuclear forces for quicker response and increased flexibility in changing situations. The NPR outlines new systems initiatives, with USSTRATCOM taking on additional missions such as global strike, space operations, missile defense, and information operations. USSTRATCOM's functions expanded to include global strike, space operations, missile defense, information operations, and C4ISR. In January 2005, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld designated USSTRATCOM as the focal point for combating weapons of mass destruction. General Cartwright established a Center for Combating Weapons of Mass Destruction in September 2005. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency was tasked with executing functions related to deterring the use of weapons of mass destruction and crisis action planning. The 2001 NPR influenced USSTRATCOM's expanded mission portfolio, which now includes global strike, space operations, missile defense, information operations, and C4ISR. The Joint Staff was updating its \"Doctrine for Joint Nuclear Operations\" in 2005 to incorporate NPR thinking into doctrinal guidance for military commanders. The Joint Staff was updating its \"Doctrine for Joint Nuclear Operations\" in 2005 to incorporate NPR thinking into doctrinal guidance for military commanders, emphasizing rapid crisis action planning to respond to unanticipated WMD threats. This concept is a carry-over from the 2001 NPR. The 2001 NPR emphasized rapid crisis action planning for responding to imminent crises, particularly in the development and dissemination of nuclear plans. This requires enhanced computer workstation capabilities at nuclear command centers and increased communication capacity to integrate these plans with other military operations. The need for enhanced communication capacity and networked collaborative planning systems in nuclear command centers is increasing. Senior leaders are expecting bandwidth-hungry video-teleconferencing links for long-distance deliberations and analysis. The Secretary of Defense appointed a 12-member commission to review the implementation of the 2001 NPR, focusing on programmatic requirements and NC2 needs. The commission must submit its report to Congress by June. The 12-member commission appointed by the Secretary of Defense is reviewing the implementation of the 2001 NPR, focusing on programmatic requirements and NC2 needs. The commission is required to submit its report to Congress by June 30, 2007. The NPR suggests using precision non-nuclear or \"non-kinetic\" weapons to fulfill missions previously allocated to nuclear weapons, potentially allowing for a smaller arsenal. However, the policy for the role and uses of nuclear weapons is not addressed, and the presence of these weapons in the U.S. arsenal is likely to continue. An overarching approach to nuclear weapons policy will shape the required command and control architecture, with considerations for the degree of robustness, redundancy, and survivability needed. Today's nuclear command and control systems were primarily developed during the Cold War era. The presence of nuclear weapons in the U.S. arsenal is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. During the Cold War, nuclear command and control systems were established to manage a potential nuclear confrontation with the Soviet Union. Key installations like the NORAD-Cheyenne Mountain Complex, E-4 National Airborne Operations Center, and USSTRATCOM underground command post were developed in the 1960s to late 1980s. Despite minimal changes post-Cold War, the Defense Department is now evaluating the necessity of this infrastructure amidst resource constraints. The Defense Department is reevaluating the Cold War-era nuclear command and control systems in light of resource constraints. The post-Cold War environment may require new programs to address evolving threats to the NC2 infrastructure, such as the potential for a \"decapitation attack\" targeting national and military leadership. During the Cold War, there was a concern over a \"decapitation attack\" targeting national and military leadership to disrupt the lines of authority needed for a retaliation. The focus was on maintaining political control during a conflict's escalation or termination by ensuring the nuclear command and control system could function through an attack. During the Cold War, the nuclear command and control system was designed to function through an attack to ensure government control of weapons. Upgrades in the 1980s increased redundancy and survivability of communication links. The current threat of a nuclear strike from Russia is diminished, with the U.S. considering the relationship non-adversarial after the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty in 2002. The Offensive Reductions Treaty, signed in 2002 by Presidents Bush and Putin, aimed to reduce deployed nuclear weapons to 1,700-2,200 levels. Despite the Cold War's end, analysts believe the U.S. could still face various future challenges, including potential nuclear threats. The necessity of a costly command and control system designed for a major nuclear exchange is being questioned in the current strategic and fiscally constrained environment. Despite the demise of the Soviet Union, analysts warn of potential nuclear threats from China. DOD estimates show Chinese military expenditures could triple by 2025, with advanced systems like the mobile DF-31A ICBM capable of targeting the United States. General Zhu Chenghu of China's National Defense University has threatened nuclear attacks on U.S. cities. General Zhu Chenghu of China's National Defense University threatened nuclear attacks on U.S. cities if the U.S. aids Taiwan against China. Analysts debate China's intentions in the Pacific Rim, with some suggesting China is seeking preeminence while others argue the threat is overstated. Kurt Campbell from the Center for Strategic and International Studies highlights the complex relationship with China. Kurt Campbell from the Center for Strategic and International Studies suggests that the relationship with China is not a clear confrontation like the Cold War. Cooperation characterizes the U.S. and European relationships with China, and the idea of a \"China threat\" may be exaggerated to justify the development of major weapons systems. The end of the Cold War era has led to warnings about potential threats from countries like China, Iran, and North Korea, which could justify the development of major weapons systems. Analysts are concerned about the increasing Chinese nuclear capability and the potential threats posed by rogue states pursuing nuclear weapons. North Korea, in particular, has been actively seeking nuclear weapons. North Korea has been pursuing nuclear weapons since the 1960s, with help from A.Q. Khan in the 1990s. In 2005, they publicly announced having nuclear weapons, but it is difficult to verify without a nuclear test. Robert Norris and Hans Kristensen estimate the amount of bomb-grade fissile material diverted from North Korean reactors. North Korea possibly has ten nuclear bombs, with various missile capabilities including SCUD, NoDong, and TaepoDong missiles. It is unclear if they can mate nuclear weapons to these delivery systems due to lack of reliable information. Post-Iraq criticisms of U.S. intelligence assessments have raised doubts. The Iranian nuclear program also poses dilemmas for threat analysts as the current administration asserts Iran is pursuing nuclear weapons, with projections suggesting they are roughly ten years away from having atomic bomb capability. Some analysts believe North Korean claims of possessing nuclear weapons may be deception efforts to bluff the United States. Iran is believed to be pursuing nuclear weapons, with some predictions suggesting they could have the capability within two years. However, Iran's nuclear fuel cycle research is permitted under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The secrecy surrounding Iran's activities at nuclear sites has raised concerns. Iran's secrecy and concealment at nuclear sites have raised suspicions about its nuclear activities. Recent testing of long-range missiles and alleged plans for a nuclear weapon have further fueled concerns. Reports suggest a link between Iran's military study of high explosives and its civilian nuclear program, raising fears of nuclear weapon development. Iran's aggressive rhetoric adds to the growing apprehension. Iran's military study of high explosives, essential for nuclear weapons, is linked to the civilian nuclear program. Iran's aggressive rhetoric about destroying Israel and the US heightens concerns. Small nuclear arsenals could pose a threat to US infrastructure through an electromagnetic pulse from a high-altitude nuclear explosion. An electromagnetic pulse (EMP) can cause voltage surges in power lines and communication cables, damaging electronic components and leading to failures in critical infrastructure. This could result in cascading failures similar to those seen after Hurricane Katrina, potentially causing the deaths of thousands or even millions of people. Congress chartered a Commission to Assess the impact of such a catastrophe. Hurricane Katrina hit the Louisiana coast, leading to potential catastrophic deaths. The EMP Commission was chartered by Congress to analyze the EMP threat, with concerns raised about China using EMP attacks on critical infrastructure. William Graham highlighted Chinese military interest in EMP attacks. Experts suggest that North Korea and Iran may be preparing for an EMP attack, with recent missile tests potentially indicating this strategy. There is also emerging technology that could generate localized EMP bursts without the need for a nuclear weapon. Some analysts believe that military and commercial systems may withstand an EMP burst with few adverse effects, as key infrastructure would continue to function. Military systems have EMP protection, and commercial systems can easily add it. The threat from a single weapon attack off the U.S. coast may not cause catastrophic failures. Some analysts believe that military and commercial systems can withstand an EMP burst with minimal adverse effects. The threat from a single weapon attack off the U.S. coast may not lead to catastrophic failures. China's motivation to use EMP against the U.S. is unclear due to potential retaliatory consequences, but using it against U.S. forces aiding Taiwan is more conceivable. Some analysts suggest that North Korea's long-range ballistic missile program has stalled due to reluctance from Russia and China to share advanced technologies. Rogue states may find it extremely difficult to acquire EMP capabilities. The EMP Commission found a decline in EMP hardening and procedures in the military since the 1990s. Congress directed the reestablishment of the EMP Commission to assess the vulnerability of military systems and progress on protection. The EMP Commission was reestablished with a deadline to deliver a report by June 30, 2007, focusing on the vulnerability of military systems to EMP. The threat of EMP supports the need for capabilities to operate in such an environment, especially in the nuclear command and control infrastructure. The challenges faced include integrating nuclear offensive forces and addressing systematic and technical issues. The challenges for the nuclear command and control system include integrating nuclear offensive forces, non-nuclear offensive forces, and defensive forces. The system may need to be improved to expand its reach and include additional participants in decision making. Implementation of NPR recommendations could drive a demand for additional capacity. The NPR recommendations may lead to increased demand for capacity and speed in missile defense response. Further development is needed for directing non-nuclear strikes, including conventional attacks and non-kinetic options like information operations and electronic warfare. The NPR recommendations suggest the need for capacity and speed in missile defense response, as well as development for non-nuclear strikes including precision weapons, conventional ballistic missiles, and non-kinetic options like information operations and electronic warfare. The question arises about who should have the authority to direct these non-nuclear or non-kinetic options, in addition to nuclear weapons, with the President currently holding that responsibility. The President has the authority to determine his level of involvement in military operations, with past Presidents typically not getting involved in planning specific missions. However, there are exceptions where strategic targets may warrant Presidential involvement. The President's involvement in military operations is typically limited, but strategic targets of high importance may require Presidential participation. Requiring Presidential authorization for certain strikes, especially those involving nuclear weapons, poses operational challenges. Mixing conventional and nuclear weapons further complicates the process. The process of linking codes to prevent unauthorized use of conventional weapons becomes complex when mixed with nuclear weapons on the same platform. Ensuring only conventional weapons are launched when ordered is crucial. Non-kinetic strikes like cyber-attacks could pose serious challenges by targeting strategically important assets. Cyber-attacks could pose serious challenges by targeting strategically important assets, potentially equivalent to a WMD strike. Concerns have been raised about the need for detailed Presidential involvement and control in response to these attacks. Technical solutions for enforcing control have not been discussed, adding complexity to the issue. Adding non-nuclear and non-kinetic responses to conventional weapons control will involve additional participants in the command and control process, potentially leading to delays in decision-making and implementation. Approval processes may need to be revised to prevent critical targets from being missed due to extended cycle times. The merging of active defenses, like missile defenses, into the NC2 architecture will require further adaptation. Decisions on release authority and locations to defend may need to be made, potentially involving Presidential involvement due to limited defensive capabilities and fleeting response opportunities. Some analysts suggest delegating missile defense release authority to the unified combatant commander to avoid missing opportunities to stop incoming missiles. Presidential involvement may be necessary for decisions on defensive launches or offensive strikes as part of the national response. The national response to a potential attack may involve considering tradeoffs between offensive and defensive actions, requiring Presidential involvement. Choreographing conversations for decision-making in limited time frames is crucial. A successful defensive response could impact offensive options, while a strong attack may necessitate an early offensive response for damage control. Consideration of defensive responses post-detection of an attack is important. As the decision-making process post-detection of a potential attack involves considering defensive responses, regional combatant commanders will play a key role in coordinating defense efforts. USSTRATCOM leads missile defense, but coordination with regional commands like USCENTCOM and USNORTHCOM is essential for effective theater missile defense. General Cartwright, the USSTRATCOM commander, has directed personnel to ensure interoperability of missile defense command and control systems with common technical standards. Adding participants to decision conferences for missile defense will increase bandwidth demands on networks. The ultimate customer of any command and control system involving \"non-nuclear\" operations will be regional combatant commands like USCENTCOM and USNORTHCOM. Bandwidth demands on networks will increase further for command and control systems. The system must present choices for Presidential decision in an easily understandable manner, facilitate interaction with advisers, and aid in decision-making within tight time constraints. The Commander-in-Chief's ability to interact smoothly with advisers aids in decision-making within tight time constraints, maintaining tight Presidential control of nuclear weapons. Nuclear command and control systems may also support other military and government functions, enhancing their value. Nuclear command and control systems have value beyond military functions, serving multiple missions in non-nuclear roles. These platforms offer tight security, robust decision-making, and communication capabilities, making them versatile national assets. For example, the National Military Command Center (NMCC) provides 24-hour monitoring of worldwide military operations, aiding in crises, conflicts, and peacetime contingencies like natural disasters. The NMCC aids in managing worldwide military operations, crises, conflicts, and peacetime contingencies like natural disasters. A response cell or crisis action team may be formed from members of various agencies to prepare orders and respond to developing situations. Command and control assets also supported mitigation and recovery activities after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and NMCC played key roles in coordinating air traffic restoration after the 9/11 attacks. These assets are crucial for continuity of operations during domestic contingencies or natural disasters. President Bush utilized USSTRATCOM in Omaha, Nebraska as a secure facility to receive updates and communicate with his national security staff on September 11, 2001. President Bush utilized USSTRATCOM in Omaha, Nebraska to receive updates and communicate with his national security staff. He also used command and control assets at U.S. Northern Command to monitor the government response to Hurricane Rita in September 2005. Nuclear command and control assets can support civil authorities for consequence mitigation after disasters. FEMA and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have signed a memorandum of agreement for National Airborne Operations. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have signed a memorandum of agreement to make the National Airborne Operations Center (NAOC) available for FEMA support during disasters and emergencies. The NAOC, a modified Boeing 747-200 command and control aircraft, offers versatile situation monitoring, communications, and tele-conferencing capabilities valued by senior government leadership for day-to-day support. The NMCC is co-located in the Pentagon for easy access by the Secretary of Defense and other DOD leadership. The NAOC, a modified Boeing 747-200 command and control aircraft, provides versatile situation monitoring, communications, and tele-conferencing capabilities. Secretary Rumsfeld relies on the NAOC for support during official travel. Using NC2 assets for missions beyond nuclear forces requires balancing tradeoffs and could lead to competition for access during crises. Tying these systems to other agency functions, like FEMA, adds complexity. The military may face challenges in sustaining systems that are no longer needed, as they are tied to other agency functions like FEMA. Using platforms for secondary roles can strain military operators and reduce readiness for primary missions. The military faces challenges in sustaining systems tied to other agency functions like FEMA, which can strain operators and reduce readiness for primary missions. An \"End-to-End Review of the U.S. Nuclear Command and Control System\" was conducted in 2001 to address the changing nature of threats and recommendations from the Nuclear Posture Review. Former National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft chaired a commission tasked with examining the national command authority's architecture to individual weapons, balancing authorized use and preventing unauthorized use, and considering new technology and potential threats. One finding of the commission was regarding the survivability of NC2 systems designed during the Cold War, which may degrade without maintenance and strict adherence to hardness procedures. The End-to-End Review highlighted these issues. The End-to-End Review highlighted concerns about the degradation of system hardening without maintenance and strict adherence to procedures. Another report suggested transferring NC2 system life cycle management to operators from the acquisition community, involving operators in aircraft program oversight. The End-to-End Review proposed a model for NC2 systems similar to aircraft program oversight, involving operators in the system life cycle management. Operator requirements for new capabilities may not always align with acquisitions, leading to challenges in system upgrades and maintenance. The challenges in guiding acquisition programs include unrealistic requirements exceeding budget constraints, overlooking total costs of sustainment, and a decline in NC2 expertise since the end of the Cold War. The debate continues on balancing operator needs with economic management of acquisition programs. Since the end of the Cold War, there has been a decline in the number of people with NC2 expertise, leading to a \"brain drain\" in key positions. The prestige associated with the nuclear mission has also decreased, resulting in a revolving door of personnel with nuclear operations expertise mastering multiple specialties. This has caused on-the-job learning in critical NC2 positions. The legacy NC2 architecture faces challenges from potential adversaries and the Defense Department's push for military transformation. US Strategic Command is transitioning towards more network-oriented operations, establishing subordinate commands for specific mission aspects like global strike and space operations. In 2004, USSTRATCOM established functional component commands for global strike, space operations, missile defense, and information operations. These organizations are geographically separated and part of a move towards decentralization and collaboration. The 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review proposes significant changes in NC2 programs. The 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review recommends retiring legacy mobile platforms like the E-4B NAOC aircraft and replacing them with C-32 aircraft. The NAOC capability for FEMA support would shift to E-6B aircraft with additional communication upgrades. The USSTRATCOM MCCC would be retired in FY2007 to transition to distributed command and control capabilities. FEMA would transition to E-6B aircraft with communication upgrades, while USSTRATCOM MCCC would be retired in FY2007. The new command and control capabilities must be survivable against various attacks, including WMD, electronic, or cyber-warfare. DOD proposes tailored systems for WMD elimination missions, requiring a robust communications infrastructure. USSTRATCOM is exploring IP-based communications implementation. USSTRATCOM is considering implementing an internet protocol (IP)-based communications architecture to integrate new organizations. However, the use of an IP network for nuclear command and control may not provide the necessary assurance of rapid message transmission, especially for high priority nuclear force direction messages. The communications bandwidth needed for this infrastructure is already limited in the military. The military's communications bandwidth is already limited, with a 500% growth in capacity requirements over the past ten years. The need for satellite communications has increased by 1000% since 9/11 and may grow by another 2500% in the next decade. The nuclear community will compete for command and control links, especially with a dispersed operations concept increasing demand. Coordination is needed for integrating new centers and systems. The dispersed operations concept is increasing demand for command and control links, including for missile defense and conventional strike systems. The level of certification and configuration management required for integration into the NC2 network is still undetermined. Compatibility and reconciliation of procedures in a distributed architecture are crucial to avoid chaos as more agencies access equivalent data. Reconciliation of procedures and protocols in a distributed architecture is crucial to avoid chaos as more agencies access equivalent data. The chain of command and identification of the level empowered to direct action or forces must be clearly defined and enforced. Procurement programs tied to the nuclear command and control system in DOD's budget requests focus on upgrades and enhancements of existing systems. The Minimum Essential Emergency Communications Network (MEECN) comprises the communication links between the President and fielded nuclear forces. The MEECN, part of the nuclear command and control system, is being upgraded with $20.5 million for procurement and $57.3 million for R&D in FY2006. Congress authorized these funds in the FY2006 Defense Authorization Act. For FY2007, DOD is seeking $3.4 million for procurement and $64.1 million for R&D. Modernization efforts include high data rate terminals. Modernization efforts in the MEECN for FY2007 include upgrades to high data rate terminals, secure computer terminals, and satellite communications for Minuteman ICBM Launch Control Centers. DOD is seeking $3.4 million for procurement and $64.1 million for R&D. Improvements of VLF/LF and EHF satellite communications for Minuteman ICBM Launch Control Centers in the upper Midwest US. Installation of VLF and EHF communications for bomber and tanker forces to replace unsustainable legacy systems. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld personally involved in directing upgrades to NMCC and its alternate at Site-R. Services directed to consolidate their separate systems. Donald Rumsfeld is personally involved in directing upgrades to the NMCC and its alternate at Site-R. He has directed the consolidation of separate command centers into two new centers in the Pentagon: a Unified Command Center and a Resources and Situation Awareness Center. These new centers would focus on tracking global crises and facilitating military advice to the President, with enhanced survivability against various threats. The Defense Department is planning to consolidate functions into new facilities in the Pentagon to provide military advice to the President. These facilities will be more survivable against threats and secure against intelligence gathering. The consolidation aims to create efficiencies, reduce manpower, and free up space in the crowded facility. Funding for planning and engineering is requested through 2011. The Defense Department requested funding for planning, system engineering, and configuration management through 2011, with $0.6 million allocated for FY2006. Congress approved the full amount for FY2006 and DOD is seeking $0.7 million for FY2007. Additionally, $85.2 million was requested in FY2006 for missile warning and attack assessment systems at NORAD and USSTRATCOM, which feed information to decision makers at the NMCC. Congress funded the full DOD request in FY2006. The Defense Department is requesting funds for airborne nuclear command and control platforms, the E-4B NAOC and the E-6B ABNCP. The Air Force is seeking $85.3 million in procurement funds and $18.9 million in research and development funds for this purpose. Additionally, DOD is asking for $50.9 million for further TW/AA research and development in FY2007. The Air Force requested funds for E-4B NAOC and E-6B ABNCP modifications in FY2006, with Congress authorizing the full amounts. The FY2007 budget request includes $5.6 million for E-4B modifications procurement and $283 thousand for R&D, covering improvements to aircraft systems for flight safety. The Air Force requested funds for E-4B NAOC and E-6B ABNCP modifications in FY2006, with Congress authorizing the full amounts. The FY2007 budget request includes $5.6 million for E-4B modifications procurement and $283 thousand for R&D, covering improvements to aircraft systems for flight safety. Specific upgrades include transitioning from analog to digital equipment, developing an \"office in the sky\" for senior leaders with secure voice, video, and data services, improving the aircraft's local area network, upgrading precision navigation capability, and integrating with Global Air Traffic systems. The proposed upgrades for the E-6B aircraft operated by the Navy for USSTRATCOM in FY2006 would cost $11.2 million for procurement and $31.4 million for RDT&E. The modifications include improved cockpit displays, enhanced navigation and air traffic control integration systems, and a service life assessment of the airframe. The Navy's E-6B aircraft upgrades in FY2006 include improved cockpit displays, navigation systems, and air traffic control integration. Congress fully supported the Navy's request for funding in the FY2006 Defense Authorization Act, exceeding the DOD budget figure. For FY2007, the Defense Department is requesting $99.2 million for E-6 modifications procurement and $37.4 million for research. The Defense Department is requesting $99.2 million for E-6 modifications procurement and $37.4 million for research and development in FY2007. The acquisition of the Advanced EHF communications satellite is a key aspect of nuclear command and control modernization programs. The AEHF will replace the aging MILSTAR EHF satellite constellation. The MILSTAR satellite constellation, used for strategic nuclear command and control and tactical warfighters, currently has five satellites. The AEHF system provides secure, anti-jam communications capabilities with higher data rates. Lockheed Martin and Northrop-Grumman are contractors for the AEHF program. The Air Force requested funding in the FY2006 budget, which was fully funded by Congress. In FY2006, Congress fully funded the Air Force budget request for AEHF procurement. In FY2007, DOD is not requesting procurement funds but the Air Force seeks $633 million for AEHF R&D. AEHF has faced schedule delays, cost overruns, and technical shortfalls in communications encryption equipment development. The AEHF program has experienced schedule delays and cost overruns due to technical shortfalls in communications encryption equipment development. The first AEHF launch is now planned for 2008, with the program estimated to cost over $7 billion, resulting in a Nunn-McCurdy notification to Congress. AEHF is intended to bridge MILSTAR and the TSAT program. The AEHF program, intended to bridge MILSTAR and the TSAT program, has faced delays and cost overruns. Congress considered purchasing an additional AEHF satellite for FY2006 to hedge against TSAT program delays. For FY2006, Congress considered purchasing an additional AEHF satellite to hedge against TSAT program delays. Congress also directed the Air Force to prepare an \"analysis of alternatives\" report for acquiring more AEHF satellites and modifying Wideband Gapfiller satellites in case of further TSAT delays. In the FY2006 Defense Appropriations Act, Congress reduced funding for TSAT by $400 million and focused on technology development instead of transitioning to an acquisition program. Congress approved $436-plus million, reserving $120 million for either a fourth AEHF satellite purchase. Congress approved $436-plus million for technology development instead of transitioning to an acquisition program. $120 million was reserved for either purchasing a fourth AEHF satellite or continued systems development for TSAT. The NCCS will face challenges due to increased demands driven by the 2001 NPR and DOD policy, competing against conventional systems for budget priority. The threat shaping the NCCS may come from China. The NCCS faces challenges from increased demands driven by the 2001 NPR and DOD policy, competing against conventional systems for budget priority. The threat shaping the NCCS may come from China or other nuclear-armed peer competitors, rogue states, or terrorism. The system's value lies in fulfilling missions beyond traditional DOD purview and as long as the US maintains a nuclear deterrent, key functions performed by the NCCS will remain necessary. The DOD is pursuing modernization initiatives across the system in a budget-constrained environment. The DOD continues modernization initiatives for the NCCS in a budget-constrained environment. USSTRATCOM's activation of functional component commands and recommendations in the 2006 QDR may signal a change in direction. Congress may need to address the nature of the threat, with debates on China's military rise as a potential peer competitor to the US. Questions Congress may face include the nature of the threat posed by China, North Korea, Iran, and terrorist organizations, and the role of nuclear weapons in U.S. strategy and command and control. There is debate on whether China is a military competitor or a partner, and on the capabilities of these potential threats. Some argue for reducing the role of nuclear weapons. The role of nuclear weapons in U.S. strategy is debated, with some advocating for reduction to support non-proliferation efforts while others want to increase their utility against proliferators. This debate also influences the command and control system, questioning the current centralized approach developed during the Cold War. Revisions to the NCCS architecture may be necessary to incorporate changes driven by the 2001 NPR. Revisions to the NCCS architecture may need to incorporate additional command and control requirements for non-nuclear offensive responses and missile defense. A more dispersed approach, like the one proposed by USSTRATCOM, could be more suitable for the current threat environment, potentially leading to manpower and budget savings in the long term. However, the effectiveness of applying a distributed, network style approach to nuclear command and control remains untested. The NCCS modernization and procurement initiatives are projected to continue for years into the future, with potential opportunities for short-term savings from the retirement of certain equipment. The NCCS will need to compete against immediate day-to-day services' needs for funding. The NCCS will need to compete for funding against immediate day-to-day services' needs. Questions arise about the adequacy and necessity of existing NCCS platforms, as well as the value of their secondary uses. The taxpayer may benefit from utilizing NCCS capabilities for ancillary functions, especially as homeland security missions and domestic disaster response gain government attention. Some platforms already supporting these areas could offer increased utility, raising the question of continued investment justification. Some platforms supporting homeland security and disaster response may have potential for greater utility, raising questions about continued investment and potential transfer to civilian agencies."
