    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Diabetic Retinopathy Prevention Act of 2003\". The Congress finds that Type 2 diabetes affects 17 million Americans, with over 1 million new cases diagnosed annually, costing the nation an estimated $138 billion per year. Diabetic retinopathy, the most common complication of diabetes, leads to visual degradation and blindness, affecting individuals aged 20 to 74. Up to 24,000 diabetics become legally blind each year. Most diabetes patients will develop diabetic retinopathy. 24,000 diabetics become legally blind each year due to diabetic retinopathy, which is the most common complication of diabetes. The risk of diabetic retinopathy increases with the duration of diabetes, and the onset of type 2 diabetes at younger ages will lead to a higher prevalence of the condition in the future. Early detection and treatment can reduce vision loss by 90%, and remote assessment has the potential to reach a large number of diabetic patients. Remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy can reach diabetic patients in rural or underserved areas lacking access to in-office eye examinations, potentially reducing vision loss by 90%. Medicare coverage of remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy is added to the Social Security Act, allowing for remote assessments to reach diabetic patients in underserved areas without access to in-office eye examinations. The term 'remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy' refers to a diagnostic examination of the retina for early detection of diabetic retinopathy, provided annually to individuals with diabetes, meeting technical standards set by the Secretary, and conducted via a telecommunications system by a physician or practitioner. Telemedicine services are provided via a telecommunications system by qualified healthcare professionals to eligible patients, even if they are not physically present with the patient. Payment for these services is allowed regardless of limitations on store and forward technology. The amendments allow for remote assessments of diabetic retinopathy using store-and-forward technologies, regardless of limitations set forth in the Social Security Act. Interim payment is permitted until the final rule is published. Interim payment for retinopathy assessments is allowed until the final regulation is published. Additionally, a study on reimbursement for remote assessments of diabetic retinopathy must be conducted within a year of the enactment. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will conduct a study on costs incurred by healthcare providers for remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy services, including per-patient and start-up/administrative costs. A report with recommendations will be submitted to Congress within two years of the Act's enactment. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress on the study regarding reimbursements for remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy under Medicare and whether the study should be repeated. The amendments made by the Act will apply to assessments performed 30 days after the enactment date. Medicaid will cover remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy. Medicaid will cover remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy, with amendments to the Social Security Act for effective implementation. The State plan under Medicaid must comply with additional requirements imposed by amendments to the Social Security Act, but failure to meet these requirements before a specified deadline will not result in non-compliance solely for that reason. If a State has a 2-year legislative session, each year is considered a separate regular session of the State legislature. SEC. 5. MOBILE DIABETIC RETINOPATHY SCREENING PILOT PROGRAM. Amends Title III of the Public Health Service Act to establish a pilot program for mobile diabetic retinopathy screening. The Secretary will establish a grant program called the \"Mobile Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Pilot Program\" to fund 5 eligible entities for mobile diabetic retinopathy screening programs. Grants can only be used for designing, demonstrating, and implementing these programs. The Secretary will establish a grant program for mobile diabetic retinopathy screening programs, with a maximum grant amount of $1,000,000 per year. Applications for grants must be submitted within 90 days of funds availability. The Secretary will prioritize grant applications from entities with experience in evaluating diabetic retinopathy using telecommunications equipment, especially in rural and impoverished areas. The Secretary will prioritize grant applications from entities with experience in evaluating diabetic retinopathy using telecommunications equipment, especially in rural and impoverished areas. Congressional notification is required before making a grant under this section. The Secretary will convene an advisory committee to evaluate the Mobile Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Pilot Program's effectiveness in increasing early detection of diabetic retinopathy and decreasing its prevalence through preventative measures. The Secretary will evaluate the effectiveness of the Mobile Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Pilot Program in decreasing the prevalence and severity of diabetic retinopathy. The report will also assess if the program can be a model for similar screening programs for other chronic conditions. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress within 42 months of the first grant under this section, detailing the advisory committee's evaluation. Definitions include an advisory committee and eligible entities like hospitals. The curr_chunk defines a mobile diabetic retinopathy screening program as a program offering remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy. Eligible entities include hospitals, State institutions, local governments, tribal governments, nonprofit health organizations, and community health centers receiving assistance under section 330. The Mobile Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Pilot Program offers remote assessment of diabetic retinopathy for patients primarily residing in rural, underserved, and remote areas. Authorization of appropriations is provided for the program. Authorization of appropriations is provided for the Mobile Diabetic Retinopathy Screening Pilot Program, with $5,000,000 authorized for each fiscal year from 2005 to 2009, excluding subsection (b). Additional funding may be allocated as necessary for evaluation and reporting under subsection (b)."
