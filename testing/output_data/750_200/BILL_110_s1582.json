Hydrographic services involve managing, interpreting, certifying, and disseminating various types of information, including bathymetric, hydrographic, shoreline, geodetic, and geomagnetic data. This includes producing nautical charts, databases, and other products derived from hydrographic data, as well as developing nautical information systems. The curr_chunk discusses nautical charts, databases, and nautical information systems derived from hydrographic data. It also mentions related activities and defines the Coast and Geodetic Survey Act. SEC. 3. FUNCTIONS OF THE ADMINISTRATOR. Section 303 of the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 (33 U.S.C. 892a) is amended to promote safe, efficient, and environmentally sound marine transportation by providing hydrographic services and fulfilling the duties of the Administration under the Coast and Geodetic Survey Act.
