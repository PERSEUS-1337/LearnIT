However, a 2009 report showed an 8.0% increase in foreign-born students for the academic year 2008-2009, with significant growth from China. The foreign student enrollment for the academic year 2008-2009 increased by 8.0%, with significant growth from China. New enrollments rose by approximately 16.0%, attributed to recruitment efforts and improved visa processing. Enrollment changes varied by institution type, study levels, and disciplines, with noticeable differences in student origin by region. India's students accounted for 15.4% of the population in 2008-2009. The flow of foreign students to the United States varied by world region of origin in the academic year 2008-2009. India had the highest percentage of students at 15.4%, followed by China (14.6%), South Korea (11.2%), and others. The top fields of study for foreign students were business, engineering, sciences, social sciences, and computer sciences. In 2006, foreign students earned a significant percentage of doctorate degrees in various fields, including sciences and engineering. The participation rates for foreign students on temporary resident visas were 32.0% in sciences and 58.6% in engineering, while permanent resident status students earned 4.2% of doctorates in both fields. In 2006, foreign students earned a significant percentage of doctorate degrees in sciences and engineering, with participation rates of 32.0% and 58.6% for temporary residents, and 4.2% for permanent residents. Trend data from 1996-2005 shows that temporary residents consistently earned the majority of doctorate degrees in science and engineering. Disaggregated data provides a detailed breakdown of degree recipients by U.S. and non-U.S. citizenship status. In 2006, foreign students earned a significant percentage of doctorate degrees in various science fields. Foreign students were awarded 47.9% of doctorates in physical sciences, 55.3% in mathematics, and 61.3% in computer sciences. Additionally, 35.4% and 33.6% of degrees in earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences, and agricultural and biological sciences respectively, were awarded to foreign-born students in 2006. In 2006, foreign students earned a significant percentage of doctorate degrees in various science fields. The NSF provides data on the country of origin of foreign-born science and engineering doctorate awards, with 33.5% from China, 11.9% from India, and smaller percentages from other countries. Foreign students with doctorate degrees (non-U.S. citizens) come from various countries, with 33.5% from China, 11.9% from India, and smaller percentages from Taiwan, Canada, Africa, Turkey, Japan, and Germany. Certain restrictions are placed on foreign graduate students in U.S. institutions, including being full-time students and not being able to seek employment or obtain most fellowships or loans. Foreign graduate students in U.S. institutions, including those from China, India, Taiwan, Canada, Africa, Turkey, Japan, and Germany, face restrictions on seeking employment and obtaining fellowships or loans. However, they can work as research or teaching assistants on federally funded projects. Financial support for science and engineering graduate students comes from various sources such as personal funds, university assistantships, foreign governments, employers, and other sources. Home country support is usually limited to the first year of study. Many foreign graduate students in U.S. institutions receive support from their home country for the first year of study. For continuing years, universities offer assistance through research or teaching assistantships funded by federal grants. The 2007 report, Doctorate Recipients from United States Universities: Summary Report 2006, shows that universities provide significant financial support to foreign doctoral students through teaching assistantships, research assistantships, and fellowships. Non-U.S. citizen doctoral recipients receive more financial assistance than U.S. doctoral recipients, with Native Americans/Alaska Natives relying on their own resources for funding. In the breakdown by race/ethnicity, Native Americans/Alaska Natives relied most on their own resources for graduate studies, followed by blacks, whites, Hispanics, and Asians. In the physical sciences and engineering, universities provided primary financial support for temporary resident students, permanent residents, and U.S. citizens, with varying percentages depending on the field and residency status. In graduate studies, universities were the main source of financial support for temporary resident students in physical sciences and engineering, as well as for permanent resident and U.S. citizen doctoral students. Foreign students in disciplines like education and social sciences also received more financial assistance from universities compared to U.S. students. In the social sciences, universities provided financial support to 54.0% of temporary resident doctoral students, 43.9% for permanent residents, and 35.7% for U.S. citizens. Some argue that U.S. universities benefit from a large foreign citizen enrollment by helping to meet the needs of the university and the nation's economy. Foreign students contribute to the U.S. economy by increasing the number of skilled workers and providing valuable assistance in research institutions. Many foreign students contribute to the U.S. economy by assisting in research institutions and paying tuition, which is a significant source of income for educational institutions. However, there are concerns among minority communities about the disparity in access to graduate education for U.S. minorities compared to foreign students. Disparity exists in the university science community regarding access for U.S. minorities to graduate education, scholarships, research funds, and collaboration opportunities. Former professor Frank L. Morris criticized colleges for favoring departments admitting foreign students over supporting minority graduate students. In testimony before the Subcommittee on Immigration and Claims, Morris criticized colleges for prioritizing resources for departments admitting foreign students over supporting minority graduate students, particularly African Americans. This disparity in funding jeopardizes the economic well-being of the African American community by providing inadequate doctoral training for competing in higher-level scientific fields. The economic well-being of the African American community is at risk due to inadequate doctoral training for competing in higher-level scientific fields. Some criticism includes foreign student teaching assistants struggling to communicate effectively with American students due to language barriers, impacting the learning process. Despite requirements for proficiency in English, issues persist. Several states have set English-language standards for foreign teaching assistants, aiming to improve communication with American students. Scientific migration is seen as beneficial by some, contributing to the U.S. economy's advancement in science and technology. International graduate students and scholars play a crucial role in the research enterprise of the United States, as highlighted in a 2005 report by the National Academies. The 2005 report by the National Academies emphasizes the importance of international graduate students and postdoctoral scholars in the research enterprise of the United States, stating that their presence is crucial for research and teaching activities in various sectors. The number of immigrant scientists and engineers entering the U.S. remained stable during the 1980s. In the 1980s, the number of immigrant scientists and engineers entering the United States remained stable. However, in 1992, there was a significant increase in admissions due to changes in the Immigration Act of 1990 and the Chinese Students Protection Act of 1992. By 2000, the proportion of foreign-born scientists and engineers in the U.S. labor force reached a record high. The proportion of foreign-born scientists and engineers in the U.S. labor force reached a record high in 2000, with increased admissions due to changes in immigration legislation and administrative impacts. Recent legislation has also raised the annual quota for the H-1B program for foreign-born workers on temporary work visas. Recent legislation has increased the annual quota for the H-1B program, allowing foreign-born workers to obtain visas for up to six years. The program is used for technology workers and other skilled workers, with some companies using it to fill positions not considered temporary. Data on selected occupations for H-1B visa workers are provided in Table 4. Some argue that the influx of immigrant scientists and engineers on H-1B visas has led to reduced job opportunities and wages for U.S. scientific personnel. The federal government issued thousands of H-1B visas to foreign workers, causing concerns about weakening opportunities for the U.S. workforce in high-tech positions. An over-reliance on H-1B visa workers in high-tech positions has raised concerns about job opportunities for U.S. workers. Critics argue that foreign labor is being hired at lower salaries, displacing American workers. Some advocate for restrictions on hiring foreign skilled employees to protect U.S. workers, while supporters of the H-1B program argue that foreign workers are necessary to fill needed positions, even during slow economic growth. The H-1B visa program has raised concerns about displacing U.S. workers with foreign labor in high-tech positions. A 2006 report by the Government Accountability Office found that Labor's oversight of H-1B applications is limited, leading to potential inaccuracies. Labor enforces program requirements through investigations and random checks on violators. The Wage and Hour Division (WHD) enforces H-1B program requirements by investigating complaints against employers. Complaints and violations increased from 2000 to 2005, possibly due to changes in the program. USCIS lacks a formal mechanism to report information to Labor, and current law limits WHD from using this information for investigations. Justice pursues charges from U.S. workers alleging discrimination in hiring practices. The Department of Justice investigates charges of discrimination in hiring practices filed by U.S. workers, particularly related to the employment of foreign scientists and engineers. Concerns include lower salaries for foreign-born computer professionals compared to their U.S. counterparts and the impact of hiring H-1B workers on the bargaining position of American workers. The Department of Labor enforces policies on temporary employment. The Department of Labor enforces policies on temporary employment of nonimmigrant foreign workers under H-1B visas to penalize violators. Supporters argue that bringing in skilled foreign talent is necessary for the U.S. to compete in the global economy. Individuals supporting the need for skilled foreign talent in the U.S. argue that monitoring the entry of foreign talent into colleges and the labor force is crucial for competing in the global economy. Some believe that the issue lies in not having enough native-born students in scientific and technical disciplines, rather than an excess of foreign-born students. The National Science Board's May 2010 report emphasizes the importance of attracting and retaining foreign-born talent in STEM fields. The National Science Board's May 2010 report emphasizes the importance of attracting and retaining foreign-born talent in STEM fields to supplement domestic talent and meet global demand. The debate on foreign students in US graduate science and engineering programs intensified post-9/11. Concerns arise about the inhospitable environment for foreign students in the US, with a report suggesting a decline in the country's appeal to international students. The US is losing its appeal for international students due to concerns about foreign students in sensitive areas like research and development related to weapons. There is increased scrutiny on students from terrorism-sponsoring countries, impacting enrollments in colleges and universities. The impact of foreign students on enrollments in colleges and universities is a topic of debate. Concerns also exist about the potential negative effects on U.S. industry competitiveness due to a reduction in foreign scientists. The tracking of foreign students attending U.S. institutions has sparked discussion in the academic and scientific community post-September 11th. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (P.L. 104-208) authorized the SEVP/CIPRIS program to track foreign students and researchers electronically. Colleges and universities were required to report data on foreign students, but the system was never fully implemented. The SEVIS system was developed in response to legislation to track foreign students and researchers in U.S. institutions. It replaced the SEVP/CIPRIS program, which was never fully implemented due to cost concerns. The INS developed the SEVIS system to track foreign students and exchange visitors in U.S. institutions. SEVIS was designed to ensure they arrive in the U.S., register at their institution, and maintain their visa status. However, SEVIS faced delays and problems during implementation, causing issues with visa applications. The deadline for SEVIS implementation was extended to February 15, 2003, but faced delays and technical issues. SEVIS II is proposed to address these problems and enhance tracking capabilities. The House Subcommittee on National Security held a hearing on September 13, 2005, to address gaps in the visa process and strengthen it as an antiterrorism tool. Witnesses highlighted increased consular workloads and lack of strategic direction, resources, and training in visa-processing offices. Witnesses testified about the challenges in visa processing offices, including increased workloads, lack of resources and training, and the absence of reliable data to address security and fraud issues. Clear procedures for visa issuance and monitoring operations globally are crucial to ensure consistent adjudication of visas at all posts. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has published reports on these efforts. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has released reports on efforts to improve visa processing, including recommendations for clarifying visa policies and procedures to address delays. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) released reports recommending clarifying visa policies and procedures to address delays. Comprehensive immigration reform legislation was debated in the 110th Congress but failed. H.R. 4321, Comprehensive Immigration Reform for America's Security and Prosperity Act, has been reintroduced in the 111th Congress. H.R. 4321, Comprehensive Immigration Reform for America's Security and Prosperity Act, reintroduced in the 111th Congress, aims to exempt certain U.S.-educated immigrants from employment-based immigration limits and amend H-1B visa requirements to protect U.S. workers and restrict employer preferences for H-1B immigrants. Additionally, bills in the 111th Congress focus on attracting foreign students in scientific and technical fields while safeguarding American scientists' interests. H.R. 1736, International Science and Technology Cooperation Act, and S. 887, H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act, are bills introduced in the 111th Congress to address issues related to collaboration between U.S. and foreign scientists. H.R. 1791 focuses on regulating the hiring of H-1B and L-1 employees by employers in the United States. The bill H.R. 1791, known as the STAPLE Act, aims to regulate the hiring of H-1B workers by businesses with 50 or more employees in the U.S. It also includes provisions for annual audits of these businesses. The bill sets numerical limitations for immigrants with a doctorate degree in scientific disciplines from a U.S. institution and an offer of employment in a related field. Additionally, it imposes H-1B visa limitations for immigrants with a doctorate in a scientific discipline and requires education as a condition of employment."
