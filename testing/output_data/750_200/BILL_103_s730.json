    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"United States-Canada Fair Grain Trade Act of 1993\". The United States-Canada Fair Grain Trade Act of 1993 addresses issues caused by unfair provisions in the US-Canada Free-Trade Agreement. Canadian grain exports, particularly durum wheat, spring wheat, and barley, have flooded the US market, leading to depressed prices, financial losses for American farmers, and challenges in implementing domestic support programs. The United States-Canada Fair Grain Trade Act of 1993 aims to address the negative impact of Canadian grain exports on US farmers. This includes implementing domestic farmer support programs and addressing the price setting policy of the Canadian Wheat Board affecting goods exported to the United States. The United States-Canada Fair Grain Trade Act of 1993 focuses on addressing the impact of Canadian grain exports on US farmers by implementing domestic support programs and regulating the price setting policy of the Canadian Wheat Board for goods exported to the United States. The legislation also requires immediate consultation with the Government of Canada to exclude transport rates established under Canada's Western Grain Transportation. The United States-Canada Fair Grain Trade Act of 1993 aims to address the impact of Canadian grain exports on US farmers by implementing domestic support programs and regulating the price setting policy of the Canadian Wheat Board for goods exported to the United States. Consultations to exclude transport rates under Canada's Western Grain Transportation have not made progress, leading to a flawed binational panel decision. The binational panel decision undermines Article 701(3) of the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement, which prohibits selling agricultural goods for export below acquisition price plus costs. SEC. 101. PRICE TRANSPARENCY. The President must negotiate with Canada to determine prices for Canadian Wheat Board goods sold to the US. If negotiations fail within 120 days, action will be taken. If negotiations fail to establish pricing methods or data procedures, Canada will be in violation of the US-Canada Free-Trade Agreement. All imports of Canadian grain to the US will be suspended until successful negotiations are completed. SEC. 102. RAIL TRANSPORTATION SUBSIDY. The President will pursue consultations with Canada regarding the exclusion of Canadian agricultural goods from transport rates. If negotiations fail within 120 days, imports of Canadian grain benefiting from the rates will be suspended. The President will suspend imports of Canadian grain benefiting from transport rates until successful negotiations are completed to terminate such benefits. The President will suspend imports of Canadian grain benefiting from transport rates until successful negotiations are completed to terminate such benefits. SEC. 103. ACQUISITION PRICE OF GRAIN. The President will negotiate with Canada to define \"acquisition price\" in the US-Canada Free-Trade Agreement to include transportation subsidies, payments to producers by the Canadian Wheat Board, and other incurred payments or subsidies. Negotiations will clarify the meaning of \"acquisition price\" in the US-Canada Free-Trade Agreement, including transportation subsidies, payments by the Canadian Wheat Board, and other incurred payments. If negotiations fail within 120 days, imports of Canadian grain will be suspended until successful negotiations are certified by the President. SEC. 104. Federal agencies must provide technical assistance to petitioners in countervailing duty cases regarding Canadian subsidies for wheat and barley exports to the US. TITLE II--AGRICULTURAL TRADE PROGRAMS SEC. 201. Export Enhancement Program can be used to promote grain exports. Section 301(b) of the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 is amended to promote grain exports by allowing U.S. grain producers to compete effectively with Canadian producers. The amendment aims to address the impact of transportation subsidies by the Government of Canada and the Canadian Wheat Board selling wheat below acquisition cost in foreign markets. The requirements to counteract transportation subsidies and wheat sales by the Government of Canada and the Canadian Wheat Board will apply until an agreement is reached with Canada to exclude agricultural goods from transport rates. The Free-Trade Agreement Implementation Act of 1988 aims to counteract the sale of wheat by the Canadian Wheat Board until an agreement is reached with Canada to ensure the sale of wheat at a price no less than the full acquisition cost. SEC. 202. AGRICULTURAL EXPORT PROGRAM PROTECTION. Amends Title XV of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 by adding a new subtitle for Agricultural Export Program Protection. This includes definitions for the program. The Agricultural Trade Program refers to export promotion, credit, guarantee, bonus, or other international food aid programs administered by the Commodity Credit Corporation, including those under the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978. The Agricultural Trade Program includes various international food aid programs administered by the Commodity Credit Corporation, excluding certain specific programs under different acts. The term 'covered foreign commodity' refers to wheat, feed grains, or soybeans imported into the US. 'Entry' means the import or withdrawal from warehouse. 'Person' includes exporters, assignees, and participants in agricultural trade programs. The term 'person' in the context includes exporters, assignees, and participants in agricultural trade programs. The term 'Secretary' refers to the Secretary of Agriculture. The term 'United States agricultural commodity' has the same meaning as defined in the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978. SEC. 1582. MONITORING OF DOMESTIC USES MADE OF CERTAIN FOREIGN COMMODITIES. The text chunk discusses the requirements for an end-use certificate for covered foreign commodities and the submission of quarterly reports by consignees certifying the percentage of the covered foreign commodity used. Consignees must submit quarterly reports certifying the percentage of covered foreign commodities used and confirming the purpose stated in the end-use certificate. If ownership is transferred, consignees must provide relevant information to the Secretary. The end-use certificates and quarterly reports required under subsection (a) must contain necessary information as determined by the Secretary. This includes the name and address of the entity to whom the commodity is transferred. Quarterly reports must include the importer and consignee's name and address, country of origin, description, and purpose of the covered foreign commodity.

The Secretary shall ensure confidentiality of purchasers and prohibit entry of covered foreign commodities without a compliant end-use certificate. The importer of record must present an end-use certificate for covered foreign commodities at the time of entry to avoid penalties under customs laws. Violating requirements set by the Secretary for this section can result in civil penalties. The Secretary can impose civil penalties up to $10,000 for failing to meet the requirements of this section. Regulations will be established to ensure compliance, including guidelines for submitting quarterly reports. \"Compliance provisions under section 402 of the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 apply to programs authorized in this subtitle. Suspension or debarment may occur for using foreign agricultural commodities in certain agricultural trade programs.\" The Commodity Credit Corporation must offer a hearing before suspending or debarring a person from participating in an agricultural trade program for violating program terms. The Corporation has the authority to waive suspension or debarment if the person proves compliance to their satisfaction. The Commodity Credit Corporation may waive suspension or debarment for a person in an agricultural trade program if they prove unintentional use of a foreign agricultural commodity, less than 1% of the total quantity involved. The Corporation may waive suspension or debarment for a person in an agricultural trade program if they prove unintentional use of a foreign agricultural commodity. The liability of the person for any other penalty imposed under the program will not be affected. This section and the amendment made by this section will become effective 120 days after the date of enactment of this Act. The Corporation may waive suspension or debarment for a person in an agricultural trade program if they prove unintentional use of a foreign agricultural commodity. The liability of the person for any other penalty imposed under the program will not be affected.
