    "content": "The \"Protect and Preserve International Cultural Property Act\" defines cultural property as outlined in the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict. The appropriate congressional committees are specified as the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate. SEC. 3. FINDINGS AND STATEMENT OF POLICY. Congress finds that protecting international cultural property is crucial for US cultural diplomacy, as it demonstrates respect for other cultures and the shared heritage of humanity. This protection is necessary due to the loss, damage, and destruction of cultural property caused by various threats such as political instability, armed conflict, and natural disasters. Recent political unrest in Egypt has resulted in the looting of museums and the destruction of ancient artifacts, creating irreversible gaps in the historical record of the ancient Egyptian civilization. In Iraq, looting of the Iraq Museum in Baghdad after the fall of Saddam Hussein resulted in the loss of approximately 15,000 ancient artifacts, including amulets, sculptures, ivories, and cylinder seals. Many items remain unrecovered. In Syria, the civil war has led to the shelling of medieval cities, damage to UNESCO World Heritage Sites, and looting of museums and archaeological sites, causing significant harm to archaeological and historic sites and artifacts. In Iraq and Syria, ISIS/ISIL has destroyed cultural sites and artifacts, looting and trafficking antiquities to fund militant operations. In Mali, Ansar Al-Qaeda has also targeted cultural heritage sites. In Mali, Ansar Dine destroyed tombs and shrines in Timbuktu, threatening ancient manuscripts. In Afghanistan, the Taliban destroyed the Bamiyan Buddhas, leading to global condemnation. In Cambodia, the Khmer Rouge destroyed Buddhist temples, statues, literature, mosques, and Catholic churches. In China, the Cultural Revolution led to the destruction of antiques and parts of old Beijing, with current efforts to rebuild. In China, antiques were destroyed, including parts of old Beijing. Chinese authorities are now rebuilding lost architectural heritage. In Haiti, the 2010 earthquake destroyed art, artifacts, and archives, as well as partially damaging the 17th century city of Jacmel. The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami affected eleven countries, causing massive loss of life and damaging UNESCO World Heritage Sites like Mahabalipuram in India. The destruction of cultural properties like Mahabalipuram in India and Galle in Sri Lanka represents a loss of humanity's heritage. The US Armed Forces have played a role in protecting cultural property since 1943. In 1943, President Franklin D. Roosevelt established the American Commission for the Protection and Salvage of Artistic and Historic Monuments in War Areas to advise the military on protecting cultural property. The Commission formed Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives (MFAA) teams, known as the \"Monuments Men,\" who secured and returned art stolen by the Nazis during World War II. The U.S. Committee of the Blue Shield was founded in 2006 to support the implementation of the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict and to coordinate with the United States military and other organizations in preserving international cultural property threatened by various disasters. The United States aims to protect and preserve international cultural property at risk of destruction due to political instability, armed conflict, or natural disasters. This is in line with its obligations under the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict and customary international law. The United States aims to protect cultural property at risk of destruction due to conflict, prevent importation of pillaged cultural property, and enforce laws to prevent trafficking in stolen cultural property. SEC. 4. WHITE HOUSE COORDINATOR FOR INTERNATIONAL CULTURAL PROPERTY PROTECTION.

Import restrictions on archaeological and ethnological material of Syria will be enforced within 60 days of the Act's enactment. The term \"archaeological or ethnological material of Syria\" refers to cultural property unlawfully removed from Syria after August 18, 2011. The term \"State Party\" is defined in section 302 of the Cultural Property Implementation Act."
