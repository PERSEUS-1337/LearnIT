    "content": "The \"Colorado Ute Settlement Act Amendments of 1998\" provides for a final settlement of the claims of the Colorado Ute Indian Tribes by agreeing to reduced water supply facilities. The Act defines key terms related to water rights settlement, including \"Agreement,\" \"Animas-La Plata Project,\" and \"Dolores Project.\" The term \"Tribe\" or \"Tribes\" is defined in the Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights Settlement Act of 1988. SEC. 3. AMENDMENTS TO THE COLORADO UTE INDIAN WATER RIGHTS SETTLEMENT ACT OF 1988. The Colorado Ute Settlement Act Amendments of 1998 amended Section 6(a) to provide for the construction of a reservoir with a storage capacity of 260,000 acres-feet as part of the Animas-La Plata Project. The Colorado Ute Settlement Act Amendments of 1998 amended Section 6(a) to include the construction of a reservoir with a storage capacity of 260,000 acres-feet for the Animas-La Plata Project. This project includes a pumping plant, reservoir inlet conduit, and water allocations for the Southern Ute Tribe and Ute Mountain Ute Indian Tribe. The Colorado Ute Settlement Act Amendments of 1998 allocated water to various entities: Ute Mountain Ute Indian Tribe, Navajo Nation, San Juan Water Commission, and Animas-La Plata Conservancy, with specific annual depletion limits for each. The Colorado Ute Settlement Act Amendments of 1998 allocated water to different entities with specific annual depletion limits, including the Navajo Nation and Animas-La Plata Conservancy District. Tribal construction costs are nonreimbursable, and nontribal water capital repayment obligations are specified. The nontribal municipal and industrial water capital repayment obligations for the Animas-La Plata Project shall be satisfied by specific entities with designated amounts, including the San Juan Water Commission, Animas-La Plata Water Conservancy District, and the State of Colorado. The State of Colorado's cost-sharing obligation for the Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights Settlement and Animas-La Plata Project is up to $16,000,000. Certain nonreimbursable costs for recreation, environmental compliance, cultural resources protection, and fish and wildlife mitigation are specified. Tribal water allocations are also addressed. The Secretary will cover operation, maintenance, and replacement costs for municipal and industrial water allocated to a Tribe from the Animas-La Plata Project or the Dolores Project until the water is used by the Tribe. The Secretary will cover operation, maintenance, and replacement costs for municipal and industrial water allocated to a Tribe from the Animas-La Plata Project or the Dolores Project until the water is used by the Tribe. The Tribe is not required to reimburse the Secretary for these costs. Repayment of a pro rata share is required when the water allocation is first used by the Tribe. The Tribe must repay its share of construction costs for the Dolores Project and bear annual operation, maintenance, and replacement costs for water supplies allocated to them. The Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights Settlement Act of 1988 is amended to provide water allocations to the Animas-La Plata Water Conservancy District of Colorado and the La Plata Conservancy District of New Mexico. The Secretary will take necessary actions to ensure water supplies after the enactment of the Colorado Ute Settlement Act Amendments of 1998. The Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights Settlement Act of 1988 is amended to allocate water to the Animas-La Plata Water Conservancy District of Colorado and the La Plata Conservancy District of New Mexico. The Secretary will ensure water supplies post the enactment of the Colorado Ute Settlement Act Amendments of 1998, with specific annual depletion limits for each district. The Secretary will allocate water among beneficiaries of the Animas-La Plata Project in accordance with an agreement. Additionally, the Secretary shall transfer water rights upon request of the State Engineer of New Mexico. The Secretary will transfer water rights to New Mexico beneficiaries of the Animas-La Plata Project as requested by the State Engineer, in accordance with applicable State law. Additionally, certain reports related to the project will be treated as specified in the April 1996 Final Supplement to the Final Environmental Impact Statement. The April 1996 Final Supplement to the Final Environmental Impact Statement and the February 19, 1996 Final Biological Opinion of the Animas-La Plata Project are deemed sufficient to meet requirements under the Endangered Species Act, National Environmental Policy Act, and Federal Water Pollution Control Act. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act are applicable to the amendments made to the Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights Settlement Act, construction of specified facilities, and an approved water depletion of 57,100 acre-feet. The final settlement allows for an aggregate depletion of 57,100 acre-feet of water as approved in a biological opinion. This subsection does not affect the construction of facilities not described here or any water use not approved by the Director of the US Fish and Wildlife Service. The final settlement of tribal water rights on the Animas and La Plata Rivers is provided in accordance with this section, constituting the final resolution. Nothing in this section affects the Tribes' rights to water on other streams and rivers, allowing them to participate in the Animas-La Plata Project. The Attorney General of the United States shall file necessary instruments with the District Court, Water Division Number 7, of the State of Colorado to request amending the final consent decree for tribal water rights on the Animas and La Plata Rivers under the Colorado Ute Settlement Act Amendments of 1998. SEC. 4. STATUTORY CONSTRUCTION; TREATMENT OF CERTAIN FUNDS. The amendments made by this Act to section 6 of the Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights Settlement of 1988 do not affect the applicability of other provisions of the Act or the Secretary of the Interior's obligation to deliver water from the Dolores Project and complete construction of facilities on the Ute Mountain Ute Indian Reservation. The Department of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Acts from 1991 to 1995 are referenced, or the treatment of the uncommitted portion of the cost. The uncommitted portion of the cost-sharing obligation of the State of Colorado, as referenced in the Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights Settlement Act of 1988, remains available for assistance after the specified payment date. The uncommitted portion of the State of Colorado's cost-sharing obligation, as per the Colorado Ute Indian Water Rights Settlement Act of 1988, can be used to fund components of the Animas-La Plata Project not covered in section 6(a)(3) after the payment date."
