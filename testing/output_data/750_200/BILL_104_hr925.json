    "content": "The \"Private Property Protection Act of 1995\" ensures that no law or agency action should diminish the value of privately owned property. Federal agencies must exercise authority to prevent such limitations and property owners have the right to compensation. The Federal Government must compensate property owners if an agency action limits property use, reducing its value by 20% or more. Compensation equals the value decrease caused by the action. If the value decreases by over 50%, the owner can choose to sell that portion at fair market value. Property owners must not use their property contrary to limitations imposed by agency actions, even if those actions are later rescinded. If the owner refunds the compensation amount to the Treasury, adjusted for inflation, the property can then be used as desired. Property owners must not use their property contrary to limitations imposed by agency actions or local zoning ordinances. If a use is deemed a nuisance by state law or already prohibited under a zoning ordinance, no compensation will be provided. SEC. 5. EXCEPTIONS.\n\nNo compensation under this Act for agency actions aimed at preventing hazards to health, safety, or specific property damage. Navigation servitude exceptions apply only to wetlands.\n\nSEC. 6. PROCEDURE. An owner must submit a written request for compensation to the agency within 180 days of receiving notice of the agency action. The agency can negotiate the compensation amount with the owner, and if an agreement is reached, the agency must promptly pay the owner. If no agreement is reached within 180 days, the owner can choose to pursue other remedies. If parties do not agree on compensation, owner can opt for arbitration or civil action. Arbitration procedures follow title 9, US Code. Award includes attorney's fees. Owner must submit written request within 180 days to agency for compensation. If no agreement, owner can pursue other remedies. An owner who does not choose arbitration or receive prompt payment may seek relief through a civil action against the agency. If successful, the agency is liable for attorney's fees, litigation costs, and interest on compensation. Payments under this section come from the agency. The court awards interest on compensation from the time of the limitation. Payments to an owner and judgments in civil actions are made from the agency's annual appropriation. The agency responsible for the action may seek reimbursement from another agency. The head of the agency can transfer appropriated funds for this purpose. The head of the agency can transfer or reprogram appropriated funds to pay judgments or compensate owners. If funds are insufficient, the agency must seek additional appropriation for the next fiscal year. SEC. 7. LIMITATION. Any payment under this Act by the United States is subject to the availability of appropriations.\n\nSEC. 8. DUTY OF NOTICE TO OWNERS. When an agency limits private property use, it must notify affected owners about their rights and compensation procedures.\n\nSEC. 9. RULES OF CONSTRUCTION. SEC. 9. RULES OF CONSTRUCTION.
