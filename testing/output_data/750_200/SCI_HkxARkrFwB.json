    "content": "Deep learning NLP models use word embeddings like word2vec or GloVe to represent words as continuous vectors, encoding semantic relationships. Storing all word embedding vectors requires a lot of space and may strain systems with limited GPU memory. Two methods, word2ket and word2ketXS, inspired by quantum computing, are proposed for storing word embedding matrix during training. Our approach, word2ket and word2ketXS, inspired by quantum computing, efficiently store word embedding matrices during training and inference, achieving significant space reduction without compromising accuracy in NLP tasks. Word embedding techniques like word2vec and GloVe map human language into a continuous space for neural network processing. These methods use vectors of smaller dimensionality to represent words, allowing for efficient training on large text datasets. Word embedding techniques like word2vec and GloVe use smaller vectors to represent words, enabling efficient training on large text datasets. The embeddings capture semantic relationships between words, with vocabulary sizes reaching up to 10^6. The dimensionality of embeddings ranges from 300 to 1024, requiring the d x p embedding matrix to be stored in GPU memory for training and inference. The dimensionality of word embeddings ranges from 300 to 1024, stored in GPU memory for training and inference. In classical computing, information is stored in bits, while in quantum computing, a qubit is described by a two-dimensional complex unit-norm vector. In quantum computing, a qubit is represented by a unit-norm vector in C 2. Entanglement allows interconnected qubits to have an exponential state space dimensionality, unlike independent classical bits. In quantum computing, qubits can be entangled, unlike classical bits. Quantum registers can be approximated classically, losing some representation power but still effective for NLP machine learning algorithms using high-dimensional word embeddings. In quantum computing, qubits can be entangled, unlike classical bits. Quantum registers can be approximated classically, losing some representation power but still effective for NLP machine learning algorithms using high-dimensional word embeddings. The impact on NLP machine learning algorithms that use approximation approaches to store and manipulate the high-dimensional word embedding matrix is significant. Two related methods, word2ket and word2ketXS, inspired by quantum computing, are proposed for storing word embedding matrix efficiently during training and inference. The first method operates independently on each word's embedding, allowing for more efficient processing, while the second method operates jointly on all word embeddings, offering even higher efficiency in storing the embedding matrix, albeit with more complex processing. Empirical evidence from three NLP tasks shows that the new word2ket embeddings offer a high space-saving rate. The new word2ket embeddings offer high space saving rate with little impact on downstream NLP model accuracy. Tensor product space of separable Hilbert spaces V and W is constructed using ordered pairs v \u2297 w, where v \u2208 V and w \u2208 W. Inner product between v \u2297 w and v \u2297 w is defined as a product of individual inner products v \u2297 w, v \u2297 w = v, v w, w. The inner product between v \u2297 w and v \u2297 w is defined as a product of individual inner products v \u2297 w, v \u2297 w = v, v w, w. It follows that ||v \u2297 w|| = ||v|| ||w||; a tensor product of two unit-norm vectors is a unit norm vector in V \u2297 W. The Hilbert space V \u2297 W consists of equivalence classes of pairs v \u2297 w, where different notations represent the same vector. A vector in a tensor product space is often called a tensor.\u03c8 j and \u03c6 k are orthonormal basis sets in V and W, respectively, where \u03b4 z is the Kronecker delta. The set {\u03c8 j \u2297 \u03c6 k} forms an. The tensor product space V \u2297 W forms an orthonormal basis with coefficients indexed by pairs jk. The dimensionality of V \u2297 W is the product of dimensionalities of V and W. Tensor product spaces can be created by multiple applications of tensor product, with arbitrary bracketing. In quantum mechanics and quantum computing, a vector u \u2208 C 2 n is written as |u and called a ket. Tensor product spaces can be created by multiple applications of tensor product with arbitrary bracketing, forming a tensor order 3 of n. The tensor product is bilinear and can be expressed as \u03c6 \u2297 \u03c8. The tensor product space contains vectors of the form v \u2297 w and their linear combinations, some of which cannot be expressed as \u03c6 \u2297 \u03c8 due to specific constraints on coefficients. In tensor product spaces, coefficients a, b, c, d are constrained such that ac = 1/ \u221a 2 and bd = 1/ \u221a 2. Tensors of rank greater than one are called entangled. The maximum rank of a tensor in a tensor product space of order higher than two is unknown. A p-dimensional word embedding model maps word identifiers into a p-dimensional real Hilbert space with the L2 norm. The text discusses a mapping function f that maps word identifiers into a p-dimensional real Hilbert space to capture semantic information. The function is represented as a collection of vectors indexed by i, typically in the form of a matrix. An embedding of a single word is represented as an entangled tensor in word2ket, using a tensor of rank r and order n. The text discusses representing word embeddings as entangled tensors in word2ket, using a tensor of rank r and order n. The resulting vector has dimension p = qn, taking up space O(rq log q log p). It is emphasized that q should be greater than or equal to 4 to avoid loss of information. If downstream computations involve inner products of embedding vectors, explicit calculation of qn-dimensional vectors may not be necessary. The calculation of inner product between two p-dimensional word embeddings in word2ket takes O (rq log q log p) time and O (1) additional space. For a batch of b words, the total space requirement is O (bp + rq log q log p). Reconstructing word embeddings from a tensor of rank r and order n takes O (rn log 2 p) operations. The tensor product space is organized into a balanced tree for parallel processing, reducing sequential processing to O (log 2 n). Word embeddings are typically trained using gradient descent. The proposed word2ket representation involves differentiable arithmetic operations, allowing for gradients to be defined. With a balanced tree structure, word embeddings can be seen as a sequence of linear layers with linear activation functions, reducing processing to O(log2n). The gradient of the embedding vector with respect to tunable parameters can lead to a high Lipschitz constant. The embedding vector gradient's high Lipschitz constant can harm training. To address this, LayerNorm is used at each node in the balanced tensor product tree. Linear operators A and B map vectors from V to U and W to Y, respectively. The mapping A \u2297 B is a linear operator that maps vectors from V \u2297 W to U \u2297 Y. The linear operator A \u2297 B maps vectors from V \u2297 W to U \u2297 Y through its action on simple vectors and linearity. In the finite-dimensional case, A \u2297 B can be represented as an mn \u00d7 mn matrix. A word embedding model can be seen as a linear operator F : Rd \u2192 Rp that maps one-hot vectors to word embedding vectors. The linear operator F maps one-hot vectors to word embedding vectors in a d \u00d7 p matrix M, with M^T representing the linear operator. The linear operator F maps one-hot vectors to word embedding vectors in a d \u00d7 p matrix. In word2ketXS, the d \u00d7 p word embedding matrix is represented using a series of linear operators. The resulting matrix F has dimension p \u00d7 d and utilizes tensor product-based exponential compression for space efficiency. This approach avoids reconstructing the full embedding matrix each time a small number of rows is needed for multiplication by a weight matrix in the downstream layer of the neural NLP model. To avoid reconstructing the full embedding matrix each time a small number of rows is needed for multiplication by a weight matrix in the downstream layer of the neural NLP model, lazy tensors are used. This method efficiently reconstructs rows of the embedding matrix using single rows of underlying matrices. The proposed space-efficient word embeddings were evaluated in three different downstream NLP tasks to assess their ability to capture semantic information about words. In downstream NLP tasks, the proposed space-efficient word embeddings were compared with regular embeddings for accuracy. Text summarization experiments were conducted using the GIGAWORD dataset with 200K examples in training. For text summarization experiments, the GIGAWORD dataset with 200K examples was used. An encoder-decoder sequence-to-sequence architecture with bidirectional RNN encoder and attention-based RNN decoder was implemented in PyTorch-Texar. Models were trained for 20 epochs with internal layers of dimensionality 256 and dropout rate of 0.2. Rouge 1, 2, and L scores were used for evaluation. The results in Table 1 demonstrate that word2ket can achieve a 16-fold reduction in trainable parameters with a slight drop in Rouge scores. On the other hand, word2ketXS is significantly more space-efficient, offering a 34,000 fold reduction in parameters while maintaining similar scores. Additionally, word2ketXS provides over 100-fold space reduction with only a minor decrease in Rouge scores. In the evaluation, word2ketXS offers a 34,000 fold reduction in trainable parameters with a slight decrease in Rouge scores. The study also explores German-English machine translation using the IWSLT2014 dataset, employing BLEU score for performance measurement with various embedding dimensions. The study evaluated word2ketXS, which offers a 34,000 fold reduction in trainable parameters with a slight decrease in Rouge scores. They explored embedding dimensions ranging from 100 to 8000 and observed a drop in BLEU scores with decreasing parameter space. Additionally, they used the DrQA model for the Stanford Question Answering Dataset, achieving a test set F1 score after training for 40 epochs. The study evaluated word2ketXS for parameter reduction and observed a drop in F1 score with increased tensor order. The study evaluated word2ketXS for parameter reduction, resulting in a 5-fold space saving rate with a slight drop in F1 score. Training time increased for tensors of order 2 and 4, reaching 7.4 and 9 hours respectively, on a single NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU. Model training dynamics remained largely unchanged despite the increased training time. The study evaluated word2ketXS for parameter reduction, resulting in a 5-fold space saving rate with a slight drop in F1 score. Training time increased on a machine with 2 Intel Xeon Gold 6146 CPUs and 384 GB RAM. The memory footprint of the word embedding part of the model decreased, impacting input layers of the encoder and decoder in sequence-to-sequence models. During inference, embedding and other layers dominate the memory footprint of the model. During training, the memory footprint is dominated by activations in all layers, which are needed for calculating gradients. Models like BERT, GPT-2, RoBERTa, and Sparse Transformers require hundreds of millions of parameters to work effectively. In RoBERTa BASE, 30% of the parameters are for word embeddings.softmax activation is not compressed by our method. During training, memory footprint is dominated by activations needed for calculating gradients. To decrease memory requirements for networks like BERT, GPT-2, RoBERTa, and Sparse Transformers, approaches like dictionary learning and word embedding clustering have been proposed. Bit encoding has also been used to lower space requirements for word embeddings. Recent approaches have been proposed to lower space requirements for word embeddings, including dictionary learning, word embedding clustering, and bit encoding. Additionally, methods for compressing models for low-memory inference and training have been explored, such as pruning, quantization, sparsity, and low numerical precision techniques. Fourier-based approximation methods have been used in approximating matrices, but none can match the space saving rates achieved by word2ketXS. Bit encoding methods are limited to a space saving rate of at most 32 for 32-bit architectures. Other methods, such as parameter sharing or PCA, offer higher saving rates but are limited by vocabulary size and embedding dimensionality. Word2ketXS achieves unmatched space saving rates compared to Fourier-based approximation methods. Parameter sharing or PCA can offer higher saving rates but are limited by vocabulary size and embedding dimensionality.
