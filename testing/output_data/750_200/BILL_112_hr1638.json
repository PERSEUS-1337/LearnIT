    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Dollar Bill Act of 2011\". Congress acknowledges the power to regulate currency and delegate it to the Federal Reserve System. The value of the US dollar has significantly decreased compared to gold, oil, and foreign currencies. The value of the United States dollar has become unstable and uncertain, affecting the economy by increasing the cost of capital and risks. The Federal Reserve System has not provided a stable value for the dollar. An unstable dollar has negative effects on the economy, including increasing the cost of capital, risks for long-term investments, and corporate income tax rates. It also reduces real earnings for American workers, the value of financial assets, pension plans, and retirement accounts. An unstable dollar damages the economic and political standing of the United States, causing anxiety and uncertainty in financial markets and among the public. SEC. 3. DIRECTIVES TO THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is directed to make the value of the U.S. dollar equal to the price of gold on the COMEX exchange and maintain it at that level. They are also instructed not to use indirect open market operations in regulating the dollar's value. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System will use banking and regulatory powers to maintain stable financial markets during the transition to a defined value for the US dollar. Effective January 1, 2011, entities can expense 100 percent of capital investment for tax purposes in the year of investment. The Congressional Budget Office will calculate the impact of tax changes on Federal revenues in a present value basis, similar to the Social Security Trustees. This includes considering the acceleration of first-year expensing of capital investment without changing total depreciation amounts. Taxpayers take depreciation based on investments, while businesses historically earn higher returns on capital investments than government bond interest rates. SEC. 6 of the Act states that in case of conflict with the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978, the provisions of this Act will prevail. SEC. 7 removes the Federal Reserve Bank's authority to pay earnings on reserves. Section 19(b)(12) of the Federal Reserve Act is amended to remove the Federal Reserve Bank's authority to pay earnings on reserves."
