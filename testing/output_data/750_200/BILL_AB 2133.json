    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature emphasizes the importance of improving occupational health and safety for family child care providers to protect both providers and the children in their care. Family child care providers face occupational health and safety hazards such as toxic chemicals, illness, stress, and physical strain. They have musculoskeletal injury rates similar to industrial workers. Since they lack workers' compensation insurance, it is crucial for them and the children in their care to receive proper training to prevent injuries and illnesses on the job. Section 1596.86 of the Health and Safety Code is being amended to address these concerns. Section 1596.86 of the Health and Safety Code is being amended to require the annual publication of lists of licensed child day care facilities, excluding small family day care homes. The lists will include facility services, licensed capacity, and licensing information. Additionally, the department will protect the privacy of small family day care homes by preventing the use of lists containing personal information. The amendment to Section 1596.86 of the Health and Safety Code requires the annual publication of lists of licensed child day care facilities, excluding small family day care homes. Personal information of small family day care homes will be protected, except for necessary purposes like licensing administration and child placement. Names and addresses may be provided to specific agencies funded by the State Department of Education. The entity selected to provide trainings under Section 1596.864 includes family day care organizations and specialized health care service plans licensed under the Knox-Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975. They offer employee assistance program services with child care referral services. Parents can request names and contact information of local small family day care providers for day care services. The department, in consultation with the Child Development Division of the State Department of Education, will adopt regulations on the confidentiality of information for small family day care homes. These regulations will ensure referral only to licensed homes in good standing. Violators may be denied access to information and reported to appropriate departments. Section 1596.864 of the Health and Safety Code defines \"family child care provider\" as either a licensed family day care home provider or a person providing child care under a publicly funded program exempt from licensing, excluding relatives of the children in care. A publicly funded child care program subsidizes early learning and care for children, administered by various state departments or agencies, excluding the K-12 public education system. A family child care provider must attend a two-hour training on occupational health and safety risks specific to the child care profession to protect their own health and safety and that of the children in their care. The State Department of Social Services may establish a schedule for family child care providers to complete training within four years or three months of becoming a provider. Training includes identifying and minimizing risks like chemical and biological hazards. In a child care setting, risks such as chemical and biological hazards, infectious diseases, and physical hazards/stress need to be identified and minimized. Providers can participate in small and large group discussions and learn from current child care professionals. Presentations by organizations promoting collective engagement to improve the child care system and provide training opportunities may be approved by the department. The Department of Industrial Relations selects a training entity through a competitive process to provide occupational health and safety training to family child care providers. The selected entity must have experience in this training, train providers to give the required training to others, and provide updates on health and safety matters to trained providers. The Department of Industrial Relations selects a training entity through a competitive process to provide occupational health and safety training to family child care providers. The entity will develop the curriculum with input from providers, which will be reviewed and approved by the Division of Occupational Safety and Health. The State Department of Social Services will administer the contract with the selected entity. Periodic updates on health and safety matters will be provided to trained providers. The State Department of Social Services will oversee the contract for training family child care providers. The training will be coordinated with other requirements to reduce provider burden. The State Department of Social Services will provide lists of family child care providers attending training to the training entity monthly. The entity will use this information to update providers on health and safety issues. Providers can request to have their personal information removed from the lists before release. The department and selected training entity must comply with the Dymally-Alatorre Bilingual Services Act, providing training materials in non-English languages. This section will be effective on July 1, 2017. This section of the act will be effective on July 1, 2017 and does not require reimbursement according to the California Constitution. It pertains to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes or infractions. The Legislature aims to establish the rights of child care providers in alternative payment programs to report violations to the State Department of Education. A new section 8221.6 is added to the Education Code. Section 8221.6 of the Education Code allows licensed or license-exempt child care providers receiving payment through alternative payment programs to file complaints for non-compliance with laws or regulations. Complaints can be filed through the Uniform Complaint Procedures outlined in the California Code of Regulations. Alternative payment programs are operated by contractors reimbursed under specific contract types. The California Alternative Payment Program, CalWORKs Stage 2 Program, CalWORKs Stage 3 Program, and Migrant Alternative Payment Program operate under specific contracts contingent upon annual budget appropriations or statutes."
