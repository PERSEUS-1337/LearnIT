Congress finds that there are millions of cases of waterborne diseases in the United States each year due to inadequately treated sewage, leading to various gastrointestinal and respiratory illnesses. Between 1,800,000 and 3,500,000 Americans get sick annually from swimming in contaminated waters, leading to economic losses estimated at $28 billion. Sewer systems often fail to monitor or report overflows, causing significant health and financial impacts. Many sewer systems do not monitor or report overflows, leading to public health risks and economic losses estimated at $28 billion annually. Improved monitoring and reporting could prevent millions of Americans from getting sick each year. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to define \"sanitary sewer overflow\" as an overflow of wastewater from a sanitary sewer system, excluding combined sewer overflows and wastewater backups caused by blockages in privately owned building laterals. The term \"sanitary sewer overflow\" is defined as an overflow of wastewater from a sanitary sewer system, excluding combined sewer overflows and wastewater backups caused by blockages in privately owned building laterals. It includes overflows or releases of wastewater reaching waters of the United States, those that do not reach waters of the United States, and wastewater backups into buildings caused by blockages or flow conditions in a sanitary sewer other than a building lateral. SEC. 4. MONITORING, REPORTING, AND PUBLIC NOTIFICATION OF SEWER OVERFLOWS. Section 402 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to require publicly owned treatment works to implement a system to alert them of sanitary sewer overflows within a year of the enactment of the subsection. The amended Section 402 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act mandates publicly owned treatment works to have a system in place for timely notification of sanitary sewer overflows to the public and relevant authorities within 24 hours of awareness. Publicly owned treatment works must immediately notify public health authorities and other affected entities of any sanitary sewer overflow that may endanger human health, providing a report within 24 hours of becoming aware of the overflow. The owner or operator of a facility must report any overflow within 24 hours and provide a written report within 5 days detailing the overflow's magnitude, duration, suspected cause, and steps taken to prevent recurrence. The facility must report all sanitary sewer overflows to waters of the United States on its monthly discharge monitoring report, detailing steps taken to reduce, eliminate, prevent recurrence, and mitigate the impact of the overflow. The facility must report all sanitary sewer overflows to waters of the United States on its monthly discharge monitoring report, detailing steps taken to reduce, eliminate, prevent recurrence, and mitigate the impact of the overflow. Additionally, they must report the total number of overflows in a calendar year, including details of wastewater released, overflow duration, location, affected receiving waters, cleanup responses, and actions to prevent future overflows. The State must report annually to the EPA on the details of sanitary sewer overflows that occurred within the State, as required by federal regulations. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to include requirements for monitoring, reporting, and public notification of sanitary sewer overflows. Additionally, authorization of appropriations is set at $2.2 billion for each fiscal year from 2004 to 2008."
