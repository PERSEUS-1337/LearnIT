    "content": "The PACT Act requires remote retailers of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to pay state and local taxes before delivering goods. Three retailers challenged the Act, claiming it violates the Due Process Clause. The Supreme Court in Quill Corp. v. North Dakota emphasized the need for a connection between a state and the transaction being taxed. In Red Earth LLC v. United States and Gordon v. Holder, federal district courts granted preliminary injunctions concluding that the PACT Act's requirement for remote retailers to pay state and local taxes violates due process by not requiring minimum contacts. The PACT Act's requirement for remote retailers to pay state and local taxes violates due process as it lacks minimum contacts. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the preliminary injunction in Red Earth, while the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit will review the injunction in Gordon. In Musser's Inc. v. United States, the federal district court rejected the due process argument, stating that the PACT Act is a federal statute requiring compliance with state and local laws. The court upheld the PACT Act as a federal statute requiring compliance with state and local laws, stating that it does not violate due process. The plaintiff had minimum contacts with jurisdictions due to its online business transactions. The Supreme Court emphasized that Congress cannot authorize violations of the Due Process Clause. The constitutionality of the PACT Act depends on minimum contacts for remote retailers, as Congress cannot authorize violations of the Due Process Clause. In Quill, the Supreme Court noted that minimum contacts determine jurisdiction for out-of-state defendants. The Supreme Court has stated that minimum contacts determine jurisdiction for out-of-state defendants, focusing on the retailer's purposeful activities in the forum state. Additionally, the Court emphasized that tax paid must be related to the state's values, and the state must provide something in return. The PACT Act aims to regulate remote sellers of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. The PACT Act requires remote sellers of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to comply with the same laws as brick and mortar retailers, increase tax collection, deter smuggling, and reduce youth access to cheap tobacco products. It deems interstate sales as intrastate sales to boost tax revenue. The PACT Act deems interstate sales as intrastate sales, requiring compliance with all state and local laws applicable to sales of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. It also mandates remote sellers to pay all taxes to state and local governments before delivery. The PACT Act mandates that remote sellers pay all applicable taxes to state and local governments before delivering cigarettes or smokeless tobacco, in compliance with the Commerce Clause and Due Process Clause. The PACT Act mandates remote sellers to pay taxes to state and local governments in compliance with the Commerce Clause and Due Process Clause, which prohibit undue burdens on interstate commerce and unauthorized taxes on foreign businesses without sufficient connection to the state. Congress can authorize state activities that comply with the Commerce Clause but not the Due Process Clause, making them analytically distinct. Remote retailers have challenged the PACT Act under the Due Process Clause. The PACT Act mandates remote sellers to pay taxes in compliance with the Commerce Clause and Due Process Clause. Remote retailers have challenged the Act under the Due Process Clause, citing the Supreme Court's opinion in Quill regarding physical presence for state taxation. The Supreme Court upheld state taxation of out-of-state businesses, citing jurisdiction over out-of-state defendants in Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz. Physical presence is not necessary for jurisdiction if there is a business relationship with the state. In modern commercial life, business conducted solely by mail and wire communications across state lines can establish jurisdiction, even without physical presence. The Supreme Court has rejected the idea that lack of physical contacts can defeat personal jurisdiction if a commercial actor's efforts are directed towards residents of another State. In Quill, the Court found that sending a \"deluge of catalogues\" to North Dakota residents established jurisdiction. In Quill, the Court established that sending a \"deluge of catalogues\" to North Dakota residents indicated purposeful direction of activities, satisfying the minimum contacts requirement for personal jurisdiction. In Red Earth, Seneca Nation members sought to block the PACT Act's tax requirement on their tobacco sales, arguing it violates Due Process Clause by subjecting them to taxing jurisdictions without minimum contacts. The United States argued that the PACT Act did not violate due process because minimum contacts were established through plaintiffs' websites and shipping goods into taxing jurisdictions. However, the district court disagreed, noting that not all plaintiffs had websites and that the websites were passive. The PACT Act applies to all plaintiffs, regardless of whether they have websites or not. The court determined that passive websites, which only provide information and require purchases to be completed offline, do not establish minimum contacts. The court rejected the argument that a shipment into a state satisfies the minimum contacts requirement for imposing taxes on an out-of-state seller. The court also dismissed the idea that each sale creates the necessary minimum contacts, stating that existing cases suggest otherwise. The court rejected the argument that a single sale creates enough minimum contacts for jurisdiction, citing that existing cases suggest otherwise. The court noted that a single sale may not be sufficient to subject a seller to foreign jurisdiction, as seen in previous cases. The court criticized the PACT Act for broadening jurisdiction without considering Due Process constraints, suggesting it seeks to bypass due process requirements. The PACT Act was criticized for attempting to bypass due process constraints by broadening jurisdiction. The district court granted a preliminary injunction to the plaintiffs, which was challenged by the government in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The Court of Appeals questioned whether Congress can require a vendor to submit to the taxing jurisdiction of any state without considering the vendor's contact with the state. The PACT Act requires a seller to collect state and local taxes based on a single delivery, but the Supreme Court has never determined if a single sale is sufficient for due process. Previous court decisions suggest that a single sale may not meet due process requirements. The court has not definitively ruled on whether a single sale into a state is enough for due process under the PACT Act. Previous decisions imply it may not be sufficient. In a case involving a tobacco retailer operating nationwide, the district court's decision on a close legal question led to a preliminary injunction being granted. The plaintiff in Musser's sought a preliminary injunction under the PACT Act, claiming that retailers are required to pay state and local taxes without minimum contacts with the jurisdictions, violating the Due Process Clause. The district court denied the injunction, stating that the taxes are imposed by Congress, not unilaterally by a state. The PACT Act requires retailers to pay state and local taxes imposed by Congress, not unilaterally by a state, in compliance with federal regulations on interstate commerce. The court's analysis found that interstate businesses must comply with state and local laws as a condition of engaging in interstate commerce, without offending due process. Congress has the authority to regulate interstate commerce and require compliance with state laws. The court concluded that the plaintiff had minimum contacts in all 50 states due to the interactive nature of its website, using the sliding scale approach from Zippo Mfg. Co. v. Zippo Dot Com, Inc. for personal jurisdiction over out-of-state businesses. Personal jurisdiction is proper when there is knowing and repeated transmission of computer files with residents of a foreign jurisdiction over the Internet. Passive websites that only provide information to users in foreign jurisdictions do not warrant personal jurisdiction. Interactive websites where users can exchange information with the host computer fall in the middle ground, with jurisdiction determined by the level of interactivity and commercial nature of the exchange. In Musser's case, personal jurisdiction was established based on the level of interactivity and commercial nature of the exchange of information on the website. The court found that selling products and conducting business through the Internet in a state was sufficient contact to satisfy due process concerns. Under the court's reasoning, minimum contacts can be satisfied by a single sale through an interactive website. Gordon, a member of the Seneca Nation of Indians, owns a store and a telephone order business selling tobacco products. He sought a preliminary injunction against the PACT Act's requirement to pay the state. Gordon, a member of the Seneca Nation of Indians, owns a store and a telephone order business selling tobacco products. He sought a preliminary injunction against the PACT Act's requirement to pay state and local taxes, arguing it violates due process. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit reversed the district court's denial of Gordon's motion, deeming it timely. The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the case to the district court, stating that the motion was timely. They noted that Due Process and Commerce Clause issues should be considered separately, even if Congress authorizes state levies based on minimum contacts. National legislation that allows burdens on interstate commerce cannot violate Due Process principles of \"fair play and substantial justice.\" The Quill case addressed the issue of interstate commerce burdens and Due Process principles. The government argued that federal law only requires minimum contacts with the United States, not individual states, in response to a due process claim. The government argued that Gordon only needs minimum contacts with the United States, not individual states, for jurisdiction. Each of Gordon's tobacco sales into a state satisfies minimum contacts with that state. The court distinguished cases where interstate businesses were not subject to specific state jurisdiction due to compliance with federal laws. The court found that the PACT Act imposes a new duty on delivery sellers to ensure state and local taxes are paid, different from cases where compliance with federal laws exempted businesses from state jurisdiction. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit emphasized that Congress cannot authorize violations of the Due Process Clause. The court discussed the opinion in Musser's regarding the PACT Act and its impact on interstate commerce and the Due Process Clause. The court rejected the government's argument on minimum contacts before reviewing seminal due process cases. The court reviewed seminal due process cases setting forth personal jurisdiction law, including International Shoe Co. v. Washington and Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, before addressing the government's argument on minimum contacts. The court referenced Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, stating that personal jurisdiction can be established if a commercial actor's efforts are purposefully directed towards residents of another State. The Supreme Court's opinion in Burger King emphasized that jurisdiction is proper when the defendant has engaged in significant activities within a State or has created continuing obligations with residents of the forum State. The district court referenced Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, stating that personal jurisdiction can be established if a commercial actor's efforts are purposefully directed towards residents of another State. It noted that a single act creating a substantial connection with the forum can support jurisdiction, but acts with only an attenuated affiliation are not sufficient for foreseeable litigation in the forum. The district court emphasized that personal jurisdiction can be established if a commercial actor's efforts are purposefully directed towards residents of another State. Acts with only an attenuated affiliation with the forum are not sufficient for foreseeable litigation. The focus on foreseeability gives predictability to the legal system. The district court emphasized that personal jurisdiction can be established if a commercial actor's efforts are purposefully directed towards residents of another State, providing predictability to the legal system. Quill's due process challenge required a definite link between a state and the person, property, or transaction it seeks to tax. The Supreme Court found that Quill's mail order business had minimum contacts with the taxing State. In Quill, the Court found that Quill's mail order business had minimum contacts with North Dakota sufficient to meet the requirement of due process because there was no question that Quill purposefully directed its activities at North Dakota residents, and that the use tax is related to the benefits Quill receives from access to the State. The district court found that the Quill standard was not met in Gordon. The court in Gordon found that the Quill standard was not met, as Gordon's business did not purposefully avail itself of the economic market of the states where it sells products. The district court also did not find a rational connection between the tax on Gordon's products and the values of the taxing state. This requirement, as stated in MeadWestvaco Corp. v. Illinois Dept. of Revenue, depends on whether the state's taxing power aligns with fiscal concerns. The court in MeadWestvaco Corp. v. Illinois Dept. of Revenue found that the PACT Act may violate due process as it does not show a clear connection between the state's taxing power and the benefits received by the taxpayer. The court concluded that Gordon has a likelihood of success in his claim that due process is not satisfied by a single sale. The court found that the PACT Act may violate due process by subjecting out-of-state businesses to state taxation without minimum contacts, potentially not meeting the requirements of the Due Process Clause. The courts in Red Earth and Gordon analyzed the constitutionality of the PACT Act under the Due Process Clause, questioning state taxation of retailers without minimum contacts. The opinion in Musser's may conflate the Commerce Clause and due process analyses, but it remains unclear if a single sale into a jurisdiction satisfies due process. Higher courts may not definitively conclude that a single sale into a jurisdiction satisfies the due process requirement of minimum contacts, as noted in the Red Earth case."
