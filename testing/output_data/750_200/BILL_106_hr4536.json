    "content": "Title X of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include a new section called \"Physical Education for Progress Act.\" This part aims to provide grants and contracts to local educational agencies to enhance physical education programs for students from kindergarten to 12th grade. Congress finds that physical education is crucial for children's development, improving their health, self-esteem, relationships, behavior, and independence. Children who participate in high quality daily physical education programs tend to be healthier and more physically fit. The percentage of overweight young people has more than doubled in the 30 years before 1999, with low activity levels contributing to obesity. Obesity-related diseases cost the US economy over $100 billion annually, and inactivity and poor diet lead to at least 300,000 deaths each year in the US. Physically fit adults have reduced risk factors for heart attacks and stroke. Children are not as active as they should be, with fewer than 1 in 4 getting enough vigorous activity daily. Surgeon General's 1996 Report recommends daily physical education for all students from kindergarten to grade 12. The Surgeon General's 1996 Report and the Centers for Disease Control recommend daily physical education for all students from kindergarten to grade 12. Despite a resolution passed by Congress in 1987, little progress has been made in providing high-quality physical education programs for all children. Despite recommendations for daily physical education for all students from kindergarten to grade 12, little progress has been made in providing quality physical education programs. It is essential for students to have the opportunity to participate in physical education to develop health-related fitness, physical competence, and cognitive understanding about physical activity for adopting healthy lifestyles. Students should also have the chance to achieve the goals set by Healthy People 2000 and Healthy People 2010. \"SEC. 10999D. PROGRAM AUTHORIZED.\" The Secretary can award grants to local educational agencies for physical education programs for K-12 students, including equipment, curriculum development, and teacher training. \"SEC. 10999E. APPLICATIONS; PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS.\" Each local educational agency must submit an application to the Secretary outlining a plan to enhance physical education programs in schools to meet national goals or state standards. The goals include facilitating achievement of national physical education goals and may include specific curriculum requirements. The curriculum of physical education programs may include fitness education, motor skills instruction, and cognitive concepts to support lifelong healthy lifestyles. Physical education programs aim to develop cognitive concepts about motor skills, physical fitness, social skills, and healthy eating habits. Teachers in this field are encouraged to engage in professional development to stay updated on research and trends. The text chunk discusses the importance of professional development for physical education teachers to stay updated on research and trends in the field. It also mentions that extracurricular activities like team sports and ROTC programs are not considered part of the curriculum for physical education programs. The Secretary ensures equitable distribution of grants and contracts between urban and rural local educational agencies, as well as between those serving large and small student populations. Private school and home-schooled students are also addressed in the text. \"An application for funds under this part may include private school and home-schooled students in activities. A report is required for continued funding.\" \"An annual report is required for continued funding of multiyear grants or contracts under this part. The report must detail activities conducted and show progress towards goals or meeting State standards for physical education. Additionally, a report to Congress is also mandated.\" The Secretary must submit a report to Congress by June 1, 2003, detailing programs assisted under this part, their success in improving physical fitness, and recommendations for their continuation and improvement. Additionally, no more than 5% of grant funds can be used for administrative costs, and the federal share should supplement, not supplant, funding. The Federal share for projects under this part is capped at 90% for the first year and 75% for subsequent years. Funds must supplement, not replace, other available Federal, State, and local funds for physical education activities. Authorization of appropriations is also addressed. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2000 to 2004 totaling $30,000,000 for 2000, $70,000,000 for 2001, and $100,000,000 for each year from 2002 to 2004 to support physical education activities."
