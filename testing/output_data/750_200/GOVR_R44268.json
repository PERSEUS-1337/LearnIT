    "content": "Operation Ranch Hand was a U.S. military program during the Vietnam War that sprayed millions of gallons of herbicides, including Agent Orange, over southern Vietnam. This led to the contamination of areas like Bien Hoa, Danang, and Phu Cat with TCDD, a toxic and carcinogenic chemical. Environmental surveys in Vietnam have identified dioxin \"hot spots\" at airbases like Bien Hoa, Danang, and Phu Cat, contaminated with TCDD above acceptable levels. The A Luoi Valley, a key segment of the Ho Chi Minh Trail, was heavily sprayed and is another identified \"hot spot.\" Recent U.S. response to the environmental damage and health issues caused by Agent Orange in Vietnam has been noted. The U.S. response to environmental damage and health problems caused by Agent Orange in Vietnam has helped advance bilateral relations. President Obama pledged to continue efforts to address the legacy of war, including removing landmines and cleaning up dioxin at Bien Hoa Air Base. The United States is nearly done removing dioxin from Danang Airport and will assist in cleanup at Bien Hoa Air Base. Vietnam welcomed cooperation for successful dioxin remediation at Danang Airport and the US committed to helping with cleanup at Bien Hoa Air Base. The Trump Administration continues to provide assistance to address the Agent Orange/dioxin issue in Vietnam. The Trump Administration has committed to assisting Vietnam with the Agent Orange/dioxin issue. Progress has been made at Da Nang Airport, and collaboration is planned for Bien Hoa Airport. Under Secretary of State Thomas Shannon and Senior Lieutenant General Nguyen Phuong Nam celebrated this cooperation on November 10, 2017. The completion of environmental remediation at Danang Airport was celebrated by Under Secretary of State Thomas Shannon and Senior Lieutenant General Nguyen Phuong Nam on November 10, 2017. A Memorandum of Intent was signed on January 23, 2018, to begin the dioxin decontamination process at Bien Hoa. Congress has allocated $254.8 million for Agent Orange/dioxin environmental cleanup and health programs in Vietnam since 2007. The legislation has appropriated separate amounts for environmental remediation and health programs in Vietnam affected by Agent Orange or dioxin contamination. The actual amount available for assistance may be less than specified due to provisions of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. The 115th Congress also allocated funds for these purposes under Section 1052 of the John S. McCain Act. The 115th Congress authorized the transfer of funds for the Bien Hoa dioxin cleanup in Vietnam from the Department of Defense's \"Operation and Maintenance, Defense-wide\" account to the Secretary of State for use by USAID. The funds are allocated under the State Department's Economic Support Fund account. The funds for environmental remediation and health programs in Vietnam have been allocated under the State Department's Economic Support Fund and Development Assistance accounts, respectively. The State Department has delegated responsibility for fund administration to USAID, focusing on cleanup at the Danang airport and health programs. Most of the environmental remediation efforts in Vietnam have focused on cleaning up the Danang airport, with funds also used for disability support programs. Cleanup at the airport is complete, and joint dioxin removal operations are planned at the airbase in Bien Hoa. Discussions are ongoing between U.S. and Vietnamese officials on addressing health and disability issues related to dioxin exposure. The State Department has administered the programs funded by the allocated funds. The Vietnamese government created Office 33 to oversee policies on Agent Orange and dioxin, with representatives from various ministries. The State Department and USAID administer programs funded by allocated funds for environmental remediation and disability support in Vietnam. Office 33 in Vietnam oversees policies on Agent Orange and dioxin, with representatives from multiple ministries. Congressional interest focuses on allocating funds for environmental remediation and health programs in areas affected by Agent Orange. The 110th Congress allocated funds for environmental remediation of dioxin \"hot spots\" and health programs in Vietnam affected by Agent Orange. Congressional oversight is focused on ensuring effective use of funds by the State Department and USAID. The 110th Congress allocated $3 million for dioxin remediation and health programs in Vietnam affected by Agent Orange. The State Department decided to handle the funds through USAID, setting a precedent for future appropriations. The 111th Congress allocated a total of $18 million for dioxin cleanup in Vietnam and related health services. This included $3 million in March 2009, $3 million in December 2009, and $12 million in July 2010. The funds were handled by USAID, setting a precedent for future appropriations. In addition to previous allocations, Congress passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2010 (P.L. 111-117) with $3 million for dioxin cleanup in Vietnam. The Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2010 (P.L. 111-212) included $12 million for remediation at Danang Airport. State Department and USAID also allocated $1.9 million for environmental remediation at the airport in FY2010. The 113th Congress continued to appropriate funds for environmental remediation of Agent Orange/dioxin in Vietnam and related health services, as directed by the Senate report associated with the Department of State Appropriations Act. The 113th Congress appropriated funds for environmental remediation of Agent Orange/dioxin in Vietnam and related health services through various Acts, including the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 allocated $22.0 million for environmental remediation and $7.0 million for health and disability programs in areas affected by Agent Orange or dioxin contamination in Vietnam. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 allocated funds for health/disability activities and environmental remediation in areas affected by Agent Orange or dioxin contamination in Vietnam. Specifically, $7.5 million is for Vietnam health/disability programs and $15.0 million for environmental remediation of dioxin. Additionally, funds were appropriated for remediation of dioxin contaminated sites and health/disability programs under different headings. The 114th Congress allocated funds for environmental remediation and health/disability programs in Vietnam to address the effects of Agent Orange and dioxin contamination. Specifically, $25 million was designated for environmental cleanup and $7 million for health/disability programs to assist individuals with severe mobility and cognitive disabilities. The 114th Congress allocated funds for environmental remediation and health/disability programs in Vietnam to address the effects of Agent Orange and dioxin contamination. Specifically, $25 million was designated for environmental cleanup and $7 million for health/disability programs to assist individuals with severe mobility and cognitive disabilities. The report emphasized the importance of implementing health/disability funds through Vietnamese organizations to maximize impact in the field. Funding for FY2017 was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31). Section 7043(h) states the allocation of funds for dioxin remediation. Section 7043(h) of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31) allocates funds for dioxin remediation in Vietnam, with $20 million for remediation activities and $10 million for health and disability programs in areas affected by Agent Orange. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 allocated funds for dioxin remediation in Vietnam and health programs for individuals with disabilities in areas affected by Agent Orange. The Act now allows assistance to the Government of Vietnam for the first time in funding dioxin environmental remediation. In March 2018, the 115th Congress allocated funds for dioxin remediation in Vietnam and health programs for individuals with disabilities in areas affected by Agent Orange. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 provided not less than $20 million for remediation of dioxin contaminated sites and not less than $10 million for health and disability programs in affected areas. The 116th Congress allocated funds for health and disability programs in areas contaminated with dioxin, including assistance for individuals with severe mobility impairment or cognitive disabilities. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 provided not less than $20 million for dioxin remediation in Vietnam and may be used for assistance for the Government of Vietnam. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 allocated funds for health and disability programs in areas contaminated with dioxin, including assistance for individuals with severe mobility impairment or cognitive disabilities. The State Department designated USAID as the responsible agency for the funds for Agent Orange/dioxin-related activities in Vietnam. USAID has obligated 81% of the $127 million appropriated for FY2011-FY2017 for environmental remediation projects as of May 2018. USAID has obligated a significant portion of funds allocated for environmental remediation and health- and disability-related services for fiscal years 2007 to 2017. The manner in which USAID has obligated the funds has been a concern for Congress. Since FY2007, Congress has designated funds for health and disability services near Agent Orange/dioxin-contaminated areas, drawing attention for slower utilization compared to environmental remediation funds. In FY2007, Congress allocated funds for health and disability services near Agent Orange/dioxin-contaminated areas in Vietnam, with specific appropriations for environmental remediation at Danang Airport and related health activities in nearby communities. The conferees recommended allocating at least $5,000,000 for health/disability activities in Agent Orange-contaminated areas in Vietnam. It is unclear if the State Department and USAID have consistently followed this guidance. Funds for health and disability services were allocated to programs in Danang from FY2007 to FY2009, but from FY2010 to FY2013, funds were largely obligated to Development Alternatives, Inc. (DAI) for disability support. From FY2010 to FY2013, health and disability funds were mainly allocated to Development Alternatives, Inc. (DAI) for a disability support program. This program aimed to improve the lives of persons with disabilities without specific mention of Agent Orange/dioxin \"hot spots.\" USAID returned to directly allocating funds for health and disability services in smaller amounts from FY2014 onwards after consultations with relevant parties. Since FY2014, USAID has shifted to smaller direct program funding for health- and disability-related services in Vietnam, increasing outreach to Vietnamese nongovernmental organizations. One key project funded by congressional appropriations is the environmental remediation project at Danang Airport, which has faced delays since its inception in 2008. The environmental remediation project at Danang Airport, initiated in 2008, faced delays, increased material for decontamination, and rising costs. USAID aimed to finish by October 2013, but completion was in August 2017, with material to decontaminate rising to 90,000 m3. The decontamination project at Danang Airport faced delays and increased costs. The amount of material to be decontaminated rose to 90,000 m3, with an additional 60,000 m3 of \"lower risk material.\" The estimated cost of the project increased to over $110 million. Soil samples at Danang airbase showed high levels of TCDD toxic equivalents, exceeding international standards. Work on the project began in December 2009. Seventeen out of 23 soil samples at Danang airbase exceeded the international maximum standard of 1.0 ppb. The decontamination project began in December 2009 with USAID and Office 33 as implementing agencies under a $6.0 million MOU with Vietnam's Ministry of Natural Resources and the Environment. In FY2007 and FY2009, $6.0 million in funds were allocated for activities at Danang airport, including a grant for an environmentally sound engineering approach to dioxin containment. USAID completed an Environmental Assessment in June 2010, recommending thermal desorption to decontaminate 61,700 m3 of material at a cost of $33.7 million, with potential cost increases due to implementation challenges. The remediation project at Danang airport was estimated to cost $33.7 million and would take two years to complete. USAID and Vietnam's Ministry of National Defence signed a Memorandum of Intent in December 2010 to start the project in 2011 and finish by October 2013. The Prime Minister approved the project in February 2011, and USAID awarded contracts for environmental remediation in July 2012. In May 2011, USAID issued RFP #486-11-028 for the environmental remediation project at Danang airport. Contracts were awarded in July 2012 to CDM Smith for project oversight and Tetra Tech, Inc. for excavation and construction. The project was launched in August 2012, with onsite work starting on August 20, 2012. An internal USAID audit in November 2014 revealed six contracts awarded for the project. An internal USAID audit in November 2014 showed that six contracts were awarded for the environmental assessment and remediation project at Danang airport, including an assessment of Bien Hoa airbase. The thermal desorption of contaminated soil was done in two phases due to the large amount of material involved. Phase 1 involved treating approximately 45,000 m3 of soil in a 70m x 100m area. The gradual heating of Phase 1, treating 45,000 m3 of soil in a 70m x 100m area, began in April 2014. Phase 1 cooling down started in April 2015 after removing over 95% of dioxin. Phase 2 excavation involved draining lakes and treating soil from November 2016 to August 2017. Weather delays impacted Danang airport decontamination progress. Progress on the decontamination of Danang airport was delayed due to weather conditions during Vietnam's rainy season, increased soil and sediment requiring decontamination, and issues with the secondary treatment facility. The excavation of 45,000 m3 of Phase 2 soil was completed in August 2017 after facing various challenges. The USAID's Office of Inspector General conducted an internal audit of an environmental remediation project in November 2014, highlighting potential risks like inclement weather and soil cooling delays. The audit recommended implementing a formal risk management plan due to inaccurate performance data provided by CDM. The audit conducted by USAID's Office of Inspector General recommended a formal risk management plan for the environmental remediation project. CDM was cited for inaccurate performance data and lack of training for Vietnamese officials. The completion of the Danang Airport project took longer and cost more than initially projected. USAID agreed with the audit's recommendations. The completed Danang Airport project took more than twice as long and cost more than three times as much as initially projected by USAID due to underestimating contamination. 162,500 cubic meters of soil were contaminated, not 72,900 as expected. Dioxin had percolated three meters deeper than anticipated. USAID utilized funds for health/disability activities in areas contaminated with dioxin. The U.S. government has provided over $60 million in assistance to disabled Vietnamese, regardless of the cause of the disability, including funds specifically appropriated for health services in areas near Agent Orange/dioxin-contaminated sites. The U.S. government has allocated funds for health services near Agent Orange/dioxin-contaminated sites to assist disabled Vietnamese. The State Department and USAID utilized these funds for grants to improve the quality of life for persons with disabilities in Danang. USAID approved a nationwide Persons with Disability Support Program in 2012. In 2012, USAID approved a three-year nationwide Persons with Disability Support Program (PDSP) to be implemented with Development Alternatives, Inc. (DAI) and Vietnam Assistance for the Handicapped (VNAH), focusing primarily on Danang. The program aimed to build on previous USAID assistance to people with disabilities in communities in Danang and include additional public health activities. The PDSP project, with a focus on Danang and other high-need areas, aimed to provide assistance to persons with disabilities through grants for health services, rehabilitation, vocational training, and community awareness. Funding was initially set at $9 million. The PDSP program, funded by USAID, provided assistance to persons with disabilities in Vietnam through various services and training. It operated in provinces heavily affected by Agent Orange during the Vietnam War, expanding to more areas over time. The USAID program in Vietnam provided grants to local partners and organizations, aiming to assist persons with disabilities in provinces affected by Agent Orange during the Vietnam War. The program expanded to Quang Nam, Tay Ninh, and Thua Thien-Hue, with a focus on fostering opportunities for vulnerable populations. USAID assistance in Vietnam aims to support vulnerable populations, including persons with disabilities, by providing direct assistance to improve health, independence, and participation in economic and social life. This includes funding for therapies and training in areas with high disability prevalence and poverty rates. USAID is providing assistance in Vietnam to support vulnerable populations, including persons with disabilities, in areas with high disability prevalence and poverty rates. The provinces of Binh Dinh, Binh Phuoc, Dong Nai, Quang Nam, Tay Ninh, Thai Binh, and Thua Thien-Hue have been identified for these programs. USAID will directly administer the new approach in consultation with Vietnamese agencies. Joint efforts are being made to clean up the dioxin \"hot spot\" at the Bien Hoa airbase after the successful environmental cleanup of Danang airport. The Vietnamese government and the U.S. have started exploring a cleanup of the dioxin \"hot spot\" at the Bien Hoa airbase, where high levels of contamination have been found. Mitigation measures have been taken to contain the dioxin contamination at Bien Hoa. The Vietnamese government has conducted mitigation measures to contain dioxin contamination at Bien Hoa airbase. A passive landfill was completed in 2009 to store contaminated soil. However, other dioxin \"hot spots\" at the airbase have not been addressed, leading to soil spreading into nearby water bodies. This will require additional treatment. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has been working with Office 33 and MONRE for five years to map out the dioxin contamination at Bien Hoa airbase, and develop a master plan for dioxin remediation. Approximately 250,000 m3 of soil would require decontamination with an estimated cost of at least $250 million. USAID contracted CDM International Inc. to conduct an environmental assessment of the Bien Hoa airbase for dioxin remediation alternatives. In September 2013, USAID contracted CDM International Inc. and Hatfield Consulting to assess dioxin remediation options at Bien Hoa airbase. The final report revealed 408,500 to 495,300 m3 of contaminated soils, with five treatment methods considered, costing up to $137 million. The estimated costs for dioxin remediation at Bien Hoa Airbase ranged from $137 million to $794 million, with potential variations of 40% less to 75% more. Over $3.7 million has been allocated for environmental assessment, and Vietnam's Ministry of National Defence has started infrastructure construction for decontamination work. In September 2017, Vietnam's Ministry of National Defence announced infrastructure construction for dioxin decontamination at Bien Hoa Airbase with a budget of $11.8 million. USAID and Vietnam's Ministry of National Defence signed a memorandum of intent on January 23, 2018, to begin the decontamination process. U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam Daniel J. Kritenbrink expressed eagerness to collaborate on this important initiative. At the MOI signing ceremony, J. Kritenbrink expressed eagerness to work with the Ministry of National Defence on the Bien Hoa airport remediation program. A $183 million aid agreement was signed between USAID and the Ministry for decontamination, projected to take 10 years at an estimated cost of $390 million. The Ministry of National Defence signed a memorandum with Shimizu Corporation to construct a decontamination factory at Bien Hoa airport. The factory will use a filtered sponge technique to decontaminate soil, capable of processing 40 tons per hour. This new technique is expected to be more cost-effective than previous methods used at Danang airport. U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis visited Bien Hoa airport on October 17, 2018, where he expressed America's commitment to remediate the former Agent Orange storage site. Congressional interest in Agent Orange/dioxin in Vietnam has focused on determining key issues. Congressional interest in Agent Orange/dioxin in Vietnam has focused on determining appropriate assistance for environmental damage and health effects, as well as oversight of assistance utilization by the State Department and USAID. Both the Obama and Trump Administrations have shown support for environmental remediation projects in Vietnam. The Trump Administration supports environmental remediation projects for Agent Orange and dioxin in Vietnam. The State Department requests funding for decontamination of dioxin \"hot spots\" in Vietnam from Congress. Funds are used for health and disability services in areas affected by Agent Orange, regardless of the cause. Programs are often conducted near known Agent Orange \"hot spots.\" The Obama Administration did not explicitly request funding for health and disability assistance programs in areas contaminated with Agent Orange or dioxin. However, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 continues to designate funds for health and disability services in these areas. The Victims of Agent Orange Relief Act of 2019 (H.R. 326) designates funds for health and disability programs in areas contaminated with Agent Orange and dioxin to assist individuals with severe mobility impairment or cognitive disabilities. The Victims of Agent Orange Relief Act of 2019 (H.R. 326) aims to provide assistance to individuals affected by exposure to Agent Orange, including medical and chronic care services, vocational training, and medical equipment. Covered individuals are defined as Vietnamese residents impacted by Agent Orange between 1961 and 1975 or their children. The Victims of Agent Orange Relief Act of 2019 (H.R. 326) aims to provide assistance to Vietnamese residents affected by exposure to Agent Orange between 1961 and 1975. The act includes provisions for medical services, vocational training, and assistance in repairing substandard homes. Additionally, it requires support for research on health issues related to Agent Orange exposure. The Victims of Agent Orange Relief Act of 2019 aims to provide assistance to individuals affected by Agent Orange exposure. It includes provisions for medical services, vocational training, and support for research on health issues related to Agent Orange. The act also requires assistance to institutions in Vietnam providing healthcare for affected individuals and remediation of areas with high levels of Agent Orange contamination. The Victims of Agent Orange Relief Act of 2019 requires reports from relevant secretaries on the implementation of the Act, including funding for environmental remediation and health services for those affected by Agent Orange exposure. Congress has overseen the utilization of appropriated funds for environmental remediation and health services in Agent Orange/dioxin-contaminated locations in Vietnam. Congressional oversight has focused on the rising cost of cleanup at Danang airport and the slow pace of fund obligation for health services by USAID. The estimated total cost of environmental remediation at Danang airport increased from $33.7 million in 2010 to $116 million. Congress is concerned about cost overruns and delays in the cleanup, as USAID plans a similar project at Bien Hoa airport with even more contaminated soil. Despite challenges, USAID has managed to continue the Danang airport project. USAID has faced challenges in utilizing funds for health services in areas contaminated with Agent Orange/dioxin. 63.5% of funds appropriated from FY2011 to FY2017 have been obligated, with a shifting approach from direct obligation to cooperative agreements. Observers question the effectiveness of USAID's management of health services funds. Some observers question the effectiveness of USAID's management of health services funds, as reflected in congressional dissatisfaction with State Department and USAID handling of previously appropriated funds for environmental remediation and health and disability services in Vietnam. Congress has included specific language in legislation indicating appropriations for these purposes. Congress has appropriated funds for environmental remediation and health services in Vietnam, with specific amounts usually detailed in accompanying reports or statements."
