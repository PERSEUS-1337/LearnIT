    "content": "In 1978, Congress enacted the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to address electronic surveillance abuses. FISA established the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to review government applications for electronic surveillance. Concerns arose in 2013 about the FISC's orders, leading to proposals to amend FISA or FISC practices. The report focuses on proposals to alter the process for selecting judges for the FISA courts, which are established to review government applications for electronic surveillance. Federal judges in Article III courts have life tenure and cannot have their salaries diminished during their terms in office. Federal judges in Article III courts have life tenure and their salaries cannot be diminished during their terms in office to ensure independence from political interference. The FISC, an Article III court established by Congress in FISA, can issue orders related to foreign intelligence investigations. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) can issue orders for electronic surveillance, physical searches, pen register/trap and trace devices, and access to business records upon application by a federal officer. The FISC Court of Review can review denials of applications. Judges serve seven-year terms and are designated by the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. The FISC and FISA Court of Review judges serve seven-year terms and are selected by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Some criticize the selection process as too partisan and argue against the sole authority of the Chief Justice in selecting judges. Several bills have been introduced in response to these criticisms. Several bills have been introduced in the 113th Congress to alter the process for selecting FISA judges, as critics argue that the current process is too partisan. Proposals include transferring selection authority to chief judges of circuit courts, allowing the President to choose FISA judges with Senate advice and consent, or giving this authority to congressional leadership. The 113th Congress introduced bills to change the selection process for FISA judges, aiming to reduce partisanship. Proposals include giving selection authority to chief judges of circuit courts or allowing the President to choose with Senate advice and consent. The issue of constitutionality arises with proposals to shift selection away from the Chief Justice, as expressed by the judicial branch in January 2014. The report examines the process of \"designation\" for federal judges to serve temporarily on another court without a separate appointment. It also discusses proposals to shift designation authority from the Chief Justice to other officials in different branches of government, raising questions about constitutionality under the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution governs the appointment of certain government officials, including principal officers like Judges of the Supreme Court who must be appointed by the President with Senate consent. The Supreme Court has ruled that all Article III circuit and district judges are also principal officers. If Congress expands the duties of an office requiring constitutional appointment, strict adherence to the Appointments Clause may not be necessary. The Supreme Court has ruled that if Congress expands the duties of an office requiring constitutional appointment, strict adherence to the Appointments Clause may not be necessary. In Weiss v. United States, military officers could serve on a military court without a second constitutional appointment if the additional duties are germane to their original government post. The Weiss Court ruled that Congress can increase the duties of an existing office without requiring a second constitutional appointment. This precedent allows federal judges to serve in related Article III capacities without violating the Appointments Clause. The Supreme Court has addressed the constitutionality of the designation process within the judicial branch. The Supreme Court has addressed the constitutionality of the designation process within the judicial branch, where Congress has long employed designations for Article III courts and vested the Chief Justice with authority to assign federal judges to serve on other federal courts, including specialized tribunals. The creation of the now-defunct Commerce Court is an example where the Chief Justice was given authority to designate federal judges to a special tribunal. The Commerce Court was established with judges appointed by the President and subsequent judges designated by the Chief Justice. This designation process became a model for specialized courts, like the FISA courts, with lower federal court judges also given designation authority. The Supreme Court has upheld these designations within the judicial branch. The Supreme Court has upheld designations within the judicial branch, as seen in McDowell v. United States where it was stated that the designation process does not infringe upon the executive power of appointment. District Courts are created by statute, and the jurisdiction of judges is under statutory control. The Supreme Court has upheld the designation process within the judicial branch, stating that it does not trespass upon the executive power of appointment. District Courts are created by statute, and the jurisdiction of judges is under statutory control. In Lamar v. United States, a constitutional challenge to the Chief Justice's designation authority was dismissed, with the Court rejecting the argument that it violated the Appointments Clause. The constitutionality of the designation of FISA judges has also been upheld in previous cases. The designation of FISA judges has been upheld as constitutional, with courts rejecting challenges based on the Appointments Clause. The process of judges being designated by the Chief Justice has been deemed valid, citing precedent for temporary assignments of lower federal judges. The court upheld the temporary assignment of district court judges by the Chief Justice, citing substantial precedent. The central issue is whether designation by certain individuals within different branches of government would be constitutionally permissible. The FISA Judge Selection Reform Act (S. 1460) proposes changes to the selection process for FISC judges, increasing the number from 11 to 13 with one designated from each judicial circuit. The Chief Justice would designate the district court judge proposed by the chief judge of the circuit with a vacancy. S. 1460 proposes changes to the selection process for FISC judges, increasing the number to 13 with one designated from each judicial circuit. The Chief Justice would designate the district court judge proposed by the chief judge of the circuit with a vacancy, with involvement from chief judges of the circuit courts and associate justices of the Supreme Court in the designation process. The Chief Justice would have the final authority in designating a judge to the FISA courts under the proposed changes. Judicial precedent suggests that allowing others within the judicial branch to make such designations could be constitutionally acceptable. The decision in McDowell emphasized Congress's control over where judges exercise jurisdiction. The McDowell Court emphasized Congress's control over where judges exercise jurisdiction, allowing for the designation of judges to serve on FISA courts. This principle is based on Congress's power to establish courts and the absence of constitutional restrictions on a District Judge's territorial authority. The McDowell Court ruling limits chief judges' authority to designate FISA court judges, with proposals to shift this authority to the President through the Presidential Appointment of FISA Court Judges Act (H.R. 2761). The Presidential Appointment of FISA Court Judges Act (H.R. 2761) proposes to authorize the President to \"designate\" judges for the FISC and FISA Court of Review, potentially constituting a second constitutional appointment. This could raise questions about the FISA courts' status as Article III courts. The FISA courts' status as Article III courts could be questioned due to the proposed Presidential Appointment of FISA Court Judges Act, which suggests a second constitutional appointment. While Article III judges have life tenure, FISA judges serve seven-year terms. However, precedent suggests that life tenure protects a judge's overall position on the federal judiciary rather than the specific court they are appointed to. A federal judge appointed to serve on the FISA courts for a fixed term does not lose their Article III status or protections. However, giving the President sole authority to select federal judges for the FISA courts could raise separation-of-powers concerns. The President's authority to appoint judges to the U.S. Sentencing Commission was upheld in Mistretta v. United States, despite concerns about separation of powers. The President cannot affect the tenure or compensation of Article III judges. The Court concluded that the President cannot affect the tenure or compensation of Article III judges, nor coerce them in their judicial duties. FISA judges, unlike those in Mistretta, exercise judicial powers on an Article III court. The selection of FISA judges by the President alone may raise separation-of-powers concerns if the President's power to remove judges from the FISA courts could compromise their impartiality. Proposals suggest vesting designation authority with congressional leadership, as seen in the FISA Court Accountability Act (H.R. 2586). The FISA Court Accountability Act (H.R. 2586) proposes allowing both the Chief Justice and congressional leadership to designate judges to the FISC and FISA Court of Review. This raises concerns under the Appointments Clause and separation-of-powers principles, as Congress does not have the authority to directly select appointees with significant authority. The FISA Court Accountability Act (H.R. 2586) proposes allowing congressional leadership to designate judges to the FISC and FISA Court of Review, which may raise legal concerns under the principles of I.N.S. v. Chadha regarding legislative acts altering legal rights without proper approval."
