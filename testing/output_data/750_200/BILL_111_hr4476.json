    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Equity in Government Compensation Act of 2010\". Congressional findings are also included in the Act. The Congress finds that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, privately owned but publicly chartered government-sponsored enterprises, were central to the 2008 financial crisis, leading to the deepest economic decline since World War II and the loss of 7,500,000 jobs. In September 2008, the Treasury Department, Federal Reserve Board, and Federal Housing Finance Agency were involved. In 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's role in the financial crisis led to the loss of 7,500,000 jobs. The Treasury Department, Federal Reserve Board, and Federal Housing Finance Agency placed the GSEs in conservatorship. The Administration established a $200 billion facility to purchase senior preferred stock, later raised to $400 billion in 2009. In February 2009, the Obama Administration increased the senior preferred stock purchase commitment to $400 billion for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. By Christmas Eve 2009, the Administration removed limits on Federal funds to cover losses, resulting in taxpayers owning at least 80% of the two GSEs. The Obama Administration increased the senior preferred stock purchase commitment to $400 billion for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in February 2009. This resulted in taxpayers owning at least 80% of the two GSEs. The Administration is using the GSEs as instruments of Federal housing policy, making it unlikely they will be returned to private ownership. The Congressional Budget Office has determined that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are now effectively government entities. The GSEs are expected to be a long-term burden on taxpayers due to market conditions and political factors. At the end of 2009, the Treasury Department and FHFA approved $6,000,000 compensation packages for the CEOs of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, including $2,000,000 in incentive pay each, which is significantly higher than the President's and Cabinet Secretary's annual compensation. The Treasury Department and FHFA approved $2,000,000 compensation packages for top executives of the GSEs, payable in cash. Executive officers of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were excluded from receiving such compensation. FHFA determined that no executive officer of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac would receive cash bonuses or long-term incentives for 2008. The agency's Strategic Plan includes a commitment for the GSEs to operate safely and soundly under the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 allows the FHFA Director to withhold or place executive officer compensation in escrow for review. SEC. 3. REASONABLE COMPENSATION.

The Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency will suspend 2010 compensation packages for executive officers of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and establish a new compensation system based on government pay rates. Congress suggests that executive officers of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac should return any excess compensation earned in 2009 to the Secretary of the Treasury.
