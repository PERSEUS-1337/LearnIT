    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Nonprofit Athletic Organization Protection Act of 2004\" and includes findings. Congress finds that amateur sports and education-based athletics are crucial for youth development, promoting leadership, teamwork, and discipline. Participation in these activities is linked to academic success and social growth. Nonprofit organizations prioritize the well-being of young people through enacting rules, despite the risk of injuries. Young people benefit from participating in school sports and amateur competitions by having lower obesity levels, becoming fitter adults with fewer health problems as they age. Playing rules in amateur sports are essential for youth participation. Rules in amateur sports are necessary for age- and skill-appropriate competition, involving intense physical activity and inherent risks. Athletes assume these risks when choosing to compete, and rules makers must make clear decisions to prevent injuries. Rules makers in amateur sports face an increasing number of lawsuits for negligence in developing or adopting rules. Defending these claims can hinder their ability to provide services and discourage top coaches, officials, and administrators from participating in rules committees. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"economic loss\" refers to pecuniary loss from harm, including loss of earnings, medical expenses, burial costs, and loss of business opportunities. \"Harm\" includes physical, nonphysical, economic, and noneconomic losses. \"Noneconomic loss\" refers to loss from physical and emotional pain and suffering. \"Noneconomic loss\" encompasses various nonpecuniary losses such as pain, suffering, impairment, mental anguish, disfigurement, and loss of enjoyment of life. It also includes damages to reputation and other nonmonetary losses. A nonprofit organization is defined as an organization exempt from tax under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, or a not-for-profit organization primarily operated for charitable, civic, educational, religious, welfare, or health purposes. A nonprofit athletic organization is a nonprofit organization that oversees sanctioned athletic competitions and practices, including its employees, agents, and volunteers. The term \"State\" includes the District of Columbia and any U.S. commonwealth, territory, or possession. SEC. 4. LIMITATION ON LIABILITY FOR NONPROFIT ATHLETIC ORGANIZATIONS. Liability protection for nonprofit athletic organizations is provided, except in certain circumstances. The organization must have been acting within its duties and properly licensed for the competition or practice. Liability protection is provided for nonprofit athletic organizations as long as they were properly licensed and the harm was not caused by willful misconduct. Employees, agents, and volunteers are not protected under this provision. Liability protection for nonprofit athletic organizations does not extend to employees, agents, or volunteers. State laws imposing risk management procedures or mandatory training are exceptions to this protection. State laws requiring mandatory training for employees, agents, or volunteers of nonprofit athletic organizations can override liability protection. Additionally, State laws may hold nonprofit organizations liable for the actions of their employees to the same extent as an employer. Limitations of liability may not apply if a civil action is brought by a government officer. The limitation on liability does not cover claims related to antitrust, labor, or other specific legal areas. The limitation on liability provided by subsection (a) does not apply to certain claims arising from antitrust, labor, environmental, defamation, tortious interference of contract law, civil rights law, or discrimination protection under Federal, State, or local laws. SEC. 5. PREEMPTION.\n\nThis Act preempts State laws inconsistent with it, except for laws providing extra liability protection for nonprofit athletic organizations' rule-making activities.\n\nSEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\nThis Act takes effect upon enactment and applies to claims for harm caused by nonprofit athletic organizations' acts or omissions filed after the effective date, only if the harm or conduct occurred after that date."
