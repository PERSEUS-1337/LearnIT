Unemployment may not immediately decrease when economic activity improves after a recession due to firms retaining underutilized employees to avoid costs associated with layoffs and rehiring. This delay in unemployment reduction is why it is considered a lagging economic indicator. Employers may increase output during a recovery by raising productivity of current employees before hiring additional workers. This temporarily boosts labor productivity growth. Output growth in an economic expansion depends on labor supply and productivity growth rates. If real GDP growth exceeds labor productivity growth, employment will increase. The relationship between real GDP growth and unemployment is determined by the combined rates of growth in labor supply and productivity. If GDP growth exceeds productivity growth, employment will rise, leading to a decrease in the unemployment rate. Okun's law, established in the 1960s, highlights this long-term relationship between GDP growth and unemployment. Arthur Okun's law, a core idea in economics, states that real GDP growth equal to potential output growth is needed to maintain a stable unemployment rate. Potential output is the economy's capacity to produce goods and services when resources are fully utilized. The rate of growth in potential output is crucial for the long-term relationship between GDP growth and unemployment. The output gap occurs when actual GDP falls short of potential GDP due to high unemployment rates. If GDP growth lags behind labor force growth, there won't be enough new jobs for all job seekers. If GDP growth falls below labor force growth, there won't be enough new jobs for all job seekers, leading to a rise in unemployment. Conversely, if output growth exceeds labor force growth, unemployment will decrease as new jobs are created to meet demand. When GDP growth equals labor force growth with productivity growth, more people enter the workforce than needed for production. If GDP growth exceeds the combined growth rates of the labor force and productivity, the unemployment rate will fall in the long run. Policymakers can use the rate of GDP growth to implement stimulus policies to reduce unemployment. The labor force growth rate has slowed over time, from 1.6% between 1950 and 2000 to 0.7% projected between 2010 and 2020, partly due to the aging baby-boom generation. Predicting productivity growth is more challenging than predicting labor force growth. The rate of labor force growth is projected to fall to 0.7% per year between 2010 and 2020. Productivity growth has varied over time, with periods of acceleration and slowdowns. Between 1995 and 2005, productivity growth accelerated to 2.9% per year, but since 2005 it has slowed to 1.6% annually. Real GDP growth above 2.5% will be needed to lower the unemployment rate. According to Okun's law, a 1 percentage point decline in unemployment requires real GDP to grow 2 percentage points faster than potential GDP. The time it takes for the unemployment rate to decline after an economic recovery can vary. Following the end of economic contractions, it took over a year for the unemployment rate to start declining after the 1990-1991 and 2001 recessions, leading to jobless recoveries. This contrasts with other periods where the decline in unemployment began sooner. The unemployment rate took over a year to start declining after the 1990-1991 and 2001 recessions, leading to jobless recoveries. The current recovery is closer to the high-end of the range for the time it takes for the unemployment rate to begin falling after a recession. After the 1990-1991 and 2001 recessions, the unemployment rate took over a year to start declining, leading to jobless recoveries. The pace of decline varied after postwar recessions, with the slowest decline occurring after the 2001 recession. It took about 3\u00bd years for the unemployment rate to fall by one-half of a percentage point. The expansion following the July 1981-November 1982 downturn began with a high unemployment rate of 10.8%, which fell to 9.4% in eight months. There is a debate on the applicability of Okun's law to economic growth and unemployment rate changes. Despite high growth rates early in the recovery, the unemployment rate stalled at around 9.0% in the first three quarters of 2011 due to slow GDP growth. The unemployment rate remained at about 9.0% in the first three quarters of 2011, with slow GDP growth. It dropped to 8.5% in December 2011 as output growth accelerated in the fourth quarter. However, the decline in the unemployment rate was greater than expected based on GDP growth. In 2011, the unemployment rate decreased more than expected despite slow GDP growth. Bernanke suggested a temporary disconnect from Okun's law may have compensated for earlier deviations. The New York Federal Reserve Bank found that Okun's law underpredicted the actual decline in the unemployment rate during long recovery periods after recessions. There is instability in the relationship between economic growth rates and unemployment, with variations possibly due to the stage of the business cycle. Owyang and Sekhposyan suggest that simple calculations relating changes in unemployment to output growth may not always hold true. Based on their analysis, Owyang and Sekhposyan suggest that the relationship between changes in the unemployment rate and output growth should be taken with a grain of salt. In contrast, Ball et al estimated that increases and decreases in output have the same effect on unemployment, demonstrating that Okun's law applies equally well to both recoveries and recessions. They also found that Okun's law did not break down during recent jobless recoveries. Okun's law remained valid during recent jobless recoveries, with large output gaps persisting in the 1990-1991, 2001, and 2007-2009 recessions. Ball et al confirmed the relationship between output and unemployment gaps predicted by Okun, stating that Okun's Law has earned its name as a strong and stable macroeconomic relationship. According to economist Robert J. Gordon, potential output has grown at an average annual rate of 3.4% since 1875. However, he predicts slower productivity growth in the next 20 years due to diminishing gains from information technology investments. This, along with expected declines in labor force growth, leads him to project a 2.4% rate of growth in potential GDP. Investments have been diminishing, leading to a projected 2.4% growth in potential output over the next 20 years. Economists Basu and Fernald suggest that the decline in household net worth post-recession will make it harder for workers to afford leisure time, potentially increasing the supply of labor. The 2007-2009 recession led to a drop in wealth, making it harder for workers to afford leisure time like retirement. This may increase the supply of labor in the near term, temporarily raising growth in potential output. However, disruptions in financial markets could constrain growth in potential output due to higher investment risks. Weidner and Williams studied the relationship between real economic growth and past recoveries, highlighting the uncertainty in estimating potential output growth. Weidner and Williams analyzed the relationship between real economic growth and past recoveries, showing the uncertainty in estimating potential output growth. They found that potential output growth varied, with rapid growth in the 1960s-1980s (3.6%) and more moderate growth in the 1990s-2000s (2.5%). The slow labor force growth led to a sluggish 2.1% potential GDP growth at the start of the Great Recession recovery. Real economic growth above 2.1% could lower the unemployment rate. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects potential output growth at 2.2% between 2012 and 2022, lower than the 3.3% average from 1950 to 2011 due to reduced labor force growth. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects potential output growth at 2.2% between 2012 and 2022, lower than the 3.3% average from 1950 to 2011 due to reduced labor force growth. CBO also predicts that real GDP growth will remain below potential output growth until 2018, with unemployment rates above 8.0% through 2014, decreasing to 5.9% by 2017 as the output gap narrows."
