    "content": "The FCC prepared to auction 62 MHz of radio frequencies in the 700 MHz band to comply with the Deficit Reduction Act. Rules were issued for spectrum allocation, auction, public safety use, and creating a public-private partnership for a network. 24 MHz had already been set aside for public safety in the same bandwidth. The FCC proposed setting aside 10 MHz from public safety frequency bands to create a shared network with auctionable spectrum, totaling 20 MHz for a nationwide broadband network. This decision aimed to meet public safety needs for robust communications and interoperability through a shared network. The FCC proposed creating a shared network with auctionable spectrum to meet public safety needs for robust communications and interoperability. This network would involve collaboration between two adjacent spectrum license-holders to provide adequate broadband capacity. The FCC assigned a national license for 10 MHz to a not-for-profit corporation formed to represent public safety interests, created from the 24 MHz originally assigned to public safety. This license is administered by a Public Safety Broadband Licensee (PSBL) chosen by the FCC, and is paired with 10 MHz designated for commercial use to create a shared network. This license was to be sold to a commercial enterprise as part of the auction of licenses at 700 MHz, Auction 73. The FCC assigned a national license for 10 MHz to a not-for-profit corporation formed to represent public safety interests, paired with 10 MHz designated for commercial use to create a shared network. The commercial license, known as the D Block, attracted only one bidder at Auction 73, but the reserve price of $1.3 billion was not met. The FCC directed not to proceed with the re-auction of the D Block in the public interest. The FCC decided not to re-auction the D Block due to the need for more time to consider options. They initiated a review of rules and proposed new auction rules for the D Block. The FCC prepared new auction rules for the D Block, maintaining a single nationwide license for the Public Safety Broadband Licensee. The commercial license will be offered as a national license or in smaller licenses covering 58 regions. Public safety associations and officials have requested local public safety networks to operate on and manage access to the public safety spectrum. The national licensee would ensure common standards and interoperability while allowing local networks to negotiate sharing. The FCC and the Office of Emergency Communications at the Department of Homeland Security are pursuing separate paths for developing a national capability for public safety communications support. Congressional policy discussions focus on combining public and private spectrum license ownership to achieve this goal. The FCC and the Office of Emergency Communications at the Department of Homeland Security are pursuing separate paths for developing a national capability for public safety communications support. Congress is considering funding solutions for the program, including levies on commercial partners or public sector funding. An economic stimulus program may also provide funding for critical infrastructure improvements. In the current economic situation, funding for improvements to critical infrastructure, including public safety networks, may receive renewed interest. The federal government could temporarily assume the role of the commercial partner to ensure network construction and later sell the business to the private sector. Sharing spectrum and network facilities with commercial users could benefit public safety by providing new funding sources, building economies of scale, and accessing additional spectrum. The benefits of sharing spectrum and network facilities with commercial users for public safety include new funding sources, economies of scale in network construction, and access to additional spectrum during emergencies. The goal of resource sharing between public and private sectors is widely accepted, with three key needs identified for an effective solution, including sufficient spectrum for a nationwide broadband network. Key elements for an effective solution include sufficient spectrum, a source of funds, and a management structure for a public-private partnership in public safety. The FCC outlines key elements for a public-private partnership in public safety, including a Public Safety Broadband Licensee, a network sharing agreement, and incentives for commercial partners to meet public safety standards. The D Block license failed to attract a winning bid after a vigorous public debate following the auction conclusion. Reasons for this failure have been discussed in the media and presented in congressional debates. Some reasons for the D Block license failure have been discussed in the media and congressional hearings. Possible steps going forward include modifying auction rules to attract potential bidders and maintain the public-private partnership structure for a public safety broadband network. To attract potential bidders for the D Block license and maintain the public-private partnership structure, auction rules may need to be modified. This could involve eliminating FCC requirements that may deter bidders, removing network sharing requirements, and allowing public safety to negotiate independently for partnerships. The goal is to auction the D Block license without public safety requirements while ensuring there is adequate spectrum capacity for successful collaboration between different entities. This course assumes a structure and spectrum capacity for public safety interoperability, using federal funds from the auction of 700 MHz frequencies. Congressional action is required to authorize expenditures for a public safety network managed by different entities sharing resources with commercial and other spectrum-license holders. The FCC seeks comments on various options for managing a public safety network that shares resources with commercial spectrum-license holders. Congressional action is needed to authorize expenditures and establish an organizational structure. Several proposals combine different elements, and re-auctioning the D block is supported by all five FCC commissioners. At a hearing on April 15, 2008, all five FCC commissioners affirmed their support for re-auctioning the D Block under rules that would produce a winning bidder and provide a commercial partner for public safety. The FCC intends to maintain and increase its oversight role in supervising the public-private partnership, with potential rule changes for the auction including modifications for the winning bidder. Some proposals for re-auctioning the D Block include lowering the reserve price, eliminating penalties for failure to negotiate a Network Sharing Agreement, and removing encumbrances such as expensive build-out requirements and the network sharing agreement. Another suggestion is to offer the D Block as a commercial license without the network sharing agreement. Some proposals suggest eliminating the network sharing agreement for the D Block and offering it as a commercial license without encumbrances. There are recommendations to use surplus funds from auctions to build a public safety network, as mentioned by FCC Chairman Kevin J. Martin. In oral testimony, FCC Chairman Kevin J. Martin and Commissioner Michael J. Copps preferred a solution using federal funds to meet public safety needs for a nationwide, interoperable network. Without federal financial support, the FCC aims to use private sector funds to build the network, with recommendations to use spectrum proceeds for funding. The FCC aims to use private sector funds to build a nationwide interoperable network. Recommendations for funding through spectrum proceeds lack details on distribution. Some proposals suggest a cooperative organization involving multiple public safety partners to manage a shared network at 700 MHz. The public-private partnership aims to build an interoperable backbone at 700 MHz for emergency use, with a smaller financial commitment from the commercial partner. State and local agencies would control access to their parts of the network, collaborating with network builders and operators for interoperability. Appropriated funds for public safety could be distributed through existing grant programs, with the commercial network as the dominant partner working with public safety collaborators. The commercial network could be the dominant partner in a cooperative organization with multiple partners, each holding licenses for local markets and rural coverage. The public safety partner would lead in designing the network and choosing technology standards for commercial partners to follow. The FCC could potentially serve as the network designer in this scenario. The FCC could potentially serve as the network designer in designing the network and setting standards for commercial partners. Federal funds could be used to build parts of the interoperable backbone at 700 MHz. The federal government's role in structuring the agreement would be minimized, with greater support through funding. The federal government's role in structuring the agreement would be minimized, with greater support and participation through funding. To ensure economic viability, federal programs could participate as network customers. A federally chartered corporation or organization could hire professionals to operate the network and secure funding through various means. The federal government could provide funding for a new public safety network, potentially through a federally chartered corporation. The Public Safety Broadband License could be retained by the current holder or reassigned, with congressional oversight replacing FCC regulations. The FCC seeks Congress's assistance in creating a broadband network for public safety at 700 MHz using the existing Public Safety Broadband License and the D Block. Without additional authority from Congress, the FCC's options are limited to modifications in spectrum band plans, auction rules, service rules, and network sharing agreements. The FCC seeks opinions and information on a wide range of questions regarding the network sharing agreement, provisions for using the Public Safety Broadband License, negotiation of the Network Sharing Agreement, auction of the D Block, relocation costs for 700 MHz frequency assignments, service rules for the D Block, and opportunities for providing broadband wireless access for public safety. The Public Safety Spectrum Trust would have borrowed $197 million secured by projected revenue from its D Block partner in spectrum access fees. Cyren Call Communications Corporation, the Public Safety Spectrum Trust planned to borrow $197 million secured by projected revenue from its D Block partner for capital expenditures, excluding operating costs. The FCC sought opinions on funding sources for both capital and operating costs of the Public Safety Broadband Licensee. The FCC is exploring funding options for the Public Safety Broadband Licensee's operating costs, including the Universal Service Fund and the Telecommunications Development Fund. Congressional amendments may be needed for the USF, while the TDF is a not-for-profit venture capital company established in 1996. The Telecommunications Development Fund (TDF) was created in 1996 as a not-for-profit venture capital company to provide capital to small businesses in the telecommunications industry. Its primary source of funding is the interest accrued on deposits held by the FCC from spectrum auction procedures. Congress may need to amend existing statutes to authorize changes to the fund's uses. The FCC has consistently established auction rules with financial requirements since initiating auctions in 1994. The FCC reviews key provisions for auctions, sets financial requirements, reserves licenses, provides incentives, and enforces service rules. These rules include requirements for license usage within a specific timeframe and can specify technologies, uses, or users. For Auction 73, the FCC expanded service rules to mandate spectrum sharing between public safety and commercial licensees. This created a public-private partnership for the auction of licenses in the 700 MHz band. The FCC established service rules for a public-private partnership in the 700 MHz band auction, setting regulatory framework for shared network operation. This includes requirements for Public Safety Broadband Licensee holding 10 MHz of spectrum. The FCC established binding requirements for a public-private partnership in the 700 MHz band auction, including guidelines for a Public Safety Broadband Licensee, a Commercial partner, and a Network Sharing Agreement. Compliance and dispute resolution would be overseen by the FCC. The FCC's Second Report and Order established guidelines for public safety communications in the 700 MHz band auction. Compliance, oversight, and dispute resolution would be handled by the FCC or through litigation. Congress directed the allocation of 24 MHz of spectrum for public safety use during the transition to digital television. The FCC allocated 24 MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz band for public safety use during the transition to digital television. Planning for public safety use began in 1997 and concluded in 2003 with the submission of the final report by the Public Safety National Coordination Committee (NCC). The NCC developed technical and operational standards for the 700 MHz band and structured license management through regional committees. Governance for these channels is overseen by 55 Regional Planning Committees (RPCs). The FCC allocated 24 MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz band for public safety use, with governance through 55 Regional Planning Committees. The band plan has been revised to create two licensing approaches for narrowband and broadband applications, reflecting changes in technology and public safety needs. The revised band plan allocates spectrum for narrowband and broadband applications in the 700 MHz band. Narrowband channels are designated for voice applications, while broadband channels are for high-speed data. States and localities will administer the narrowband frequencies through regional committees, with funding from local, state, and federal sources. RPCs with approved band plans must submit amended plans as required by FCC rules. The frequencies for broadband communications in the 700 MHz band will be financed through a combination of local, state, and federal funds. Spectrum will be allocated in 10 MHz of frequencies at 763 - 768 MHz and 793 - 798 MHz, with two guard bands at 768 - 769 MHz and 798 - 799 MHz to prevent interference. Some public safety network operators may need to modify equipment to accommodate the new band plan. Some public safety network operators may need to modify equipment for the new band plan at 700 MHz frequencies. The cost of changes would be partially covered by the commercial D Block licensee. Public safety licensee must meet requirements including forming a not-for-profit corporation, establishing standards, and compliance. The non-profit organization responsible for establishing standards and participating in the creation of the Network Sharing Agreement for the national network using spectrum held by the broadband licensee. The FCC selected the Public Safety Broadband Licensee based on criteria such as not-for-profit status and broad representation of public safety entities. The Public Safety Spectrum Trust Corporation (PSST) was formed by public safety associations to negotiate for the nationwide Public Safety Broadband License. Cyren Call Communications Corporation was hired as an advisor. The Board of Directors of the licensee will consist of members from organizations representing public safety. The FCC designated 11 organizations to appoint members to the Board. The FCC designated 11 organizations to appoint members to the Board of the Public Safety Spectrum Trust Corporation. The composition of the board was later changed to include three representatives from named organizations and four at-large members selected jointly by FCC bureaus. The National Public Safety Telecommunications Council was eliminated from the board. The FCC eliminated the National Public Safety Telecommunications Council from the board of the Public Safety Spectrum Trust Corporation due to overlap with other associations. The selected licensee, PSST, would need to submit quarterly financial reports to the FCC and meet specific criteria. The FCC requires the licensee to meet specific criteria for its corporate governance, with oversight to ensure compliance. Options were considered to ensure the public safety license holder receives necessary services for emergency communications. The FCC reserves the right to re-assign or revoke the D Block license if necessary, with the public safety license valid for ten years unless revoked for non-compliance with FCC rules. The public safety license, valid for ten years unless revoked for non-compliance with FCC rules, would be effective from February 17, 2009. The licensee would have additional tasks assigned by the FCC, including negotiating a Network Sharing Agreement with its commercial partner and administering access to the network for public safety users. The winning bidder for the D Block will administer access to the network for public safety users, represent their interests, and negotiate purchase agreements with vendors. They have the authority to approve equipment and applications used on the network, and state and local entities must seek approval before linking their systems. The winning bidder for the D Block has the authority to approve equipment and applications used on the network. State and local entities must seek approval before linking their systems. They oversee the relocation of users required by rebanding and decide on allowing federal public safety agencies access to the broadband network. They also review requests for construction or use of wideband networks in unserved areas. The FCC ruled that eligible bidders for Block D in Auction 73 would receive a bidding credit of 15% for small businesses with average gross revenues of $40 million in the past three years, and 25% for companies. Public land owned by states or localities could be used to build network sites in a public-private partnership with the winning bidder for Block D. Wideband networks in unserved areas may be constructed with approval from state and local entities. The FCC ruled that eligible bidders for Block D in Auction 73 would receive a bidding credit of 15% for companies with average gross revenues of $40 million in the past three years and 25% for companies with average annual earnings of no more than $15 million. The D Block designates frequencies at 758 - 763 MHz and 788 - 793 MHz, totaling 10 MHz, and was offered as a single, nationwide license in the auction. The FCC suggested a reserve price of $1.33 billion for the D Block. The FCC recommended setting a reserve price of $1.33 billion for the D Block license in Auction 73. The winning bidder would need to meet specific requirements, including a Network Sharing Agreement with the Public Safety Broadband Licensee. The FCC required negotiations for the NSA to begin after the winning bidder files its long form application. The NSA had to be completed within six months and approved by the FCC. A separate agreement granted the Public Safety Broadband Licensee right of first refusal and the option to purchase network assets at fair market value if the D Block license is cancelled. The winning bidder for the D Block must start negotiations for the Network Sharing Agreement (NSA) within ten days and provide monthly reports after three months. FCC staff will observe the negotiation process. The FCC requires detailed monthly reports on negotiations for the D Block license. Two FCC staff members will observe the negotiation process. Separate legal entities must be formed to hold the D Block license, own network assets, and operate the company. These entities must be \"bankruptcy remote\" as confirmed by bankruptcy counsel. The FCC requires detailed monthly reports on negotiations for the D Block license, with separate legal entities formed to hold the license and operate the network assets. These entities must be \"bankruptcy remote\" as confirmed by bankruptcy counsel. The corporate structure for leasing secondary rights to the public safety spectrum must be approved by the FCC and consist of quasi-independent companies with designated functions. The public-private partnership involves a corporate structure with quasi-independent companies, subject to the Communications Act and FCC regulations. These entities are responsible for building out the shared network as per the Network Sharing Agreement and FCC rules. Failure to meet obligations could result in revocation of rights. The D Block license, subject to FCC rules, could be revoked for non-compliance, leading to penalties. The license is valid for ten years unless revoked, allowing the licensee to apply for renewal if rules are followed. The FCC established benchmarks for a population-based build of the public safety network on the 700 MHz band, with requirements for license renewal and network sharing agreements. Modifications to these requirements could be allowed with approval from all parties involved. The FCC set benchmarks for a population-based build-out of the public safety network on the 700 MHz band, with requirements for license renewal and network sharing agreements. The network should reach 75% of the population within four years, 95% within seven years, and 99.3% within ten years. Population measurements are based on U.S. Census data to ensure FCC's minimum coverage standards are met. The FCC required the NSA to include a build-out schedule for major highways, interstates, and communities over 3,000 population based on U.S. Census data. The D Block licensee had to confirm benchmarks for coverage and offer a handset with integrated satellite solution for public safety in rural areas. Failure to meet deadlines could result in license cancellation. The D Block licensee must offer a handset with integrated satellite solution for public safety in rural areas to ensure coverage requirements are met. The NSA establishes requirements for service to public safety users and network performance. The FCC prohibits the D Block licensee from discontinuing or degrading service to public safety customers without approval. The FCC prohibits the D Block licensee from discontinuing or degrading service to public safety customers without approval. The Network Sharing Agreement (NSA) is the keystone of the public-private partnership, with rules serving as the contractual mortar uniting the two licensees. Adherence to the agreement is a regulatory condition for both commercial and public safety licensees, with the FCC reviewing and approving all components. The FCC has set requirements for the Network Sharing Agreement (NSA) between two parties, including network coverage standards and minimum specifications for a platform providing broadband mobile voice, video, and data for public safety and commercial users. The NSA must address communication interoperability and evolving technologies. The FCC has set requirements for the Network Sharing Agreement (NSA) between two parties, including network coverage standards and minimum specifications for a platform providing broadband mobile voice, video, and data for public safety and commercial users. This includes features for public safety users, communication interoperability, signal coverage, reliability, robustness, capacity, and backup power for extended operations during emergencies. The FCC requires network sharing agreements to have sufficient capacity, state-of-the-art security, and automatic prioritization of public safety communications. This includes maintaining operations during emergencies and prioritizing safety of life and property. The FCC mandates network sharing agreements to prioritize public safety communications, with the highest priorities being safety of life and property, and homeland security. The Public Safety Broadband Licensee has operational control of the network to ensure public safety requirements are met, including determining equipment specifications and purchasing subscriber equipment from any vendor. The FCC mandates network sharing agreements to prioritize public safety communications. The Public Safety Broadband Licensee has control over determining equipment specifications and purchasing subscriber equipment from any vendor. The D Block Licensee must provide integrated handsets for public safety use on 700 MHz and satellite frequencies. A common standard for nationwide broadband interoperability is required for all public safety users participating in the network. Good faith negotiations are necessary to create the Network Sharing Agreement, including establishing a fee structure. The FCC mandates network sharing agreements for public safety communications. The Network Sharing Agreement must include a fee structure and specify service fees, including those for priority access to spectrum capacity during emergencies. Negotiations should be conducted in good faith to determine reasonable rates. The FCC expects a reasonable fee structure for network sharing agreements in public safety communications. This includes financial incentives for commercial licensees based on subscriber numbers, priority access fees to protect public safety from unexpected costs, and affordable rates aligned with commercial services but lower for public safety. The D Block licensee should negotiate terms that prioritize public safety goals. The FCC expects the D Block licensee to negotiate fees that prioritize public safety goals. The Network Sharing Agreement (NSA) would be in effect for up to ten years, corresponding to the D Block license duration, and may be renewed or modified along with the license. The NSA may be renewed or modified along with the D Block license by the FCC. Approval from FCC Commissioners or Chiefs of the Wireless Bureau and Public Safety and Homeland Security is required for any major changes. The Public Safety Broadband Licensee can lease access to frequencies exclusively to the D Block licensee. Under current rules, the Public Safety Broadband Licensee can lease access to frequencies exclusively to the D Block licensee on a secondary, unconditionally preemptible basis as part of a public-private partnership. This allows commercial users to transmit on public safety band frequencies only when there is no demand from primary public safety users, with immediate termination of commercial traffic to yield to public safety users. The D Block licensee would have secondary access to spectrum leased from the Public Safety Broadband Licensee as part of a public-private partnership. The FCC requires a spectrum manager leasing arrangement for the full ten-year license term, placing compliance responsibility on the D Block licensee. The D Block licensee must ensure public safety users do not experience harmful interference. The D Block licensee must prioritize first responders and provide real-time emergency access to the spectrum, ensuring public safety users are not affected by commercial operations. The D Block licensee must prioritize first responders and provide real-time emergency access to the spectrum for public safety users. Commercial users are allowed usage of the bandwidth in exchange for this priority access during emergencies. The definition of an emergency and access procedures are outlined in the National Security Agency (NSA) guidelines. If an agreement on emergency access cannot be reached, the public safety licensee can appeal to the FCC for assistance. The FCC revised the band plan for public safety in the 700 MHz band to accommodate both narrowband and broadband networks. This included allowing shared spectrum agreements between public safety and the private sector. Other spectrum management issues were also addressed by the FCC. The FCC revised the band plan for public safety in the 700 MHz band to accommodate both narrowband and broadband networks. This involved moving networks in preliminary stages of build out, requiring technical adjustments and capping reimbursement at $10 million. New operations of narrowband systems on 700 MHz public safety networks will be prohibited, and wideband network building and use will be limited. The new band plan created two separate sets of paired spectrum blocks. The new band plan for public safety in the 700 MHz band has created two sets of paired spectrum blocks. One set is for narrowband communications, while the other is designated for a new broadband network to be built through a public-private partnership. Some states have already started building narrowband networks using the 700 MHz capacity. Base stations and radios may need modifications if they are programmed for frequencies reassigned to the broadband network. The FCC has set a deadline for vacating these frequencies by February 17. The FCC has set a deadline for frequencies to be vacated by February 17, 2009 for broadband use. Motorola provided a cost estimate for a rebanding plan proposed by NPSTC, covering equipment already installed, on order, or planned. The cost of retuning was set at $9.45 million to cover installations projected to be in place by July 2008. The FCC established a cap of $10 million for reimbursements to cover rebanding costs, with a cut-off date of August 30, 2007. By limiting the systems and radios eligible for reimbursement, the estimated cost was reduced to around $6 million. The FCC set a $10 million cap for rebanding reimbursements by August 30, 2007, aiming to limit costs to around $6 million by restricting eligible systems and radios. To control relocation expenses, new operations on affected narrowband frequencies were prohibited after the deadline. Rules were established for calculating actual costs and reimbursements. In 2007, the FCC established rules for calculating costs and reimbursements related to rebanding. Public safety and commercial licensees had to agree on a relocation plan and cost agreement, approved by the FCC within 30 days. Displaced public safety operators had to provide accurate information by August 30, 2007, to be eligible for reimbursement. The FCC established rules in 2007 for calculating costs and reimbursements related to rebanding. Public safety and commercial licensees had to provide accurate information by August 30, 2007, including details on mobile and portable handsets, base stations, contact information, and geographical areas of operation. The D Block licensee would only be responsible for reimbursing the minimum cost for necessary changes, not for unrelated improvements. The FCC established rules in 2007 for calculating costs and reimbursements related to rebanding. The D Block licensee is only responsible for the minimum cost of necessary changes, not for unrelated improvements. Reimbursement for costs related to rebanding may be forthcoming for the Public Safety Broadband Licensee. The total costs for changes necessitated by rebanding must be agreed upon by both licensees and submitted to the FCC, not to exceed $10 million. The total costs for changes necessitated by rebanding must be agreed upon by both licensees and submitted to the FCC, not to exceed $10 million. Once approved, the amount must be paid into a trust account established by the Public Safety Broadband Licensee, with responsibility for administering and making payments according to the agreed schedule. The public safety licensee is responsible for administering the account and making payments according to the agreed schedule. Payments cannot be made from the trust account until the D Block license is awarded to the winning bidder. The winning bidder is considered provisional until all FCC requirements are met, including obtaining a waiver for operating wideband systems. To operate wideband systems within narrowband frequencies, a waiver must be obtained, including an application, confirmation from the Public Safety Broadband Licensee, agreed-upon conditions, a transition plan, and a certification of no reimbursement sought. Wideband operations in broadband frequencies are generally not permitted, except in rare cases. Devices on the wideband network must be interoperable. In the Second Report and Order, the FCC assigned itself the role of champion and protector for public safety interests, nationwide emergency communications, and interoperable networks. Licenses for wideband operations will be valid for five years and devices must be interoperable with the broadband network. Congressional oversight will monitor and regulate the actions of the Public Safety Broadband Licensee and D Block license holder obligations. The FCC has extended its authority to oversee and regulate the Public Safety Broadband Licensee and D Block license holder obligations. Congressional oversight will be within the jurisdiction of telecommunications committees. The FCC will monitor the operation of the network, which could have a significant asset value controlled by the Public Safety Broadband Licensee. The Public Safety Broadband Licensee, governed by its Board of Directors, will control a significant asset value worth tens of billions of dollars. The FCC plans to enforce rules through litigation, license revocation, or other means supported by the Communications Act, with guidance from Congress. The FCC plans to enforce rules through litigation, license revocation, or other means supported by the Communications Act, with guidance from Congress. Two bills in the 110th Congress aim to address issues related to creating a shared network, including the Public Safety Broadband Authorization Act of 2008 (H.R. 6055) providing funding for the Public Safety Broadband Licensee. The Public Safety Broadband Licensee would receive funds in the form of grants from the FCC, with additional appropriations of $2 million authorized to promote a nationwide, interoperable broadband public safety communications network. The bill imposes limits on the licensee's activities, including requirements for not-for-profit status and no commercial entity participation in management. The RESPONDER Act of 2008 aims to provide new devices for emergency responders. The RESPONDER Act of 2008 aims to create a Trust Fund for purchasing interoperable radios for emergency responders. It would allocate proceeds from the D Block Auction and future auctions for this purpose. The RESPONDER Act of 2008 aims to establish a Trust Fund for buying interoperable radios for emergency responders using proceeds from the D Block Auction and future auctions. Additional funds would be generated from future auctions to support this initiative."
