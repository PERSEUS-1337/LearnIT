    "content": "One of the most controversial issues in U.S. foreign assistance is restrictions on funding for abortion and family planning activities abroad. The debate revolves around whether recipients of U.S. aid perform abortions or engage in coercive practices with U.S. funds, and the impact of withholding funds on population growth and reproductive health services in developing countries. Members of Congress have had heated debates on these issues. Members of Congress have engaged in debates on population growth, family planning, and reproductive health services in developing countries, particularly in relation to U.S. abortion policy since the Roe v. Wade ruling in 1973. Legislation has been introduced to prohibit abortion in the U.S., with attempts to restrict federal funding for abortions. After the Roe v. Wade ruling in 1973, debates in Congress shifted to include discussions on federal funding for abortion, both domestically and in U.S. foreign assistance. This led to the enactment of abortion and family planning restrictions in foreign assistance legislation. The controversy over international abortion restrictions also extended to the executive branch, with President Reagan involved in the debate in 1984. The \"Mexico City policy\" requires foreign NGOs receiving USAID family planning assistance to certify they will not promote abortion. The policy has been rescinded and reissued by various Administrations, most recently by President Obama in 2009. The Mexico City policy, also known as \"Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance,\" has been rescinded and reinstated by different Administrations. President Obama rescinded it in 2009, and President Trump reinstated and expanded it in 2017. During the 115th Congress, Members debated abortion and family planning restrictions in State-Foreign Operations legislation. Some introduced bills related to the Mexico City policy. The report examines legislative and executive branch policies restricting U.S. funding for abortion and family planning abroad, including the Mexico City policy. Congressional interest in foreign assistance funding for these activities is expected to continue in the next session. The report discusses U.S. policies restricting funding for abortion and family planning activities abroad, including the types of foreign aid affected and the lawmakers associated with certain provisions. Legislation authorizing foreign aid establishes rules for different types of assistance programs. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (FAA) is the cornerstone of permanent foreign aid authorization law, divided into parts that authorize different types of foreign assistance. Congress routinely modifies legislation for foreign aid programs. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 authorizes various foreign aid programs, but Congress has not fully reauthorized most programs since 1985. Debates on controversial issues and foreign policy disputes have stalled subsequent authorization bills. Congress has instead focused on annual appropriations measures for foreign aid. In the absence of regular foreign aid authorizations, Congress annually considers appropriations that influence how U.S. foreign aid is disbursed. These measures often include family planning or abortion-related restrictions. The links among these requirements and restrictions are complex, with some already enacted in the Foreign Assistance Act. Some amendments in foreign aid legislation, like the Helms and Biden provisions, are added to other bills for emphasis or to cover more aid categories. Restrictions and requirements can stand alone or clarify existing ones, such as the Leahy and Livingston amendments. The Leahy amendment clarifies the term \"motivate\" from the Helms amendment, while the Livingston amendment clarifies prohibitions in the DeConcini amendment. These legislative restrictions relate to U.S. funding of abortion and voluntary family planning programs abroad, listed chronologically by year enacted. The Helms amendment prohibits the use of U.S. foreign assistance funds for abortions or to coerce individuals to have abortions. Introduced by Senator Jesse Helms in 1973, it was added to the FAA due to concerns about funding overseas abortions. The Helms amendment, introduced in 1973 by Senator Jesse Helms, prohibits the use of U.S. foreign assistance funds for abortions as a method of family planning or to coerce individuals to have abortions overseas. It applies to all foreign assistance activities authorized by the FAA. The Helms amendment, introduced in 1973, prohibits the use of U.S. foreign assistance funds for abortions as a method of family planning or coercion overseas. It applies to all foreign assistance activities authorized by the FAA and is included in the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act. In 1978, an amendment to the FAA specified that U.S. foreign assistance cannot fund involuntary sterilizations or coercion of sterilizations. None of the funds can be used for involuntary sterilizations as a method of family planning or to provide financial incentives for sterilization. The FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act prohibits the use of foreign assistance funds for involuntary sterilizations or coercion of sterilizations. This restriction has been included in annual foreign operations appropriations since FY1979, including a specific restriction on Peace Corps funding to prevent money from being used for abortions for volunteers. The FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act includes a restriction on Peace Corps funding, prohibiting the use of funds for abortions. Exceptions are allowed in cases of rape, incest, or endangerment to the mother's life. No restrictions apply to funding for the medical evacuation of Peace Corps volunteers seeking abortions. The Peace Corps covers the cost of medical evacuation for volunteers seeking abortions in locations where it is legally permissible. Congress passed an amendment in 1981 prohibiting foreign assistance for abortion-related biomedical research. The Biden amendment prohibits the use of funds for biomedical research related to abortions or involuntary sterilization. It has been included in foreign operations appropriations acts, most recently in the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act. The Siljander amendment, included in the FAA and FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, prohibits the use of U.S. funds for lobbying for or against abortion in foreign assistance activities. Congress has modified the amendment over the years to broaden its scope. The Siljander amendment, included in the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, prohibits the use of U.S. funds for lobbying for or against abortion in foreign assistance activities. Congress enacted a provision in 1985 to only fund family planning projects that offer a range of services. The provision introduced by Senator Dennis DeConcini in 1985 requires that U.S. funding for family planning projects in developing nations must offer a broad range of family planning methods and services to reduce reliance on abortion. The provision introduced in 1985 requires a broad range of family planning methods and services for U.S. funding in developing nations. It is included in the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act and applies to family planning assistance funded through all accounts under that act. Congress also included a provision in the FY1986 Foreign Assistance and Related Programs Appropriations Act regarding the use of funds for countries or organizations violating certain amendments. The provision introduced in 1985 requires a broad range of family planning methods and services for U.S. funding in developing nations. It prohibits the use of funds for any country or organization if the President certifies that the use of such funds violates the Helms, Biden, or involuntary sterilization amendments. This provision is included in annual foreign operations appropriations. The Kemp-Kasten amendment, introduced in 1985, prohibits the use of funds for any country or organization if the President certifies that the use of such funds violates the Helms, Biden, or involuntary sterilization amendments. This provision is included in annual foreign operations appropriations. The Kemp-Kasten amendment, introduced in 1985, prohibits funds from supporting organizations involved in coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization, particularly targeting the U.N. Population Fund's program in China. This provision has been included in annual foreign operations appropriations legislation since FY1985. The Kemp-Kasten amendment, introduced in 1985, prohibits funds from supporting organizations involved in coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization. It applies to any organization or program supporting or participating in such activities, with a determination made only regarding UNFPA. The provision is included in the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, stating that any determination must be made within 6 months of the Act's enactment, accompanied by evidence and criteria. In 16 of the past 34 years, the United States has not contributed to UNFPA. The United States has not contributed to UNFPA in 16 of the past 34 years due to executive branch determinations that UNFPA's program in China violated the Kemp-Kasten amendment. The Obama Administration supported U.S. funding for UNFPA, highlighting the President's commitment to international family planning, women's health, and global development. Currently, the United States is not providing funding to UNFPA under Kemp-Kasten. The United States has a history of not funding UNFPA due to concerns about its program in China. The Trump Administration determined that UNFPA supports coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization in China. Congress has imposed conditions on U.S. funding for UNFPA, including in the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act. The FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act imposes conditions on U.S. funding for UNFPA, including restrictions on funds for China programs and abortions. The act also requires funds not used for UNFPA to be transferred to Global Health Programs. The FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act imposes conditions on U.S. funding for UNFPA, including restrictions on funds for China programs and abortions. It also requires the Secretary of State to report on fund withholding and transfer unused funds to Global Health Programs. Representative Bob Livingston introduced an amendment in 1986. In 1986, Representative Bob Livingston introduced an amendment prohibiting discrimination based on religious beliefs in awarding grants for natural family planning under the Foreign Assistance Act. The Livingston amendment prohibits discrimination based on religious beliefs in awarding family planning grants under the Foreign Assistance Act, ensuring that organizations supporting natural family planning methods are not excluded from funding if they comply with the DeConcini amendment. The DeConcini amendment allows organizations supporting natural family planning methods to receive family planning grants, as long as they comply with the amendment. The provision is included in the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act and applies to family planning assistance from any account under that act. The Leahy amendment clarifies language in the Helms amendment regarding the use of funds for family planning. The Leahy provision in the Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act clarifies language in the Helms amendment regarding the use of funds for family planning, specifically addressing concerns about providing information or counseling on legal pregnancy options. The Leahy provision clarifies that for foreign operations funding, \"motivate\" in family planning assistance does not prohibit providing information or counseling on pregnancy options, in line with local laws. This provision has been included in various appropriations acts, including the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act. The Tiahrt amendment, part of the FY1999 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, requires voluntary family planning projects funded by the US to meet specific requirements. This provision has been included in foreign operations appropriations every fiscal year since its enactment in October 1998. The Tiahrt amendment, part of the FY1999 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, mandates that funds for voluntary family planning projects can only be used if certain requirements are met, such as no implementation of quotas or numerical targets for births or family planning acceptors, and no payment of incentives or bribes. The project for voluntary family planning must adhere to specific guidelines: no payment of incentives or bribes for accepting family planning services, no implementation of quotas or numerical targets, and no denial of rights or benefits for choosing not to accept family planning services. The project for voluntary family planning must provide comprehensible information on health benefits and risks of chosen methods, ensure experimental contraceptives are only provided in scientific studies, and inform participants of potential risks and benefits. The Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development must report violations of project requirements to the Committees on Appropriations. Representative Tiahrt introduced the amendment in response to reports of governments offering financial incentives. In response to reports of governments offering financial incentives for sterilization quotas, Representative Tiahrt introduced an amendment to prevent U.S. foreign assistance from supporting such practices. This was prompted by instances of forced sterilizations in rural Peru, where women were not properly informed about alternative contraception methods, leading to complications and even death. USAID issued guidance in April 1999 to ensure compliance with the Tiahrt requirements for voluntary family planning projects. Since the Tiahrt amendment was enacted in response to reports of forced sterilizations in Peru, USAID issued guidance on implementing the amendment for voluntary family planning projects. Violations of the amendment were reported in Peru, Guatemala, and the Philippines. A 2007 audit found no further violations in USAID operating units. The Tiahrt amendment, included in the FY2018 State-Foreign Operations Appropriations Act, applies to family planning assistance funded through all accounts under that act. Two executive branch policies addressing abortion or voluntary family planning are the Mexico City policy (PLGHA) and USAID Policy Determination 3 (PD-3) on voluntary sterilization. The Mexico City policy restricts U.S. family planning assistance to foreign NGOs. The Mexico City policy (PLGHA) restricts U.S. family planning assistance to foreign NGOs engaged in voluntary abortion activities. It has been implemented and reversed through executive branch actions, with Republicans supporting and Democrats opposing it. The Trump Administration recently reinstated and expanded the policy to include all global health assistance. The Mexico City policy, supported by Republicans and opposed by Democrats, was reinstated and expanded by the Trump Administration to include all global health assistance. Initially issued by President Reagan in 1984, the policy prohibits the use of U.S. funds for abortion as a method of family planning or involuntary sterilizations. The Mexico City policy, supported by Republicans and opposed by Democrats, was reinstated and expanded by the Trump Administration to include all global health assistance. U.S. funds cannot be used for abortion as a method of family planning or involuntary sterilizations, but foreign recipients of USAID grants can use their own resources for abortion-related activities if legal, with separate accounts required for U.S. money to show compliance. The Mexico City policy requires organizations receiving USAID funds to certify they do not promote abortion. It was reinstated by President George W. Bush in 2001 and expanded in 2003. Exceptions are allowed for cases of rape, incest, or life-threatening conditions. President Bush reinstated the Mexico City policy in 2001, with exceptions for cases of rape, incest, and life-threatening conditions. President Obama revoked the policy in January 2009, citing overly broad conditions on grants and assistance awards. President Trump reinstated the Mexico City policy in January 2017, expanding it to include global health assistance. He directed the Secretary of State to implement the policy for all departments and agencies to ensure U.S. taxpayer dollars do not fund certain organizations. The Trump Administration expanded the Mexico City policy to include global health assistance, named \"Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance\" (PLGHA), to ensure that U.S. taxpayer dollars do not fund organizations supporting coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization. This policy applies to about $8.8 billion in funding for international health programs appropriated to various departments and agencies. The \"Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance\" policy applies to $8.8 billion in funding for international health programs, excluding assistance to governments and humanitarian activities. It includes programs for HIV/AIDS, maternal and child health, malaria, global health security, and family planning. The \"Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance\" policy applies to $8.8 billion in funding for international health programs, excluding assistance to governments and humanitarian activities. It includes exemptions for rape, incest, and conditions threatening the mother's life, as well as postabortion care. In May 2018, the Trump Administration published a six-month review on the policy's implementation, acknowledging it was too early to assess all benefits and challenges. The six-month review of the PLGHA policy for global health assistance found that some recipients refused to agree to the terms, highlighting challenges in understanding the policy's intent and compliance. Further review of implementation is planned to address these issues. The department plans to review the implementation of Policy Determination 3 (PD-3) on voluntary sterilization (VS) by December 15, 2018. PD-3 aims to protect the needs and rights of individuals receiving USAID-funded voluntary sterilization services through requirements such as informed consent. The USAID voluntary sterilization services under PD-3 require informed consent, ready access to other family planning methods, and prohibit incentive payments. Other family planning methods should be available at a common location, without incentive payments for sterilization acceptance. Fee structures should not create financial incentives for sterilization over other methods. PD-3 also provides guidance on payments to service acceptors, providers, and referral agents. Certain types of payment are not considered incentives provided they are \"reasonable.\" Determination of a reasonable payment must be based on a country- and program-specific basis using knowledge of social and economic circumstances. VS acceptors may receive recompense for legitimate extra expenses related to VS, VS service providers may receive per-case payment and compensation for related items, and VS service referral agents may receive per-case payment for extra expenses incurred in informing or referring VS clients. PD-3 applies to family planning assistance funded by USAID for voluntary sterilization activities, covering U.S. NGOs, foreign NGOs, public international organizations, and governments."
