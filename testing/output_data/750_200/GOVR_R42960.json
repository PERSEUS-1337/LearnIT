    "content": "The Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984 reformed patent and drug laws to balance innovation and competition in the pharmaceutical industry. Congressional focus has shifted to pharmaceutical patent litigation settlements. Congressional attention has been on pharmaceutical patent litigation settlements. Brand-name drug companies must litigate in federal courts to enforce patents against generic competitors, leading to either blocking generic competition or allowing market entry. Pharmaceutical patent litigation settlements may involve agreements where generic firms do not challenge brand-name patents or sell generic versions of drugs in exchange for cash payments. These payments, known as \"exclusion\" or \"exit\" payments, are sometimes referred to as \"reverse\" payments. Some observers term these settlements as \"pay-for-delay\" agreements, with differing views on their legality. Congress has required notification of pharmaceutical patent settlements to antitrust authorities since 2003. Since 2003, Congress has mandated notification of pharmaceutical patent settlements to antitrust authorities. However, no substantive standards have been set for evaluating these agreements under antitrust laws, leaving the determination to the courts. Lower courts have reached conflicting conclusions on whether certain reverse payment settlements violate antitrust laws. The U.S. Supreme Court's decision on June 17, 2013, addressed this issue. The U.S. Supreme Court's June 17, 2013 decision in Federal Trade Commission v. Actavis, Inc. established that reverse payment settlements should be evaluated under the \"rule of reason\" approach, rather than being presumptively illegal. Lower courts now have the task of applying this standard to future cases, while legislation before Congress also addresses reverse payment settlements. Legislation before the 113th Congress addresses reverse payment settlements in pharmaceutical patent litigation. The Preserve Access to Affordable Generics Act (S. 214) and the FAIR Generics Act (S. 504) aim to regulate these settlements. The legislation introduces reforms to reduce incentives for generic firms to settle with brand-name companies. This report analyzes innovation and competition policy issues related to pharmaceutical patent litigation settlements. The report examines innovation and competition policy issues in pharmaceutical patent litigation settlements, focusing on reverse payment settlements and their status under antitrust laws. It also discusses congressional issues and possible alternatives. Inventors must submit patent applications to the USPTO for patent protection, which are assessed by examiners for merit. To obtain patent protection, inventors must submit patent applications to the USPTO for assessment by examiners. The application must include a detailed description of the invention and at least one claim. Examiners evaluate if the invention meets patentability criteria such as novelty and nonobviousness. To obtain patent protection, inventors must submit patent applications to the USPTO for assessment by examiners. The invention must meet patentability criteria such as novelty and nonobviousness. Novelty requires that the invention is not fully anticipated by prior knowledge, while nonobviousness means it must not be easily within the skills of an artisan based on prior art. If the USPTO grants the patent, the owner obtains the rights. The USPTO grants patents to inventors based on novelty and nonobviousness criteria. Patent owners have the right to exclude others from using, selling, or importing the invention for twenty years. This exclusivity allows inventors to profit from their discoveries. The grant of a patent allows inventors to profit from their discoveries by excluding others from using or selling the invention for twenty years. Patent owners must monitor competitors and may need to litigate to enforce their intellectual property rights. To enforce intellectual property rights, patent owners often need to go to federal district courts. While a patent grants proprietary rights to a pharmaceutical product, FDA approval is required before distribution. Developers must prove the safety and effectiveness of new drugs through preclinical and clinical investigations for FDA marketing approval. Prior to the Hatch-Waxman Act, generic drug manufacturers had to file their own New Drug Application (NDA) to sell their products, even if the drug had already been approved by the FDA. Some manufacturers could submit a \"paper NDA\" based on published scientific literature to demonstrate safety and efficacy. Some generic manufacturers could rely on published scientific literature to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the drug by submitting a \"paper NDA.\" However, not all generic firms could file a paper NDA as some were required to provide additional studies by the FDA. This resulted in some manufacturers having to prove the safety and effectiveness of their chemically identical products. The approval of generic drugs was seen as costly and time-consuming, leading to a lack of generic equivalents for expired patented drugs. In response, the Hatch-Waxman Act was enacted to create an expedited approval pathway for generic pharmaceutical companies. The Hatch-Waxman Act created an expedited approval pathway for generic drugs through Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs), allowing generic manufacturers to demonstrate bioequivalence to pioneer drugs without extensive clinical data. This process helps generic companies avoid costs and delays associated with full-fledged New Drug Applications (NDAs). The Hatch-Waxman Act allows generic manufacturers to avoid costs and delays by filing ANDAs instead of NDAs. It also provides patent proprietors with a way to extend their patent term by up to five years, with a total effective patent term not exceeding 14 years. The Hatch-Waxman Act allows generic manufacturers to file ANDAs instead of NDAs to avoid costs and delays. It also allows patent proprietors to extend their patent term by up to five years, with a total effective patent term not exceeding 14 years. The scope of rights during the extension period is limited to the approved use of the product that faced regulatory delays, compensating brand-name firms for their investment in pre-clinical and clinical data. The Hatch-Waxman Act established procedures for resolving patent disputes related to generic drugs, allowing brand-name pharmaceutical firms to list patents that could be infringed by generic products. The Hatch-Waxman Act allows brand-name pharmaceutical firms to list patents in the Orange Book that could be infringed by generic drugs. Generic drug manufacturers must then certify their views on these patents when submitting an ANDA application. The Hatch-Waxman Act requires generic drug manufacturers to certify their views on patents listed in the Orange Book when submitting an ANDA application. Certifications include paragraph I, II, III, and IV, indicating various scenarios related to the patent status of the drug. Approval for ANDAs certified under paragraphs I or II is immediate upon meeting regulatory requirements. The Hatch-Waxman Act requires generic drug manufacturers to certify their views on patents listed in the Orange Book when submitting an ANDA application. Approval for ANDAs certified under paragraphs I or II is immediate upon meeting regulatory requirements, while ANDAs with a paragraph III certification must wait for the brand-name drug's patent to expire. Filing an ANDA with a paragraph IV certification constitutes patent infringement, requiring notification to the patent owner and potential litigation. The Hatch-Waxman Act incentivizes challenges to pharmaceutical patents by awarding a 180-day exclusivity period to the first generic drug applicant filing a paragraph IV certification. This prevents the FDA from approving subsequent generic drug applications with a paragraph IV certification for the same drug product for 180 days, potentially leading to a drop in market prices. Following 2003 amendments to the Hatch-Waxman Act, a first paragraph IV ANDA applicant may lose its entitlement to the 180-day generic exclusivity period. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act established \"forfeiture events\" that can result in this loss. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act established forfeiture events for generic exclusivity, including failure to market promptly, obtain FDA approval timely, and expiration of certified patents. This was to prevent 'parking' of exclusivity periods and prompt market entry by generic manufacturers. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act established forfeiture events for generic exclusivity to prevent 'parking' of exclusivity periods. Generic firms filing a paragraph IV ANDA may face patent infringement suits from brand-name drug companies, leading to injunctions preventing marketing of the product until the NDA holder's patents expire. Independent generic companies often amend their ANDAs to replace paragraph IV certifications with paragraph III. The expiration of generic exclusivity may coincide with the NDA holder's patents. Independent generic companies may amend their ANDAs, replacing paragraph IV certifications with paragraph III. Courts may rule in favor of the generic firm, allowing them to launch their product once FDA approval is obtained. The approval of the ANDA led to various resolutions in pharmaceutical patent litigation cases. Upon filing a paragraph IV ANDA, a generic firm could be sued for patent infringement under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The NDA holder and generic applicant would then settle, with the generic firm agreeing not to challenge the patent or produce a generic version of the drug for a specified period in exchange for compensation. Reverse payment settlements involve the NDA holder compensating the ANDA applicant to refrain from challenging the patent or producing a generic version of the drug. These settlements have raised concerns about anticompetitive behavior and collusion between firms to restrict output and share profits. Additionally, they eliminate the possibility of a judicial ruling of patent invalidity, which could open the market to generic competition. Reverse payment settlements involve the NDA holder compensating the ANDA applicant to refrain from challenging the patent or producing a generic version of the drug. Some view these settlements as potentially anticompetitive and collusive, as they eliminate the risk of a judicial ruling of patent invalidity that could benefit consumers by opening the market to generic competition. However, others argue that settlements promote a judicial policy favoring resolution, allowing parties to avoid litigation expenses and achieve a timely resolution while preserving scarce judicial resources. Settlement of litigation serves the goal of resolving disputes peacefully, preserving judicial resources, and involves an exchange of benefits and obligations between rational actors. Judge Richard Posner explains that any settlement agreement includes \"compensation\" to the defendant, leading to potential restrictions on patent settlements. Reverse payment settlements in patent agreements may allow for generic competition before the patent expires, benefiting consumers compared to a judgment of patent validity. Dispute settlement procedures under the Hatch-Waxman Act may also promote resolution. Reverse payment settlements in pharmaceutical patent litigation may be promoted by the dispute settlement procedures established by the Hatch-Waxman Act. In such cases, the accused infringer may compensate the patent proprietor to avoid the risk of an infringement finding and potential injunction. The Hatch-Waxman Act may alter the balance of risks between patent holders and accused infringers in pharmaceutical patent litigation. The Act allows generic manufacturers to challenge patent validity without facing the risk of infringing commercial sales. This can lead to accused infringers being willing to compensate patent holders to avoid the risk of infringement findings and potential injunctions. The unique procedures of the Hatch-Waxman Act have led to reverse payment settlements in pharmaceutical patent litigation. Congressional action on these settlements has been limited. The Hatch-Waxman Act has led to reverse payment settlements in pharmaceutical patent litigation. Congressional action on these settlements has been limited, with the 2003 Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act mandating the DOJ and FTC to receive copies of certain patent settlement agreements. These agreements trigger a notification requirement if they relate to specific topics. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act mandates the DOJ and FTC to receive copies of certain patent settlement agreements related to specific topics, triggering a notification requirement. Agreements not subject to this requirement include those solely consisting of purchase orders for raw materials, equipment, and facility contracts. The FTC reported receiving 140 final resolutions of patent disputes between brand and generic companies during FY2012, with 40 settlements potentially involving pay-for-delay payments. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act imposed a filing obligation on certain patent settlements but did not establish substantive standards for their validity. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act imposed a filing obligation on certain patent settlements between pharmaceutical firms, without setting substantive standards for their validity. Various government and private actors claimed that some reverse payment settlements violated antitrust laws, leading to different court outcomes based on general antitrust principles. The report reviews judicial opinions on reverse payment settlements in antitrust law, which includes the Sherman Act, Clayton Act, and Federal Trade Commission Act. These laws prohibit anticompetitive economic conduct. More detailed information on antitrust laws can be found in other sources. The Sherman Act, part of antitrust laws, declares illegal any contract, combination, or conspiracy that restrains trade unreasonably. Courts use the \"rule of reason\" to determine if a practice violates this law by assessing its impact on competition. The rule of reason in antitrust laws requires courts to assess if a practice unreasonably restrains competition by considering various factors. This involves balancing the anticompetitive effects with the business justifications and potential procompetitive impact. Certain restraints are deemed unlawful per se when past experience allows confident predictions about their anticompetitive nature. Certain restraints are considered per se violations in antitrust laws, meaning they are conclusively presumed to be unreasonable and illegal without further inquiry. Examples include price fixing, group boycotts, and market division. The \"quick look\" or \"truncated rule of reason\" approach in antitrust law applies when a defendant engages in practices similar to per se violations. The defendant must show pro-competitive justifications to avoid liability for antitrust violations. The courts have differing approaches to reverse payment settlements in pharmaceutical patent litigation, with some subjecting such agreements to strict antitrust scrutiny. The Sixth Circuit opinion in In re Cardizem CD Antitrust Litigation held a reverse payment settlement agreement between Hoescht Marion Roussel Inc. and Andrx Pharmaceuticals as per se invalid. The Sixth Circuit deemed the settlement agreement between Hoescht Marion Roussel Inc. and Andrx Pharmaceuticals as per se invalid due to it being classified as a horizontal agreement, a restraint of trade at the same level of competition. Despite early precedent, other Courts of Appeals ruled that reverse payment settlements were permissible as long as they did not exceed the scope of the patent. The Eleventh Circuit ruled that reverse payment settlements are permissible as long as they do not exceed the scope of the patent. In Valley Drug Co. v. Geneva Pharmaceuticals, agreements between Abbott Laboratories and generic firms were challenged for being a horizontal market allocation, but the Court of Appeals remanded the matter for further determination. The Eleventh Circuit reversed the per se illegality standard for reverse payment settlements, remanding for scrutiny of agreement parts beyond patent protection. Criteria include no extension beyond patent scope, non-baseless infringement claim, and no USPTO fraud. The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit rejected the scope of the patent test in antitrust cases involving reverse payment settlements, stating that it restricts antitrust law application and goes against the policies of the Hatch-Waxman Act and Supreme Court precedent on patent litigation and competition. The Third Circuit criticized the weight placed on the presumption of validity by courts following the scope of the patent test. The Third Circuit rejected the scope of the patent test in antitrust cases involving reverse payment settlements, stating that it restricts antitrust law application and goes against the policies of the Hatch-Waxman Act and Supreme Court precedent on patent litigation and competition. The Court of Appeals believed that courts had placed too much weight on the presumption of validity accorded to granted patents, which was deemed a procedural device rather than a substantive right of the patent holder. The Third Circuit rejected the scope of the patent test in antitrust cases involving reverse payment settlements, adopting a \"quick rule of reason\" test instead. This new test presumed that reverse payments were anticompetitive, but parties could rebut this by showing pro-competitive benefits. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case due to conflicts between lower courts. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case of Federal Trade Commission v. Actavis, Inc regarding reverse payment settlements in antitrust cases. The Court held that these settlements should be evaluated under the \"rule of reason\" approach, without being presumptively illegal under a \"quick look\" analysis. Solvay Pharmaceuticals, the NDA holder of ANDROGEL\u00ae, filed charges of patent infringement against generic firms Actavis and Paddock Laboratories under the Hatch-Waxman Act. Solvay Pharmaceuticals filed patent infringement charges against generic firms Actavis and Paddock Laboratories for ANDROGEL\u00ae. The case was settled with the generic firms receiving money in exchange for delaying the launch of their generic products until 2015. The FTC later accused the parties of unlawfully sharing monopoly profits and avoiding competition for nine years. The FTC accused Solvay Pharmaceuticals and generic firms of sharing monopoly profits and avoiding competition by delaying the launch of generic products for nine years. The District Court rejected the FTC's claims, but the Supreme Court later reversed the judgment in a 5-3 ruling. The Supreme Court reversed the judgment of the Eleventh Circuit in a 5-3 ruling, stating that anticompetitive effects of the agreement between Solvay and generic firms fell within the scope of its patent. Holder of a valid patent may be exempt from antitrust liability, but litigation under the Hatch-Waxman Act involves assertions of patent invalidity or noninfringement. The Supreme Court ruled that anticompetitive effects of agreements under the Hatch-Waxman Act must be measured against procompetitive antitrust policies, not just patent law policy. This is important as litigation in such cases involves claims of patent invalidity or noninfringement, potentially impacting competition. The Supreme Court ruled that anticompetitive effects of agreements under the Hatch-Waxman Act must be measured against procompetitive antitrust policies, not just patent law policy. This involves considering traditional antitrust factors such as likely anticompetitive effects, redeeming virtues, market power, and potentially offsetting legal considerations related to patents. The Supreme Court ruled that the Hatch-Waxman Act's structure supports subjecting reverse payment settlements to antitrust scrutiny. Justice Breyer cited five considerations against the Eleventh Circuit's holding, despite acknowledging the policy favoring dispute settlement. The Supreme Court ruled that the Hatch-Waxman Act's structure supports subjecting reverse payment settlements to antitrust scrutiny. Justice Breyer cited five considerations against the Eleventh Circuit's holding, emphasizing the potential anticompetitive effects of large and unjustified reverse payments in settling patent disputes. The Supreme Court ruled that reverse payment settlements should be subject to antitrust scrutiny, emphasizing the potential anticompetitive effects of unjustified payments in settling patent disputes. Justice Breyer rejected near-automatic antitrust immunity for such settlements and declined to adopt a presumptively unlawful approach suggested by the Commission. The Supreme Court ruled that reverse payment settlements should be subject to antitrust scrutiny, emphasizing the potential anticompetitive effects of unjustified payments in settling patent disputes. The Court concluded that the FTC must establish antitrust liability using a detailed analysis rather than a quick-look approach. The Supreme Court ruled that reverse payment settlements must undergo antitrust scrutiny, emphasizing the potential anticompetitive effects of unjustified payments in settling patent disputes. The Court determined that the FTC must establish antitrust liability using a detailed analysis, rejecting a quick-look approach. Chief Justice Roberts, along with Justices Scalia and Thomas, dissented, suggesting that antitrust law should only be violated if the settlement exceeds the patent scope, involves fraud, or includes sham litigation. They expressed concerns that the majority ruling could deter generic firms from challenging patents, hinder patent litigation settlements, and weaken patent protection. The dissenters were concerned that the majority ruling in Actavis could discourage generic firms from challenging patents, hinder patent litigation settlements, and weaken patent protection. The Supreme Court's decision does not prevent pharmaceutical firms from settling litigation under the Hatch-Waxman Act, but parties will need to carefully structure and explain their agreements. Those unwilling to make the effort may have to litigate their pharmaceutical patent cases to a final conclusion. Lower courts now face the challenge of applying the rule of reason to existing agreements. The lower courts are tasked with applying the rule of reason in Hatch-Waxman cases, which may involve complex issues of patent validity and infringement. Justice Breyer believes antitrust cases may not always require a detailed examination of patents, while the Chief Justice sees patent issues as central to antitrust disputes. Congress has various options, including waiting for further judicial developments. One option for Congress is to regulate pharmaceutical patent litigation settlements. The Preserve Access to Affordable Generics Act in the 113th Congress addresses reverse payment settlements as acts of unfair competition. The Preserve Access to Affordable Generics Act, S. 27, aims to regulate reverse payment settlements in pharmaceutical patent litigation. It would presume such agreements as anticompetitive and unlawful unless proven otherwise by clear and convincing evidence of procompetitive benefits outweighing anticompetitive effects. The Fair and Immediate Release of Generics Act, S. 504, proposes changes to the Hatch-Waxman Act to discourage reverse payment settlements. It grants generic firms the right to share regulatory exclusivity if they win a patent challenge or are not sued for patent infringement by the brand company. The legislation proposed in the Fair and Immediate Release of Generics Act, S. 504, aims to discourage reverse payment settlements in pharmaceutical patent litigation. It grants generic firms the right to share regulatory exclusivity if they win a patent challenge or are not sued for patent infringement by the brand company. Additionally, the legislation obligates generic firms to abide by any deferred entry date agreed upon in settlements with brand-name firms, and requires brand-name firms to make a decision on enforcing their patents within 45 days of being notified of a patent challenge by a generic firm under the Hatch-Waxman Act. Pharmaceutical patent litigation is crucial for public health, balancing the development of new medicines by brand-name companies with increased access through generic firms. The Hatch-Waxman Act mediates disputes between these rivals, with settlements that align with antitrust principles benefiting medical innovation and consumer access."
