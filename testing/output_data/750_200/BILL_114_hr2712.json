Employers can use this system for plan years starting after December 31, 2015. The Secretary of the Treasury will implement a voluntary reporting system for employers to report essential coverage details for full-time employees, dependents, and certification information.

Employers providing prospective reporting through the system created under subsection (a) will be considered as meeting return requirements of section 6056 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 for the calendar year in which the plan year ends. Additionally, they will be deemed to satisfy the requirements of section 6056(c) of the Code if they furnish the necessary statement to the Internal Revenue Service.

ELIGIBILITY VERIFICATION PROCESS FOR ACA SUBSIDIES. A marketplace can automatically reenroll an individual in a qualified health plan annually, as long as eligibility for subsidies is redetermined and changes in premiums and the Federal poverty level are considered. The marketplace must consider annual changes in premiums, the Federal poverty level, and the individual's most recent income data when redetermining eligibility for subsidies. If the marketplace does not follow the specified processes, the individual cannot be automatically reenrolled in a qualified health plan with subsidies until current income information is provided for redetermination. The marketplace requires current income information for eligibility redetermination for subsidies and credits, following guidance from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The marketplace must ensure comprehensive guidance for annual eligibility redeterminations and reenrollments for coverage and tax credits. Enrollees eligible for automatic reenrollment in a health plan must provide authorization for disclosure of information. The marketplace must provide authorization for disclosure of information to verify eligibility for credits or cost-sharing reductions, request updated income information annually, and give timely notices for redeterminations and reenrollments. The term \"marketplace\" refers to State Based Exchanges and the Federally Facilitated Exchange under the Affordable Care Act."
