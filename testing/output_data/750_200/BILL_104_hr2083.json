    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Tax Reduction and Economic Growth Act of 1995\" and includes provisions for tax reduction in the event of low growth. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget must notify the President and Congress if economic growth is below 1.5% and national unemployment is above 6.5%. The national unemployment rate is estimated to be greater than 6.5 percent. Testing periods are defined for notification purposes. Presidential authorization of temporary tax reductions is discussed. After notification of high unemployment rates, the President may declare temporary tax reductions for a specified year to stimulate the economy. The declaration must be transmitted to Congress for approval. If the President transmits a declaration to Congress, temporary tax reductions may be implemented for a specified year to stimulate the economy. This would involve reducing the rates applicable to the first income bracket in the tax tables by a certain percentage. The Revenue Code of 1986 may be reduced by up to 3 percent as specified in a presidential declaration, leading to adjustments in tax amounts in the tables. The Secretary of the Treasury can make withholding adjustments accordingly. The Secretary of the Treasury can modify withholding tables under section 3402(a) of the Revenue Code of 1986 to reflect a reduction of up to 3 percent specified in a presidential declaration. This adjustment should be made for the full calendar year effect, with withholding reductions implemented after the declaration. Effective for taxable years beginning in the first subsequent calendar year for which the economic growth requirements are satisfied, tax rates in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 will be increased by a certain percentage determined for that year. The tax rates in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 will be increased by a certain percentage for taxable years beginning in the first subsequent calendar year, with exceptions for individuals with Adjusted Gross Income below $50,000 and joint filers below $75,000. The tax rates in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 will be adjusted to reflect rate increases for subsequent calendar years. Withholding tables will be modified to account for the increase in tax rates. Economic growth requirements will also be considered. The tax rates in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 will be adjusted to reflect rate increases for subsequent calendar years. Withholding tables will be modified to account for the increase in tax rates. Economic growth requirements will also be considered, with the President determining if economic growth exceeds 4.5 percent based on the change in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The estimated economic growth is over 4.5 percent, and the national unemployment rate is below 5.5 percent. The percentage increase in tax rates will be determined by the President to balance the decrease in receipts under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The President will determine the percentage increase in tax rates to balance the decrease in receipts under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 without raising taxes for individuals with Adjusted Gross Income below $50,000 and joint filers below $75,000. The percentage will be published in the Federal Register before the start of the relevant calendar year. The Act specifies that any changes in receipts from the previous section will not be factored into the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985."
