    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"National Science Education Incentive Act of 2005\". The Congress finds that the United States must maintain its position in science and technology to advance human understanding and improve lives. Over half of the country's economic growth is directly linked to this. Research and development in science and technology drive over half of the United States' economic growth. Fundamental research explores the universe and seeks answers to new questions, while applied research applies these findings to real-world problems. The United States' economic growth relies heavily on research and development in science and technology. Education is crucial in developing intellectual capital for innovation and economic progress, requiring scientists and engineers to drive research and development efforts. The United States relies on scientists and engineers for economic growth through research and development. It also needs technologically proficient workers and scientifically literate voters for a science-based, high-technology workplace and informed public policy decisions. Student performance in math and science education shows current shortcomings in K-12 education. The International Student Assessment highlights deficiencies in K-12 science and math education in the United States compared to other countries. Improved teaching methods, curricula, teacher training, and parental involvement are needed to enhance student performance. Science is emphasized as a process of inquiry, not just a collection of facts and theories. Science is a process of inquiry based on observations and data, leading to an understanding of the universe through concepts and theories. Students should learn by doing science, with education being object-oriented, experiment-centered, and concept-based. Starting science education early taps into children's natural curiosity and inquisitiveness. To ensure successful education in science, it is crucial to start at an early age and continue throughout the school experience. Teachers play a vital role in connecting students with the content they are learning. High-quality teachers should be recruited by offering a respected, financially rewarding career with opportunities for advancement. Incentives and training are essential for teachers to remain in the classroom and improve their practice. Teachers must have incentives to remain in the classroom and improve their practice, and training is essential for superior results. They need to be knowledgeable about their content area, curriculum, up-to-date research in teaching and learning, and techniques to connect with students. A new section, SEC. 36, provides a refundable credit for undergraduate tuition paid by certain teachers. This aims to support teachers in improving their practice and staying in the classroom.

The new section, SEC. 36, defines an 'eligible teacher' as a full-time teacher in grades K-12 for the academic year, teaching primarily math, science, engineering, or technology courses in grades 9-12. The new section, SEC. 36, defines an 'eligible teacher' as a full-time teacher in grades K-12 for the academic year, teaching primarily math, science, engineering, or technology courses in grades 9-12, who holds a degree in mathematics, science, engineering, or technology from an institution of higher education and is highly qualified. The new section, SEC. 36, defines an 'eligible teacher' as a full-time teacher in grades K-12 for the academic year, teaching primarily math, science, engineering, or technology courses in grades 9-12, who holds a degree in mathematics, science, engineering, or technology from an institution of higher education and is highly qualified. School administrative functions can be considered as teaching courses if they primarily relate to such courses or are for a school focusing on such courses. Qualified undergraduate tuition refers to qualified higher education expenses for this section. The term 'qualified undergraduate tuition' in SEC. 36 refers to qualified higher education expenses for enrollment at an institution of higher education, as defined in the Higher Education Act of 1965. The Secretary will prescribe regulations for this section. The Secretary will prescribe regulations for SEC. 36 to carry out its purposes. Amendments are made to section 1324(b) of title 31, United States Code, and the table of sections for subpart C of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The amendments in SEC. 36 relate to tuition for undergraduate education of certain teachers and overpayments of tax. The effective date for these amendments applies to taxable years beginning after the enactment of the Act. Only periods of being an eligible teacher after the enactment date will be considered for tax purposes. SEC. 4 introduces credits for contributions benefiting STEM education at the elementary and secondary school level. SEC. 4 introduces credits for contributions benefiting STEM education at the elementary and secondary school level under SEC. 45J of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The section introduces a tax credit for STEM contributions at elementary and secondary schools, including school contributions, teacher externship expenses, and teacher training expenses. The section defines STEM school contributions as STEM property and service contributions, with STEM property contributions referring to deductible amounts for charitable contributions of STEM inventory property to eligible elementary or secondary schools. The section describes criteria for property donations to schools, including the use of the property, original use beginning with the donee, fit into the education plan, and no transfer by the donee. The criteria for property donations to schools include fitting into the donee's education plan, no transfer for money or services, and compliance with specified provisions. Deductions are determined as if the limitation under section 170(e)(3)(B) applied to all STEM donations. The term 'STEM service contributions' refers to payments made for STEM services provided in the US or defense dependents' education system for students at specific schools, if the taxpayer is in the business of providing such services commercially. The term 'STEM inventory property' refers to property donated to a school that is deemed necessary for providing education in grades. The term 'STEM services' refers to services needed by a school for education in grades K-12 in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics. The term 'STEM teacher externship expenses' refers to amounts paid for a STEM externship program, as defined in the Defense Dependents' Education Act of 1978. The term 'STEM teacher externship expenses' refers to amounts paid for a STEM externship program established by a taxpayer in the fields of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics, for eligible STEM teachers participating in the program. The term 'eligible STEM teacher' refers to any K-12 teacher in the US who receives training to enhance their teaching skills in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics. The term 'STEM teacher training expenses' refers to amounts paid or incurred by a K-12 teacher in the US at an educational organization, including those on a US military base, whose teaching responsibilities involve science, technology, engineering, or mathematics courses. The term 'STEM teacher training expenses' refers to amounts paid or incurred by a taxpayer in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics for training programs enhancing teaching skills. No double benefit deduction is allowed under this chapter. The section prohibits deduction for any amount claimed as a credit.
