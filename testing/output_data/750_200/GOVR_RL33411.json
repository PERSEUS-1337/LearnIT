    "content": "The Great Lakes watershed, spanning 300,000 square miles across eight U.S. states and one Canadian province, holds nearly 90% of the U.S. surface freshwater and 20% of the world's. It is vital for the economies of both countries and supports a population of around 40 million people. The Great Lakes basin, holding 20% of the world's surface freshwater, supports 40 million people for jobs, drinking water, and recreation. However, agricultural and urban development have degraded water quality, posing threats to wildlife and human health. Development along the Great Lakes shoreline has degraded water quality, posing threats to wildlife, human health, and the ecosystem. Restoration activities are being implemented by federal and state governments in response to these challenges. Congress has enacted legislation to support restoration efforts in the Great Lakes. The U.S. Congress has enacted over 30 federal laws to support restoration activities in the Great Lakes ecosystem, including grant programs for toxic substance mitigation and water quality improvement. However, there is no comprehensive plan like the Everglades Restoration Plan in Florida. The Great Lakes Interagency Task Force, established in 2004, provides strategic direction on federal Great Lakes policy. Chaired by the EPA Administrator, it includes 10 agency and cabinet-level officers. The task force collaborates with various groups to form the Great Lakes Regional Collaboration for restoration efforts. The Great Lakes Regional Collaboration was formed by the Great Lakes Cities Initiative, tribes, and Congressional Task Force. It includes representatives from states, communities, tribes, NGOs, and other interests in the region. The Collaboration's goals were outlined in the Great Lakes Framework, with the first goal being to create a strategy to restore and protect the Great Lakes within a year. The Collaboration Strategy was released in December 2005. The Great Lakes Regional Collaboration Strategy, released in December 2005, aims to restore and protect the Great Lakes ecosystem through recommendations for actions to be implemented over the next five years. It serves as a forum for addressing regional issues and coordinating the Strategy's implementation. The Great Lakes Regional Collaboration Strategy, released in December 2005, outlines priorities for restoration over the next five years. It covers eight issue areas including aquatic invasive species, habitat, coastal health, pollution, and sustainable development. Each issue area includes recommendations and specific activities justified by collaboration. The Great Lakes Regional Collaboration Strategy outlines activities ranging from supporting existing programs to creating new ones, with estimated costs provided for implementing recommendations over five years. Goals and interim milestones are also included for each issue area, relying on existing authorities, programs, and funding at federal, state, and local levels of government. The Strategy relies on existing authorities, programs, and funding at various government levels, with some new actions required. It aims to improve coordination among stakeholders and utilize shared resources, including tribes. While some recommendations can be implemented with existing resources, others will need additional funding or substantial new expenditures. The Great Lakes Strategy emphasizes the need for improved coordination among stakeholders and shared resources to address invasive species. Economic losses from invasive species were estimated at $5.0 billion annually in 2005. Some recommendations will require modest additional funding, while others may be impossible to implement without substantial new expenditures. The Strategy is not meant to fully restore the Great Lakes ecosystem but should guide decisions on activities affecting the region. The Great Lakes Strategy aims to prevent the introduction and control the spread of over 160 non-native invasive aquatic species, with economic losses estimated at $5.0 billion annually in 2005. Existing measures to address aquatic invasive species are deemed inadequate, necessitating the prevention of new introductions and the management of existing AIS through various strategies such as controlling ballast water and creating research programs. Development, agricultural expansion, toxic pollutants, and invasive species have contributed to habitat loss and species declines in the Great Lakes ecosystem. The Great Lakes basin has faced habitat loss and species declines due to development, agricultural expansion, toxic pollutants, and invasive species. The ecosystem provides ecosystem services and supports a lucrative recreation industry. The goals include improving fisheries and restoring various habitats. Recommendations suggest increasing funding for habitat conservation and species management by $288 million annually. The recommendations for this issue are to increase habitat conservation and species management funding by $288 million annually through existing programs and new authorizations. Water quality in coastal areas of the Great Lakes is degraded, leading to outbreaks of disease among humans, beach closings, and drinking water advisories. Goals include eliminating untreated waste inputs, reducing toxic contaminants at beaches, and protecting drinking water quality through wet weather programs and improved wastewater treatment systems. The recommendations for improving water quality in the Great Lakes basin include implementing wet weather programs, improving wastewater treatment systems, regulating pollution sources, and managing waters used for recreation. In 1987, the United States and Canada identified 43 Areas of Concern (AOC) in the basin, with contaminated sediments being a common reason for degradation. Sediments can contain toxic pollutants that settle out of the water column, potentially entering the air or food chain when resuspended. The goal is to restore all Areas of Concern in the United States through funding programs under the Great Lakes Legacy Act and developing sediment treatment technologies. Nonpoint source pollution, a major contributor to impaired waters in the Great Lakes ecosystem, comes from diffuse sources and cannot be traced back to specific origins. Nonpoint source pollution in the Great Lakes ecosystem comes from diffuse sources and includes excessive levels of nutrients like phosphorus and nitrogen. Recommendations to address this issue include restoring wetlands and buffer habitat to reduce nutrient loading. The goals of this issue include restoring wetlands and buffer habitat to reduce excess nutrients, reducing soil loss and waste flows into waterways, and virtually eliminating the discharge of persistent toxic substances (PTS) into the ecosystem. Recommendations involve restoring acres of wetlands and buffer habitat, reducing PTS such as mercury, PCBs, dioxins, pesticides, and creating a program to address new toxic chemicals. The Strategy recommends reducing persistent toxic substances (PTS) like mercury, PCBs, dioxins, and pesticides from the ecosystem, conducting research and monitoring in the Great Lakes, and increasing public education. Ecosystem monitoring, research, and indicator development are underfunded, with goals to create a comprehensive monitoring network and conduct coordinated research in the Great Lakes. The Strategy recommends developing science-based indicators of ecosystem health, increasing research funding for the Great Lakes, and coordinating scientific information to balance economic, social, and ecological factors in the region. The goal is to support a strong economy while meeting social and cultural needs in harmony with the ecosystem. The Strategy recommends enhancing sustainable planning and resource use in government programs to promote the livability of the Great Lakes. It calls for $20 billion in funding over five years, with $15.3 billion allocated for coastal health, including $13.7 billion for wastewater treatment systems. The Strategy recommends $20 billion in funding over five years, with $15.3 billion allocated for coastal health, including $13.7 billion for wastewater treatment systems. Some argue that this amount is excessive compared to other ecosystem restoration projects like the Florida Everglades. The Interagency Task Force's annual report stated that the Great Lakes Restoration Strategy should be funded from existing programs, with federal and state governments currently spending $523 million and $100 million annually on related activities. No specific federal spending figures were provided for other ecosystem aspects. Some proponents argue that the $10.5 billion allocated for the Florida Everglades restoration project is more reasonable compared to the Strategy's proposed $20 billion funding over five years. Some proponents argue that the Great Lakes ecosystem restoration requires higher funding due to its size compared to other initiatives. Inadequate funding is seen as a barrier to restoration efforts in the region. Some proponents argue that inadequate funding is a main barrier to Great Lakes ecosystem restoration efforts. Data on current funding levels and cost-sharing plans are lacking in the Strategy, making it difficult to identify funding gaps. The Collaboration and Strategy aim to improve coordination of ecosystem restoration activities in the Great Lakes, addressing the lack of a comprehensive plan and inadequate funding. Some view the Interagency Task Force and Collaboration as entities facilitating coordination, but others believe governance issues need to be addressed for better coordination. The Strategy for ecosystem restoration in the Great Lakes lacks specific governance structure and coordination plans, leaving questions about leadership, federal and state roles, and implementation oversight unanswered. The task force is responsible for coordinating restoration activities but does not provide a clear plan for governance. The task force in the Great Lakes is responsible for coordinating restoration activities and has successfully undertaken coordinated responses to ecosystem issues. The executive committee of the Collaboration will create plans to implement the Strategy, serving as an administrative structure to direct activities, promote accountability, and facilitate coordination of restoration efforts. The committee in the Great Lakes region will direct activities, promote accountability, identify issues, and coordinate restoration efforts among stakeholders. Governance and coordination in large-scale ecosystem restoration initiatives are addressed in federal and state laws, as seen in the Everglades example. The federal law requires policies for stakeholders to interact and implement the Everglades restoration plan. Some argue that the Strategy's cost makes full implementation infeasible within five years. Setting priorities for program implementation could help decision makers allocate limited funds. Priorities discussed include restoring and protecting near-shore areas. At a congressional hearing on the Great Lakes Strategy, priorities discussed included restoring and protecting near-shore and coastal waters, controlling aquatic invasive species, and addressing nonpoint source pollution. The Strategy may serve as a platform for introducing federal legislation for Great Lakes restoration, with two main approaches reflected in pending legislation: authorizing a grant program for restoration projects and reauthorizing existing programs. The Great Lakes Strategy discussed priorities like restoring near-shore waters, controlling invasive species, and addressing pollution. Two approaches in pending legislation are authorizing a grant program for restoration projects and reauthorizing existing programs. One approach in the 109th Congress proposed $4-6 billion for Great Lakes restoration activities. The Strategy does not specify funding sources for its categories. Reauthorizing existing federal programs could enact portions of the Strategy into law, like the Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration Act of 2006. No similar bills have been introduced in the 110th Congress. The Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration Act of 2006 reauthorizes appropriations for the Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Act of 1990 through 2012, with amendments to increase reporting requirements and allow regional projects by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. This strategy is incorporated into bills in the 110th Congress to authorize new programs and support existing ones within the Strategy. The Strategy, part of bills in the 110th Congress, aims to restore the Great Lakes with tasks for the task force, executive committee, and Collaboration beyond its creation. It envisions a five-year plan for restoration and protection. The Strategy aims to restore the Great Lakes in the near term with a five-year plan and a $20 billion price tag. Questions arise about the process, cost, roles, governance, and success measurement in completely restoring the ecosystem. The Strategy aims to restore the Great Lakes in the near term with a five-year plan and a $20 billion price tag. Questions arise about the process, cost, roles, governance, and success measurement in completely restoring the ecosystem. The answers to these questions are not addressed in the Strategy, but may come from the collaborative process that created it."
