    "content": "The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the discovery of Al Qaeda cells in Europe spurred EU efforts to combat terrorism and enhance cooperation in police, judicial, and intelligence fields. The EU, a partnership of 28 member states, aims to promote peace and economic prosperity through European integration. Harmonizing policies in \"justice and home affairs\" has been a long-standing goal for the EU. The EU has long aimed to harmonize policies in \"justice and home affairs\" (JHA) to enhance internal security, protect citizens' rights, and promote free movement within the EU. JHA covers counterterrorism, cross-border crimes, police cooperation, migration, asylum, and border control policies, including rules for the Schengen area. EU's efforts to establish common JHA policies have been ongoing for years. The Schengen area allows passport-free travel among participating countries. EU's attempts to establish common JHA policies were hindered by member state concerns about national sovereignty. The 2001 terrorist attacks prompted EU leaders to enhance law enforcement cooperation and track down suspects. After the 2001 terrorist attacks, European law enforcement efforts led to numerous arrests in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Germany and Spain were identified as key bases for the attacks. European leaders recognized the need to address the ease of movement for terrorists due to open borders and different legal systems within the EU. Most EU member states lacked anti-terrorist legislation at the time. After the 2001 attacks, most EU member states lacked anti-terrorist legislation, allowing terrorists to evade arrest by moving between countries with different laws and codes. Extradition requests often took months to process, highlighting the need for improved cooperation within the EU to combat terrorism. The EU recognized the need to combat terrorism more effectively after the 2001 attacks. Efforts were made to harmonize national laws, enhance cooperation among member states' law enforcement, establish a common definition of terrorism, and streamline the extradition process with an EU arrest warrant. The EU took steps to combat terrorism by establishing a common definition of terrorism, a list of terrorist groups, an EU arrest warrant for extradition, tools to stop terrorist financing, and measures to improve border controls and aviation security. They also strengthened Europol and Eurojust. The urgency to enhance EU counterterrorism capabilities increased after the 2004 Madrid bombings by an Al Qaeda-inspired group. The March 2004 Madrid bombings by an Al Qaeda-inspired group led to EU initiatives to improve travel document security and establish a Counterterrorism Coordinator. The July 2005 London bombings highlighted the issue of \"homegrown\" Islamist terrorism. The July 2005 London bombings brought the issue of \"homegrown\" Islamist extremism to the forefront of European political debate, leading to the EU adopting its first plan to combat radicalization and terrorist recruitment. The EU adopted its first plan to combat radicalization and terrorist recruitment after the 2005 London bombings. The plan includes disrupting terrorist networks, promoting mainstream voices over extremism, and expanding the definition of terrorism to include new criminal offenses. The EU adopted a plan to combat radicalization and terrorist recruitment after the 2005 London bombings. This decision aimed to facilitate the prosecution of individuals involved in terrorist activities and counter the dissemination of terrorist propaganda, including through the Internet. In 2011, the EU established the Radicalisation Awareness Network (RAN) to connect key groups involved in countering radicalization and violent extremism. The EU established the Radicalisation Awareness Network (RAN) in 2011 to connect key groups involved in countering radicalization and violent extremism, serving as an EU-wide forum for exchanging ideas and best practices. Harmonizing laws and concluding EU-wide policies in the JHA field remains a work in progress due to national sovereignty concerns and differing views among member states and EU institutions on sensitive issues like data privacy and intelligence sharing. EU member states retain control over their law enforcement and judicial authorities, with some national police and intelligence services hesitant to share information. Challenges have arisen in addressing threats from terrorist organizations like the Islamic State, as European citizens join these groups in the Middle East and North Africa. The European Union is facing a growing concern over the number of its citizens joining terrorist groups in the Middle East and North Africa. EU authorities estimate that up to 5,000 EU citizens have traveled to fight in conflict zones since 2011. Security services are worried about the potential threat posed by these trained militants returning to Europe, as well as individuals inspired by extremist propaganda to carry out attacks at home. Recent terrorist attacks in Europe have heightened these fears. Recent terrorist attacks in Europe, such as the 2014 Brussels Jewish Museum attack and the 2015 Paris attacks, have raised concerns about individuals inspired by Islamist extremist propaganda to carry out \"lone wolf\" attacks at home. These attacks have been linked to the Islamic State and other extremist groups abroad. The January 7-9, 2015, attacks in Paris, France, targeted Charlie Hebdo, police officers, and a kosher supermarket. Perpetrators were French-born Muslims with possible ties to Al Qaeda or the Islamic State. The February 14-15, 2015, shootings in Copenhagen, Denmark, involved a self-radicalized Danish citizen of Palestinian descent. The attempted August 21, 2015, attack on a train from Amsterdam to Paris was thwarted by passengers, including three Americans. The November 13, 2015, coordinated attacks in Paris left 130 dead and over 350 injured. The assailants were French or Belgian citizens linked to the Islamic State. The recent attacks in Europe have revealed weaknesses in domestic security and border controls. European authorities struggle to monitor potential assailants due to insufficient information sharing among EU countries' law enforcement and intelligence services. Some attackers have exploited the Schengen system and chaos in the region. The recent attacks in Europe have exposed flaws in security and border controls, with inadequate information sharing among EU countries' law enforcement and intelligence services. Perpetrators have exploited the Schengen system and migrant influxes, traveling between European countries before carrying out attacks. The recent attacks in Europe have revealed security and border control flaws, with perpetrators exploiting the Schengen system and migrant influxes. Two attackers entered Europe through Greece with fake Syrian passports, while another suspect entered Belgium from France after the Paris attacks. The EU faces challenges in implementing common policies to counter terrorism and the foreign fighter threat. The EU has faced challenges in implementing common policies to counter terrorism and the foreign fighter threat, due to issues related to sovereignty and balancing security with human rights. Despite some progress on EU initiatives, skepticism remains about their effectiveness. EU initiatives aim to address the foreign fighter threat by enhancing information sharing among national authorities and utilizing common EU databases like the Schengen Information System and Europol's Focal Point Travellers database. Europol launched a European Counter Terrorism initiative in January 2016. Europol's Focal Point Travellers database was established in 2013 to collect information on European fighters. In January 2016, Europol launched the European Counter Terrorism Centre for information sharing and cooperation among member states. Success of these initiatives relies on receiving information from national authorities, with an increase in alerts entered into SIS and data contributed to Europol databases noted by EU officials. EU officials note an increase in alerts entered into SIS and data contributed to Europol databases. However, concerns remain about EU-wide information sharing related to terrorism. The proposal for an EU-wide Passenger Name Record (PNR) system has been stalled since 2013 due to data privacy issues, but pressure to adopt it intensified after the 2015 Paris attacks. Following the 2015 Paris attacks, there was increased political pressure to implement an EU-wide Passenger Name Record (PNR) system to enhance information sharing on foreign fighters and track their movements. EU officials argued for harmonization across member states on PNR collection and data protection practices. In December 2015, a provisional agreement was reached between the Parliament and EU governments. The PNR proposal was necessary for harmonization across the EU on PNR collection, usage, and data protection. In December 2015, a provisional agreement was reached between the Parliament and EU governments. Airlines will be obliged to provide PNR data for flights into and out of EU territory, and member states can collect PNR data from intra-EU flights and non-carrier economic operators. Critics argue against the envisioned PNR system. The EU governments signed a \"letter of intent\" to collect PNR data, despite critics' concerns about data privacy rights. The agreement does not establish a centralized EU PNR database but calls for the exchange of PNR data between EU members. EU governments have two years to implement the agreement's provisions. The EU urged national authorities to use security tools to strengthen external border controls in response to the foreign fighter threat. Resistance to amending the Schengen Borders Code to allow more extensive checks of EU nationals at borders was due to concerns about potential reimposition of internal border controls. The European Commission proposed a \"targeted modification\" of the Schengen Borders Code to introduce mandatory checks of EU citizens against law enforcement databases at the external borders. This was in response to the surge of migrants, refugees, and security concerns following the attacks in Paris. The European Commission proposed mandatory checks of EU citizens against law enforcement databases at the Schengen area's external borders. Additionally, the EU is working on establishing a new European Border and Coast Guard to strengthen border security. efforts to counter terrorist ideologies, especially online, are also being made. The EU has established an Internet Referral Unit (IRU) to monitor and remove terrorist content online. They also launched an Internet Forum to collaborate with technology companies in countering terrorist propaganda. Member states are urged to address societal factors contributing to terrorism. The EU is working on revising its Framework Decision on Combating Terrorism to criminalize traveling abroad for terrorist purposes and receiving terrorist training throughout the EU. Harmonizing criminal laws in the EU has faced challenges due to varying national policies on crime and punishment. EU is revising its Framework Decision on Combating Terrorism to criminalize traveling abroad for terrorist purposes and receiving terrorist training. Harmonizing criminal laws in the EU has faced challenges due to varying national policies on crime and punishment. EU officials argue that updating the common terrorism definition is necessary to comply with U.N. Security Council Resolution 2178. The EU is revising its terrorism laws to address foreign fighter threats and comply with U.N. Resolution 2178. The European Commission proposed changes to the common terrorism definition, which will be reviewed by EU member states and the European Parliament. Cooperation with the U.S. in law enforcement and intelligence has been a priority for the EU since 9/11. The EU prioritized improving law enforcement and intelligence cooperation with the United States to combat terrorism. This partnership has enhanced dialogue on security issues and is generally viewed positively by U.S. policymakers and analysts. The Obama Administration has supported U.S. cooperation with the EU in counterterrorism, border controls, and transport security. The partnership with the EU in these areas is viewed positively by most U.S. policymakers and analysts. President Obama's National Strategy for Counterterrorism emphasized working with European allies bilaterally and with the European Parliament and EU to advance counterterrorism efforts. The EU has been a key U.S. partner in counterterrorism efforts, including the Global Counterterrorism Forum. U.S.-EU cooperation has focused on combating the foreign fighter phenomenon, with concerns about recruitment of European and American Muslims to fight in Syria. The EU and the US have been working together to combat the recruitment of European and American Muslims to fight with Islamist groups in Syria and Iraq. US policymakers are particularly concerned about European foreign fighters due to visa-free travel arrangements between the US and most EU countries. Attorney General Eric Holder emphasized the need for shared strategies to address the influx of violent extremists from the US and Europe traveling to Syria. In September 2014, the White House and EU officials collaborated on measures to address the foreign fighter threat in Syria, focusing on counter-radicalization, border security, aviation security, and information sharing. EU countries supported U.N. Security Council Resolution 2178 to combat the influx of U.S. and European-born violent extremists in Syria. EU countries strongly supported U.N. Security Council Resolution 2178 in September 2014 to combat the foreign fighter threat. Following the Paris attacks in January 2015, high-ranking European officials attended meetings with the U.S. to discuss terrorist threats and foreign fighters. Following the Paris attacks in January 2015, high-ranking European and EU officials participated in a conference on countering violent extremism hosted by the United States in Washington, DC. U.S. officials have been urging European governments and the EU to enhance information exchanges and utilize existing EU-wide databases to combat terrorist threats. President Obama called on the EU to implement an EU PNR system after the November 2015 attacks in Paris. Following the Paris attacks in November 2015, President Obama urged the EU to implement an EU PNR system to enhance information-sharing and combat terrorist threats. Close law enforcement ties with European allies and Best U.S.-EU information-sharing arrangements are crucial in tracking terrorist financing and sharing airline passenger data. Challenges remain in the evolving U.S.-EU counterterrorism relationship. Challenges persist in the U.S.-EU counterterrorism relationship, particularly regarding data privacy concerns and negotiations on information-sharing agreements. Issues include NSA surveillance disclosures, detainee policies, terrorist designation lists, and border security measures. The U.S.-EU counterterrorism relationship faces challenges such as data privacy concerns, NSA surveillance disclosures, detainee policies, and border security measures. Legislation passed in 2015 to strengthen the U.S. Visa Waiver Program has raised concerns in the EU. Contacts between U.S. and EU officials on police, judicial, and border control policy matters have increased since 2001, playing a crucial role in developing closer ties. Contacts between U.S. and EU officials on police, judicial, and border control policy matters have increased since 2001, playing a crucial role in developing closer ties. The U.S. Departments of State, Justice, Homeland Security, and the Treasury are actively engaged in this process, with high-level meetings and working groups discussing cooperation against terrorism. The United States and the EU have been engaging in discussions on police and judicial cooperation against terrorism for the past six months. They have also established dialogues on terrorist financing, border and transport security, critical infrastructure protection, and preventing violent extremism. Europol has liaison officers in Washington, DC, and the United States has stationed officers at Europol. Europol and U.S. agencies have reciprocal liaison relationships, with Europol having liaison officers in Washington, DC, and the U.S. stationing officers at Europol headquarters in The Hague. These officers work on counterterrorism, counterfeiting, and cybercrime cases, with approximately 500 cases a year involving U.S. authorities. This collaboration has led to operational successes in countering transnational crimes. Since 2006, a U.S. liaison has worked at Eurojust headquarters in The Hague to facilitate cooperation between European and U.S. prosecutors on terrorism and other cross-border criminal cases. U.S.-EU efforts against terrorism have resulted in agreements to improve police and judicial cooperation. In 2001 and 2002, U.S.-Europol agreements were made to allow sharing of information between U.S. law enforcement authorities and Europol. In 2001 and 2002, U.S.-Europol agreements were made to share strategic and personal information between U.S. law enforcement authorities and Europol. Negotiations on personal information were challenging due to concerns about U.S. data protection standards conflicting with EU regulations on privacy rights. The EU prioritizes personal data privacy as a fundamental right, leading to delays in negotiations with the US over cooperation agreements. In 2007, a common security standards agreement was signed between the US and EU. In 2010, new US-EU treaties on extradition and mutual legal assistance came into force after approval by the US Senate and ratification by all EU member states. The US-EU treaties on extradition and mutual legal assistance (MLA) were approved by the US Senate and ratified by all EU member states in 2010. These agreements aim to harmonize existing bilateral accords, simplify extradition processes, and enhance information-sharing and prosecutorial cooperation to combat terrorism and transnational crimes like financial fraud and human trafficking. The US-EU treaties on extradition and mutual legal assistance were ratified in 2010 to combat transnational crimes like financial fraud and human trafficking. The extradition agreement addresses challenges regarding the death penalty and extradition of EU nationals, modernizing existing bilateral agreements and streamlining information exchange. The MLA treaty between the United States and EU members streamlines information exchange, allows access to European financial information, speeds up request processing, permits video conferencing for evidence acquisition, and enables joint investigations. Despite growing U.S.-EU law enforcement ties, some critics question the utility of collaborating with EU-wide bodies. Despite growing U.S.-EU law enforcement ties and agreements, critics doubt the utility of collaborating with EU-wide bodies like Europol. Concerns include Europol's lack of enforcement capabilities and dependence on national services for information. European officials also criticize the United States for expecting intelligence sharing without reciprocating. In early 2015, U.S. and Europol officials signed agreements to enhance cooperation against foreign fighters and illegal immigration, despite some European opposition to U.S. policies like the death penalty and extradition of their nationals. Most U.S. and European officials are committed to working with Europol, although concerns remain about its enforcement capabilities and dependence on national services for information. In 2015, U.S. and Europol officials signed agreements to improve cooperation against foreign fighters and illegal immigration, particularly concerning organized crime groups. The United States and the EU work together in global forums to combat terrorist financing and have access to financial data through SWIFT. The U.S. and EU benefit from an agreement allowing access to financial data through SWIFT for the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program. The program has provided leads for EU governments in preventing terrorist attacks, but faces controversy in Europe over data privacy concerns. The U.S. and EU have an agreement for sharing SWIFT data through the Terrorist Finance Tracking Program, which has helped prevent terrorist attacks in Europe. However, the agreement remains controversial in Europe due to data privacy concerns. EU and U.S. officials have collaborated since 2001 to bridge gaps in their lists of terrorist organizations, presenting a united front against terrorism. The EU maintains two lists of terrorist organizations and individuals, one focusing on Al Qaeda and Taliban affiliates, and the other on non-affiliated entities. The lists are crucial in combating terrorist financing and have been updated over the years to include groups like Jabhat al Nusra, Boko Haram, and the Islamic State. The EU's \"common terrorist list\" or \"blacklist\" includes over 80 individuals or entities worldwide, with law enforcement measures varying based on whether they are considered \"external\" or \"internal\" to the EU. This list has been a subject of controversy and U.S.-EU debate. The EU's \"common terrorist list\" includes over 80 individuals or entities worldwide, categorized as \"external\" or \"internal\" to the EU. Member states must freeze assets, restrict financial resources, and provide law enforcement assistance for \"external\" entities. \"Internal\" entities are subject to police cooperation measures. The EU's common terrorist list includes over 80 individuals or entities worldwide, categorized as \"external\" or \"internal\" to the EU. Member states must freeze assets, restrict financial resources, and provide law enforcement assistance for \"external\" entities. Inclusion on the list subjects individuals to strengthened police cooperation measures, with national governments also applying their own sanctions to stem financing. Unanimous agreement among all EU member states is required for adding or deleting a person or entity from the list. The United States and other countries have successfully lobbied the EU to add several organizations, such as the PKK, FARC, and Palestinian groups like Hamas. The EU's common terrorist list includes various groups like PKK, FARC, Hamas, and Hezbollah. The US has also added members of ETA to its terrorist designation lists, causing occasional friction with the EU. EU hesitates to add some Hamas-related charities due to differing views among member states. The EU hesitates to add suspected Hamas-related charities to its common terrorist list due to differing views among member states. Charities like Interpal, designated as fronts for Hamas by the US, have been cleared by European national authorities. There is division among EU member states on whether Hezbollah should be included on the list. The EU member states have been divided on whether to include Hezbollah on the common terrorist list, with the United States considering it a foreign terrorist organization. Some countries like the UK and the Netherlands support adding Hezbollah to the list, while others like France oppose it. In 2012-2013, there was a renewed debate within the EU on adding Hezbollah to the common terrorist list, despite opposition from countries like France. Some EU members were hesitant due to Hezbollah's role in the Lebanese government and its social services in poor communities. Several events, including the 2012 Burgas airport bombing linked to Hezbollah and the 2013 conviction of a Hezbollah operative in Cyprus, led to renewed calls for the EU to add Hezbollah to its terrorist list. Hezbollah's involvement in Syria's civil war and support for the Assad government also prompted appeals for EU action. In late July 2013, the EU announced the addition of Hezbollah's military wing to its terrorist list, following calls for action due to their involvement in Syria's civil war and support for the Assad government. This decision was seen as a compromise to address concerns about destabilizing Lebanon and maintaining EU influence in the region. The EU's decision to include Hezbollah's military wing on its terrorist list was largely symbolic, sending a message that terrorist activities would endanger the organization's political legitimacy. This move aimed to reduce the EU's influence in the region while maintaining dialogue and assistance to Lebanon. Hezbollah's military wing was included on the EU's terrorist list, sending a message that terrorist activities would jeopardize the organization's political legitimacy. Some experts believed this designation would prompt EU governments to investigate activities linked to Hezbollah, potentially making Europe a less appealing base for the group. Critics argued that only listing the military wing was insufficient as it still allowed Hezbollah to fundraise in Europe. The EU included Hezbollah's military wing on its terrorist list, but critics argue it is insufficient as the group can still fundraise in Europe. US administrations and Congress have urged the EU to list Hezbollah as a whole after Bulgaria implicated them in the Burgas bombing. Obama called for action to uncover Hezbollah's infrastructure and disrupt their financing schemes to prevent future attacks. Members of Congress have sent letters urging the EU to add Hezbollah to its terrorist list. At the end of the 112th Congress, both the Senate and House passed resolutions urging the EU to designate Hezbollah as a terrorist organization and impose sanctions. The Obama Administration and many Members of Congress welcomed the EU's decision to list Hezbollah's military wing as a terrorist group. Both the US and EU emphasize the importance of sharing information to disrupt terrorist activities. The EU considers data privacy as a human right and has regulations in place to protect personal data. Some EU officials have concerns about information-sharing accords with the US due to privacy issues. Some EU officials are worried about the US guaranteeing adequate protection for European citizens' personal data in information-sharing agreements. Concerns stem from violations of privacy rights in U.S.-EU accords, especially after unauthorized disclosures of NSA surveillance programs. The NSA surveillance programs and allegations of US collection activities in Europe have strained transatlantic trust and raised concerns about data protection safeguards. Analysts are worried about the future of US-EU information-sharing arrangements, especially with the European Parliament's approval required for many accords. The European Parliament has expressed serious concerns about US surveillance programs and established a special working group to investigate alleged collection activities. This has strained transatlantic trust and raised worries about the future of US-EU information-sharing accords. The European Parliament's civil liberties committee, chaired by Claude Moraes, investigated alleged US surveillance activities and criticized the NSA's mass surveillance programs in the \"Moraes report.\" Concerns were raised about US-EU information-sharing agreements. The \"Moraes report\" from the European Parliament raised concerns about U.S.-EU information-sharing agreements, urging revisions to U.S. legislation to protect the privacy rights of EU citizens. The report also called for the timely conclusion of negotiations on the U.S.-EU Data Privacy and Protection Agreement. The European Parliament's \"Moraes report\" highlighted concerns about U.S.-EU information-sharing agreements and urged revisions to U.S. legislation to protect EU citizens' privacy rights. The report also emphasized the need for timely negotiations on the U.S.-EU Data Privacy and Protection Agreement. The Parliament's resolution, while not binding, carries political weight and has prompted demands for stronger data protection reforms within the EU. The European Parliament's \"Moraes report\" raised concerns about U.S.-EU data sharing and called for revisions to U.S. laws to safeguard EU citizens' privacy. New data protection rules are expected to be finalized in early 2016, with some U.S. officials worried about potential obstacles to law enforcement cooperation and burdens on U.S. companies. U.S. officials have reassured EU leaders that surveillance activities comply with U.S. law and oversight. The United States has been working to address EU concerns about surveillance activities, including the PRISM program. A U.S.-EU working group was established to discuss NSA surveillance operations and assess their impact on the privacy rights of EU citizens. The European Commission issued a report on the matter in November 2013. In November 2013, the European Commission issued a report on the findings of a working group established to address EU concerns about U.S. surveillance activities and their impact on the privacy rights of EU citizens. The report included recommendations for restoring transatlantic trust and seeking redress for EU citizens in U.S. courts. The Obama Administration aimed to pass legislation allowing EU citizens to seek redress in U.S. courts for law enforcement data privacy violations. The Judicial Redress Act was signed into law in February 2016. Controversy over Europe's involvement in the U.S. Terrorist Finance Tracking Program dates back to 2006. Controversy arose in 2006 over Europe's involvement in the U.S. Terrorist Finance Tracking Program, with reports of secret access to SWIFT financial data. In 2007, a deal was reached between the U.S. and EU to allow continued access for counterterrorism purposes. In 2009, changes to SWIFT's systems architecture required a new U.S.-EU agreement for data sharing, leading to a new accord between the European Commission and the United States on SWIFT data. In 2009, a new U.S.-EU agreement on SWIFT data sharing was reached. In February 2010, the European Parliament rejected the updated SWIFT accord with the U.S. due to concerns about data protection for EU citizens. The European Parliament expressed concerns about data protection for EU citizens regarding the U.S.-EU SWIFT agreement, leading to a halt in U.S. access to SWIFT data. Negotiations for a revised agreement focused on guaranteeing judicial remedy for European citizens and addressing the use of \"bulk data\". The European Parliament raised concerns about data protection for EU citizens in the U.S.-EU SWIFT agreement, focusing on guaranteeing judicial remedy and addressing \"bulk data\" transfers. Some MEPs called for more targeted transfers and greater supervision over U.S. access to SWIFT data. In June 2010, a new draft SWIFT agreement was concluded, including provisions for administrative and legal redress for EU citizens. In June 2010, a new draft SWIFT agreement was concluded between U.S. and EU officials. The draft included provisions for administrative and legal redress for EU citizens, with Europol having authority over U.S. Treasury Department requests for SWIFT data. Additional changes were made to the draft to address concerns of some MEPs, including the appointment of an independent observer in Washington, DC. The final iteration of the U.S.-EU SWIFT accord, approved by the European Parliament, included provisions for an independent observer in Washington, DC, and plans for a European equivalent to the U.S. TFTP within a year. The European Parliament approved the final U.S.-EU SWIFT accord on July 8, 2010, for a five-year period, with automatic yearly extensions unless notified otherwise. Some MEPs expressed concerns about the EU's role in the U.S. TFTP and the implementation of the SWIFT accord. Several MEPs remained concerned about the EU's role in the U.S. TFTP and the implementation of the SWIFT accord. The European Commission recommended measures to make the TFTP more transparent, including providing more information to Europol in writing. A second review in December 2012 concluded that the TFTP had concrete benefits in fighting terrorism. The second review of the TFTP in December 2012 found concrete benefits in fighting terrorism, with proper implementation of safeguards. However, concerns arose in Europe following unauthorized disclosures of U.S. surveillance activities, leading to renewed scrutiny of how the U.S. handles personal data of EU citizens. In October 2013, the European Parliament passed a nonbinding resolution calling for the suspension of the U.S.-EU SWIFT accord due to NSA surveillance allegations. However, actually suspending the agreement would require action from the European Commission and member states, which they are not inclined to do. The SWIFT accord suspension calls in 2013 were largely symbolic as actual suspension would need action from the European Commission and member states, which they are not inclined to do. Reviews show SWIFT data has helped European intelligence services in investigating terrorist threats, including during the 2012 London Olympics and threats posed by EU nationals training with extremist groups in Syria and Iraq. In May 2004, the US and EU agreed to share passenger name record data for flights to or from the US. The US and EU reached an agreement allowing airlines to provide passenger name record data to US authorities within 15 minutes of a flight's departure. The PNR accord faced controversy in Europe over privacy concerns, leading to a case lodged by the European Parliament in the EU Court of Justice. In May 2006, the Court annulled the PNR agreement. In May 2006, the European Parliament lodged a case against the PNR agreement in the EU Court of Justice, which was annulled due to improper legal basis. In July 2007, the US and EU negotiated a new seven-year agreement for the transfer of PNR data, with provisions allowing the US Department of Homeland Security to share data with other agencies in the fight against terrorism. The new US-EU PNR agreement allowed the Department of Homeland Security to share passenger data with other US agencies in the fight against terrorism. It extended data storage time to 15 years and permitted access to sensitive passenger information. Airlines were required to send data 72 hours before a flight, with fewer fields collected compared to the previous agreement. The 2007 U.S.-EU PNR agreement faced objections from many MEPs due to concerns about data transfer, data retention period, redress for data misuse, and potential data mining by U.S. authorities. In 2010, European Parliament postponed the vote on the 2007 U.S.-EU PNR agreement due to concerns about data misuse and data mining by U.S. authorities. The Parliament called for a \"global external PNR strategy\" from the European Commission to set requirements for all EU PNR agreements with other countries. The European Commission issued a \"global external PNR strategy\" in September 2010, calling for the renegotiation of EU PNR agreements with the United States, Australia, and Canada. The strategy emphasized using PNR data for combating terrorism and serious crimes, providing clear information to passengers about data exchange, ensuring passenger rights to redress, and prohibiting decisions to deny boarding based solely on automated data processing. The European Commission's PNR strategy in September 2010 emphasized the importance of using PNR data for combating terrorism and serious crimes, ensuring passenger rights to redress, and prohibiting decisions to deny boarding based solely on automated data processing. In November 2010, the European Parliament endorsed new PNR negotiations with the United States, emphasizing the need for limited data exchange, retention for only necessary periods, and the prohibition of data mining or profiling. The European Commission emphasized the importance of using PNR data for combating terrorism and serious crimes, ensuring passenger rights to redress, and prohibiting decisions to deny boarding based solely on automated data processing. The European Parliament endorsed new PNR negotiations with the United States, emphasizing limited data exchange, retention for necessary periods, and the prohibition of data mining or profiling. The Obama Administration agreed to discuss adjustments to the PNR accord in recognition of the EP's concerns. U.S.-EU negotiations on a revised PNR accord were launched in December 2010. U.S. officials maintained that the 2007 accord protected data and privacy rights. In 2010, U.S. officials insisted that the 2007 PNR accord protected data and privacy rights, with two joint reviews confirming no misuse of data. They stressed that any new PNR agreement with the EU should not compromise operational effectiveness or invalidate existing bilateral deals. Resolutions were introduced in the House and Senate in mid-May 2011. In mid-May 2011, resolutions were introduced in the House and passed in the Senate supporting the existing 2007 U.S.-EU PNR accord. The United States and the European Commission concluded negotiations on a revised PNR agreement in late May 2011, introducing new innovations to enhance the protection of passengers' personal information. The leaked draft of the revised U.S.-EU PNR agreement in May 2011 introduced new provisions to enhance passenger data protection, including depersonalization of records after six months, decreased storage time in the database, and restricted access to authorized personnel. U.S. officials argued that the draft accord provided legal clarity on passenger rights and ensured that boarding decisions would not be based solely on automated processing of PNR data. The revised U.S.-EU PNR agreement in May 2011 aimed to enhance passenger data protection by depersonalizing records after six months, limiting storage time, and restricting access. Despite revisions, some MEPs were still unsatisfied as the accord allowed the U.S. to retain passenger data for up to 15 years. MEPs were unsatisfied with the May 2011 version of the U.S.-EU PNR agreement as it allowed the U.S. to retain passenger data for up to 15 years, increased the data transmission requirement to at least 96 hours before a flight, and broadened the use of PNR data for more criminal offenses. In October 2011, the House Homeland Security Committee's Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence discussed the U.S.-EU PNR agreement, with U.S. officials stating that the 2011 draft was stronger than the 2007 version, addressing EU concerns on data security, offenses covered, and passenger rights. Negotiations between U.S. and EU continued to address European concerns. In November 2011, the United States and the EU finalized a new draft PNR agreement with improvements to address European concerns, including limiting data use to serious crimes and varying retention time based on the offense. In December 2011, EU member states approved the new U.S.-EU PNR agreement, with varying retention times based on the type of crime under investigation. Germany and Austria abstained due to concerns about data retention and redress provisions. Some MEPs also criticized the changes as cosmetic and called for rejection. Some MEPs had concerns about the changes in the November 2011 PNR accord, with some calling it largely cosmetic and advocating for its rejection. Others supported the new agreement, citing stronger data protection guarantees compared to the 2007 version. Despite some reservations about data privacy safeguards, a number of MEPs planned to vote for the 2011 accord to provide airlines with legal certainty. The European Commission warned that rejecting the agreement would result in no agreement at all. The U.S.-EU PNR agreement was approved by the full Parliament on April 19, 2012, with 409 votes in favor, 226 against, and 33 abstentions. The agreement reaffirmed the commitment to countering terrorism while protecting privacy and civil rights. It was officially adopted by the EU on April 26, 2012, and came into force on August 8, 2012, valid for seven years. The U.S.-EU PNR accord was adopted by the EU on April 26, 2012, and came into force on August 8, 2012. It will be valid for seven years and can be renewed for another seven years. In November 2013, the European Commission published the results of a joint review of the PNR program, stating that it is an efficient tool to combat terrorism and serious crimes. The U.S.-EU PNR accord, adopted in 2012, is seen as a vital tool in fighting terrorism and serious crimes. Some MEPs have raised concerns about U.S. data protection safeguards, calling for adequate protection of PNR data stored in cloud systems on U.S. soil. The U.S.-EU PNR accord, adopted in 2012, is crucial for combating terrorism. U.S. and EU leaders view information-sharing agreements like SWIFT and PNR as essential tools in this fight. U.S. officials have faced challenges in negotiating data-sharing agreements with the EU, seeking an umbrella agreement to streamline future accords. In 2009, the European Parliament called for U.S.-EU cooperation on data privacy standards. The European Parliament called for a U.S.-EU framework agreement in 2009 to ensure data protection in the fight against terrorism and crime. In May 2010, the European Commission proposed a draft mandate for negotiating such an accord to address differences in privacy rights between the U.S. and EU. The goal was to facilitate future data-sharing agreements in law enforcement. The European Commission proposed an umbrella Data Privacy and Protection Agreement (DPPA) to bridge U.S.-EU differences in privacy rights. This agreement would not provide the legal basis for data transfer but would require specific agreements on SWIFT or PNR. EU member states approved the Commission's mandate in December 2010, leading to negotiations on the DPPA in March 2011. In March 2011, the United States and the EU began negotiations on a Data Privacy and Protection Agreement (DPPA) to safeguard personal information in law enforcement. The goal was mutual recognition of data protection systems to ensure privacy rights. The DPPA aimed for EU approval of U.S. data protection standards. U.S. authorities aimed for EU approval of data protection standards through negotiations on a Data Privacy and Protection Agreement (DPPA). Progress was made on provisions related to data security, transparency, and oversight, but controversial issues like purpose limitation and retention times remained. EU officials and MEPs emphasized the need for protection of European citizens' data. Some controversial issues remained, including purpose limitation, retention times, and redress. EU officials and MEPs insisted on judicial redress rights for European citizens in the U.S., while U.S. Administrations argued that other redress options were available. The DPPA negotiations were stalled due to the lack of judicial redress, but gained momentum after revelations of U.S. surveillance activities in 2013. The European Parliament called for the negotiations to resume without delay, emphasizing the importance of concluding the DPPA. The European Parliament urged the European Commission and U.S. authorities to resume DPPA negotiations without delay. The EP's \"Moraes report\" emphasized the need for the DPPA to restore transatlantic trust and urged the U.S. to revise its legislation for EU citizens' privacy rights. Attorney General Holder announced the Obama Administration's commitment to seeking legislation to ensure equal rights for EU citizens in personal information transfers under the DPPA. The Obama Administration is committed to seeking legislation to ensure that EU citizens have the same rights as U.S. citizens under the DPPA for personal information transfers. This decision aims to restore EU trust in U.S. data privacy commitments. U.S. and EU negotiators finalized and initialed the text of the DPPA on September 8, 2015. On September 8, 2015, U.S. and EU negotiators finalized the text of the DPPA to restore EU trust in U.S. data privacy commitments. The EU required U.S. judicial redress legislation before signing the DPPA. Legislation like H.R. 1428 and S. 1600 was introduced to meet these demands. The Judicial Redress Act, introduced by Senators Chris Murphy and Orrin Hatch in June 2015, aimed to extend privacy protections to citizens of covered countries or regional organizations like the EU. This legislation became crucial following a ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union in October 2015. The Judicial Redress Act gained importance after the CJEU invalidated the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Agreement due to inadequate data protection and lack of judicial remedies for EU citizens in the U.S. The CJEU decision in mid-2013 highlighted the lack of judicial remedies for EU citizens in the United States. The Judicial Redress Act aimed to address European concerns about U.S.-EU data transfers and strengthen confidence in the new \"Privacy Shield\" agreement. However, some note that the scope of judicial redress in the U.S. legislation is not equivalent to what U.S. persons enjoy under the Privacy Act. The Judicial Redress Act aims to address EU concerns about U.S.-EU data transfers and strengthen confidence in the Privacy Shield agreement. However, the scope of judicial redress in U.S. legislation is not equivalent to what U.S. persons enjoy under the Privacy Act. H.R. 1428 passed the House on October 20, 2015, and was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee on January 28, 2016, with an amendment introduced by Senator John Cornyn. The Cornyn amendment to the Judicial Redress Act limited its applicability to countries allowing data transfer to the U.S. without hindering national security interests. This provision may have influenced the U.S.-EU Privacy Shield agreement. H.R. 1428, with amendments, was signed into law on February 24, 2016 (P.L. 114-126). The Judicial Redress Act, H.R. 1428, was signed into law on February 24, 2016 (P.L. 114-126), paving the way for the formal signature of the U.S.-EU DPPA. The EU welcomed the act's enactment, stating it will restore trust in transatlantic data flows. EU member states and the European Parliament must approve the DPPA for it to enter into force. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security stated that around 30,000 passengers and 3,000 commercial containers arrive daily from Europe at U.S. ports of entry. The United States and the EU have emphasized cooperation in border control, aviation, and maritime security over the last decade, with several agreements concluded. They aim to enhance international information exchanges on lost and stolen passports and promote interoperability. The United States and the EU have collaborated on various security measures, including enhancing international information exchanges on lost and stolen passports, promoting interoperable biometric identifiers for travel document security, strengthening aviation security measures worldwide, and improving cargo and global supply chain security. In October 2010, their collaboration led to an International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) declaration on aviation security agreed upon by 190 countries. The United States and the EU have collaborated on enhancing aviation security, including improving cargo and global supply chain security. Both parties are working to find a balance between border security and facilitating transatlantic travel and commerce since the 2001 terrorist attacks. Since the 2001 terrorist attacks, the US and EU have implemented measures to enhance aviation security. Recent incidents like the 2009 underwear bomb attempt and the 2010 Yemen bomb plot have reignited discussions on air cargo security in US-EU relations. Two Chicago-bound printer cartridge packages containing explosives were shipped from Yemen on cargo and passenger flights, with one package intercepted in the UK after being transferred in Germany. Tighter rules for carrying electronic devices on international U.S.-bound flights were implemented in July 2014 due to fears of Al Qaeda-linked groups using devices to disguise explosives, highlighting the ongoing terrorist threat to aviation. U.S. and EU have closely aligned rules and regulations since 2001, working together to address gaps in their policies. Since 2001, the U.S. and EU have closely aligned rules and regulations in aviation, collaborating to address policy gaps. In 2003, EU countries objected to U.S. rules on armed air marshals, leading to discussions on alternative measures. In 2008, an agreement was reached on coordinating air cargo security measures between the two sides. The United States and the EU have agreed to coordinate air cargo security measures, including implementing systems to ensure the security of all cargo on passenger flights between their territories. This partnership was announced in June 2012, in compliance with the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007. In June 2012, the United States and the EU reached an agreement on an air cargo security partnership to recognize each other's security regimes, reducing duplication and costs for cargo operators. This mutual recognition aims to enhance cargo security, improve transatlantic shipments, and save time and money. The United States and the EU reached an agreement on an air cargo security partnership to improve transatlantic shipments and reduce costs. The agreement includes exchanging information on security regimes and mutual recognition to meet U.S. requirements for cargo screening on passenger planes. Despite shared goals, some differences in perspective remain. In 2007, the United States and the EU agreed to promote cooperation in aviation and air cargo security. After the 2009 attack, the US installed body scanners at airports and urged the EU to do the same. Some EU countries supported the idea, but others were concerned about privacy and health risks. In July 2011, the European Parliament approved the use of body scanners at EU airports with certain safeguards in place. In July 2011, the European Parliament approved the use of body scanners at EU airports with safeguards to protect passenger privacy and health. The scanners were required to only produce stick figure images, not body images, and x-ray scans were banned in favor of millimeter wave scans. Passengers had the right to opt for a manual search, and the use of scanners was voluntary. In November 2011, the European Commission adopted the EP's conditions for body scanners at EU airports, but member states are not required to deploy them. Some EU officials and Parliamentarians have concerns about body scanners at U.S. airports due to the large number of European visitors. However, in January 2013, the TSA announced the removal of full-body scanners producing revealing images by June 2013. In January 2013, the U.S. Transportation Security Administration announced the removal of full-body scanners that produce revealing images by June 2013. Body scanners at U.S. airports will now only use technology that produces generic body images, addressing concerns about privacy rights. The EU announced plans to eliminate restrictions on liquids and gels in carry-on baggage, causing concerns about privacy rights and security measures. The EU planned to lift restrictions on liquids and gels in carry-on baggage by April 2013, sparking concerns about security measures and potential flight delays. The EU postponed its 2013 deadline for liquid screening equipment and restrictions on liquids and gels in carry-on baggage due to industry concerns about airline security and potential flight delays. The EU aims to lift all restrictions on liquids and gels aboard planes by January 2016, starting with duty-free items in January 2014. In April 2004, the US and EU signed a customs cooperation accord. In April 2004, the United States and the European Union signed a customs cooperation accord to extend the U.S. Container Security Initiative (CSI) throughout the EU. CSI stations U.S. customs officers in foreign ports to pre-screen U.S.-bound maritime cargo containers for dangerous substances. In May 2012, the U.S. and EU agreed to recognize each other's trusted shipper programs to enhance supply chain security and trade opportunities. The United States and the EU have agreed to recognize each other's trusted shipper programs to improve supply chain security and trade opportunities. This mutual recognition accord aims to expedite customs procedures for 15,000 U.S. and European companies designated as \"trusted traders\" by either the C-TPAT program or the AEO regime. The agreement is expected to reduce costs, simplify procedures, and allow customs authorities to focus on risky consignments while facilitating legitimate transatlantic trade. Recently, U.S.-EU tensions have receded over a provision in the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 ( P.L. 110-53 ) that set a five-year goal of scanning at foreign ports of loading all containers bound for the United States for nuclear devices. EU officials viewed 100% container scanning as unrealistic, arguing it could disrupt trade and burden EU ports and businesses. U.S. policymakers shared concerns about the cost and effectiveness of 100% scanning. The financial burden on EU ports and businesses due to 100% container scanning was a concern shared by U.S. policymakers in the Bush and Obama Administrations. They highlighted potential lower profits and higher transportation costs for U.S. importers. Despite existing programs to identify high-risk cargo, proponents of 100% scanning continue to push for its full implementation. In 2012, the 100% scanning deadline was extended by two years, with an additional two-year extension announced in June 2014. Proponents argue that current manifest data is not sufficient for determining risk. The U.S. Visa Waiver Program allows visa-free travel for citizens of 38 countries, mostly in Europe, leading to periodic tensions between the U.S. and EU over its application to all 28 member states. The U.S. Visa Waiver Program allows visa-free travel for citizens of 38 countries, mostly in Europe. New EU members were eager to join the program but faced exclusion due to not meeting requirements. There were debates in Congress about extending the program to new EU members, with some concerns about security post-9/11. The U.S. Visa Waiver Program faced security concerns post-9/11 as terrorists with European citizenship exploited the program. In response, Congress passed the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 to strengthen security measures and expand eligibility to more EU members and interested countries. The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 aimed to enhance the security of the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) by implementing stricter security and passport standards for participant countries. It also allowed the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to waive specific admission requirements, enabling new EU member states to join the VWP. Currently, 23 countries participate in the program. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security can waive admission requirements for new EU member states to join the Visa Waiver Program (VWP). Currently, 23 out of 28 EU member states are part of the VWP. The EU is pushing for the remaining five members to be admitted soon. In 2014, a revised EU reciprocity mechanism was implemented to achieve full visa reciprocity with the United States and other countries exempt from EU visa requirements. The EU is working towards achieving full visa reciprocity with the United States and other countries exempt from EU visa requirements. The European Commission may suspend visa-free travel for a third country's citizens if there is no full visa reciprocity. The VWP is a key reason for U.S. officials' interest in this issue. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) is a concern for U.S. officials due to Europeans fighting in Syria and Iraq being able to easily return home and enter the United States without a visa. The Obama Administration supports the VWP for transatlantic commerce and tourism, but additional biographic information is now required for VWP travelers through ESTA. DHS also introduced new traveler screening in August 2015. In early November 2014, DHS announced additional biographic information required for VWP travelers through ESTA. In August 2015, new traveler screening and information-sharing requirements were introduced for VWP countries to enhance security measures. The November 2015 attacks in Paris heightened U.S. concerns about VWP security, leading to additional changes announced by the Obama Administration on November 30, 2015. The Obama Administration announced changes to the VWP in response to security concerns raised by French or Belgian citizens. These changes included modifying ESTA to capture past travel to terrorist safe havens and requiring DHS and the FBI to report on cooperation and terrorism information sharing with VWP countries. In December 2015, Congress passed legislation to enhance the security of the Visa Waiver Program (VWP). The new law prohibits individuals who have traveled to certain countries from entering the US under the VWP. They must now obtain a visitor visa at a US consulate abroad. The new legislation enhances the security of the Visa Waiver Program by prohibiting certain individuals from entering the US under the VWP. They must now obtain a visitor visa at a US consulate abroad. Additionally, all VWP participant countries must issue electronic passports and implement screening protocols. DHS announced an expansion of VWP travel restrictions to individuals who have traveled to Libya, Somalia, and Yemen since March 1, 2011. The VWP travel restrictions have been expanded to include individuals who have traveled to Libya, Somalia, and Yemen since March 1, 2011. However, dual nationals of these countries are exempt from the restrictions. EU officials are concerned about the new requirements, arguing that they could be seen as a de facto visa regime and discriminate against dual nationals. They also question the effectiveness of the legislation, stating that it may impact European citizens traveling to these countries for legitimate reasons. The new legislation expands VWP travel restrictions to individuals who have visited specified countries since March 1, 2011. EU officials are concerned about discrimination against dual nationals and question the effectiveness of the law in detecting clandestine travelers joining terrorist groups. US officials highlight exemptions for government and military personnel, with the Secretary of DHS having authority to waive exclusion on a case-by-case basis. Examples of eligible waiver candidates include journalists and humanitarian NGO workers. EU leaders have warned about potential implications. EU leaders and Members of Congress express concerns about VWP legislation restrictions on dual nationals, warning of possible reciprocal measures. Representative Justin Amash and Senator Jeff Flake introduce bills to eliminate these restrictions. The \"Equal Protection in Travel Act 2016\" aims to remove VWP restrictions on dual nationals, with a companion measure introduced by Senator Jeff Flake. This change could potentially prevent the EU from imposing reciprocal visa requirements on U.S. citizens traveling to Europe. U.S. and European officials emphasize the importance of balancing freedom and security without compromising civil liberties and human rights standards. The treatment of suspected terrorist detainees remains a contentious issue. During the George W. Bush Administration, U.S. policies on suspected terrorist detainees caused tension with Europe, particularly regarding Guantanamo Bay, military commissions, and enhanced interrogation techniques. The practice of extraordinary rendition and CIA detention also raised concerns. The U.S. practice of \"extraordinary rendition\" and possible CIA detention facilities in Europe sparked investigations by European bodies. European leaders criticized these policies as violating international and European law and undermining shared values on human rights and prisoner treatment. European leaders criticized U.S. terrorist detainee and interrogation policies for breaching international and European law, degrading shared values on human rights, and weakening efforts to win Muslim \"hearts and minds.\" The Bush Administration defended these policies as crucial in fighting terrorism and denied violating U.S. human rights commitments. They sought agreements with foreign governments to address European concerns about Guant\u00e1namo. The Bush Administration defended its terrorist detainee policies as crucial in fighting terrorism, despite European criticism that they violated U.S. human rights commitments. U.S.-EU frictions over detainee policies have eased under the Obama Administration, with European officials welcoming plans to close Guant\u00e1namo and ban torture. The Obama Administration aimed to close the detention facility at Guant\u00e1namo within a year, banning torture and reviewing Bush Administration legal opinions on detention and interrogation methods. A special envoy was appointed to persuade countries to accept detainees cleared for release. Some EU members accepted released detainees, while others declined, posing challenges to the closure efforts. The Obama Administration faced challenges in closing Guant\u00e1namo due to reluctance from some EU countries to accept released detainees. Congressional opposition and restrictions also hindered the closure efforts. The Obama Administration has faced obstacles in closing Guant\u00e1namo, including reluctance from some EU countries to accept released detainees and Congressional opposition. In March 2011, President Obama signed an executive order creating indefinite detention for dangerous detainees at Guant\u00e1namo. The Administration also lifted a freeze on new military commission trials for detainees. Some European policymakers fear Guant\u00e1namo serves as a recruiting tool for terrorist groups. Some European policymakers worry that Guant\u00e1namo serves as a recruiting tool for terrorist groups and have concerns about the detainees' well-being. In May 2013, the European Parliament expressed concern for hunger-striking detainees and called for the facility's closure. The Obama Administration remains committed to shutting down Guant\u00e1namo, with President Obama renewing his pledge in May 2013. Congress passed a measure in December 2013 to support this goal. In December 2013, Congress passed a measure easing restrictions on transferring low-risk detainees from Guant\u00e1namo to other countries, supporting President Obama's goal of closing the detention facility. In FY2016, Congress maintained restrictions on bringing Guant\u00e1namo detainees to the US but required a plan for closing the facility. President Obama sent a proposal to Congress in February 2016 to shutter the facility before the end of his term. 147 individuals have been resettled overseas during the Obama Administration, with 91 detainees remaining at Guant\u00e1namo as of February 2016. In early 2002, press reports indicate that 147 detainees have been resettled overseas during the Obama Administration. 91 detainees remain at Guant\u00e1namo as of February 2016, with 35 cleared for transfer. European concerns persist about the past role of European governments in U.S. terrorist detainee policies. The European Parliament has been vocal on this issue, establishing a committee in 2006 to investigate member states' involvement in CIA detention facilities and rendition practices. The European Parliament has been investigating alleged CIA detention facilities and rendition flights related to terrorism suspects. In February 2015, they directed committees to resume investigations following a U.S. Senate report on the CIA's detention and interrogation programs. The European Parliament is investigating the illegal detention of terrorist suspects in EU countries following a U.S. Senate report on the CIA's programs. The resolution calls for the U.S. to investigate and prosecute human rights violations and cooperate with EU countries on extradition and remedies for victims. Concerns exist about allegations of U.S. wrongdoing and criminal proceedings against CIA officers in some EU states. Allegations of U.S. wrongdoing and rendition-related criminal proceedings against CIA officers in some EU states continue to threaten U.S.-European intelligence cooperation against terrorism. Efforts to enhance U.S.-EU collaboration since the 2001 attacks have faced skepticism, but the George W. Bush Administration determined the political benefits of engaging the EU on police and judicial matters. The George W. Bush Administration prioritized engaging the EU on police and judicial matters to enhance U.S.-EU cooperation on border controls and counterterrorism efforts, despite challenges posed by differing competencies and policy preferences. Observers note that U.S.-EU counterterrorism cooperation is complicated by different EU and member state competencies, as well as U.S. policy preferences. Policy areas relevant to counterterrorism fall under the EU's competence, leading to occasional frictions in the relationship. Despite tensions, both the United States and the EU remain committed to fostering cooperation. The U.S.-EU relationship can face frictions due to disconnects in counterterrorism cooperation. Both sides are committed to working together in areas like counterterrorism, law enforcement, border controls, and transport security. Cooperation against terrorism is crucial in combating threats from European and American citizens fighting with Islamist groups. Aviation and cargo security, U.S. border control measures, and visa policy are key issues. In the 113th and 114th Congresses, hearings focused on threats posed by Western foreign fighters in Syria and Iraq. Congress passed the Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015 to strengthen security controls in response to concerns about European citizens fighting with or inspired by terrorist groups. In response to concerns about European citizens joining terrorist groups, Congress passed the Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015. Changes to U.S. surveillance laws and the U.S. Judicial Redress Act may impact U.S.-EU counterterrorism cooperation. EU officials view the U.S. Judicial Redress Act as a positive step towards finalizing the U.S.-EU Data Privacy and Protection Agreement. The U.S. Judicial Redress Act (P.L. 114-126) is seen as a positive step towards finalizing the U.S.-EU Data Privacy and Protection Agreement, aiming to rebuild trust in transatlantic data sharing. Members of Congress may influence the European Parliament's views on international agreements related to counterterrorism. Members of Congress play a role in shaping Parliament's views on U.S. surveillance operations and data privacy rights. Representative Jim Sensenbrenner testified before the European Parliament on potential changes to U.S. surveillance laws, urging cooperation to protect both nations. Senator Chris Murphy and Representative Mike Rogers also engaged in discussions on this issue. In late 2013, Senator Chris Murphy and Representative Mike Rogers led congressional delegations to Europe to discuss alleged U.S. intelligence activities with European officials and reaffirm the importance of U.S.-European relations. Members of Congress have ongoing contacts with European Parliamentarians through the Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue. In the European Parliament, the Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue (TLD) brings members of the Parliament and the U.S. House of Representatives together twice a year to discuss foreign policy and economic issues. There is interest in strengthening ties between the two bodies to enhance transatlantic dialogue on counterterrorism issues."
