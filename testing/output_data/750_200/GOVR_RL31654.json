    "content": "The Endangered Species Act (ESA) provides legal protection to identified species and their habitats. Administered by the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), the ESA categorizes species as \"endangered\" or \"threatened\" based on their risk of extinction. Once listed, the ESA offers legal tools to aid in species recovery and habitat protection, including the prohibition of unpermitted \"take\". The Endangered Species Act provides legal protection to species and their habitats. Once listed, legal tools like prohibiting unpermitted \"take\" aid in species recovery and habitat protection. As of August 24, 2016, 2,266 species are listed as endangered or threatened, with 1,593 in the US and its territories. The Endangered Species Act, passed in 1973, protects 2,266 species as endangered or threatened, with 1,593 in the US. 1,156 US species have recovery plans. The ESA has been amended multiple times since 1973. Funding authorization expired in 1992, but prohibitions and penalties remain in effect. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) funding expired in 1992, but Congress has continued to appropriate funds each year. ESA prohibitions and penalties remain in effect regardless of appropriations, with a focus on conserving ecosystems for endangered and threatened species. The ESA can become a battleground in debates over scarce resources due to its strict provisions compared to other laws. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) can become a battleground in debates over scarce resources due to its strict provisions compared to other laws. Economic interests can be involved in issues surrounding vanishing species, with declining species often indicating resource scarcities and altered ecosystems. Examples include the Tellico Dam controversy and the Northwest timber harvest. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) has sparked debates over scarce resources, economic interests, and declining species. The global climate change debate has focused on the polar bear as tensions over the ESA increase with species added to the protected list. Congress and the executive branch aim to lessen these tensions by tailoring regulations. The demands of a growing economy and human population have impacted species' habitats. Congress and the executive branch have tried to address these tensions by tailoring the application of the ESA. Critics argue that more needs to be done to accommodate needs other than species conservation, while defenders believe the ESA balances a bias towards development in other laws and policies. Debate on the ESA largely divides along demographic lines, with stronger support for species conservation among urban and suburban populations. The ESA divides along demographic lines, with stronger support for species conservation among urban and suburban populations. Native Americans often support the survival of listed species due to their reliance on natural resources. Groups opposing strong protections claim jobs will be lost, while those seeking strong protections argue the opposite. The debate over listed species conservation often revolves around job loss concerns, with differing views on the impact of stringent measures. Ethical and religious support is cited by both sides, while industries like logging view the ESA as a problem. Authorization of appropriations is distinct from statutory authority for actions. The ESA contains statutory authority for activities and a provision for appropriations through FY1992. Questions arise about the act's prohibitions and authorities, House and Senate rules on appropriations without current authorization, and the consequences of a funding failure. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) expired in FY1992, leading to questions about its prohibitions and authorities. Despite the lack of authorization for appropriations, agencies still have the authority to carry out actions and enforce prohibitions under the act. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) provisions (Sections 4, 6-8, 10, and 11; 16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a71533, 1535-1537, 1539 and 1540) remain enforceable even without appropriations. The U.S. Supreme Court has affirmed that lack of funding does not negate statutory obligations. Section 11(g) (16 U.S.C. \u00a71540(g)) allows citizens to initiate civil actions. The Endangered Species Act provisions remain enforceable even without appropriations. Lack of funding does not negate statutory obligations. Section 11(g) allows citizens to initiate civil actions, potentially dissuading parties from prohibited acts. The possibility of citizen suits under the Endangered Species Act could deter parties from prohibited acts. House and Senate rules distinguish between authorizations and appropriations but do not affect a measure's legal force. House Rule XXI prohibits unauthorized appropriations, while House Rule XXII prohibits certain considerations. House rules prohibit unauthorized appropriations in legislation, amendments, and conference reports. These rules are enforced through points of order on the floor, but the House Rules Committee can set procedural parameters for appropriations measures. The House Rules Committee can report a special rule to set procedural parameters for appropriations measures, including waiving rules against unauthorized appropriations for floor amendments and conference reports. The House must adopt a special rule before considering the measure or conference report. Senate rules also distinguish between authorizations and appropriations, prohibiting unauthorized appropriations in committee and floor amendments. The House Rules Committee can report a special rule to set procedural parameters for appropriations measures, including waiving rules against unauthorized appropriations for floor amendments and conference reports. The prohibition on unauthorized appropriations in committee and floor amendments is enforced via points of order during consideration, but its application may be waived by unanimous consent. The practical effects of a lapse in funding would have mixed implications for supporters and critics of existing law. Some affected areas during a funding lapse include no interagency consultations for agency actions. During the funding lapse, there were no interagency consultations for agency actions, no issuance of incidental take statements, no species listed or delisted, no critical habitat designated, and no issuance of incidental take permits for nonfederal activities. During the funding lapse, there were no interagency consultations for agency actions, no issuance of incidental take statements, no species listed or delisted, no critical habitat designated, and no issuance of incidental take permits for nonfederal activities. This could potentially lead to increased lawsuits when services fail to meet deadlines, no federal enforcement of prohibitions on taking listed species or adverse modification of critical habitat, reduced inspections of incoming cargo for violations of species listed under CITES, no fulfillment of obligations under CITES, no monitoring of candidate species, and no federal enforcement of prohibitions (citizen suits under the ESA still possible). No federal enforcement of prohibitions on taking listed species or adverse modification of critical habitat, no acquisition of habitat for listed species, no state grants for conservation of listed or candidate species, and no ability to exempt agency actions from jeopardy opinions under Section 7 (e)-(p). The last major effort to end all funding for the ESA occurred in the 104th Congress, with a focus on eliminating conflicts in projects. The 104th Congress made a major effort to end all funding for the ESA to eliminate conflicts in projects. However, the attempt was abandoned due to the potential effects on new species listings. The ESA's goal is species recovery to the point where protection is no longer needed, but only 34 species have been delisted for recovery as of July 25, 2016. The ESA's goal is species recovery, but only 34 species have been delisted for recovery as of July 25, 2016. Some species have become extinct, while others have been delisted due to reclassification or improved data. It can be challenging to determine if rare species are extinct. It is difficult to prove whether extraordinarily rare species are simply that or already extinct, such as the ivory-billed woodpecker and the Eskimo curlew. Rare species are hard to find, and proving their extinction is challenging. Studies show that most endangered species are listed only when their populations are very low, suggesting another measure of effectiveness could be the number of species listed as endangered. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) could be considered successful based on the number of species that have stabilized or increased their populations, with 41% showing improvement. Some species like red wolves and California condors might not exist without ESA protection, indicating its impact on preventing extinctions. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) has been successful in stabilizing or increasing populations of many species, with 41% showing improvement. Some species, like red wolves and California condors, owe their existence to ESA protection, preventing potential extinctions. Scientific information and analysis are crucial for ESA actions, focusing on causes of extinction and the normalcy of extinction. The ESA relies on scientific information and analysis to guide its actions and enforcement. Key issues include the causes of extinction, the normalcy of extinction, and comparing current extinction rates to background levels. The focus of the extinction debate has shifted from over-exploitation to habitat loss, putting a majority of species at risk. The majority of species are at risk due to habitat loss, which has been exacerbated by factors such as global climate change and the introduction of nonnative invasive species. Habitats like tall-grass prairies, wetlands, old growth forests, rivers, coral reefs, and sandy beaches have been significantly reduced in size. The introduction of nonnative invasive species is a high-ranking factor in the demise of many species, acting as disease vectors, predators, or competitors. This has led to a gradual homogenization of the world's flora and fauna, threatening many species with extinction. Some species decline for no obvious reason, and multiple factors contribute to the decline of others. Many species are threatened by various factors, leading to their decline. The current rate of extinction is a concern as it exceeds background rates over time. Estimating total species numbers is challenging, with estimates ranging from 3.5 million to 100 million. Estimating current rates of extinction is challenging due to uncertainty in total species numbers. Conservative assumptions are used, with extinction rates around 17,000 species per year. Public awareness of the vast number of species is limited. Estimates suggest that current extinction rates exceed normal background rates, which are typically 1 to 10 species per 10 million species per year. Current extinction rates are believed to be 100 to 10,000 times higher than background rates. Current estimates suggest that current extinction rates are significantly higher than normal background rates, with critics questioning these calculations due to uncertainties in estimating the number of existing species. However, most biologists argue that similar numbers are found in studies across different groups by various scientists using different methods. Some scientists argue that robust results from testing hypotheses in various ways are scientifically sound, even if the species that become extinct cannot be revived. The possibility of a recovery through the evolution of new species better adapted to new conditions is considered, with estimates suggesting a lengthy process based on the geologic record after major extinction events. Some scientists estimate that recovery from major extinction events could take up to 25 million years for species numbers to return to pre-historic levels. The Endangered Species Act defines endangered species as those in danger of extinction throughout their range. The Endangered Species Act defines endangered species as those in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of their range, while threatened species are likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future. The ESA does not rely on a numerical standard to account for the wide variety of species biology. The protection under the ESA extends to all species and subspecies of animals. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) provides protection to all species and subspecies of animals, with additional safeguards for distinct population segments within a species. Limited protection is available for plant species, while organisms not classified as animals or plants are not covered by the ESA. \"Take\" under the ESA includes actions like harassment, harm, hunting, and capturing. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) defines \"take\" as actions that harm, harass, hunt, capture, or collect wildlife. There is debate over whether habitat modification falls under this definition. A Supreme Court ruling in 1995 supported including significant habitat modification that harms wildlife. The Secretary of the Interior oversees most listed species through FWS, while marine species and anadromous fish are managed separately. The Endangered Species Act designates the Secretary of the Interior to manage listed species through FWS, while marine species and anadromous fish are under the Secretary of Commerce through NMFS. Species can be listed by the Secretary or by petition, based on scientific and commercial data. The Secretary decides whether to list a species based on scientific and commercial information, following procedural steps for public participation. Economic effects are not considered at this stage, as listing is primarily a scientific question. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) prohibits economic considerations in listing decisions, focusing on the scientific question of a species' threat of extinction. Species can be classified as endangered or threatened based on the severity of decline and survival threats. Endangered species face extinction throughout their range, while threatened species are likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future. The ESA defines species as a whole. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) defines species as \"likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range.\" The Department of the Interior (DOI) has interpreted this phrase differently, with some flexibility in providing protection to species at risk of extinction in only a significant portion of their range. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) defines species as \"likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range.\" DOI's interpretation of this phrase has been challenged in court, with most courts finding it in violation of the ESA. In 2014, FWS and NMFS issued a joint interpretation stating that a portion of a species' range is significant if its contribution to the species' viability is crucial for preventing endangerment. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) defines species as \"likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range.\" The interpretation states that a species' range is where it currently exists, not where it once existed. Listing determinations must be based on scientific factors related to the species and threats to its continuance. The ESA requires listing determinations to be made solely on the best scientific evidence. The ESA mandates listing determinations based solely on scientific factors related to a species and threats to its continuance. The word \"solely\" was added in 1982 to emphasize the decision should be strictly scientific, without considering potential economic impacts. The addition of the word \"solely\" in the legislation emphasizes that decisions regarding the listing and delisting of species must be based strictly on biological criteria, without allowing non-biological considerations to influence the process. The Committee emphasizes that species listing or delisting should be based solely on scientific and commercial data, without considering economic factors. Economic criteria should not influence decisions on whether a species should be listed as endangered, threatened, or not listed at all. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) emphasizes that species listing or delisting should be based solely on scientific and commercial data, without considering economic factors. The ESA prohibits applying economic criteria to the analysis of species listing decisions, but allows for conservation methods that lower costs while still achieving conservation goals. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) prohibits economic factors from influencing species listing decisions but allows for cost-effective conservation methods. Petitions to change a species' status or delist it must be assessed within 90 days for scientific or commercial merit. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) prohibits economic factors from influencing species listing decisions but allows for cost-effective conservation methods. Petitions must be assessed within 90 days for scientific or commercial merit by the agency. If warranted, a status review is conducted within 12 months, leading to a decision on listing the species or not. Lawsuits have been filed for agencies failing to meet these deadlines amidst a rise in petitions. The Endangered Species Act requires agencies to reevaluate findings annually and meet deadlines for listing determinations. Lawsuits have been settled, setting deadlines for hundreds of species. As of August 2016, FWS had received over 160 ESA petitions, with questions arising about federal responsibilities towards proposed species. The Endangered Species Act requires agencies to reevaluate findings annually and meet deadlines for listing determinations. Lawsuits have been settled, setting deadlines for hundreds of species. As of August 2016, FWS had received over 160 ESA petitions, with questions arising about federal responsibilities towards proposed species. The federal government must confer with the appropriate Secretary on any agency action that could harm proposed species or their critical habitat. The Endangered Species Act requires agencies to reevaluate findings annually and meet deadlines for listing determinations. Lawsuits have set deadlines for hundreds of species. The federal government must confer with the appropriate Secretary on any agency action that could harm proposed species or their critical habitat. The conference process for species proposed for listing aims to resolve conflicts early in the planning process and advise on minimizing adverse effects. The ESA allows for a less formal conference stage before listing to avoid duplication of effort later. The agency may choose to follow a formal process at the proposed listing stage to avoid future duplication of effort. The ESA states that irreversible commitment of resources should be avoided at this stage to consider alternative measures. Listing a species comes with definite responsibilities for the agency, which may lead to liability for compensation. For example, avoiding timber sales could prevent harm to a species and potential legal issues. The relevant Secretary must monitor candidate species to prevent significant risks to their well-being. A candidate species is being considered for listing as endangered or threatened but not yet subject to a proposed rule. Federal agencies and other entities may work to improve a species' status to avoid listing. While there were 58 candidate species, federal agencies and landowners may pursue conservation agreements to improve a species' status and avoid listing. Landowners can enter into candidate conservation agreements with assurances to carry out actions for species conservation. The Secretary must publish proposed regulations for species listed under conservation agreements in the Federal Register, notify relevant agencies and countries, and hold public hearings. As of August 24, 2016, 73 species were proposed for listing under conservation agreements. Federal agencies must confer with the appropriate Secretary on actions likely to jeopardize candidate species. The Secretary must monitor candidate species' status and promptly list in case of emergencies. The Secretary must monitor candidate species' status and promptly list in case of emergencies. Some steps in the normal listing process may be skipped for emergency listings. Special regulations may be promulgated to conserve threatened species, with tailored protections and recovery measures. Endangered species enjoy the same protections as threatened species without special rules. A distinct population segment (DPS) under the ESA refers to a portion of a listed species, separated by genetic distinction and range. Only vertebrates can be designated as a DPS, with criteria including discreteness and significance based on genetic diversity loss. The DPS designation under the ESA is based on genetic separation and loss of genetic diversity. Protection status is determined using the same criteria as other listings, with special rules under Section 4(d) if threatened. The gray wolf DPS designation has led to litigation, with courts vacating DPS designations since 2003. NMFS developed evolutionarily significant units. NMFS developed evolutionarily significant units (ESUs) to interpret the \"distinct population segment\" language in the ESA. ESUs include multiple populations of salmon and steelhead trout, with 28 ESUs listed as endangered or threatened along the Pacific coast. The ESU concept has been criticized for lacking a specific scientific basis. The ESU concept, developed by NMFS, is used to interpret the \"distinct population segment\" language in the ESA. It includes multiple populations of salmon and steelhead trout, with 28 ESUs listed as endangered or threatened along the Pacific coast. The ESU concept was chosen for both policy and scientific reasons, as the stock level was not practical and the full species level would not distinguish among distinct population segments. The question of whether hatchery fish may be assigned to an ESU has been controversial. Congress added the concept of experimental populations to the ESA in 1982 as a way of reintroducing a species to its historic range. The concept of experimental populations was added to the ESA in 1982 to reintroduce species without severe land use restrictions. Two criteria must be met for reintroduction: authorization by the service and geographic separation from other animals of the same species. This separation allows for clear distinction of the introduced population's protected status. Experimental populations are designated differently from DPS or other species. If in danger of extinction, they are essential; otherwise, they are nonessential and considered threatened. Special regulations under ESA Section 4 apply, including rules for taking the species. No Section 7 consultation is required unless in a national wildlife refuge or park. The rules for taking species from nonessential experimental populations are different. Critical habitat is not designated for these populations. Delisting, uplisting, and downlisting processes are the same as listing. The Secretary of the Interior can initiate changes in a species' status. The Secretary of the Interior can initiate changes in a species' status by downlisting from endangered to threatened or uplisting from threatened to endangered. The decision must be based solely on scientific and commercial data, without considering economic impacts. Species listed must be reviewed every five years for potential removal or status change. The regulations mandate a review of listed species every five years for potential status changes. Critical habitat includes areas essential for conservation. The Secretary must designate critical habitat for listed species, but may withhold publication if it could harm the species. The Secretary must designate critical habitat for listed species, but may withhold publication if it could harm the species. Critical habitat had been designated for 758 listed species as of July 25, 2016, affecting both federally owned and private land. The Secretary must designate critical habitat for listed species based on scientific data and economic impact. Federal agencies must avoid adverse modification of critical habitat. Private land is affected by critical habitat designation only if federal action is involved. The Secretary must consider economic impact when designating critical habitat for listed species, excluding areas if benefits outweigh designation benefits, unless extinction risk is present. Economic factors are not considered in listing species as endangered or threatened, but are in critical habitat designation. Some habitat areas may be excluded from critical habitat designation based on economic concerns, unless extinction of the species would result. Adverse modification of critical habitat is primarily a concern for federal agencies, while restrictions on private land come from the ESA's prohibition on taking listed species. The ESA imposes restrictions on private land use primarily through the prohibition on taking listed species, with fewer restrictions on plants than animals. P.L. 108-136 amended the ESA to exclude Defense Department lands with INRMPs from critical habitat designation. The ESA imposes restrictions on private land use primarily through the prohibition on taking listed species. P.L. 108-136 amended the ESA to exclude Defense Department lands with INRMPs from critical habitat designation, considering national security and military training concerns. The ESA imposes restrictions on private land use through the prohibition on taking listed species. Administrations and Congress have limited FWS's ability to designate critical habitat under the ESA. FWS stated that critical habitat designation is most beneficial when it includes unoccupied areas important for connecting populations or reintroducing new ones. FWS placed critical habitat designation at the lowest priority in its listing budget in 1999. In 1999, FWS prioritized critical habitat designation at the lowest level due to budget constraints, leading to frequent lawsuits for failure to designate critical habitat. Funding restrictions on critical habitat designation have persisted in subsequent appropriations bills. FWS has faced lawsuits for not designating critical habitat, with the agency believing it offers limited protection compared to listing a species. The cost of designation and perceived minimal conservation benefit make it a poor use of resources, especially if the public sees it as the main regulatory impact of the ESA. The designation of critical habitat under the ESA may provide additional protection for listed species in federal actions. Federal agencies must consider if their actions will harm critical habitat. FWS previously disagreed on the level of protection provided, stating it would be rare for habitat harm without species jeopardy. According to FWS, designated critical habitat does not offer extra protection from federal actions as the jeopardy consideration already provides necessary protection. This conclusion was based on the definition of \"destroy or adversely modify,\" which focuses on the survival and recovery of listed species. Several federal courts of appeal agreed with this argument. The definition of \"conservation\" under the ESA was changed in February 2016 after federal courts of appeal found that the previous definition focused on survival rather than recovery of listed species. The Services now directly apply the Act's definition of conservation in evaluating actions' effects on critical habitat during interagency consultation. The Services now apply the Act's definition of conservation in evaluating actions' effects on critical habitat during interagency consultation. The definition in 50 C.F.R. 402.02 emphasizes the act's focus on recovery, stating that destruction or adverse modification diminishes the value of critical habitat for the conservation of a listed species. Such alterations may include those that affect essential physical or biological features for conservation. Recovery plans must be developed for the survival of listed species. The appropriate Secretary must develop recovery plans for the conservation and survival of listed species, covering birds and mammals. A 1988 ESA amendment prohibits favoring specific taxonomic groups in these plans. As of August 24, 2016, there were recovery plans for 1,156 U.S. species, with the ability to acquire land for conservation purposes. As of August 24, 2016, there were recovery plans for 1,156 U.S. species, with the potential acquisition of land for conservation purposes using funds from the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), derived from offshore oil and gas leases. Cooperation with states is required under the ESA for conserving protected species, including entering into cooperative agreements to assist states in their endangered species programs. The 1988 ESA amendments created a fund for state grants to assist in endangered species programs, with federal funds available if states meet specified standards and provide a 25% matching amount. Congress appropriated $53.5 million for cooperative activities with states and territories in FY2016. In FY2016, Congress allocated $53.5 million for cooperative activities with states and territories to assist in endangered species programs. Federal action agencies must complete a biological assessment if their actions may harm a listed species, ensuring actions do not jeopardize the species' existence through consultation with FWS or NMFS. Federal agencies must consult with FWS or NMFS to ensure their actions do not harm endangered species or critical habitat, known as Section 7 consultation. This consultation is required for any activity authorized, funded, or carried out by a federal agency, except when dictated by statute. When a federal action is mandated by statute, a Section 7 consultation is not needed. If the Secretary determines that the action will not harm a species or critical habitat, a biological opinion is issued along with an incidental take statement. If the action is deemed harmful, alternatives must be suggested to avoid harm to the species. The Endangered Species Act requires the Secretary to propose alternatives if a proposed action may harm listed species or critical habitat. The BiOp must be based on the best available scientific and commercial data, as required by implementing regulations. The majority of consultations result in no harm to species. The BiOp is to include a summary of the information on which the opinion is based, with consultations generally resulting in \"no jeopardy\" opinions or finding reasonable alternatives for projects to proceed. Consultations should be completed within 90 days for federal actions, with the possibility of extension up to 150 days with reasons provided for delays. Timeframes for consultations involving nonfederal parties are agreed upon by the relevant parties. Formal consultation for federal actions should be completed within a specified timeframe, with the possibility of extensions for delays. If no alternatives are feasible, the agency must forego the action, risk penalties under the ESA, or obtain an exemption. If jeopardy is expected, the agency can apply for an exemption to proceed with the action. If agency action is unavoidable and an exemption is sought, a high-level Endangered Species Committee decides if the action can proceed despite harm to a species. The committee consists of six federal officials and a representative from each affected state. The Endangered Species Committee requires at least five votes to pass an exemption for future harm to a species. The committee includes six federal officials and has strict rules and deadlines for applying for exemptions. The Secretary of Defense can grant an exemption for national security reasons. The Endangered Species Committee requires five votes to pass an exemption for future harm to a species. The Secretary of Defense can grant an exemption for national security reasons, and the President may exempt projects in disaster areas. Federal agencies must have carried out consultation processes under the ESA to be eligible for an exemption. Under Section 7 of the ESA, federal agencies must conduct consultation processes in good faith and make efforts to consider modifications or alternatives that would not harm endangered species or critical habitats. They must also complete biological assessments and avoid irreversible commitments of resources. The agency must avoid irreversible commitments of resources to ensure consideration of alternatives that would not harm species or habitats. The ESC will grant an exemption if evidence shows no reasonable alternatives exist. Additional requirements are outlined in relevant regulations. The ESC will grant an exemption for a project if no reasonable alternatives exist, the benefits outweigh the drawbacks, the action is of regional or national significance, and no irreversible commitments of resources have been made. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) specifies specific instances when exemptions may be granted, such as for international treaty obligations, national security, and presidentially declared disasters. The exemption process is complex and can take up to 280 days for the applicant. There is no general provision for granting exemptions in other emergency conditions. The exemption process under the Endangered Species Act is complex and could take up to 280 days for the applicant. The decision to exempt an action could jeopardize the existence of a species, leading to rigorous scrutiny. Exemption applicants must fund mitigation measures for the life of the action, and the burden of conservation and recovery falls on the applicant, not the species. The exemption under the Endangered Species Act applies to the action, not the species, shifting the burden of conservation and recovery elsewhere. This may pose challenges for governors balancing state interests and other statutory obligations. Parties may be hesitant to support actions that increase the risk of species extinction. The consultation process under the Endangered Species Act offers federal agencies opportunities to modify their actions to avoid harming species or their habitats while still proceeding with their plans. This can lead to reluctance from parties to support actions that may increase the risk of species extinction. The Endangered Species Act prompts agencies to consider consequences early on to avoid conflicts and exemptions. Private parties can obtain permits for incidental take of species for lawful actions without federal nexus. Applicants must submit a habitat conservation plan detailing impact, mitigation steps, funding, alternatives considered, and other measures. The Endangered Species Act requires agencies to consider consequences early on to avoid conflicts and exemptions. Private parties can obtain permits for incidental take of species for lawful actions without federal nexus. Applicants must submit a habitat conservation plan (HCP) that shows the likely impact, steps to minimize and mitigate the impact, funding for mitigation, alternatives considered and rejected, and any other measures required by the Secretary. The use of this section was greatly expanded in the 1990s, with streamlined procedures for activities with minimal impacts. Other provisions include exemptions for raptors, regulation of subsistence activities by Alaskan Natives, prohibition of interstate transport and sale of listed species and parts, control of trade in parts or products of endangered species owned before the law went into effect, and rules for establishing experimental populations. The Endangered Species Act prohibits various acts such as taking endangered species, possessing, selling, or transporting unlawfully taken species, and violating regulations by FWS or NMFS. Threatened species receive similar protections as endangered species unless specified otherwise. In the absence of a special rule for a threatened species, agency rules state that they are subject to the same protections as endangered species. Violating the ESA by committing prohibited acts applies broadly to anyone under US jurisdiction, with exceptions for incidental take permits. No civil penalties will be imposed on those who can prove a good-faith violation. Section 11 of the ESA states that no civil penalties will be imposed on individuals who can demonstrate a good-faith belief that they were protecting themselves or others from bodily harm from endangered or threatened species. Violators of the ESA may face civil penalties, with higher fines for knowing violators and those involved in the import or export of wildlife. Criminal violations may also apply to certain ESA provisions. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) imposes civil penalties on violators, with higher fines for knowing violations and those involved in wildlife import/export. The ESA allows any person to sue in federal court to enforce its provisions or compel the Secretary to act, with the possibility of receiving litigation costs and attorneys' fees. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) requires written notice of intent to sue 60 days before taking legal action. The court may award litigation costs and attorneys' fees when deemed appropriate. Citizen suit provisions have driven efforts to conserve species and influence listings of species at risk. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) allows citizen suits to challenge delays in listing decisions and has led to numerous lawsuits against FWS and NMFS. ESA also implements CITES and the Western Hemisphere Convention for the United States. The United States implements the Convention on Nature Protection and Wildlife Preservation in the Western Hemisphere (the Western Hemisphere Convention) and CITES, which focuses on trade and categorizes species based on extinction risk. The ESA makes violations of CITES U.S. law if committed within the country's jurisdiction. Through the Western Hemisphere Convention, the U.S. commits to establishing nature reserves and controlling international wildlife trade. The United States, through the Western Hemisphere Convention, commits to establishing nature reserves and controlling international wildlife trade. The ESA designates the Secretary of the Interior as the Endangered Species Scientific Authority specified under CITES. The Secretary of the Interior, as the Endangered Species Scientific Authority under CITES, must ensure that the international trade of living or dead organisms does not harm the species. This authority is enforced through FWS, and export determinations are based on the best available biological information. The Secretary is also the Management Authority for the United States under CITES, responsible for ensuring legal exports and imports. The Secretary of the Interior, as the Management Authority for the United States under CITES, must ensure legal exports and imports of specimens. The ESA prohibits importing or exporting listed species, with exceptions for scientific purposes or species survival. The ESA requires importers and exporters of fish or wildlife to obtain permission, keep records, and use designated ports. The Endangered Species Committee made decisions in three instances. The Endangered Species Committee granted an exemption for the Grayrocks Dam and Reservoir, despite the potential harm to the habitat of endangered whooping cranes in the Platte River Basin. The ESC granted an exemption for Grayrocks Dam and Reservoir on January 23, 1979, with conditions to protect whooping crane habitat on the Platte River. Tellico Dam on the Little Tennessee River faced opposition due to its impact on the endangered snail darter. The Supreme Court case TVA v. Hill clarified the broad reach of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and its impact on public works projects. Congressional passage of P.L. 95-632 followed, establishing an ESC process with an automatic exemption for dams if a decision was not reached within a specified time. The ESC denied an exemption for the Tellico Dam due to economic implications. The ESC denied an exemption for the Tellico Dam, but Congress directed its completion in P.L. 96-69. The ESC also granted exemptions for some Bureau of Land Management timber sales in the habitat of the threatened northern spotted owl. In 1992, the ESC granted exemptions for 13 Oregon timber sales in the habitat of the northern spotted owl, but controversy led to their withdrawal in the Clinton Administration. The Pittston Company applied for an exemption to build a refinery in Eastport, ME, based on jeopardy opinions regarding threatened bald eagles and endangered whales. The company applied for an exemption to build a docking area for barges at Mound City, IL, but withdrew the application in 1986 due to a jeopardy opinion and denial of permits. The Suwanee River Authority sought an exemption for a project to dredge Alligator Pass in Suwanee. The consulting engineer of the Suwanee River Authority applied for an exemption to dredge Alligator Pass in Suwanee Sound, Florida, a habitat for the endangered manatee. The project was denied a permit by the Army Corps of Engineers, and the Authority later refused to ratify the engineer's actions, leading to the withdrawal of the application in 1986."
