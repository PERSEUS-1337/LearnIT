    "content": "Several tax options have been proposed to finance health care reform, including restricting itemized deductions for high-income taxpayers and modifying the tax exclusion for employer-provided health care. The Senate Finance Committee provided a list of options for health-related tax provisions, such as increasing taxes on alcoholic beverages and imposing an excise tax on non-diet sweetened beverages. The House and Senate have proposed various tax options to finance health care reform, including a surtax on high-income individuals and an excise tax on insurers for high-cost plans. The House passed H.R. 3962 and H.R. 3200, while the Senate passed H.R. 3590. The Senate passed H.R. 3590, which includes revenue-raising provisions such as an excise tax on insurers for high-cost plans. President Obama proposed a compromise using H.R. 3590 as a base but with changes to the revenue provisions, including delaying the tax on high-cost employer plans to 2018 and raising the exemption threshold. The new plan proposed by the Administration includes raising the threshold for the tax to $27,500 for families and $10,200 for individuals. It also broadens the Medicare Hospital Insurance tax for high-income households by adding a 3.8% tax on unearned income. The House passed H.R. 3590 and H.R. 4872 on March 22, 2010, with the President signing H.R. 3590 on March 23 and H.R. 4872 on March 30. Detailed revenue estimates for the different versions are provided in the Appendix. The tax proposals in the House and Senate bills, along with reconciliation modifications, differ in their effects on behavior and income distribution. Taxes may rise with income in absolute amounts, but the burden relative to income can vary, affecting higher-income taxpayers more heavily in some cases. For example, the limit on itemized deductions increases taxes for high-income taxpayers, making it a highly progressive change. The tax proposals in the House and Senate bills, along with reconciliation modifications, differ in their effects on behavior and income distribution. Limiting health-related income and payroll-tax exclusions tends to increase taxes more in middle income brackets, with smaller effects at the low and high ends of the income distribution. Excise taxes are regressive and fall more heavily on lower-income classes. The distributional analysis in this report focuses on the financing mechanism of health care reform proposals, which may benefit lower-income families. Despite regressive revenue sources, the overall proposal could redistribute in favor of lower-income individuals. The report reviews revenue raisers proposed in House and Senate bills, by President Obama, and other financing proposals. The final legislation includes various financing proposals, with the most significant revenue raiser being the increased Medicare tax. Other key revenue raisers are the fee on health insurance providers, the \"Cadillac\" tax on employer health insurance premiums, and the fee on branded drugs. These provisions account for a significant portion of the revenue over a 10-year period. The largest revenue raisers in the final legislation include the increased Medicare tax (44%), the \"Cadillac\" tax on employer health insurance premiums (22%), and fees on health insurance providers (14%) and branded drugs (3%). These provisions make up about 90% of the total revenue over a 10-year period, with shares changing over time due to delays and expirations. In 2019, the Medicare tax is 44% of the total revenue, while the Cadillac tax is 22%. Health insurance fees and drug fees account for 14% and 3% respectively. The biofuel provision has expired. Provisions enacted by the new law and their revenue effects can be found in Table A-1. The House Ways and Means Committee announced revenue- and tax-related provisions to fund health care reform, including a tax on high-income individuals. On July 14, 2009, the House Ways and Means Committee introduced revenue and tax provisions for health care reform, including a tax on high-income individuals. By October 2009, legislation was reported out, leading to the Affordable Health Care for America Act, H.R. 3962, which passed on November 14, 2009. This section of the report summarizes the initial provisions and explains the modifications made. The House Ways and Means Committee introduced revenue and tax provisions for health care reform on July 14, 2009. Legislation was reported out in October 2009, leading to the passage of H.R. 3962 on November 14, 2009. The main modifications to the initial proposal involved revising the surtax on high-income taxpayers and adding additional revenue raisers. The surtax was to be imposed on adjusted gross income, with rates ranging from 1% to 5.4% based on income levels. The House proposal introduced a surtax on adjusted gross income, with rates ranging from 1% to 5.4% based on income levels. The tax rates would double in 2013 unless savings occur in health programs. Income levels for married couples were specified, with singles taxed at 80% of those levels. Additionally, a provision was included to align the definition of medical expenses for health savings accounts with itemized deductions for health care. The House proposal included a surtax on adjusted gross income, with rates from 1% to 5.4% based on income levels. It also aimed to align the definition of medical expenses for health savings accounts with itemized deductions for health care. Additionally, the plan included revenue raisers related to international taxation and tax evasion, such as a delay in the revised allocation of interest for the foreign tax credit, a provision to address tax sheltering, and a provision to codify the economic substance doctrine. The House proposal, H.R. 3962, included revenue raisers such as a surtax on incomes over $1 million, expanding dependents for health-related tax purposes, and provisions related to international taxation and tax evasion. These measures aimed to raise billions of dollars over a specified period. H.R. 3962 includes revenue raisers related to international taxation and tax evasion, raising $460.5 billion over the FY2010-FY2014 period. The provision on foreign tax credit interest allocation is projected to raise $6.0 billion, while the economic substance doctrine provision with penalties for underpayments is estimated to raise $5.7 billion. The economic substance doctrine provision in H.R. 3962 includes penalties for underpayments, estimated to raise $5.7 billion. It also imposes restrictions on health-related tax provisions, such as limiting health flexible spending arrangements to $2,500, increasing penalties for nonqualified distributions from health savings accounts, disallowing deductions for subsidies related to Medicare Part D, and imposing a 2.5% excise tax on the first taxable sale of medical devices, projected to raise $20.0 billion. The plan in H.R. 3962 includes an excise tax on medical devices, information reporting on payments to corporations, and extending health benefits for spouses and dependents. The Senate Finance Committee proposal includes provisions for extending health benefits for spouses and dependents, fees on insured and self-insured health plans, and excluding Indian Tribe health benefits from gross income. It also addresses the tax on the sale of medical devices and other provisions in a different form than the H.R. 3962 bill. The Senate Finance Committee proposal includes provisions for extending health benefits, fees on health plans, and excluding Indian Tribe health benefits from gross income. The surtax proposal in H.R. 3962 would affect 0.3% of taxpayers and is highly progressive. The surtax proposal in H.R. 3962 is highly progressive, affecting 0.3% of taxpayers. Concerns have been raised about its impact on small businesses and entrepreneurship. Only about 4% of businesses would be affected initially, with 1.2% of unincorporated businesses paying the revised surtax. Higher-income individuals would be more affected due to their larger share of income. The revised surtax proposal in H.R. 3962 is highly progressive, affecting 1.2% of unincorporated businesses. Higher-income individuals, who have a larger share of income, would be more impacted. IRS statistics show that income is concentrated at higher levels, with returns over $1 million accounting for 15.1% of income but only 0.2% of returns. Business income is also more concentrated in higher-income levels. Labor income makes up about three-quarters of overall income. The concentration of income at higher levels is evident, with labor income accounting for about three-quarters of overall income. Business income is more concentrated in higher-income levels, particularly among individuals with incomes over $1 million and $500,000. This concentration is primarily seen in partnership and Subchapter S firms. Incomes over $500,000 account for 39% of total income, with higher concentrations in partnership and Subchapter S firms. Returns with income over $1 million make up 7.5% of total proprietorship income, while those over $500,000 account for 12.6%. For partnerships and Subchapter S firms, income over $1 million represents 49% of net income, and over $500,000 represents 64% of net income. According to a 2007 Treasury study, taxpayers at the top tax rate are responsible for 61% of business flow-through income. Almost 85% of partnership income is in limited liability companies or limited partnerships, with Subchapter S firms being more broadly distributed. This business income includes passive income and income from tax shelters. The Treasury study found that high-income taxpayers at the top tax rate accounted for only 46% of active positive business income. The Tax Policy Center also noted that only 22.8% of returns affected by the surtax had business income that was more than half of total income, suggesting that much of this income is passive investment income. The Treasury study found that high-income taxpayers at the top tax rate accounted for only 46% of active positive business income. About two-thirds of partnerships reflect finance, real estate, oil and gas extraction, and services. 8% of total income was from real estate and oil and gas, 19% from finance and insurance. The Treasury study found that high-income taxpayers at the top tax rate accounted for only 46% of active positive business income. Most partnerships are in finance, real estate, oil and gas, and services. Income sources include real estate, oil and gas (8%), finance and insurance (19%), professional services (15%), and health (5%). Small business income is often associated with passive investments, stockbrokers, lawyers, doctors, and accountants, rather than innovators or job creators for lower-income individuals. The Treasury study found that high-income taxpayers at the top tax rate accounted for only 46% of active positive business income. Small business income is often associated with passive investments, stockbrokers, lawyers, doctors, and accountants, rather than innovators or job creators for lower-income individuals. Very little of the increased tax revenue is likely to be collected from the businesses of interest, and questions could be raised about the argument that small businesses are important sources of new jobs. The economy creates its own jobs over time, so there is no need for a permanent policy to create jobs. The sector offering more opportunities to women and minorities pays less, is less stable, and has fewer benefits. The impact on small businesses is a major concern regarding job creation policies. The impact on small businesses is a major concern regarding job creation policies. Income from certain business operations could be excluded from a surcharge to address objections. Flow through income is a significant portion of the top 1%'s income. Excluding certain types of income could reduce revenue loss. Other revenue-raising provisions have smaller effects. In the initial bill, certain industries like insurance, oil and gas extraction, and professional services were not permitted an exclusion. Other revenue-raising provisions have smaller effects, with one provision targeting spending on over-the-counter medications as qualified uses of flexible spending plans and health savings accounts. Most of the other provisions discussed are minor, including limits on flexible spending accounts in cafeteria plans and conforming the definition of medical expenses for health savings accounts. The Senate proposal discusses limits on flexible spending accounts in cafeteria plans and aligning the definition of medical expenses for health savings accounts with itemized medical deductions. Some health-related provisions are implemented earlier in the Senate bill, while other significant provisions relate to corporation taxes and the tax gap. The excise tax on medical devices is also briefly discussed. The excise tax on medical devices in the House and Senate bills is discussed. The House bill imposes a 2.5% tax on manufacturers and importers, while the Senate bill has a fixed fee structure. The excise tax on medical devices in the House and Senate bills is imposed on manufacturers and importers. For ordinary devices, the tax is passed on to consumers, leading to higher insurance payments. Unique devices under patent may have some costs absorbed by the producer. The tax could discourage investment in developing new devices. The excise tax on medical devices in the House and Senate bills is imposed on manufacturers and importers, with costs potentially passed on to consumers through higher insurance payments. Industry spokesmen argue that the tax could discourage investment in developing new innovative devices, but this effect may be reduced if consumers do not pay the full price due to health insurance coverage. The interest allocation proposal would repeal a provision from 2004 allowing worldwide interest allocation for the foreign tax credit. The 2004 provision allowed worldwide interest allocation for the foreign tax credit, increasing allowable foreign tax credits and reducing U.S. tax liability for firms with more foreign taxes paid than allowable credits. The provision aims to reduce \"treaty-shopping\" by eliminating the benefit of setting up a subsidiary in a treaty country to avoid withholding tax. The provision aims to eliminate the benefit of setting up a subsidiary in a treaty country to avoid withholding tax and codify the economic substance doctrine. This doctrine disallows tax benefits for arrangements lacking economic substance, with proposals to introduce legislative standards to ensure consistency across courts. President Obama's budget proposals and recent legislative proposals have included provisions requiring transactions to meet objective and subjective tests for profit. Penalties are imposed to reduce tax avoidance. H.R. 3962 includes a provision for information reporting on payments to corporations by firms. Some tax attorneys are concerned about specific rules providing a roadmap for passing the test. H.R. 3962 includes a provision for information reporting on payments to corporations by firms to aid in tax enforcement. This may increase compliance burden on businesses, especially smaller corporations where compliance is a problem. The provision in H.R. 3962 aims to improve tax enforcement by requiring information reporting on payments to corporations, potentially increasing compliance burden. It simplifies reporting requirements by excluding certain fuels from the cellulosic biofuels producer credit. The provision in H.R. 3962 modifies the cellulosic biofuels producer credit to exclude fuels with water, sediment, or ash content like black liquor. Black liquor was previously eligible for the credit but is now excluded. This change was aimed at reducing the use of fossil fuels by the paper industry. The provision in H.R. 3962 modifies the cellulosic biofuels producer credit to exclude fuels with water, sediment, or ash content like black liquor, previously eligible for the credit but now excluded to reduce fossil fuel use by the paper industry. Firms must report payments to unincorporated businesses providing services over $600 per year. Under current law, firms must report payments to unincorporated businesses providing services over $600 per year. If they can't get the vendor's taxpayer ID, they must withhold taxes. The reporting requirements aim to increase third-party reporting to address unreported income, especially from small businesses. Compliance rates for other types of income are higher. The scope of reporting reflects this objective, covering a significant share of payments but only a small fraction overall. The reporting requirements aim to increase third-party reporting to address unreported income, especially from small businesses. The proposal is to expand reporting of payments for services to corporations, which has been suggested for years. There has been a significant increase in small firms in corporate status, leading to the need for this expansion. The expansion of reporting requirements aims to increase compliance, with two potential reasons being the increase in small firms in corporate status and the simplification of compliance for firms. Additionally, the reporting will now include goods as well as services, which is a newer idea that could increase the share of firms expected to file these forms. The expansion of reporting requirements aims to increase compliance by including goods and services, simplifying aspects of compliance for businesses. However, businesses criticize the increased cost and administrative burden, questioning the IRS's ability to utilize the additional resources effectively. The Senate Finance Committee reported S. 1796, America's Healthy Future Act of 2009, which includes proposals to raise the minimum dollar reporting requirement and only require additional information to be reported to the IRS, not the payee unless withholding occurs. The Senate Finance Committee reported S. 1796, America's Healthy Future Act of 2009, which includes a provision for a 40% excise tax on health coverage exceeding certain thresholds. H.R. 3590, passed by the Senate, raises $398.1 billion with a 40% excise tax on health coverage exceeding different thresholds. H.R. 3590 reduced fees on medical devices, increased payroll tax for high-income earners, imposed a 10% excise tax on indoor tanning facilities, and made changes to Blue Cross treatment. It also included temporary fees on insured and self-insured plans, liberalized the adoption credit, and excluded assistance for certain health professionals in state student loan repayment programs. The plan includes provisions related to health tax provisions and health issues, such as conforming medical expenses definitions, limiting health flexible spending arrangements, increasing penalties for nonqualified distributions from health savings accounts, and disallowing certain provisions for state student loan repayment programs for health professionals. The proposal includes various changes to health tax provisions, such as increasing penalties for nonqualified distributions from health savings accounts, disallowing deductions for Medicare Part D subsidies, and limiting deductions for health insurance providers. Additionally, it suggests raising the floor for itemized deductions for medical costs and restricting tax benefits for certain entities. The proposal includes changes to health tax provisions, such as limiting deductions for health insurance providers and imposing fees on manufacturers of medical devices, branded drugs, and indoor tanning facilities. It also includes a fee on insured and self-insured health plans expiring after September 31, 2019. The plan includes a 10% tax on indoor tanning facilities ($2.7 billion) and a fee on insured and self-insured health plans ($2.6 billion) expiring after September 31, 2019. It also introduces an additional 0.9% HI payroll tax on wages over $200,000 for singles and $250,000 for joint returns, projected to raise $86.8 billion. Other provisions include requirements for non-profit hospitals, employer reporting on health benefits, and a safe harbor for nondiscrimination rules in cafeteria plans for small employers. The curr_chunk discusses revenue losing provisions in the plan, including a qualifying therapeutic discovery project credit, exclusion of funds for state student loan repayment programs, and changes to the adoption tax credit. It also mentions the excise tax on health insurance coverage and fees on drugs, medical devices, and health insurance providers. The excise tax on health insurance coverage falls on insurance companies, plan administrators, and employers for certain self-insured plans. It is not deductible and has a 40% rate, serving as a proxy for taxing employer benefits to high-income taxpayers. The excise tax on health insurance coverage has a 40% rate and is not deductible. It serves as a proxy for taxing employer benefits to high-income taxpayers. The provision is expected to increase premiums or reduce benefits for high-income individuals, leading to higher tax liability. This would also raise the price of medical care and decrease demand. The provision is estimated to generate $148.9 billion in revenue over 10 years, smaller than the Finance Committee Plan. The thresholds for the tax would be increased by the CPI plus one percentage point. The excise tax on health insurance coverage has a 40% rate and is not deductible, serving as a proxy for taxing employer benefits to high-income taxpayers. The thresholds for the tax would be increased by the CPI plus one percentage point, with higher limits for those over 55 and in risky professions. The excise tax on health insurance coverage has a 40% rate and is not deductible. Thresholds for the tax would be increased by CPI plus one percentage point, with higher limits for those over 55 and in risky professions. Limits for single and family plans under exceptions are $9,850 and $26,000 respectively. A study by the Committee on Budget Policy and Priorities shows that 90% of plans would be unaffected by the Senate Finance Committee version of this provision. The excise tax on health insurance coverage has a 40% rate and is not deductible, with thresholds for the tax increasing over time. The argument for the tax is to discourage rising health care costs, with economic and distributional effects similar to an across-the-board dollar cap on the exclusion. The tax would be collected at the insurance-company level or health insurance plans' costs would be reduced, potentially leading to higher taxes. An excise tax on health insurance coverage at a 40% rate aims to curb rising healthcare costs. It would be collected at the insurance-company level or reduce health insurance plans' costs, potentially leading to higher taxes. Concerns include fairness issues, impact on lower-income employees, treatment of self-insured firms, and deductibility from income tax. Excise tax revenues are typically reduced by 25% due to interactions, and if deductible, could provide a net tax advantage. H.R. 3590 would increase the HI payroll tax by 0.9% for earnings over $200,000 for single persons and $250,000 for joint returns, raising $86.8 billion in revenue. The tax would be collected by the employer on compensation over $200,000, with the employee responsible for any discrepancies in withholding. The employer would collect taxes on compensation over $200,000, with the employee responsible for any discrepancies. This provision targets high-income taxpayers and raises revenue from fees on health insurance providers, branded drugs, and medical devices. From FY2010 through FY2019, fees on health insurance providers, branded drugs, and medical devices totaled $106.3 billion. The fees on branded drugs were $22.2 billion, on medical devices $19.2 billion, and on health insurance providers they increased over time. For health insurance providers, fees were $2 billion in 2011, $4 billion in 2012, $7 billion in 2013, $9 billion in 2014-2016, and $10 billion thereafter. Medical device fees were $2 billion annually from 2011-2017 and $3 billion thereafter. Branded drug fees were $2.1 billion yearly. Fixed nominal aggregate fees will become less significant over time. The fees on health insurance providers, branded drugs, and medical devices totaled $106.3 billion from FY2010 to FY2019. Branded drug fees were $2.1 billion per year, while medical device fees were $2 billion annually from 2011-2017 and $3 billion thereafter. The fees on insured and self-insured plans, totaling $2.6 billion, finance the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust fund and expire after September 31, 2019. These fees could impact prices, producer profits, and ultimately consumers, potentially discouraging new device and drug development. The fees on health insurance providers, branded drugs, and medical devices totaled $106.3 billion from FY2010 to FY2019. The medical device fee exempts certain devices with a retail cost $100 or less, designed to exclude small items such as pregnancy tests, contact lenses, and blood pressure monitors. The fees provide for a fixed amount of revenue to be collected, with the shares apportioned according to the share of sales. The medical device fee and branded drug fee have a sliding scale to reduce the impact on small producers. For medical devices, the first $5 million in sales is not counted, with 50% of the amount over $5 million but less than $25 million counted. For drugs, the apportionment shares vary based on sales, ranging from 0% to 100%. Insurance premiums are also subject to fees, with the first $25 million exempt and half of premiums between $25 million and beyond included. The fee structure for medical devices and drugs includes exemptions for the first $5 million in sales, with varying percentages of amounts over that threshold included. Insurance premiums are also subject to fees, with exemptions for the first $25 million and partial inclusion for amounts between $25 million and beyond. The fees are not deductible and are imposed as a fixed amount with apportionment, resulting in a tax at the margin without generating additional revenue. The tax at the margin depends on the share of sales produced by individual firms, with a 10% excise tax on indoor tanning facilities included in H.R. 3590. A provision for taxing cosmetic producers was discussed but not included in the final bill. The debate included discussions on a standard excise tax, which may be absorbed by providers. Hospitals classified as charitable organizations receive tax benefits based on meeting a \"community benefit\" standard. The Congressional Budget Office found that nonprofit hospitals provided slightly more charity care than for-profit hospitals. Federal tax exemptions for nonprofit hospitals were estimated to be worth about $6 billion in 2002. The Senate Finance Committee held hearings on this topic. The benefits of federal tax exemptions for nonprofit hospitals were estimated to be about $6 billion in 2002. The Senate Finance Committee and House Ways and Means Committee held hearings on the topic. Senator Grassley raised concerns about nonprofit hospitals, including charity care, community benefits, and asset conversion. The Senate Finance Committee and House Ways and Means Committee held hearings on nonprofit hospitals, focusing on charity care, community benefits, asset conversion, governance, and billing practices. Senator Grassley authorized a round-table discussion on the topic, while the IRS reported that the median share of revenues spent on charity care was 3.9% for nonprofit hospitals. The average nonprofit hospital spent 7.4% of revenues on charity care. A proposal aims to establish specific standards for charity to qualify for exempt status, including a community needs standard and a minimum annual level of charitable patient care. This could have a limited impact on nonprofit hospitals. The provision aims to codify rules for charitable status, including a community needs standard and minimum annual charitable patient care. Flexible spending accounts allow reductions in taxable income for program benefits, chosen under a cafeteria plan. This could increase charity care levels without significant revenue impact. Options for raising revenue through health reimbursement arrangements include limits on contributions or eliminating them. Concerns about these plans include the \"use it or lose it\" nature, with forfeited amounts at the end of the year. Both House and Senate bills limit arrangements to $2,500, with H.R. 3590 indexing amounts by the CPI after 2011. The House and Senate bills limit health reimbursement arrangements to $2,500 and index amounts by the CPI after 2011. Over-the-counter medication costs are not eligible for itemized deductions exceeding the 7.5% floor but are covered under employer health accounts. This provision aligns eligible spending for employer accounts with itemized deductions, disqualifying expenditures on over-the-counter medication like aspirin. Expenditures on over-the-counter medication like aspirin do not qualify as tax-excludible expenses from health reimbursement arrangements. Both House and Senate bills include this provision. Individuals can deduct medical expenses above 7.5% of adjusted gross income, estimated to cost $10.7 billion annually. This provision benefits taxpayers with high medical costs relative to income, especially those without insurance or facing uncovered expenses like mental health care, dental care, and long-term care. It is utilized by about 12 million taxpayers, or 9% of tax returns. The medical expense deduction is utilized by about 12 million taxpayers, or 9% of tax returns. It tends to benefit middle-class taxpayers more than other itemized deductions, with only 15% claimed by higher-income groups. Less than 4% of the deduction is claimed by those with incomes over $200,000. The Senate bill increases the floor for medical expense deductions to 10%, remaining at 7.5% for individuals aged 65 and older and their spouses through 2016. Blue Cross and Blue Shield, along with a few other tax-exempt companies, are eligible for a special deduction of 25% of claims and expenses. Blue Cross and Blue Shield, along with other tax-exempt companies, are eligible for a special deduction of 25% of claims and expenses in excess of surplus. They also have an exception from a rule approximating the taxation of unearned premiums. These provisions were introduced in 1986, replacing a general tax exemption due to the perception of these organizations as community service entities. The revenue loss from this provision is approximately $1 billion annually. In 1986, tax exemptions for Blue Cross and Blue Shield and other tax-exempt companies were removed as their activities were deemed similar to commercial insurance. The Blues still offer specialized and community rates, benefiting shareholders and other groups. A Senate proposal aims to disallow tax benefits for firms with premiums exceeding 85% of claims. Obama Administration released a compromise proposal in 2010 based on H.R. 3590 with modifications. The Obama Administration's 2010 compromise proposal modifies the revenue provisions of H.R. 3590 by delaying the tax on high-cost health insurance plans until 2018. The proposal raises the exemption amount to $27,500 for families and $10,200 for individuals, offsetting revenue loss by broadening the Medicare HI tax. The Obama Administration's compromise proposal delays the tax on high-cost health insurance plans until 2018. It raises the exemption amount to $27,500 for families and $10,200 for individuals. To offset revenue loss, the proposal broadens the Medicare HI tax by increasing the tax rate to 2.35% for high-income married couples and individuals. Additionally, a 2.9% assessment is proposed on unearned income for those earning more than $250,000 for couples and $200,000 for individuals. The President's compromise proposal includes revenue provisions for high-income earners, clarifying tax credits for certain byproducts and codifying the economic substance doctrine. It also reduces and delays the tax on high-cost insurance, impacting revenue from $148.9 billion to $32 billion. Additionally, there is an additional Medicare tax on unearned income for those earning above specified thresholds. The House passed the Senate bill, H.R. 3590, with the President expected to sign it on March 23. H.R. 4872 was also passed by the House, and the Senate is currently reviewing it. Amounts paid by firms for employee health insurance are excluded from wages and not subject to income or payroll taxes. The Senate Finance included the option of capping the exclusion for employer-supplied health insurance. This exclusion applies to amounts paid by firms for employee health insurance, which are not subject to income or payroll taxes. Health insurance benefits can include group insurance, self-insurance, cafeteria plans, health savings accounts, and flexible spending accounts. The Senate Finance Committee discussed capping the exclusion for employer-supplied health insurance as a revenue option. Various proposals have been made, including a dollar limit based on a benchmark plan or income, or both. The Advisory Panel on Tax Reform in the Bush Administration also proposed a cap based on the average cost of insurance. This discussion is part of finding health-related financing options. The Senate Finance Committee discussed capping the employer exclusion for health insurance as a revenue option. The exclusion is the largest health-related income tax benefit, costing billions annually and growing at about 8% per year. The increased tax revenue from the payroll tax would be offset by benefit increases. The Senate Finance Committee considered capping the employer exclusion for health insurance as a revenue option. The revenue effect of capping health benefits at the 75th percentile of employer health insurance costs in 2009 was estimated to be $14 billion in 2010, $25 billion in 2011, and increasing. This would recover only part of the revenue lost from the tax exemption related to income and payroll taxes. The Tax Policy Center estimates that a cap on health insurance costs could raise significant revenue, with different growth rates depending on indexing for inflation. If not indexed, it could raise $18.2 billion in 2010 and reach $226.5 billion in 2019. Indexed for general price inflation, it would raise $17.4 billion in 2010 and $174.6 billion in 2019. Indexed for health price inflation, it would raise $10.2 billion in 2010. A cap on health insurance costs could raise significant revenue, with different growth rates depending on indexing for inflation. If not indexed, it could raise $18.2 billion in 2010 and reach $226.5 billion in 2019. Indexed for general price inflation, it would raise $17.4 billion in 2010, growing at a rate of 29.2%, and reaching $174.6 billion in 2019. Indexed for health price inflation, it would raise $10.2 billion in 2010, growing at a rate of 9.8%, and reaching $23.6 billion in 2019. Caps need to be indexed to health price inflation to maintain a relatively even revenue stream. Caps on health insurance costs need to be indexed to health price inflation to maintain a steady revenue stream. The employer exclusion for health care insurance has been criticized for favoring high-income employees and incentivizing the purchase of excessive insurance, leading to increased demand for health care and higher costs. Individuals with higher marginal tax rates are more likely to be covered by employer health care insurance, benefiting from greater tax advantages. The top tax bracket saves $0.35 in income taxes for every dollar of excluded income, compared to $0.15 for the average taxpayer in the 15% bracket. The payroll-tax exclusion benefits are less targeted towards higher-income families due to flat rate taxes and income caps on the Social Security portion. The tax benefit from payroll taxes is not as targeted towards higher-income families, as the excluded income does not rise with an individual's income. This suggests that repealing the tax benefit would not necessarily be progressive. The tax increases generally rise with income, but the tax benefit may not keep pace with income. The tax benefit from repealing the tax exclusion may not be progressive, as the tax effects as a percentage of income are highest in the middle income brackets. This change would result in a proportional tax change across much of the population, with smaller burdens on lower- and higher-income taxpayers. Repealing the tax exclusion may not be progressive, as the tax effects are highest in middle income brackets. A cap related to income would lead to a different distribution, with smaller burdens on lower- and higher-income taxpayers. The average tax increase from repealing the exclusion cannot be directly tied to the size of the health insurance benefit package. The exclusion has been supported to reduce adverse selection in healthcare. The exclusion of employer-provided health insurance from taxes, which averages around 20% to 25%, results in excluded income of approximately $15,000. This exclusion helps reduce adverse selection in the healthcare market by balancing costs and participation between healthy and less healthy individuals. Concerns exist that altering tax subsidies for employer health insurance could decrease employer participation, affecting 62% of the non-elderly population. A cap on the exclusion could potentially address these issues. A cap on the exclusion of employer-provided health insurance from taxes could address concerns about tax subsidies affecting employer participation without significantly impacting coverage. However, challenges include determining includable income for tax purposes and potential inequities in assigning income to employees based on geographic location and number of individuals covered. The economic costs of health insurance for employees vary by location, number of individuals covered, age, sex, and health status. Employer plans involve implicit cost shifting, with characteristics of the group affecting premiums for firms that purchase insurance and claims for firms that self-insure. Employer insurance benefits can be affected by group characteristics, such as age and location. Varying by family coverage is common, but not necessarily by age. Including age-based variations may result in higher costs for older individuals, reflecting the benefits of health insurance but potentially being burdensome. Including age-based variations in employer insurance benefits may result in large inclusions in income for older individuals, reflecting the implicit benefits of health insurance. This could shift the burden towards higher incomes, as older individuals tend to earn more. However, requiring income imputations that do not vary with age may impose burdens on younger individuals with lower incomes and discourage their participation. Not varying the imputed income from health benefits by age may still produce inequities across employees. Imputed income from health benefits may create inequities across employees based on age, gender, and workforce health. Adjusting for these characteristics could add to administrative burden. The exclusion of benefits in income could be set under the same rules as COBRA benefits, allowing for continuation of insurance on leaving a job. The Senate Finance Committee options document suggests reformulating the exclusion as a deduction, credit, or a combination of the two to equalize treatment across taxpayers of different incomes. The Senate Finance Committee suggests reformulating the exclusion of benefits as a deduction, credit, or a combination of the two to equalize treatment across taxpayers of different incomes. An alternative approach could be to restrict deductions for employers, reducing or eliminating the deduction available for insurance costs exceeding a certain limit. The Senate Finance Committee suggests reformulating the exclusion of benefits as a deduction, credit, or a combination of the two to equalize treatment across taxpayers of different incomes. Another approach could be to restrict deductions for employers, reducing or eliminating insurance costs exceeding a certain limit, which would also raise revenues and discourage overly generous health insurance packages. Other health-related tax expenditures were considered, with the second-largest being the revenue loss from excluding Medicare benefits from income for tax purposes. The JCT estimated the tax expenditure from excluding Medicare benefits at $40.6 billion. Administrative challenges prevent altering this provision. Exclusions for military dependents and retirees are also not included. Health savings accounts allow tax-deductible contributions and tax exclusions for employer contributions. Investment earnings and income spent on medical costs are not taxable. Health savings accounts (HSAs) allow tax-deductible contributions and tax exclusions for employer contributions. Investment earnings are not taxable, and income spent on medical costs is also not taxable. Distributions for other purposes are includable in income and subject to a 10% additional tax. HSAs have a dollar cap and cost about $0.5 billion per year in foregone taxes according to JCT estimates. They allow individuals to purchase insurance against catastrophic costs but not for routine costs, reducing the incentive to overspend on healthcare. However, they exacerbate adverse selection. The Finance Committee options paper discusses limiting contributions under high deductible health plans and increasing penalties for non-medical uses of HSAs. Distributions from HSAs would only be tax-exempt for medical expenses with employer or third-party verification. Proposals also include capping HSA contributions by employers. The Senate Finance Committee proposal aims to clarify the exception for students from paying FICA taxes on certain services while employed by their school, particularly focusing on medical residents. This proposal would also include HSA contributions under a general employer cap. The Senate Finance Committee proposal aims to codify recent regulations addressing the intermingling of services and study, clarify definitions, and establish a dollar limit for exceptions. It would extend Medicare coverage and associated taxes to all state and local employees, potentially increasing Medicare costs due to expanded coverage. The Senate Finance Committee proposal includes provisions to increase health insurance payroll taxes for Medicare funding. It also discusses options for excise tax increases on alcoholic and sugared beverages, as well as tobacco taxes. Different rates apply to various types of alcoholic beverages. Alcoholic beverage taxes vary based on the type of beverage. Distilled spirits are taxed at $13.50 per proof gallon, equivalent to $0.21 per ounce of alcohol. Beer is taxed at $18 per barrel, approximately $0.10 per ounce of alcohol. Wine is taxed at $1.07 per gallon for table wine with 12.5% alcohol, amounting to $0.07 per ounce of alcohol. Alcohol taxes are levied per unit and their real value falls over time due to inflation, with the last revision in 1991. If the $13.50 per gallon rate on distilled spirits in 1991 were to have kept pace with inflation, it would be about $19.60 currently. Many issues arise with alcohol taxes similar to those with tobacco taxes. Alcohol use has health cost consequences, especially with heavy drinking. Alcohol taxes, like tobacco taxes, have consequences for health costs and are larger than current taxes. Consumption is responsive to price changes, and taxes tend to be regressive, collecting a larger percentage of low-income individuals' income. The distributional data on federal excise taxes effects is limited, with the latest data from a 1990 study. Alcohol taxes are regressive, impacting low-income individuals more. Higher income classes likely spend more on expensive alcohols, skewing the burden towards lower income classes. Alcohol taxes are regressive, impacting low-income individuals more because higher income classes are likely to buy more expensive alcohols. The unit tax nature of excise taxes tends to make them more regressive than sales taxes. The proposal aims to increase taxes on alcohol, making them more regressive than sales taxes. This change would equalize taxes on beer, wine, and distilled spirits, with the tax on beer at 4.5% alcohol level being $44.64 per barrel and the tax on table wine at 12.5% alcohol level being $3.88 per gallon. The proposed tax increase on alcohol would result in higher taxes on beer, wine, and distilled spirits. The tax on beer at a 4.5% alcohol level would be $44.64 per barrel, while the tax on table wine at a 12.5% alcohol level would be $3.88 per gallon. The tax changes would generate an estimated $5.7 billion in revenue, with significant increases for wine and beer. The proposed tax increase on alcohol would raise $5.7 billion in revenue per year. The tax on wine would increase by 225% or $2.2 billion, and the tax on beer by 148% or $5 billion. The increase in price is expected to decrease consumption, with beer consumption elasticity estimated at 0.16. The elasticity estimates for alcohol consumption suggest that price changes have a limited impact. Beer consumption elasticity is 0.16, wine is 0.58, and spirits is 0.39, with an overall elasticity of 0.52. Current alcohol sales total $187.6 billion, with beer at $99.3 billion, spirits at $61.1 billion, and wine at $27.2 billion. Price increases of 5% for beer, 8.1% for wine, and 1.5% for spirits would result in a 0.8% decrease in beer consumption, 4.7% decrease in wine consumption, and 0.6% decrease in spirits consumption. The proposal includes a tax on non-diet sweetened beverages, with estimates suggesting a tax of one cent per 12-ounce can could raise about $1.5 billion per year, and a tax of one cent per ounce could raise about $17 billion annually. Unlike with alcohol, the tax would target sweetened beverages. A tax of one cent per ounce on sweetened beverages could raise $17 billion annually. The tax may be regressive and some question singling out this food source. Individual taxpayers can choose to take a standard deduction or itemize. Most food items have small price elasticities. Taxpayers can choose to take a standard deduction or itemize deductions, including taxes, home mortgage interest, charitable contributions, medical expenses, and casualty losses. The largest share of itemized deductions are for mortgage interest and taxes, with income taxes making up almost 60% of the total deductions. The largest share of itemized deductions are for mortgage interest (36%) and taxes (35%), with income taxes making up almost 60% of the total deductions. President Obama's tax proposals include capping the value of itemized deductions for the top two tax rates to 28%, expected to raise revenues by about $25 billion when fully effective in FY2012. When the 2001 tax cuts expire, top tax rates will rise to 36% and 39.5%, affecting high-income taxpayers. This provision is expected to raise about $25 billion in revenues by FY2012. Itemized deductions mainly benefit one-third of taxpayers, with the value increasing with the marginal tax rate. The proposal aims to increase tax rates for high-income taxpayers, specifically targeting the top 2% of incomes. Taxpayers with incomes over $250,000 would be primarily affected, with the $200,000-to-$500,000 income class representing 11.4% of itemized deductions and the $500,000-and-over income class representing 14.6%. These taxpayers likely contribute around one-fifth of itemized deductions, with varying percentages for different deduction types based on income levels. The $500,000-and-above income class accounts for 4% of mortgage interest deductions, 3% of property taxes deductions, and 32% of charitable contributions deductions. Concerns were raised about the impact on charitable contributions, but studies suggest only a modest 1% reduction in giving due to limited tax benefit and behavioral responses. The cap on charitable deductions has limited effects due to small tax benefit impact and behavioral responses. Higher-income individuals favoring health, art, and education would be more affected, while giving to religious organizations or basic welfare would see smaller effects. Excluding these deductions from the cap could sacrifice a quarter of expected revenue gain. Other proposals suggest more significant restrictions on itemized deductions. President Obama proposes base-broadening provisions to increase compliance and reduce the tax gap, resulting in about $1 billion in revenue gain when fully implemented. The tax provisions proposed by President Obama aim to increase compliance and reduce the tax gap, resulting in about $1 billion in revenue gain. Another set of provisions includes revisions affecting financial institutions, tax accounting methods, and estate tax, raising around $5 to $6 billion per year. The largest revenue loss comes from restrictions on valuation discounts for family-owned assets for estate tax purposes. The largest provisions in the tax proposal include restrictions on valuation discounts for family-owned assets for estate tax purposes, modification of corporate-owned life insurance, and repeal of a certain inventory valuation method. These provisions could generate additional revenues through rate increases, widening rate brackets, expanding the base, or increasing tax rates. Burman suggests reducing the indexing of rate brackets to CPI minus 1% instead of CPI to raise additional revenues. This proposal could generate $8 billion in 2010 and $50 billion in 2019, growing over time. The proposal aims to raise $8 billion in 2010 and $50 billion in 2019 by increasing the capital gains tax, taxing carried interest as ordinary income, reforming international tax enforcement, and repealing LIFO inventories. Revenue estimates from the Treasury's \"Greenbook\" show that raising tax rates on capital gains and dividends would raise about $5 billion, carried interest would initially raise about $3 billion, and LIFO repeal would raise about $6 billion. The Treasury's \"Greenbook\" proposes raising tax rates on capital gains and dividends to raise $5 billion, taxing carried interest as ordinary income for $3 billion, and repealing LIFO inventories for $6 billion. International reforms could raise over $20 billion, while increasing payroll taxes could generate $100 billion annually. Eliminating the Social Security earnings cap could raise $84 billion. The employee and employer share of payroll taxes could raise $100 billion annually. Eliminating the Social Security earnings cap may generate $84 billion in revenue. Other options for raising revenue include a 10% value added tax (VAT) for $600 billion and a carbon tax or auction revenue from a cap and trade system. The VAT would introduce new administrative compliance challenges. The potential revenue sources include a carbon tax or auction revenue from a cap and trade system. Implementing a value-added tax (VAT) may pose administrative challenges and may not be worth the costs if large revenue sources are not desired. Transition and compliance issues would also arise. Excise taxes, carbon tax, or cap and trade would be difficult to implement and may have regressive effects. The text discusses important program issues related to regressive taxes in H.R. 3962 and H.R. 3590, comparing revenue provisions and reform proposals.
