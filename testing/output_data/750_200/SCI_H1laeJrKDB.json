Recent works have focused on studying the semantics of the latent space to improve control and understanding of generative models. This paper introduces a new method to enhance interpretability by identifying meaningful directions in the latent space for precise control. This paper introduces a new method to find meaningful directions in the latent space of generative models for precise control over properties of generated images like position or scale. The method is weakly supervised and suitable for simple transformations such as translation, zoom, or color variations, demonstrated effectively for GANs and variational auto-encoders. Generative models like GANs and variational auto-encoders have been successful in producing high-resolution images for various applications. However, the lack of control over generated images limits their use. More control could enhance approaches for generating new training examples by allowing users to specify image properties. Initial attempts have shown that modifying attributes of generated images is possible. Generative models like GANs and variational auto-encoders have shown potential in creating high-resolution images for different applications. Recent efforts have focused on enhancing user control over generated images by allowing specific property selection. Studies have demonstrated the ability to modify image attributes by manipulating latent codes or combining codes from different images. Understanding the latent space of generative models provides valuable insights into their structure, which is crucial for learning unsupervised data representations. The latent spaces of generative models like auto-encoders exhibit a vector space structure where directions encode factors of variations such as object presence, position, and lighting. Factors of variations are categorized as modal (discrete values) and continuous (range of values). The latent space of generative models, like auto-encoders, exhibits a vector space structure encoding factors of variations such as object presence, position, and lighting. These factors can be categorized as modal (discrete values) and continuous (range of values), providing an efficient representation of natural images. This approach to characterizing images is promising for explaining the latent space of generative models. In this paper, a method is proposed to find meaningful directions in the latent space of generative models for precise control over specific continuous factors of variations. Previous works mainly focused on semantic labeled attributes like gender, emotion, or object category. The method proposed allows precise control over specific continuous factors of variations in image generative models without the need for labeled datasets or an encoder. It focuses on factors like vertical position, horizontal position, and scale, with potential for adaptation to other variations such as rotations, brightness, contrast, and color. Our method focuses on finding interpretable directions in the latent space of generative models, allowing for precise control over factors like position and scale. This approach can reveal insights about the structure of the latent space and does not require labeled datasets or an encoder. In the latent space of generative models, interpretable directions can be found to control properties of generated images precisely. A novel reconstruction loss is proposed for inverting generative models, and the difficulty of optimization inversion is discussed. The impact of disentanglement on controlling generative models is studied, highlighting the ease of modifying image properties compared to obtaining descriptive labels. In the study of controlling generative models, it is easier to modify image properties than to obtain descriptive labels. By determining the latent code of transformed images, the direction in the latent space for specific transformations can be found. In controlling generative models, determining the latent code of transformed images helps find the direction in the latent space for specific transformations. The generative model G maps latent space Z to image space I, with transformations characterized by a continuous parameter. The goal is to find the latent code z T such that G(z T ) approximates the transformed image T T (I) to estimate the factor of variation encoded by the transformation. The text discusses estimating the latent code of an image by minimizing a reconstruction error between the original image and its projection. The choice of reconstruction error is crucial in this optimization problem, as solutions may end up in low likelihood regions of the distribution, resulting in unrealistic reconstructed images. The choice of reconstruction error in optimizing the latent code of an image is crucial. Commonly used pixel-wise Mean Squared Error and cross-entropy can lead to blurry images. Alternative errors have been proposed but are computationally expensive. The pixel-wise Mean Squared Error is often criticized for favoring expected values and producing blurry images. The limited capacity of neural networks in the frequency domain results in textures being reconstructed as uniform regions. The limited capacity of neural networks in the frequency domain results in textures being reconstructed as uniform regions. To address this, a new loss function is proposed to reduce the weight of high frequencies, leading to sharper results. To improve image sharpness, a new loss function is proposed that reduces the importance of high frequencies in error penalization. This allows for a wider range of possibilities in generating images with more details and realistic textures. A qualitative comparison of reconstruction errors and different choices of parameters is provided in Appendix C, along with a quantitative comparison to other loss functions. The text discusses a new loss function proposed to improve image sharpness by reducing the impact of high frequencies in error penalization. It includes a qualitative comparison of reconstruction errors and parameter choices in Appendix C, as well as a quantitative comparison to other loss functions using the LPIPS metric. The optimization problem of finding z T such that G(z T ) \u2248 T T (I) is addressed, with considerations for using an L2 penalty on the norm of z and difficulties in choosing the hyper-parameter \u03b2. The text discusses the optimization problem of finding z T such that G(z T ) \u2248 T T (I), with difficulties in choosing the hyper-parameter \u03b2. It introduces Algorithm 1 for creating a dataset of trajectories in the latent space corresponding to a transformation T in the pixel space. The transformation is controlled by a parameter \u03b4t, with z 0 and \u03b4t n retained in D at each step for training. The optimization problem involves finding z T such that G(z T ) \u2248 T T (I), with difficulties in choosing the hyper-parameter \u03b2. Algorithm 1 creates a dataset of trajectories in the latent space corresponding to a transformation T in the pixel space. The transformation is controlled by a parameter \u03b4t, with z 0 and \u03b4t n retained in D at each step for training. Zhu et al. (2016) proposed using an auxiliary network to estimate z T for initialization, as training a specific network for this task is costly. To address the costly nature of training a specific network for initialization, the optimization problem involves finding z T such that G(z T ) \u2248 T T (I). The highly curved nature of the manifold of natural images in pixel space can slow down convergence. By decomposing the transformation T T into smaller transformations and solving sequentially, the optimization is guided on the manifold to improve convergence. Our approach decomposes the transformation T into smaller transformations and solves sequentially, without requiring extra training. Ignoring undefined regions in the image and considering limitations of generative models, we compare our method to naive optimization in Appendix C. When applying our method, we discard latent codes with high reconstruction errors in generated trajectories to reduce outliers. The generative model may struggle to produce images outside the dataset's object shape positions. To reduce outliers, high reconstruction error latent codes are discarded in generated trajectories. One tenth of the codes with the worst errors are removed, leading to Algorithm 1 for trajectory generation in the latent space. The model posits that a factor of variation's parameter can be predicted from the latent code's coordinate along an axis. The model predicts a factor of variation from the latent code's coordinate along an axis. The distribution of the factor is determined by a function g when z follows a normal distribution. For example, in the dSprite dataset, the horizontal position of an object follows a uniform distribution while the projection of z onto an axis follows a normal distribution. The distribution of the parameter t is not known, so a parametrized model g \u03b8 is adopted with trainable parameters (\u03b8, u). Piece-wise linear functions are typically used for g \u03b8, but the model cannot be trained directly due to lack of access to t. The model cannot be trained directly due to lack of access to t, so \u03b4t is modeled instead. Parameters u and \u03b8 are estimated by minimizing MSE between \u03b4t and f(\u03b8,u) using gradient descent. This method allows for estimation of image distribution and sampling using g\u03b8. The method allows for estimation of image distribution and sampling using g\u03b8, providing control over the outputs of a generative model. Knowledge of these distributions can also help reveal potential bias in the training dataset. The datasets used in the experiments include dSprites with binary images of shapes and ILSVRC with natural images from various categories. The experiments were implemented using TensorFlow 2.0 and the code is available online. The experiments were implemented using TensorFlow 2.0 with a BigGAN model for generating images from different categories. The model takes a latent vector and a one-hot vector as inputs, which are then split into six parts for generating images at different scale levels. The study trained \u03b2-VAEs to explore disentanglement in image generation using Conditional Batch Normalization layers. Training was done on dSprites with an Adam optimizer for 1e5 steps. Evaluating the method's effectiveness on complex datasets is challenging due to the difficulty in directly measuring factors of variation. The study focused on analyzing two factors of variations, position, and scale, in image generation. For complex datasets like natural images from BigGAN, saliency detection was used to estimate position by extracting the barycenter. Scale was evaluated based on the proportion of salient features. The study utilized saliency detection to evaluate scale in image generation, using a model implemented in PyTorch. The evaluation procedure involved sampling latent codes and generating images to estimate the factor of variation. Jahanian et al. (2019) proposed an alternative method for quantitative evaluation using an object detector. The proposed approach for quantitative evaluation in image generation involves controlling the position and scale of objects precisely. The study focused on ten chosen categories of objects from ILSVRC, excluding non-actual objects like \"beach\" or \"cliff\". Results show the ability to manipulate object position and scale effectively. The study focused on controlling object position and scale precisely for ten chosen categories from ILSVRC. Results show shared directions for factors of variations across all categories. Qualitative results are also provided for illustration. The study demonstrates shared directions for factors of variations across all categories, with qualitative results provided for illustration. BigGAN uses hierarchical latent code split into six parts injected at different levels of the generator to encode position and scale. The squared norm of each part of the latent code is reported for horizontal position, vertical position, and scale, showing that spatial factors of variations are mainly encoded. The latent code in Figure 4 encodes spatial variations for horizontal position, vertical position, and scale. Y position has a higher contribution from level 5 compared to x position and scale. Quantitative results are shown for geometric transformations on the ILSVRC dataset. The algorithm's performance is affected by large scales, likely due to poor saliency model performance when the object covers most of the image. Correlations between object position and background may be introduced by transformations, impacting performance. Testing the effect of disentanglement on method performance is necessary. The effectiveness of the method in controlling object position in images depends on the degree of disentanglement in the latent space, with better results observed with a larger \u03b2 value in \u03b2-VAE training on dSprites. The method's effectiveness in controlling object position in images depends on the degree of disentanglement in the latent space, with better results seen with a larger \u03b2 value. This motivates the interest in disentangled representations for control in the generative process. The aim is to find interpretable directions in the latent space of generative models for control. Generative models like GANs and auto-encoders offer different ways to obtain latent representations of images. Conditional GANs allow for category or property control but require labeled data. VAEs face a trade-off between reconstruction accuracy and sample plausibility. Our method does not require labels, unlike other approaches such as VAE and InfoGan, which aim to improve reconstruction accuracy and disentangle the latent space by adding codes or using conditional reconstruction. Our approach focuses on disentangling the latent space in generative models without changing the learning process or requiring a priori knowledge of the factor of variation sought. In contrast to analyzing activations of neurons like Bau et al. (2018), our work emphasizes controlling the latent space rather than intermediate activations inside the generator. Our work focuses on disentangling the latent space in generative models without requiring prior knowledge of the factors of variation. We introduce a procedure to find the latent representation of an image when an encoder is not available, building on previous works that optimize the latent code to minimize reconstruction error between generated and target images. The process involves optimizing the latent code to minimize reconstruction error between generated and target images. Methods to improve results on challenging datasets have been introduced, but may fail on more complex datasets. The reconstruction loss is adapted to improve reconstruction quality significantly, with theoretical justification for the difficulties in inverting a generative model. White (2016) discusses vector space arithmetic in a latent space. In the context of generative models, White (2016) suggests using spherical interpolation to reduce blurriness in images generated by a VAE. A new algorithmic data augmentation technique called \"synthetic attribute\" is proposed to generate less blurry images. Recent works on ArXiv emphasize the importance of finding interpretable directions in the latent space to control generative model outputs. In 2019, Jahanian et al. highlighted the importance of finding interpretable directions in the latent space of generative models like BigGAN. Their method differs from ours in training procedure and evaluation, as they directly train their model while we first generate a dataset of trajectories. The curr_chunk discusses the use of a saliency model instead of MobileNet-SSD v1 for evaluation, the impact of disentangled representations on control, and an alternative reconstruction error for inverting generators. The main difference identified is the model of the latent space used. The curr_chunk proposes a method to extract meaningful directions in the latent space of generative models for precise control over the generative process and interpretability in their latent representations. It shows that a linear subspace of the latent space of BigGAN can be used to control properties of generated images. The text discusses interpreting factors of variation in the latent space of generative models to control image properties. It explores using a linear subspace of BigGAN's latent space for this purpose, focusing on Fourier transforms and loss calculations. The text discusses using the Plancherel theorem to calculate the loss in Fourier space. By modeling the generator's inability to capture high-frequency patterns as uncertainty in phase, the contribution to the total loss directly depends on the magnitude of the Fourier transform. The \u03b2-VAE framework aims to discover interpretable latent representations for images without supervision. A simple convolutional VAE architecture was designed for experiments, generating 64x64 images with a decoder network using transposed convolutions. The optimization process favors smoother images with less high frequencies, influenced by the constant term r 2 in the loss function. The decoder network for generating 64x64 images in the \u03b2-VAE framework uses transposed convolutions with specific filter sizes and strides. The architecture includes Dense layers and reshaping before the final transposed convolutions with sigmoid activation. The decoder network in the \u03b2-VAE framework uses transposed convolutions with specific filter sizes and strides. The architecture includes Dense layers and reshaping before the final transposed convolutions with sigmoid activation. The reconstructed results show good performance with \u03c3 = 3 and \u03c3 = 5, penalizing higher values for less accurate reconstruction. Comparisons with other approaches are illustrated in Figure 7. The decoder network in the \u03b2-VAE framework uses specific filter sizes and strides for transposed convolutions. Results show good performance with \u03c3 = 3 and \u03c3 = 5, penalizing higher values for less accurate reconstruction. A comparison with other approaches is illustrated in Figure 7. The approach proposed in Eq. 2 shows accurate reconstruction and avoids artifacts by restricting z to a ball of radius \u221a d. A quantitative evaluation of the performance was also conducted. The approach restricts z to a ball of radius \u221a d to avoid artifacts and shows accurate reconstruction. A quantitative evaluation using the LPIPS metric indicates that images reconstructed with this method are perceptually closer to the target image compared to MSE or DSSIM. The reconstruction error method produces images closer to the target image than MSE or DSSIM. The natural image manifold's curvature complicates solving the optimization problem. Common transformations result in curved trajectories in pixel space. The curvature of images undergoing common transformations like translation, rotation, and scaling in pixel space is analyzed using the dSprites dataset. PCA is used to visualize the trajectories of the transformations, showing that large translations result in orthogonal paths in pixel-space. Rotation and scaling also exhibit similar behavior, while brightness does not pose the same issue. During optimization of the latent code, the gradient of the reconstruction loss with respect to the generated image is affected by near orthogonality in pixel-space transformations like rotation and scale. This results in small gradients of the error with respect to the latent code, impacting the optimization process. In ideal cases, a basis of tangent vectors to the manifold of natural images can be defined for better optimization. In ideal cases, a basis of tangent vectors to the manifold of natural images can be defined for better optimization. When the direction of descent in pixel space is near orthogonal to the manifold described by the generative model, optimization slows down and can stop if the gradient of the loss with respect to the generated image is orthogonal to the manifold. The latent space of dimension 2 encodes the position of the circle in a generated image. Moving the circle from left to right results in a small translation that does not change the reconstruction error. Qualitative examples for geometric transformations and brightness are shown using the BigGAN model. The BigGAN model is used for generating images with variations in position, scale, and brightness. Latent codes are sampled to control these variations, but controlling brightness may be challenging for some categories due to training data limitations. The direction for position and scale is learned on specific categories. The BigGAN model generates images with variations in position, scale, and brightness. Controlling brightness may be challenging for some categories due to training data limitations. The direction for position and scale is learned on specific categories, while brightness is learned on the top five categories."
