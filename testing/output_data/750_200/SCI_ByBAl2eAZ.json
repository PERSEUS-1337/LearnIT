    "content": "Deep reinforcement learning methods can use noise injection in the action space for exploratory behavior. An alternative approach is adding noise directly to the agent's parameters, leading to more consistent exploration. Combining parameter noise with traditional RL methods benefits both off- and on-policy methods, as shown in experimental comparisons of DQN, DDPG, and TRPO on various environments. Both off- and on-policy methods benefit from noise injection in the action space for exploratory behavior, as shown in experimental comparisons of DQN, DDPG, and TRPO on high-dimensional discrete action environments and continuous control tasks. Efficient exploration is crucial in deep reinforcement learning to prevent premature convergence to local optima, but it remains challenging due to the lack of direction from the reward function in the underlying Markov decision process. Various methods have been proposed to address this challenge in high-dimensional and continuous-action environments, often relying on complex additional structures. Various methods have been proposed to address the challenge of exploration in high-dimensional and continuous-action Markov decision processes (MDPs). One approach is the addition of temporally-correlated noise or parameter noise to increase exploratory behavior in algorithms like bootstrapped DQN and DDPG. This helps in obtaining a policy with a larger variety of behaviors. The addition of parameter noise improves exploration by obtaining a policy with a larger variety of behaviors. This paper explores combining parameter space noise with deep RL algorithms like DQN, DDPG, and TRPO to enhance their exploratory capabilities. Parameter space noise is effectively combined with deep RL algorithms like DQN, DDPG, and TRPO to enhance exploratory behavior, outperforming traditional action space noise-based methods, especially in tasks with sparse reward signals. The standard RL framework involves an agent interacting with a fully observable environment modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP). The environment is defined by states, actions, initial state distribution, reward function, transition probabilities, time horizon, and discount factor. The agent aims to maximize expected discounted return by following a policy parametrized by \u03b8, which can be deterministic or stochastic. The agent's goal in reinforcement learning is to maximize expected return by following a policy. This paper explores off-policy algorithms like Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG). DQN uses a deep neural network to estimate the optimal Q-value function. Policy Gradients (DDPG, BID18) and Deep Q-Networks (DQN) use deep neural networks to estimate optimal Q-value functions. The policy is implicitly defined by Q, encouraging exploration through stochastic policies. DDPG is for continuous action spaces, while DQN uses off-policy data from a replay buffer. DDPG is an actor-critic algorithm for continuous action spaces. The actor maximizes the critic's Q-values by back-propagating through both networks. Exploration is achieved through action space noise, either uncorrelated or correlated. On-policy methods require updating function. Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) is an on-policy method that improves upon traditional policy gradient methods by computing an ascent direction that ensures a small change in the policy distribution. It solves a constrained optimization problem to update function approximators according to the currently followed policy. Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) solves a constrained optimization problem to update function approximators according to the currently followed policy, ensuring a small change in the policy distribution. Policies are represented as parameterized functions, such as neural networks, allowing for structured exploration. To achieve structured exploration, policies are sampled by adding Gaussian noise to the parameter vector. This perturbed policy is kept fixed for the entire rollout. State-dependent exploration distinguishes between action space noise and parameter space noise. State-dependent exploration involves a crucial difference between action space noise and parameter space noise. In the continuous action space case, Gaussian action noise leads to different actions being sampled for the same state in each rollout. Parameter space noise perturbs the policy parameters at the start of each episode, resulting in a fixed policy for the entire rollout. Perturbing policy parameters at the beginning of each episode ensures consistency in actions and introduces a dependence between state and exploratory action. Deep neural networks can be perturbed meaningfully with spherical Gaussian noise, as shown by Salimans et al. (2017). Deep neural networks, with complex interactions, can be perturbed using spherical Gaussian noise. A reparameterization technique by Salimans et al. (2017) achieves this by using layer normalization BID2 between perturbed layers. This normalization allows for consistent perturbation scale across all layers, despite varying sensitivities to noise. Adaptive noise scaling in parameter space noise requires selecting a suitable scale \u03c3, which can be challenging due to network architecture variations and parameter changes over time. The proposed solution involves adapting the scale of parameter space noise over time to relate it to the variance in action space, addressing limitations in an easy and straightforward manner. The proposed solution involves adapting the scale of parameter space noise over time to relate it to the variance in action space, addressing limitations in an easy and straightforward manner. Parameter space noise can be applied in off-policy methods as data collected off-policy can be used. Parameter space noise can be applied in off-policy methods by perturbing the policy for exploration and training the non-perturbed network on collected data. On-policy methods can incorporate parameter noise using an adapted policy gradient approach. The expected return of a stochastic policy can be expanded using likelihood ratios and the re-parametrization trick for N samples. The value of \u03a3 is fixed to \u03c3^2I and scaled adaptively. This section explores the benefits of incorporating parameter space noise in RL algorithms for exploring sparse reward environments effectively. Parameter space noise is examined for its effectiveness in exploring sparse reward environments compared to evolution strategies for deep policies. Reference implementations of DQN and DDPG with adaptive parameter space noise are available online for evaluation on high-dimensional discrete-action environments and continuous control tasks. Discrete environments are tested with DQN, while continuous tasks use DDPG and TRPO. In discrete-action environments, comparisons are made using DQN with parameter noise and -greedy action noise. The scale of parameter noise is adjusted based on KL divergence between policies. Linear annealing is applied over the first 1 million timesteps. By using parameter perturbation, a fair comparison is achieved between action space noise and parameter space noise without introducing an additional hyperparameter. The network is reparametrized to represent the greedy policy implied by Q-values, rather than perturbing the Q-function directly. This involves adding a fully connected layer after the convolutional part of the network to represent the policy \u03c0(a|s). To represent the policy \u03c0(a|s), a fully connected layer is added after the convolutional part of the network, followed by a softmax output layer. Perturbing the policy instead of Q-values leads to more meaningful changes, defining an explicit behavioral policy. The Q-network is trained following standard DQN practices, while the policy is trained to output the greedy action based on the current Q-network. The policy is trained to output the greedy action based on the current Q-network. Parameter space noise approach is compared against regular DQN and two-headed DQN with -greedy exploration. Random actions are sampled for the first 50 thousand timesteps to fill the replay buffer before training. Parameter space noise performs better when combined with a bit of action space noise. Parameter space noise performs better when combined with a bit of action space noise in training agents for 21 games of varying complexity. Experimental details are in Section A.1, with learning curves shown in FIG2. Each agent is trained for 40 M frames, and performance is evaluated on the exploratory policy. Our results show that parameter space noise outperforms action space noise, especially on games requiring consistency like Enduro and Freeway. Learning progress starts sooner with parameter space noise. Comparison with a double-headed version of DQN confirms improved exploration is not due to architecture changes. Parameter space noise outperforms action space noise, especially on games requiring consistency like Enduro and Freeway. Learning progress starts sooner with parameter space noise. The change in architecture is not responsible for improved exploration, as confirmed by results. More sophisticated exploration methods like BID4 may be necessary for extremely challenging games like Montezuma's Revenge. It would be interesting to evaluate the effect of parameter space noise combined with exploration methods. The text discusses the comparison between parameter space noise and action space noise in continuous control environments using DDPG as the RL algorithm. Proposed improvements to DQN are mentioned as potentially enhancing results further, with the need for experimental validation in future work. In OpenAI Gym environments, DDPG is used as the RL algorithm with various noise configurations tested for performance comparison. Layer normalization is applied after each layer, and adaptive parameter space noise is evaluated. The study evaluates different noise configurations in DDPG for performance comparison in OpenAI Gym environments. Adaptive parameter space noise is applied, and results are shown for three environments after training each agent for 1 million timesteps. Performance is evaluated every 10 thousand steps without noise for 20 episodes to ensure comparability. In the study, different noise configurations in DDPG are evaluated for performance comparison in OpenAI Gym environments. Parameter space noise outperforms other exploration schemes on HalfCheetah, quickly learning to break out of sub-optimal behavior. This noise also surpasses correlated action space noise, indicating superior performance. Parameter space noise outperforms correlated action space noise on HalfCheetah, indicating a significant difference between the two. DDPG can learn good policies even without noise, suggesting well-shaped reward functions in the environments. TRPO results are shown in FIG4. In the Walker2D environment, adding parameter noise reduces performance variance between seeds, aiding in escaping local optima. Parameter noise is evaluated on environments with sparse rewards to see if it enables existing RL algorithms to learn effectively. In sparse reward environments, parameter noise is tested to improve performance consistency across different seeds. A toy example with a chain of states is used to compare adaptive parameter space noise DQN and bootstrapped DQN. In sparse reward environments, parameter noise is tested to improve performance consistency across different seeds. A toy example with a chain of states is used to compare adaptive parameter space noise DQN, bootstrapped DQN, and -greedy DQN. The chain length N is varied, and the performance of the current policy is evaluated after each episode. The problem is considered solved if one hundred subsequent rollouts achieve the optimal return. The median number of episodes before the problem is considered solved is plotted. The study compares parameter space noise DQN, bootstrapped DQN, and -greedy DQN in a sparse reward environment. Results show that parameter space noise outperforms action space noise and even the more computationally expensive bootstrapped DQN. The optimal strategy in this simple environment is highlighted. In a sparse reward environment, parameter space noise DQN outperforms action space noise and bootstrapped DQN. The optimal strategy in this simple environment is to always go right. In sparse reward environments, parameter space noise DQN performs better than action space noise and bootstrapped DQN. The strategy in these challenging environments is to achieve significant progress towards a goal to receive a non-zero reward. Sparse reward environments include tasks like SparseDoublePendulum, SparseHalfCheetah, SparseMountainCar, and SwimmerGather, each with specific reward conditions. DDPG and TRPO are used to solve these tasks with a time horizon of T = 500 steps. Performance results for DDPG are shown in FIG6, while TRPO results are in Appendix F. Each configuration is run five times for overall performance estimation. In Sparse reward environments, DDPG performance is evaluated with different random seeds. SparseDoublePendulum is easy to solve, while SparseCartpoleSwingup and SparseMountainCar require parameter space noise for successful policies. SparseHalfCheetah results are also discussed. Parameter space noise can improve exploration behavior in off-the-shelf algorithms, but its effectiveness varies depending on the task. It is important to evaluate the potential benefits on a case-by-case basis. Evolution strategies (ES) are closely related. Parameter space noise can enhance exploration behavior in algorithms, but its impact varies by task. Evaluating its benefits on a case-by-case basis is crucial. Evolution strategies (ES) are linked to this approach, introducing noise in the parameter space for improved exploration. ES lacks temporal information and uses black-box optimization, while combining parameter space noise with traditional RL algorithms allows for temporal information inclusion and optimization through back-propagation gradients. Comparing ES and traditional RL with parameter space noise reveals differences in exploration behavior. Comparing ES and traditional RL with parameter space noise directly on 21 ALE games shows differences in performance. ES results were obtained after training on 1,000 M frames, while DQN with parameter space noise trained on 40 M frames, despite being exposed to 25 times less data. Parameter space noise in DQN outperforms ES on 15 out of 21 Atari games, demonstrating a combination of desirable exploration properties and sample efficiency in reinforcement learning. In the context of deep reinforcement learning, various techniques have been proposed to enhance exploration, but they are challenging to implement and computationally expensive. Perturbing policy parameters has been suggested as a method to address this issue. Perturbing policy parameters has been proposed as a method to enhance exploration in deep reinforcement learning. R\u00fcckstie\u00df et al. (2008) introduced this idea for policy gradient methods, showing its effectiveness over random exploration. Their study focused on low-dimensional policies and state spaces, limited to the policy gradient case. In contrast, our method is evaluated for both on and off-policy settings, offering a more comprehensive approach. Our method is applied and evaluated for both on and off-policy settings, using high-dimensional policies and environments with large state spaces. It is closely related to evolution strategies and policy optimization methods. ES has shown effectiveness in high-dimensional environments but lacks efficiency in handling temporal structures and sample inefficiency. Parameter space noise is proposed as a simpler yet effective method for exploration in high-dimensional environments, compared to existing approaches like Bootstrapped DQN BID20 and evolution strategies. Parameter space noise is suggested as a more efficient exploration method compared to traditional action space noise like -greedy and Gaussian noise. It can be successfully integrated with deep RL algorithms such as DQN, DDPG, and TRPO, leading to improved performance, especially in environments with sparse rewards. The results show that parameter noise is effective in solving environments with sparse rewards, offering a viable alternative to action space noise. The experimental setup for ALE BID3 includes a network architecture with convolutional layers and a hidden layer with ReLUs. The network architecture includes convolutional layers with 64 filters of size 3x3 and a hidden layer with 512 units. ReLUs are used in each layer, and layer normalization is applied in the fully connected part. A policy network with a softmax output layer is included for parameter space noise. The Q-value network is trained using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 10^-4 and a batch size of 32. Target networks are updated every 10,000 timesteps, and the replay buffer can hold 1 million state transitions.

For parameter space noise, the policy is perturbed at the beginning of each episode with the standard deviation adapted every 50 timesteps. The policy head is perturbed every 50 timesteps after the convolutional part of the network. To prevent getting stuck, -greedy action selection with = 0.01 is used. Initial data is collected with 50 K random actions before training. Parameters include \u03b3 = 0.99, reward clipping to [-1, 1], and gradient clipping for the output layer of Q to [-1, 1]. Observations are down-sampled to 84 \u00d7 84 pixels. The network architecture for DDPG includes 2 hidden layers with 64 ReLU units each for both the actor and critic. Layer normalization is applied to all layers, and target networks are soft-updated with a parameter \u03c4. The DDPG network architecture includes 2 hidden layers with 64 ReLU units each. Actions are not included in the critic until the second hidden layer. Layer normalization is applied to all layers, and target networks are soft-updated with \u03c4 = 0.001. The critic is trained with a learning rate of 10 \u22123, while the actor uses a learning rate of 10 \u22124. Both actor and critic are updated using the Adam optimizer with batch sizes of 128. The critic is regularized with an L2 penalty of 10 \u22122. The replay buffer holds 100 K state transitions, and \u03b3 = 0.99 is used. Each observation dimension is normalized by an online estimate of the mean and variance. Parameter space noise with DDPG is adaptively scaled to be comparable to the respective action space noise. TRPO uses a step size of \u03b4 KL = 0.01, a policy network of 2 hidden layers with 32 tanh units for nonlocomotion tasks, and 2 hidden layers of 64 tanh units for locomotion tasks. The Hessian calculation is subsampled with a factor of 0.1, \u03b3 = 0.99, and the batch size per epoch is set to 5 K timesteps. The baseline is a learned linear. The TRPO algorithm uses different network architectures for locomotion and non-locomotion tasks. It subsamples the Hessian calculation, sets a batch size per epoch, and uses OpenAI Gym and rllab environments for training. The TRPO algorithm uses various network architectures for different tasks, such as SparseDoublePendulum and DISPLAYFORM5. DQN with a simple network is used for approximating the Q-value function, with each agent trained for up to 2K iterations. Layer normalization is applied before nonlinearity in hidden layers. The function consists of 2 hidden layers with 16 ReLU units, using layer normalization before applying nonlinearity. Each agent is trained for up to 2K episodes, varying the chain length N and evaluating with different seeds. Performance is assessed by sampling trajectories with noise disabled, and the problem is solved if one hundred subsequent trajectories achieve optimal return. The environment for testing exploratory behavior is depicted in Figure 6. The environment for testing exploratory behavior is shown in Figure 6. A comparison is made between adaptive parameter space noise DQN, bootstrapped DQN (with K = 20 heads and Bernoulli masking with p = 0.5), and \u03b5-greedy DQN. Parameter space noise is adaptively scaled with \u03b4 \u2248 0.05. Learning starts after 5 initial episodes, and the target network is updated every 100 timesteps. The text discusses the use of adaptive parameter space noise in DQN, with \u03b4 \u2248 0.05. The network is trained using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 10 \u22123 and a batch size of 32. The expected return is expanded using likelihood ratios and the reparametrization trick for N samples. The proposed adaption method is used to re-scale appropriately. The text proposes adapting the scale of parameter space noise in DQN to address limitations and dependencies on network architecture and learning progress. This adaptation method aims to resolve issues related to picking a suitable scale \u03c3 and understanding the scale in parameter space. The proposed solution adapts the scale of parameter space noise in DQN by using a time-varying scale \u03c3 k, related to action space variance, and updated every K timesteps based on a heuristic involving distance, rescaling factor \u03b1, and threshold value \u03b4. This approach is inspired by the Levenberg-Marquardt heuristic. The proposed solution adjusts the scale of parameter space noise in DQN by using a time-varying scale \u03c3 k, based on a heuristic involving distance, rescaling factor \u03b1, and threshold value \u03b4. The choice of distance measure depends on the policy representation, with \u03b1 always set to 1.01 in experiments. For DQN, the policy is implicitly defined by the Q-value function, leading to challenges in measuring distance between Q-values. The proposed solution adjusts the scale of parameter space noise in DQN by using a time-varying scale \u03c3 k, based on a heuristic involving distance, rescaling factor \u03b1, and threshold value \u03b4. The distance measure between Q-values is crucial due to potential pitfalls in na\u00efve distance calculations. The proposed solution adjusts the scale of parameter space noise in DQN by using a time-varying scale \u03c3 k, based on a heuristic involving distance, rescaling factor \u03b1, and threshold value \u03b4. \u03c0 is defined using the softmax function over predicted Q values, while \u03c0 uses perturbed Q values. The distance in action space is measured using Kullback-Leibler divergence, effectively normalizing Q-values and avoiding previous issues. This distance measure is related to -greedy action space noise, allowing fair comparison without an additional hyperparameter \u03b4.

The proposed solution adjusts the scale of parameter space noise in DQN by using a time-varying scale \u03c3 k, based on a heuristic involving distance, rescaling factor \u03b1, and threshold value \u03b4. This distance measure is related to -greedy action space noise, allowing fair comparison without an additional hyperparameter \u03b4. We can use this distance measure to relate action space noise and parameter space noise to have similar distances, by adaptively scaling \u03c3 so that it matches the KL divergence between greedy and -greedy policy, thus setting \u03b4 := \u2212 log (1 \u2212 + |A| ). For DDPG, we relate noise induced by parameter space perturbations to noise induced by additive Gaussian noise. To do so, we use the following distance measure between the non-perturbed and perturbed policy: DISPLAYFORM0 where E s [\u00b7] is estimated from a batch of states from the replay buffer and N denotes the dimension of the action space (i.e. A \u2282 R N ). It is easy to show that d(\u03c0, \u03c0 + N (0, \u03c3 2 I)) = \u03c3. Setting \u03b4 := \u03c3 as the adaptive parameter space threshold. The proposed solution adjusts the scale of parameter space noise in DQN by using a time-varying scale \u03c3 k, based on a heuristic involving distance, rescaling factor \u03b1, and threshold value \u03b4. This distance measure is related to -greedy action space noise, allowing fair comparison without an additional hyperparameter \u03b4. For DDPG, noise induced by parameter space perturbations is related to noise induced by additive Gaussian noise through a distance measure between non-perturbed and perturbed policy. The adaptive parameter space threshold \u03b4 is set to \u03c3, ensuring effective action space noise with the same standard deviation as regular Gaussian action space noise. Trust region policy optimization (TRPO) scales noise by adapting sampled noise vectors \u03c3 using a natural step H \u22121 \u03c3, ensuring the perturbed policy remains close to the non-perturbed version. The conjugate gradient algorithm is used to compute the perturbed policy in Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), ensuring constraint conformation. Learning curves for 21 Atari games are provided, comparing the final performance of Evolution Strategies (ES) and Deep Q-Network (DQN) after a certain number of frames. Performance is estimated by running 10 episodes with exploration disabled. The results show that adaptive parameter space noise achieves stable performance on InvertedDoublePendulum, comparable to other exploration approaches. No noise in action or parameter space yields similar results, indicating these environments with DDPG are not ideal for exploration testing. Adding parameter space noise improves learning consistency on challenging sparse environments when combined with TRPO, as shown in FIG10. TRPO uses action noise and parameter space noise, with the latter scaled according to parameter curvature. This approach outperforms DDPG in exploration testing."
