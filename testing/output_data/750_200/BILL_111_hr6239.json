    "content": "The Act titled \"Prevention of Frivolous Ethanol Lawsuits Act of 2010\" is cited as the short title. Findings are outlined in Section 2. The Congress finds that ethanol is widely used in gasoline for vehicles and engines, and any decision to increase ethanol blending must ensure it does not harm emission control systems. The Congress is concerned about the potential negative effects of increasing the blending limit of ethanol in gasoline on vehicle and equipment engines, including engine failures, decreased performance, consumer complaints, litigation, and other unforeseen impacts on interstate commerce. The Federal Trade Commission has proposed labeling requirements for fuels with ethanol levels exceeding the current blending limit in gasoline to warn consumers of potential harm to conventional vehicles. Federal testing is ongoing to assess the impact of higher ethanol blending limits on motor vehicle engines. The executive branch is currently conducting tests on newer motor vehicles to determine the effects of increasing the blending limit of ethanol in gasoline. There is a lack of data on the impact of higher ethanol blending limits on older vehicles and nonroad engines. Congress should address any potential issues arising from this. Congress should mitigate undue effects on interstate commerce resulting from a Federal decision to increase the blending limit of ethanol in gasoline, as (B) is currently in the process of reaching a decision on this issue. SEC. 3. Targeted liability protections for claims related to damages from ethanol in fuel. Liability Protections for covered entities using renewable fuel with ethanol concentrations over 10% in internal combustion engines. Immune from suit and liability under Federal and State law for resulting losses. The term \"loss\" in this section includes death, injury, illness, disability, property damage, and business interruption, regardless of when it occurred. The immunity under paragraph (1) applies to any claim for loss related to the use of renewable fuel with ethanol concentrations over 10%, to operate an internal combustion engine. The Clean Air Act allows immunity for covered persons involved in the design, development, testing, manufacture, distribution, marketing, sale, and use of renewable fuel in internal combustion engines. An exception to this immunity is for a federal cause of action against a covered person for death. An exclusive Federal cause of action against a covered person for death or serious physical injury caused by willful misconduct is allowed under certain circumstances. This cause of action is not considered a violation of a statute of the United States. The action can be brought for wrongful death or serious physical injury. An exclusive Federal cause of action for wrongful death or serious physical injury can be brought by any person who suffers such injury or their representative. The action must be filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia and the governing law is based on the state where the alleged willful misconduct occurred. In an action for wrongful death or serious physical injury, the complaint must plead each element of the plaintiff's claim with particularity, including the alleged willful misconduct and the facts supporting the claim of injury causation. The complaint in an action for wrongful death or serious physical injury must include facts supporting the allegation of willful misconduct causing the injury claimed and facts supporting the claim that the person suffered death or serious physical injury. Additionally, the complaint must be verified by affidavit of the plaintiff under oath. The plaintiff must verify the complaint under oath, stating knowledge of the deponent except for matters alleged on information and belief. Matters not identified as such are considered known by the plaintiff. Proof of willful misconduct is required in actions for wrongful death or serious physical injury. The plaintiff must verify the complaint under oath, stating knowledge of the deponent except for matters alleged on information and belief. In an action under subsection (b), the plaintiff has the burden of proving willful misconduct by each covered person sued before a three-judge court. In actions under subsection (b), motions to dismiss or for summary judgment are considered, and if denied or time expires, the action is referred to the chief judge for further proceedings, including trial. Civil discovery is not allowed before each covered person sued has had a chance to respond. In actions under subsection (b), civil discovery is not allowed until each covered person sued has had a chance to file a motion to dismiss, the court has ruled on the motion, and any interlocutory appeal has been decided by the Court of Appeals. In actions under subsection (b), civil discovery is permitted only forever covered person sued after a motion to dismiss has been filed, ruled on, and any interlocutory appeal decided by the Court of Appeals. Discovery is limited to matters directly related to contested issues, and responses are compelled only if the information is needed to prove or defend a material issue with likely benefits exceeding the costs. In actions under subsection (b), civil discovery is permitted only for a covered person sued after a motion to dismiss has been filed, ruled on, and any interlocutory appeal decided by the Court of Appeals. Responses are compelled only if the information is needed to prove or defend a material issue with likely benefits exceeding the costs. Damages in such actions may be reduced by the amount of collateral source benefits received by the plaintiff. In actions under subsection (b), civil discovery is permitted only for a covered person sued after a motion to dismiss has been filed, ruled on, and any interlocutory appeal decided by the Court of Appeals.

(g) Interlocutory Appeal.--The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has jurisdiction over interlocutory appeals by covered persons within 30 days of an order denying a motion to dismiss or summary judgment based on immunity from suit or exclusion under subsection (h)(1). Sanctions may include attorney's fees to deter repeat conduct and compensate injured parties. Exclusion for Regulated Activity of Manufacturer or Distributor under subsection (h)(1) states that an act or omission by a manufacturer or distributor related to a covered countermeasure, regulated by the Clean Air Act, shall not be considered \"willful misconduct\" if certain conditions are met. The act or omission related to a covered countermeasure by a manufacturer or distributor is not considered \"willful misconduct\" if certain conditions are met, such as no enforcement action initiated by the EPA or Attorney General, or if the action has been terminated without a covered remedy. Any action under this provision is stayed during an enforcement action. Any action or proceeding under subsection (b) is stayed during enforcement actions.

The term \"covered remedy\" refers to outcomes such as criminal convictions, injunctions, civil monetary payments, and debarment resulting from final determinations. The term \"final\" refers to a court judgment that cannot be appealed or a voluntary dismissal, and with respect to an agency action, it refers to a final resolution that cannot be appealed. The term \"willful misconduct\" does not include acts taken pursuant to a stipulated dismissal or final resolution of an agency action that is not subject to further review within the agency or reversed by a court determination. The term \"willful misconduct\" excludes acts taken intentionally for wrongful purposes or knowingly without legal or factual justification, but does not include acts taken in response to regulations or guidance related to ethanol-gasoline blends. The term \"willful misconduct\" excludes intentional acts for wrongful purposes or without legal justification, disregarding known risks where harm outweighs benefit."
