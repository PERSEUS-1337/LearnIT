    "content": "Both House and Senate bills for the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2012 address detainee issues at Guantanamo Bay and counterterrorism measures. H.R. 1540 passed the House, while S. 1253 and S. 1867 were reported out of the Senate Armed Services Committee. The Senate passed S. 1867 on December 1, 2011, with provisions from H.R. 1540 inserted. Differences between the House and Senate versions will be discussed in conference. The White House has criticized aspects of both bills and may veto any legislation that limits the President's intelligence collection authority. The House has criticized aspects of the bills and threatened to veto any legislation that limits the President's intelligence collection authority, particularly military detention mandates, limits on executive discretion, and constraints on detainee transfers. This report provides background, analysis of relevant sections, and a comparison of the House- and Senate-passed bills. This report provides a comparison of the House- and Senate-passed bills regarding detainee provisions, focusing on confirming and potentially expanding the detention authority granted to the President post-9/11 through the Authorization for Use of Military Force. In the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF), Congress authorized the President to use force against those involved in the 9/11 attacks to prevent future terrorism. Many captured individuals have been detained to prevent terrorist activities, with some facing military commission trials for related crimes. In the context of the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF), individuals have been detained in preventive detention to prevent terrorist activities. Some have faced military commission trials for crimes associated with hostilities, while others have been tried for terrorism-related offenses in civilian court. The 2004 case of Hamdi v. Rumsfeld established that the President can detain enemy combatants captured while fighting U.S. forces in Afghanistan, including U.S. citizens, for the duration of hostilities. Lower courts have been tasked with defining the scope of detention authority under the AUMF. The Hamdi decision allowed for the detention of enemy combatants captured while fighting U.S. forces in Afghanistan for the duration of hostilities. Subsequent judicial activity in the D.C. Circuit has favored the government's position on detention authority under the AUMF. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit has generally supported the government's position on detention authority under the AUMF. It is uncertain if the Supreme Court will review these rulings and whether they will agree with the circuit court's interpretation. Congress has not passed any laws to clarify detention authority under the AUMF, but the D.C. Circuit has considered post-AUMF legislation on military commissions for guidance. The D.C. Circuit has used post-AUMF legislation on military commissions to determine the scope of detention authority granted by the AUMF. In 2010, they concluded that the government can detain individuals associated with Al Qaeda or the Taliban, as well as those who support them in hostilities against U.S. Coalition partners. The AUMF allows for the detention of individuals associated with Al Qaeda or the Taliban, as well as those who support them in hostilities against U.S. Coalition partners. Detainees are mostly captured during military operations in Afghanistan or abroad and held at Guantanamo Bay or Parwan, Afghanistan. The U.S.-operated facility in Parwan, Afghanistan, holds a large number of detainees captured in Afghanistan. Future captures outside of Afghanistan are handled ad hoc, with individuals suspected of terrorist activity prosecuted in federal court instead of military detention under the AUMF. The Bush Administration transferred individuals arrested in the United States into military custody as \"enemy combatants\" in two instances. One was a U.S. citizen arrested for alleged Taliban involvement in Afghanistan, and the other was a legal resident accused of being an Al Qaeda \"sleeper agent.\" However, both detainees were eventually transferred back. There has been controversy over how to handle suspected terrorists in U.S. custody, with some arguing for military detention and trial for those linked to Al Qaeda. Some argue that suspected terrorists linked to Al Qaeda should be held in military custody and tried before a military commission, while others suggest transferring them to civilian law enforcement for trial in an Article III court. There are also those who believe executive discretion should determine the best approach for handling such cases. Disagreement arises over the handling of suspected terrorists in U.S. custody, with some advocating for executive discretion in decision-making. Congress imposed restrictions on transferring Guantanamo detainees to the U.S. for trial in Article III courts, particularly in response to plans involving Khalid Sheik Mohammed. The 9/11 attacks led to funding restrictions that prevented Guantanamo detainees from being transferred to the US for criminal prosecution in FY2011 and FY2012. This restriction forces trials by military commission as the only viable option. The funding restrictions post-9/11 prevented Guantanamo detainees from being transferred to the US for criminal prosecution, leading to trials by military commission as the only option. Attention has also been on cases like Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame, a Somali national brought to the US for terrorism charges in a civilian court after being detained on a naval vessel for interrogation. Some individuals faced terrorism-related charges in civilian courts after being detained on a U.S. naval vessel for interrogation. Controversy surrounded the decision to transfer them to civilian custody instead of military custody. The Administration faced criticism for bringing civilian charges against Iraqi refugees suspected of insurgent activities. The 2012 NDAA is expected to address the handling of individuals captured in the conflict with Al Qaeda. H.R. 1540 passed by the House reaffirms the conflict and its scope. H.R. 1540, passed by the House of Representatives, reaffirms the conflict with Al Qaeda and imposes restrictions on detainee transfers. The White House supports most aspects of the bill but issued a statement regarding its provisions. The White House criticized provisions in H.R. 1540 concerning detainee matters and threatened to veto any version of the bill that challenges executive branch authority. S. 1253, as reported by the Senate Armed Services Committee, would authorize detention of certain persons and require military detention for some, regulate status determinations for persons held under the AUMF, and establish periodic review proceedings. The Senate Armed Services Committee reported a new version of the bill, S. 1867, on November 15, 2011, which included provisions for the detention of certain persons, regulated status determinations for detainees, and made funding restrictions related to Guantanamo transfers permanent. Senate Majority Leader Reid delayed consideration of the bill due to objections from the White House and Senate committees. The Senate passed S. 1867 on December 1, 2011, with revised detainee provisions despite objections from the Department of Defense and the White House threatening a veto. The bill clarified the authority to detain persons captured in the conflict with Al Qaeda without modifying existing authorities regarding U.S. citizens or lawful detainees. The Senate passed S. 1867 with revised detainee provisions, clarifying the authority to detain persons captured in the conflict with Al Qaeda without modifying existing authorities regarding U.S. citizens or lawful detainees. The House and Senate versions of the bill will be reconciled in conference to address differences. The current status of U.S. policies and legal authorities on detainee matters is discussed in the FY2012 NDAA. The FY2012 NDAA addresses policies and legal authorities related to detainee matters, including detention authority under the AUMF, initial status determinations, periodic reviews, and concerns about recidivism. The AUMF is the primary legal basis for detaining individuals captured in the conflict with Al Qaeda and affiliated entities. The AUMF is the main legal basis for detaining individuals captured in the conflict with Al Qaeda and affiliated entities. The scope of detention authority under the AUMF is subject to differing interpretations. The Obama Administration outlined its detention authority under the AUMF as the President having the power to detain those involved in the 9/11 attacks and those who supported them. The AUMF grants the President authority to detain individuals involved in the 9/11 attacks, those who supported them, and members of Al Qaeda or the Taliban. The inclusion of \"associated forces\" in the AUMF raises questions about the breadth of detention authority claimed by the executive. The AUMF grants the President authority to detain individuals involved in the 9/11 attacks, those who supported them, and members of Al Qaeda or the Taliban. The inclusion of \"associated forces\" in the AUMF raises questions about the breadth of detention authority claimed by the executive, especially regarding the \"substantial support\" prong and the interpretation of detention authority under the law of war principles. The government's 2009 brief did not clarify these aspects of its detention authority. The government's 2009 brief did not clarify the precise nature and degree of \"substantial support\" or the characteristics of \"associated forces\" that would bring individuals and organizations under the detention authority framework. The Obama Administration's scope of detention authority is similar to the Bush Administration's definition of \"enemy combatant,\" requiring \"substantial support.\" The detention authority under the Obama Administration requires \"substantial support\" for individuals to be treated as an \"enemy combatant,\" including those functionally part of Al Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces. The executive branch has included \"associated forces\" in its detention authority scope since 2004. The AUMF has included \"associated forces\" in its detention authority scope since 2004, allowing for the detention of enemy combatants for the duration of hostilities. The government clarified in 2009 that the AUMF covers organizations beyond just al-Qaida or the Taliban, including various private armed groups in Afghanistan. The AUMF allows the US to detain individuals associated with groups beyond al-Qaida or the Taliban in Afghanistan to prevent future terrorism. This authority extends to individuals who would be detainable under principles of co-belligerency in a traditional international armed conflict. The D.C. Circuit rejected the Bush Administration's argument regarding the detention of Chinese Uighur dissidents at Guantanamo. The court upheld the government's criteria for membership in an \"associated force\" but ruled against labeling a petitioner as an \"enemy combatant\" based on alleged affiliation with ETIM. The court rejected the government's argument on the detention of Chinese Uighur dissidents at Guantanamo, ruling against labeling a petitioner as an \"enemy combatant\" based on alleged affiliation with ETIM. The government's evidence did not support the association with al Qaida or the Taliban, making it unnecessary to address the issue further. The court rejected the government's argument on the detention of Chinese Uighur dissidents at Guantanamo, ruling against labeling a petitioner as an \"enemy combatant\" based on alleged affiliation with ETIM. The evidence did not establish a close enough connection between ETIM and Al Qaeda to be considered an \"associated force.\" The court did not find sufficient evidence to link ETIM with Al Qaeda as an \"associated force,\" as defined by the government. The term \"associated forces\" has mainly been interpreted to cover armed groups aiding the Taliban or Al Qaeda in Afghanistan. The term \"associated forces\" has been interpreted to cover armed groups aiding the Taliban or Al Qaeda in Afghanistan. For example, \"Zubayda's militia\" and Hezb\u2013i\u2013Islami Gulbuddin (\"HIG\") have been considered \"associated forces\" under the AUMF. The D.C. Circuit also upheld the detention of a person working as a cook for the 55th Arab Military Brigade. The D.C. Circuit affirmed the detention of a cook for the 55th Arab Military Brigade, a force defending the Taliban. There is uncertainty about the AUMF's application to individuals captured outside Afghanistan, especially U.S. citizens. The AUMF's detention authority applies to persons captured outside of Afghanistan, including U.S. citizens or those with ties to the United States. The Supreme Court in Hamdi allowed detention of a U.S. citizen in Afghanistan, but did not clarify if individuals captured outside Afghanistan can be detained under the AUMF. The D.C. Circuit believes the AUMF permits detention of anyone linked to Al Qaeda. The D.C. Circuit interprets the AUMF as authorizing the detention of individuals associated with Al Qaeda, including non-U.S. citizens captured outside the U.S. The Fourth Circuit upheld the military detention of a U.S. citizen and resident alien captured in the U.S. as enemy combatants. detainees were transferred to civilian law enforcement for prosecution before the Supreme Court could review the cases. The AUMF authorizes detention of individuals associated with Al Qaeda, including non-U.S. citizens captured outside the U.S. The Pentagon established CSRTs to determine detainee status at Guantanamo. The Supreme Court has not yet addressed detention of U.S. citizens or others captured in the U.S. under the AUMF. The CSRTs at Guantanamo were used to determine the status of enemy combatants, with 539 confirmed between 2004 and 2009. The process has been largely inactive since 2007 due to few new detainees being brought to Guantanamo. The CSRT process at Guantanamo has been inactive since 2007 due to few new detainees. Non-citizen detainees in Afghanistan have a different review process with fewer rights. Guantanamo detainees can challenge their detention in federal court. The constitutional writ of habeas extends to Guantanamo detainees, allowing them to challenge their detention in federal court. However, non-citizen detainees in Afghanistan do not have the same privilege. President Obama created task forces to study Guantanamo detention issues. Military commission and administrative review board proceedings at Guantanamo were put on hold during this time. The Obama Administration implemented a new review system for detainees at Bagram Theater Internment Facility in Afghanistan. President Obama issued Executive Order 13567 in 2011 to establish a process for determining detainee status. President Obama issued Executive Order 13567 in 2011 to establish a Periodic Review Board (PRB) for Guantanamo detainees to assess the need for continued detention based on security threats. The Periodic Review Board (PRB) assesses the need for continued detention of Guantanamo detainees to protect against security threats. If detention is not warranted, efforts are made to transfer the detainee outside the US. An initial review involves a hearing before the PRB. The United States has legal requirements for periodic review of Guantanamo detainees by the Periodic Review Board (PRB). The review includes a hearing where detainees can challenge their continued detention and present evidence. The process is discretionary and does not change existing detention authority or court jurisdiction. Congress has placed limits on detainee transfers from Guantanamo, requiring certification of measures to prevent them from returning to terrorism. Statistics on post-release activities of detainees are limited. The post-release activities of Guantanamo detainees have been somewhat elusive, with statistics remaining classified. Some detainees have engaged in terrorist activities after their release, sparking debate on the policy implications and fairness of long-term detention without trial. In 2007, the Pentagon issued a news release. In 2007, the Pentagon released data suggesting that 30 former Guantanamo detainees had engaged in militant activities or anti-U.S. propaganda post-release, sparking debate on the fairness of long-term detention without trial. Researchers at Seton Hall University challenged the accuracy of these numbers and highlighted discrepancies in the data. Advocates for Guantanamo detainees disputed discrepancies in DOD data and lack of identifying information for independent verification. They argued against labeling former detainees' activities as \"recidivism\" or \"reengagement\" without clear evidence of terrorist involvement, suggesting radicalization during internment could explain post-release behavior. The study found that some ex-Guantanamo detainees engaged in terrorism after release, with 36 confirmed or suspected cases in 2008 and 74 out of 534 prisoners in 2009. The Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2010 required the Director of. The Intelligence Authorization Act for FY2010 mandated the DNI to release a report on Guantanamo detainee recidivism rates. The report revealed that out of 598 transferred detainees, 81 were confirmed and 69 suspected of engaging in terrorism again. The report on Guantanamo detainee recidivism rates revealed that out of 598 transferred detainees, 81 were confirmed and 69 suspected of reengaging in terrorist activities. Out of 150 recidivist detainees, 13 are deceased, 54 are in custody, and 83 remain at large. Since Executive Order 13492, 2 detainees are confirmed and 3 suspected of terrorist activities. The report on Guantanamo detainee recidivism rates revealed that a small percentage of released detainees have posed a threat to the United States or its interests. The accuracy of these numbers has been questioned, with estimates suggesting around 6% of released detainees have engaged in terrorist activities. The discrepancy between the report's estimates and publicly available sources remains unexplained due to classified intelligence data. The report on Guantanamo detainee recidivism rates showed a discrepancy with publicly available sources. The number of detainees engaging in terrorism post-release has increased. Section 1031 of H.R. 1540 defines \"individual detained at Guantanamo\" as non-US citizens detained after March 7, 2011. The term \"individual detained at Guantanamo\" refers to non-US citizens held by the Department of Defense after March 7, 2011, regardless of their status under the AUMF. It is unclear who falls under the Department of Defense's \"effective control.\" The term \"individual detained at Guantanamo\" covers non-US citizens held by the Department of Defense after March 7, 2011. It is unclear who might fall under the Department of Defense's \"effective control\" without being in its custody for purposes of the bill. This term may include situations where detainees are technically under the custody of another agency but still supervised by the Department of Defense. The Military Commissions Act of 2009 allows guilty pleas in capital cases before military commissions, but it is unclear if foreign refugees brought to Guantanamo will be covered by the provisions of H.R. 1540. Section 1033 of the Military Commissions Act of 2009 allows guilty pleas in capital cases before military commissions, permitting the death penalty in cases where the accused has pled guilty, as long as the military commission panel members vote unanimously to approve the sentence. Section 1033 of the Military Commissions Act of 2009 allows guilty pleas in capital cases before military commissions, permitting the death penalty if the accused pleads guilty and the panel members unanimously approve the sentence. Section 1034 clarifies the armed conflict with Al Qaeda, identifies parties involved, and affirms the President's authority to detain captured belligerents. Section 1034 affirms the United States' armed conflict with al-Qaeda, the Taliban, and associated forces, authorizing the President to use necessary force and detain captured belligerents for the duration of hostilities. Section 1034 of H.R. 1540 affirms the President's authority to detain individuals who are part of or supporting al-Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces engaged in hostilities against the United States. This provision has been a point of controversy among supporters and critics. The controversial provision in H.R. 1540 affirms the President's authority to detain individuals associated with al-Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces. Supporters argue it confirms the armed conflict's evolution since the 2001 AUMF, while opponents see it as authorizing an expansion of the conflict without a nexus to the 9/11 attacks. The AUMF requirement for a nexus to the 9/11 attacks is debated as authorizing an expansion of the armed conflict to cover new terrorist groups associated with Al Qaeda. Proponents argue the AUMF has no geographical or time limits, giving the President discretion in using force. Critics see the removal of limits on identifying conflict parties as significant. Section 1034 may exceed the executive branch's conflict characterization. Section 1034 of the AUMF goes beyond the executive branch's conflict characterization by identifying belligerent parties not only directly engaged with Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and associated forces but also any nations, organizations, and persons who have supported hostilities. This requirement seems to necessitate a connection to armed hostilities rather than mere support. The AUMF's Section 1034 identifies belligerent parties engaged with Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and associated forces, requiring a connection to armed hostilities rather than mere support. The use of the past tense in describing the conduct suggests entities could be deemed belligerents even if their support occurred before September 11, 2001, with no effect on the United States. The AUMF's Section 1034 identifies belligerent parties engaged with Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and associated forces, requiring a connection to armed hostilities. It could be construed to apply to targeting decisions or other operations as well. The legislative history suggests it is not intended to authorize a significant expansion of the ongoing conflict. The House Armed Services Committee report accompanying H.R. 1540 clarifies that Section 1034 of the AUMF is meant to reaffirm the current interpretation of the AUMF in habeas litigation involving wartime detainees, rather than authorizing a significant expansion of the ongoing conflict with Al Qaeda and affiliated organizations. The report acknowledges the evolving terrorist threat but emphasizes that Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and associated forces still pose a grave threat. The committee supports the Executive Branch's interpretation of the Authorization for Use of Military Force, acknowledging the ongoing threat posed by Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and associated forces. The Executive Branch's interpretation of the Authorization for Use of Military Force is supported by the committee, affirming that it does not expand the authority to use force beyond what is already permitted under the AUMF. The District Court for the District of Columbia has also affirmed this stance. The language in H.R. 1540 Section 1034 paragraphs (1) and (2) could expand the authority to use force beyond the AUMF. The word \"associated\" is not clearly defined, which may lead to different interpretations. Paragraph (3) mirrors language used in Combatant Status Review Tribunals at Guantanamo for detention purposes. The language in paragraph (3) of H.R. 1540 mirrors the language used by Combatant Status Review Tribunals at Guantanamo for detention purposes, allowing for the detention of individuals associated with Taliban or al Qaida forces. This also applies to nations and organizations involved in the conflict. The White House strongly objects to section 1034 of H.R. 1540, arguing that it could recharacterize the scope of the conflict and create confusion. Section 1036 requires the Secretary of Defense to establish a review process for Guantanamo detainees to determine the necessity of continued military detention for national security. The White House objects to section 1034 of H.R. 1540, stating it could create confusion. Section 1036 mandates the Secretary of Defense to set up a review process for Guantanamo detainees to assess the need for ongoing military detention for national security. This process involves military officers on the initial review panel, stringent criteria for detention assessment, and limitations on private counsel assistance. Section 1036 of H.R. 1540 mandates the Secretary of Defense to establish a review process for Guantanamo detainees to determine the necessity of continued military detention. The process includes detailed criteria for assessment, limits on private counsel assistance, and periodic reviews every three years for each detainee. The review process for Guantanamo detainees includes a full review not less than once a year by a panel of military officers with expertise in operations, intelligence, and counterterrorism. The detainee is entitled to be assisted by a \"military personal representative\" with the appropriate security clearances. The Guantanamo detainee is entitled to be assisted by a \"military personal representative\" with the appropriate security clearance during the review process. The detainee can present a statement, evidence, and call witnesses to advocate on their behalf. They are provided with an unclassified summary of information the panel will consider before the hearing. The Guantanamo detainee is entitled to be assisted by a \"military personal representative\" with the appropriate security clearance during the review process. They can present a statement, evidence, and call witnesses to advocate on their behalf. Prior to the hearing, the detainee is provided with an unclassified summary of information the panel will consider, including mitigating information. Outside parties, including the detainee's private counsel if authorized, may provide a written submission to the military panel. During the annual file review at Guantanamo, the detainee can submit a written statement to the military panel. The panel considers new information about the individual's threat level and mitigating factors. Relevant information from military commission cases must be provided. The panel evaluates the detainee's internment based on various factors. The military panel at Guantanamo evaluates the detainee's internment based on factors like likelihood of terrorist activity, ties to hostile organizations, behavior in custody, and intelligence value of known information. The government's submission to the panel aims to mitigate the threat posed by the individual and assess the intelligence value of known information. Section 1036 mandates an interagency review board to review the military panel's decisions for errors and has the authority to reject recommendations by majority vote. The interagency review board reviews military panel decisions for errors and can reject recommendations by majority vote. If a detainee is recommended for release, the board finds a suitable country for transfer based on various factors. The interagency review board reviews military panel decisions and can reject recommendations by majority vote. The detainee does not have the right to seek redress or enforcement in any U.S. court. The detainee's recommendation is forwarded to the Secretary of Defense for approval, with no right to seek redress in U.S. courts. The White House expressed concerns about Section 1036 of H.R. 1540 potentially leading to a presidential veto due to its impact on the periodic review process established by the President's Executive Order. The President's Executive Order established a system of review that could limit advice from intelligence and law enforcement professionals, undermining national security interests. Section 1039 restricts the transfer of non-citizen detainees held abroad in U.S. military custody. It also hinders DOD's management of detention operations. The provision in Section 1039 restricts the transfer of detainees held abroad in U.S. military custody, including those at Guantanamo, into the United States. Congress enacted funding measures to limit executive discretion in response to the Obama Administration's plan to close the Guantanamo detention facility. The funding limitations, including those in the 2012 Minibus (P.L. 112-55), prohibit the transfer of Guantanamo detainees into the United States for any purpose, including criminal prosecution. These restrictions were motivated by the Administration's plans to transfer Khalid Sheik Mohammed and other detainees to the US for trial in an Article III court. The 2012 Minibus and funding restrictions in Section 1039 of House-passed H.R. 1540 effectively limited the options for prosecuting Guantanamo detainees in civilian courts, making military commissions the primary forum until the end of FY2012. These restrictions cover a broader category of detainees and apply to all non-citizens. Section 1039 of H.R. 1540, unlike the 2012 Minibus restrictions, broadens the detainee category covered and prohibits the transfer of non-citizen detainees held by military authorities at foreign locations other than Guantanamo into the United States. The restrictions in H.R. 1540 only prevent the Department of Defense from transferring wartime detainees into the U.S., but do not limit other government agencies from bringing detainees into the country. The 2012 Minibus restrictions apply to all federal agencies, while Section 1039 of H.R. 1540 prohibits the transfer of non-citizen detainees held by military authorities at foreign locations other than Guantanamo into the United States. This restriction does not limit other government agencies from bringing detainees into the country. The White House strongly opposes Section 1039 of H.R. 1540, which prohibits the transfer of non-citizen detainees held by military authorities at foreign locations other than Guantanamo into the United States. The Obama Administration argues that this measure interferes with executive discretion to prosecute detainees in Article III courts within the country. The White House opposes Section 1039 of H.R. 1540, which limits the transfer of non-citizen detainees held by military authorities at foreign locations to the United States. This measure interferes with executive discretion to prosecute detainees in Article III courts within the country. Section 1037 of H.R. 1540 prohibits the use of funds to construct or modify facilities in the US for Guantanamo detainees. Section 1040 limits funds for transferring detainees to foreign countries unless certain criteria are met. Section 1040 restricts the transfer of Guantanamo detainees to foreign countries or entities, except when specific criteria are met, such as court orders for release. These restrictions align with previous legislation and were set to expire at the end of the 2011 fiscal year. The 2011 NDAA and CAA imposed funding restrictions on the transfer or release of Guantanamo detainees from U.S. custody, with concerns over possible recidivism. Supporters argue the restrictions reduce terrorist activity risks, while critics say they hinder detainee transfers. No detainee has been released since these acts took effect. Since the 2011 NDAA and CAA, no Guantanamo detainee has been transferred or released from U.S. custody. The Secretary of Defense must certify to Congress before a transfer can occur, ensuring the destination country is not a terrorist sponsor and can effectively control the detainee. The Secretary of Defense must certify that the destination country can effectively control a transferred detainee, prevent terrorism, share relevant information, and allow access to appropriate US agencies. The Secretary of Defense must certify that the destination country can effectively control a transferred detainee, prevent terrorism, share relevant information, and allow access to appropriate US agencies. The certification requirements are similar to those for Guantanamo detainees' continued detention, with an additional requirement for the foreign entity to permit US authorities access to the transferred individual. Section 1040 of the NDAA establishes requirements for transferring Guantanamo detainees to foreign entities, including allowing US authorities access to the transferred individual. The White House opposes these restrictions, claiming they interfere with the executive's decision-making. The White House opposes the restrictions on detainee transfers in Section 1040 of the NDAA, stating that they interfere with the executive's ability to make foreign policy and national security determinations swiftly and flexibly. Section 1035 requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a national security protocol for Guantanamo detainees' communications within 90 days of enactment. The White House opposes restrictions on detainee transfers in Section 1040 of the NDAA, stating they interfere with the executive's ability to make foreign policy and national security determinations swiftly. Section 1035 mandates a security protocol for Guantanamo detainees' communications within 90 days of enactment, detailing limitations, privileges, monitoring procedures, and enforcement measures. Section 1038 prohibits the use of DOD funds in FY2012 to allow family visits for Guantanamo detainees. Section 1043 restricts rights and benefits for detainees repatriated to certain countries under the Compact of Free Association. Section 1043 of the Compact of Free Association restricts rights and benefits for detainees repatriated to certain countries, potentially affecting their travel to the United States. This provision may not apply to former Guantanamo detainees resettled in these countries, such as the Chinese ethnic Uighur detainees in Palau. Section 1043 of the Compact of Free Association restricts rights and benefits for detainees repatriated to certain countries, potentially affecting their travel to the United States. However, Section 1042 requires consultation among key officials before prosecuting a non-citizen for an offense that could be tried by military commission. Section 1042 mandates consultation among officials before prosecuting a non-citizen for an offense that could be tried by military commission, deciding on venue and custody transfer. The White House opposes this provision, citing existing interagency coordination in terrorism-related prosecutions. The White House opposes Section 1042, arguing that it would disrupt existing interagency coordination in terrorism-related prosecutions by requiring institutions to take on unfamiliar roles and potentially causing delays in apprehending individuals posing imminent threats to national safety. Section 1046 mandates that foreign nationals involved in terrorism-related conduct must be tried by military commission. The provision in Section 1042 applies to foreign nationals involved in terrorist attacks against the US or its government personnel, subject to trial by military commission. It is unclear if the provision covers prospective attacks that are not carried out. The White House opposes this section, citing potential disruptions in terrorism-related prosecutions and delays in apprehending imminent threats. The provision in Section 1042 applies to foreign nationals involved in terrorist attacks against the US or its government personnel. It is unclear if the provision covers prospective attacks that are not carried out, and the definition of a \"terrorist attack\" is not clarified. The White House opposes this section, citing potential disruptions in terrorism-related prosecutions and delays in apprehending imminent threats. The criteria for a terrorist attack to be covered under US law include it taking place within the United States or involving US government property or personnel. The offense must be prosecutable by a military commission, and the accused must be subject to its jurisdiction. The use of an explosive device to target a civilian aircraft could fall under these criteria. The use of an explosive device to bring down a civilian aircraft may be prosecuted under military commissions if it is connected to hostilities and the accused has ties to forces opposing the United States in an armed conflict. In order for a military commission to have jurisdiction over an accused, they must not be a US citizen and must be an unprivileged enemy belligerent. This includes individuals who have engaged in hostilities against the US, supported hostilities, or were part of al Qaeda at the time of the alleged offense. The bill outlines criteria for individuals to be considered unprivileged enemy belligerents, including engaging in hostilities against the US, supporting hostilities, or being part of al Qaeda at the time of the alleged offense. The bill does not specify how these criteria will be determined, leaving room for military commissions or Article III courts to make jurisdictional decisions. The provision in the bill regarding habeas jurisdiction could complicate extradition and trial efforts for terrorism suspects, especially in cases where a qualifying terrorist attack has not been carried out. It applies to all foreign nationals engaged in relevant conduct, potentially affecting material support cases and other terrorism-related charges. The provision in the bill may not apply to foreign nationals arrested in sting operations and does not require government action to determine their eligibility under the provision. However, habeas challenges may be possible for foreign nationals in the United States. The bill does not prohibit trials in Article III courts for the individuals it covers. The bill does not outright preclude trials in Article III courts for foreign nationals in the United States, but states that they shall only be tried for certain offenses in military commissions. This provision may be avoidable by framing the offense as one under a terrorism-related provision of title 18, U.S. Code. The U.S. Code allows for broader discretion in prosecutorial decisions compared to military commissions. If a federal criminal offense is charged, a defendant could challenge the jurisdiction of an Article III court. If trial before a military commission is not possible, a criminal trial may not be possible. The defendant's extradition from a foreign country without permission for a military court trial may hinder a criminal trial. Section 1032 extends authority for rewards up to $5 million for information related to military operations against terrorism. Section 1041 extends authority for military operations against international terrorism and requires quarterly briefings to congressional defense committees. Section 1044 approves DOD anti-terrorism efforts, and Section 1045 addresses congressional support for future efforts. Section 1045 addresses the need for improved interagency strategic planning to deny safe havens to Al Qaeda and affiliated groups and strengthen \"at-risk states.\" The President is required to issue planning guidance identifying geographic areas of concern, setting goals, describing agency roles, and filling gaps in U.S. capabilities through coordination with other entities. The President is required to issue planning guidance to deny safe havens to Al Qaeda and affiliated groups, strengthen \"at-risk states,\" and fill gaps in U.S. capabilities through coordination with other entities. The Senate bill S. 1867 covers \"Detainee Matters\" in subtitle D of Title X, with provisions similar to S. 1253 but revised language to address Administration concerns. The Senate passed S. 1867 on December 1, 2011, with a single amendment clarifying the legal authority to detain persons captured in the conflict with Al Qaeda. The detainee provisions were revised to address Administration concerns. The original provisions of H.R. 1540 were replaced with new language. The Senate passed S. 1867 with provisions allowing the U.S. Armed Forces to detain \"covered persons\" as enemy belligerents. The bill defines \"covered persons\" as any person captured in the conflict with Al Qaeda. The Senate passed S. 1867 allowing the detention of \"covered persons\" as enemy belligerents, defined as those involved in the 9/11 attacks or supporting Al Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces engaged in hostilities against the US. The Senate passed S. 1867 allowing the detention of \"covered persons\" involved in 9/11 attacks or supporting Al Qaeda, Taliban, or associated forces engaged in hostilities against the US, including those who committed belligerent acts or directly supported such hostilities. The earlier version of Section 1031 in S. 1253 authorized the Armed Forces to detain covered persons as unprivileged enemy belligerents captured in hostilities authorized by the AUMF until the end of hostilities. The White House objected to the language \"captured in the course of hostilities\" as it could limit detentions. The White House objected to the language in the Senate-passed S. 1867 regarding the detention of \"covered persons\" under the AUMF, as it could limit detentions to those captured during military operations. The provision in Section 1031 allows for various dispositions under the law of war, including detention without trial, trial by military commission, transfer for trial by another court, or transfer to a foreign country or entity. The provision in Section 1031 allows for various dispositions under the law of war, including detention without trial, trial by military commission, or transfer to a foreign country or entity. It is unclear if U.S. citizens or lawful resident aliens may be considered \"covered persons.\" S. 1867, as reported out of committee, seemed to tacitly leave the application of the Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) to U.S. persons, particularly those arrested in the United States, in an unsettled position. The committee-modified version of S. 1867 aimed to reinforce the executive branch's view of detention authority, with significant debate on the potential application of Section 1031 to U.S. citizens. An amendment to bar U.S. citizens from long-term military detention based on enemy belligerent status was rejected, but a proviso was added. The committee-modified version of S. 1867 aimed to reinforce the executive branch's view of detention authority, with significant debate on the potential application of Section 1031 to U.S. citizens. An amendment to bar U.S. citizens from long-term military detention based on enemy belligerent status was rejected, but a proviso was added clarifying that existing law and authority relating to the detention of U.S. citizens and resident aliens would not be affected by Section 1031. The executive's authority to detain U.S. citizens and resident aliens, as well as others captured in the United States, has been controversial and not definitively resolved in the courts. While the Supreme Court has allowed military detention of individuals captured in Afghanistan, the circumstances for those captured elsewhere remain unclear. Section 1031 does not clarify the rules for preventive military detention of U.S. citizens. Section 1031 does not provide clarity on the circumstances for preventive military detention of U.S. citizens or residents captured in the United States. The definitional standard for detention authority remains ambiguous, with terms like \"substantial support\" and \"associated forces\" not clearly defined. Section 1031 does not clarify terms like \"substantial support,\" \"associated forces,\" or \"hostilities,\" potentially allowing for a broad interpretation. S. 1867 requires the Secretary of Defense to brief Congress on how the provision applies to \"covered persons,\" possibly necessitating ongoing identification of \"associated forces.\" The Administration has not raised specific objections to the language in revised Section 1031, but cautions against unnecessary codification of existing authorities. Congress must avoid creating new legal questions that could detract from national security efforts. Future legislative action should ensure that military detention is clearly defined in statute. The current language minimizes risks, but future legislative action must ensure military detention authority in statute doesn't compromise national security. Section 1032 requires temporary military custody for certain Al Qaeda members and associated forces. The provision under the control of the United States as of 60 days from enactment applies to captured individuals during hostilities authorized by the AUMF, excluding U.S. citizens but including U.S. resident aliens. The mandatory detention requirement under the AUMF applies to captured individuals involved with al-Qaeda or associated forces in attacking the US or its partners, to be detained by military authorities until disposition under the law of war. The AUMF mandates the detention of individuals involved in attacking the US or its partners by military authorities until disposition under the law of war, which includes being held in military detention, tried before a military commission, transferred for trial by another court, or transferred to a foreign government if certain requirements are met. Section 1032 of S. 1867 applies to members of \"associated forces\" acting in coordination with or directed by al-Qaeda, omitting explicit reference to the Taliban unless their actions are closely tied to Al Qaeda. The text discusses how Section 1032 of S. 1867 applies to associated forces linked to Al Qaeda, raising questions about the treatment of Taliban members who may coordinate with Al Qaeda. The determination of mandatory detention may depend on the level of coordination with Al Qaeda in specific attacks. The text discusses how Section 1032 of S. 1867 applies to associated forces linked to Al Qaeda, raising questions about the treatment of Taliban members who may coordinate with Al Qaeda in specific attacks. The interpretation of what constitutes an \"attack ... against the United States coalition partners\" is not clearly defined. The interpretation of what constitutes an \"attack ... against the United States coalition partners\" under Section 1032 of S. 1867 is ambiguous, with no clear definition provided. It could refer to attacks in military operations or broader terrorist acts against civilian targets, leading to uncertainty in applying the law of war. The interpretation of \"attack against the United States\" under Section 1032 of S. 1867 is unclear and may apply broadly to cover terrorist acts against civilian targets. The reference to lawful resident aliens being detained based on conduct in the U.S. supports this broader reading. The mandatory detention requirement is related to hostilities authorized by the AUMF and may not apply to insurgents attacking U.S. or coalition targets in Iraq. The provision in S. 1867 requires the President to submit a report to Congress within 60 days of enactment, detailing procedures for implementing the provision, including designating who is authorized to determine covered persons and the process for making such determinations. The provision in S. 1867 requires the President to submit a report to Congress within 60 days of enactment, detailing procedures for determining covered persons and preventing interruptions in surveillance or intelligence gathering. It also includes procedures for individuals not in U.S. custody, waiver provisions, and access to individuals in the custody of a third country. The provision in S. 1867 requires the President to submit a report to Congress within 60 days of enactment, detailing procedures for determining covered persons and preventing interruptions in surveillance or intelligence gathering. It includes procedures for individuals not in U.S. custody, waiver provisions, and access to individuals in the custody of a third country. The interaction of these procedures with those under Section 1036, which requires DOD to submit procedures for status determinations for persons detained under the AUMF, is unclear. The bill does not preclude multiple processes for determining if someone qualifies for mandatory military detention under Section 1031, depending on custody. It also does not prevent the use of different procedures for initial custody status determination under Section 1036. The bill allows for various processes to determine if someone qualifies for mandatory military detention under Section 1031, depending on custody. It does not prevent Article III trials of covered persons, with constitutional due process requirements likely to be implicated. The Obama Administration opposes Section 1032 of the bill, which could complicate the prosecution of covered defendants and limit the executive branch's counterterrorism tools according to Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta. Secretary Panetta objects to Section 1032 of the bill, stating that it limits the executive branch's counterterrorism tools and complicates the Department's ability to interpret and implement the restriction. The White House also strongly opposes this section. The White House strongly objects to Section 1032, calling it an \"unnecessary, untested, and legally controversial restriction of the President's authority to defend the Nation from terrorist threats\" that would \"tie the hands of our intelligence and law enforcement professionals.\" The Administration expresses doubt that the committee revisions to the provision will correct the fundamental problems it perceives. The revised text of Section 1032 aims to prevent interruptions in interrogations and other enhancements by directing the President to develop procedures. This approach acknowledges the risks of mandating military custody but fails to provide a sufficient solution. Section 1033 extends restrictions on transferring Guantanamo detainees and prohibits military funds for such purposes. This could lead to confusion in counterterrorism operations. Section 1033 extends restrictions on transferring Guantanamo detainees by prohibiting the expenditure of DOD funds for any detainee transfer to a foreign country without congressional certification. The text chunk discusses the conditions that a foreign country must meet in order to house an individual who is not a designated state sponsor of terrorism or a designated foreign terrorist organization. The country must maintain control over the detention facility, not face a substantial threat to control over the individual, take measures to avert any threat posed by the individual, prevent the person from engaging in terrorism, and share relevant information with the United States. The Senate bill requires a foreign country to share information related to the individual or his associates, and relevant to the security of the United States, its citizens, or its allies. Unlike H.R. 1540, the bill does not require the Secretary of Defense to certify access to transferred individuals. The Senate bill does not require the Secretary of Defense to certify access to transferred individuals, except in cases of detainees being transferred pursuant to a pretrial agreement or court order. Transfers from Guantanamo to foreign countries are generally prohibited if a previously transferred detainee has engaged in terrorist activity, with exceptions for pretrial agreements or court orders. Detainees transferred under pretrial agreements or court orders may have certification and recidivism requirements waived by the Secretary of Defense, with approval from the Secretary of State and consultation with the Director of National Intelligence. Waivers can be granted if alternative actions address the purpose of the measures or substantially mitigate risks. The Secretary of Defense, with approval from the Secretary of State and consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, may issue a waiver for detainees transferred under pretrial agreements or court orders if alternative actions will substantially mitigate risks. Transfers must be determined to be in the national security interests of the United States, with notification to congressional defense committees 30 days prior. The Senate bill's transfer restrictions for detainees at Guantanamo must be submitted to congressional defense committees with a statement of national security interests, reasons for not certifying all risks eliminated, and summary of alternative actions contemplated. The term \"individual detained at Guantanamo\" is broadly defined to exclude U.S. citizens, servicemembers, detainees under court orders, or military commission pretrial agreements. The term \"individual detained at Guantanamo\" is broadly defined to exclude U.S. citizens, servicemembers, detainees under court orders, or military commission pretrial agreements. Section 1033 may cover foreign refugees brought to the Migrant Operations Center at Guantanamo after being interdicted at sea. The White House has expressed disapproval of transfer restriction provisions in the 2012 NDAA. Section 1034 of the 2012 NDAA prohibits the use of DOD funds to construct or modify facilities in the US or its territories for housing individuals detained at Guantanamo without congressional authorization. The White House and Department of Defense disapprove of transfer restriction provisions in the bill. The 2012 NDAA Section 1034 restricts the use of DOD funds for Guantanamo detainee housing without congressional approval. The White House opposes these restrictions, similar to previous enactments. The Senate bill for the 2012 NDAA does not include restrictions on transferring Guantanamo detainees to the United States. Detainees can be transferred to civilian law enforcement for prosecution, and cleared detainees can be released into the US. The White House objects to these provisions. The Senate bill for the 2012 NDAA does not restrict transferring Guantanamo detainees to the United States. Cleared detainees can be released into the US, but transfers for continued military detention may be limited. Section 1035 clarifies aspects of detention reviews at Guantanamo under Executive Order 13567. Section 1035 of the 2012 NDAA clarifies procedures for review panels established under Executive Order 13567. The purpose of the periodic review is to assess if a detainee poses a threat to U.S. security, not to review the legality of their detention. The Secretary of Defense is responsible for making final decisions on detainee release based on panel recommendations. The 2012 NDAA clarifies procedures for detainee review panels to assess threat to U.S. security. The Secretary of Defense makes final release decisions based on panel recommendations, considering factors like likelihood of terrorist activity resumption. Administration objects to this provision. The 2012 NDAA clarifies procedures for detainee review panels to assess threat to U.S. security and the Secretary of Defense makes final release decisions based on panel recommendations. The Administration objects to a provision in the bill that shifts responsibility for detainee review to the Defense Department. Section 1036 requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a report to congressional committees within 90 days explaining procedures for determining the status of persons detained under the AUMF for purposes of the bill. The 2012 NDAA clarifies procedures for detainee review panels to assess threat to U.S. security. Section 1036 requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a report to congressional committees within 90 days explaining procedures for determining the status of persons detained under the AUMF for purposes of the bill. In the case of any unprivileged enemy belligerent who will be held in long-term detention, procedures must include a military judge presiding at status determination proceedings and the option for the belligerent to be represented by military counsel. The 2012 NDAA clarifies procedures for detainee review panels to assess threat to U.S. security. An unprivileged enemy belligerent may be represented by military counsel at status determination proceedings, regardless of detainee location. This provision could provide detainees in Afghanistan with greater privileges during hearings for long-term detention. The 2012 NDAA clarifies procedures for detainee review panels to assess threat to U.S. security, allowing military counsel for unprivileged enemy belligerents. The implications of Section 1036 on Guantanamo detainees' habeas challenges are unclear. The 2012 NDAA clarifies procedures for detainee review panels to assess threat to U.S. security, allowing military counsel for unprivileged enemy belligerents. The implications of Section 1036 on Guantanamo detainees' habeas challenges are unclear, as it raises questions about the application to all detainees in U.S. custody designated for long-term detention under the AUMF. The 2012 NDAA clarifies procedures for detainee review panels to assess threat to U.S. security, allowing military counsel for unprivileged enemy belligerents. The provision in question does not clarify how to determine if a detainee will be held in long-term detention before a status hearing, potentially requiring a second status determination for those designated. The 2012 NDAA clarifies procedures for detainee review panels to assess threat to U.S. security, allowing military counsel for unprivileged enemy belligerents. The disposition determination is to be made prior to a status determination, which may require a second status determination for those designated for long-term detention. Persons subject to long-term detention may have more than one status determination to change their disposition. The 2012 NDAA clarifies detainee review procedures, allowing military counsel for unprivileged enemy belligerents. Long-term detainees may undergo multiple status determinations to change their disposition, which could involve transfer or prosecution without the need for a military judge or right to counsel. Alternatively, detainees not designated for long-term detention may have their status determined through existing administrative review processes. The 2012 NDAA clarifies detainee review procedures, allowing military counsel for unprivileged enemy belligerents. Long-term detainees may undergo multiple status determinations for disposition changes, including transfer or prosecution without a military judge or right to counsel. Detainees not designated for long-term detention may have their status determined through existing administrative review processes, which the White House disapproves of due to perceived onerous requirements conflicting with established field procedures. Section 1037 of the MCA allows plea agreements in capital cases, similar to a provision in House-passed H.R. 1540. Section 1037 of the MCA allows plea agreements in capital cases, similar to a provision in House-passed H.R. 1540."
