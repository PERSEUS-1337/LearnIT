    "content": "SECTION 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. Congress finds that the tax treatment of section 529 college savings plans was changed in 2001 to exempt qualified distributions from taxation. This favorable treatment was made permanent in 2006, empowering middle-class families to save for college expenses. The College Savings Plan Network reports 11.83 million 529 accounts open nationwide, totaling $244.5 billion in assets with an average account size of $20,671. States offer 529 plans with low minimum contributions to help families save for college. The President's 2016 Budget includes proposals related to college savings. The President's fiscal year 2016 Budget proposes raising taxes on future distributions from 529 college savings plans, which could discourage their use and lead to more student debt. Purchase of a computer should be eligible for qualified distributions under 529 plans. The Act aims to strengthen 529 college savings plans and make them more modern and consumer-friendly. It states that education expenses should be eligible for qualified distributions under these plans. Computer technology and equipment are now permanently allowed as qualified higher education expenses for Section 529 accounts. Computer technology and equipment, including computer or peripheral equipment, computer software, and Internet access, are now considered qualified higher education expenses for Section 529 accounts if primarily used by the beneficiary during their enrollment at an eligible educational institution. The amendment applies to taxable years starting after December 31, 2014. SEC. 3 eliminates distribution aggregation requirements in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The amendment is effective for distributions after December 31, 2014. SEC. 4 allows for the recontribution of refunded amounts. The amendment allows beneficiaries to recontribute refunded qualified higher education expenses to a qualified tuition program, exempting that portion from distribution rules. The amendment allows beneficiaries to recontribute refunded qualified higher education expenses to a qualified tuition program within 60 days, not exceeding the refunded amount. Effective after December 31, 2014, this rule applies to refunds of qualified higher education expenses. After December 31, 2014, refunds of qualified higher education expenses can be recontributed to a qualified tuition program within 60 days. Refunds of qualified higher education expenses can be recontributed to a qualified tuition program within 60 days after the date of such refund."
