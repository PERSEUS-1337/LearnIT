    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Child Handgun Injury Prevention Act\". The Congress finds that in the 10 years from 1987 through 1996, nearly 2,200 children aged 14 or younger died from unintentional shootings in the United States. The country leads the industrialized world in rates of children lost to unintentional firearms-related death. A 1997 CDC study found that the US had a 9 times higher rate of unintentional firearms-related deaths for children under 15 compared to 25 other industrialized countries. Additionally, nearly 8 times as many children are treated annually in US hospitals for nonfatal unintentional gunshot wounds. A study in medical journals found that unintentional gunshot wounds among children often involve handguns, with children as young as 3 years old capable of firing most commercially available handguns. Children as young as 3 years old are strong enough to fire most commercially available handguns, with 25% of 3- to 4-year-olds and 70% of 5- to 6-year-olds having sufficient finger strength. Firearms in the US are not subject to minimum safety standards, as highlighted in a 1997 public opinion poll. The University of Chicago and Johns Hopkins Center found that 74% of Americans support safety regulations for the firearms industry. Many trigger locks are inadequate in preventing accidental discharge or children accessing firearms. Regulation of handgun discharge protection products. The Secretary of the Treasury will regulate handgun discharge protection products to reduce the risk of injury to children from unintentional discharge. Minimum safety standards will be set for these products. The Secretary of the Treasury will establish safety standards for handgun discharge protection products to prevent children from operating a handgun. The standard will ensure that the product is permanently installed and cannot be removed without specific access methods provided by the manufacturer.

It advises keeping handguns locked and unloaded to prevent child access.
