    "content": "The electric utility industry is a significant source of air pollution, including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury, as well as carbon dioxide. The EPA released an analysis comparing different approaches to controlling this pollution, focusing on market-oriented mechanisms for cost-effective solutions. The analysis compared versions of the \"Clear Skies\" proposal with bills introduced by Senators Jeffords and Carper. The EPA's new analysis compares different versions of the \"Clear Skies\" proposal with bills introduced by Senators Jeffords and Carper, which impose more stringent requirements. The Administration initially resisted conducting the study due to cost and difficulty but relented after the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee failed to report the Clear Skies bill. Opponents of the bill cited the lack of a comparative analysis as a reason for its failure to advance. The EPA conducted a cost-benefit analysis of the Clear Skies bill and other Senate bills in response to concerns raised during confirmation hearings for EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson. Electric utility generating facilities are a major source of air pollution due to the combustion of fossil fuels. The combustion of fossil fuels in electric generating facilities results in air pollution, emitting gases like particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury. These pollutants pose direct risks to human health and welfare, with some gases also contributing to global warming. Regulations under the Clean Air Act control emissions of SO2, NOx, and CO2 from these facilities, with reductions seen in SO2 and NOx emissions. Table 1 shows the declining emissions of SO2 and NOx from electric generating facilities due to regulations, while CO2 emissions continue to rise. Fossil-fuel-fired plants accounted for a significant portion of the country's emissions in 2003, with Hg emissions from utility facilities being uncertain but estimated at around 45 tons. Emissions from U.S. fossil-fuel electric generating plants, particularly Hg from utility facilities, are estimated at about 45 tons, accounting for over 40% of the country's total Hg emissions. The evolution of air pollution controls has led to a complex system of regulations, with additional controls in progress for NOx, SO2, and PM 2.5 emissions. The United States is implementing additional controls on NOx, SO2, and Hg emissions, as well as voluntary limits on CO2 emissions under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The Bush Administration rejected the Kyoto Protocol in favor of a voluntary reduction program, while the Senate passed a resolution in 2005 calling for mandatory controls on greenhouse gases. The Senate passed a resolution in June 2005 for mandatory controls on greenhouse gases, focusing on a \"multi-pollutant\" approach targeting SO2, NOx, Hg, and CO2 emissions from utilities to balance environmental goals with industry stability. The new approach aims to balance environmental goals with industry stability by implementing controls on pollutants like SO2, NOx, Hg, and CO2 emissions. This approach has already been integrated into existing law through rules such as CAIR, CAMR, and CAVR, which focus on capping emissions from coal-fired power plants and improving visibility around national parks and wilderness areas. The Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR), implemented in 2005, targets SO2 and NOx emissions affecting visibility in national parks and wilderness areas. Reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions are necessary to comply with new air quality standards for ozone and fine particles. Mercury emissions are also a concern, with 44 states issuing fish consumption advisories due to mercury contamination in water bodies. Mercury contamination in water bodies has led to fish consumption advisories in 44 states, covering millions of acres of lakes and river miles. Legislation addressing power plant pollution, such as the \"Clear Skies\" initiative, is being considered in Congress to achieve health and environmental goals more cost-effectively. In the 109th Congress, legislation known as \"Clear Skies\" aims to impose multi-pollutant controls on utilities, addressing SO2, NOx, and Hg emissions from electric generating facilities through a system of tradeable allowances. Key questions in the debate include the stringency of caps, the timeline for reductions, and the inclusion of CO2 emissions. The congressional debate on multi-pollutant controls focuses on the stringency of caps, reduction timelines, and inclusion of CO2 emissions. Bills require 70-80% reduction of NOx and SO2 emissions, and 70-90% reduction of mercury. The Clear Skies bill has the least stringent standards and longest phase-in period, with final deadlines set for 2018 but targets may not be met for a decade. The Clear Skies bill sets final deadlines for 2018, but 70% reduction targets may be delayed for up to a decade due to banking provisions allowing utilities to overcomply early on and use credits for later emission reductions. The Clear Skies bill allows banking of emission allowances, leading to potential delays in achieving 70% reduction targets by 2026 or later. Jeffords and Carper bills, with stricter caps, would enable utilities to reach full compliance at least a decade sooner. The Jeffords and Carper bills impose controls on carbon dioxide, unlike Clear Skies. This difference in regulation may lead to varied compliance strategies, potentially preserving a market for coal and reducing the reliance on natural gas or renewable fuels for power production. EPA's cost-benefit analysis compared six options, with four being variants of Clear Skies and the other two being different regulatory approaches. The EPA analysis compared six options, including variants of Clear Skies, Carper's Clean Air Planning Act, and Jeffords' Clean Power Act. The results showed little difference between the Clear Skies options, simplifying the discussion to three main choices. The EPA analysis compared six options, including Clear Skies, Carper, and Jeffords. The chosen Clear Skies version was the Managers' Mark offered at the Senate markup of S. 131 on March 9, 2005. EPA's baseline assumes no additional action on emissions beyond rules finalized by mid-2004, despite three recent EPA rules on SO2, NOx, and Hg. The EPA baseline assumes no further action on emissions beyond rules finalized by mid-2004, despite recent EPA rules on SO2, NOx, and Hg. EPA included these rules as a \"sixth proposal\" for controlling pollutants, leading to uncertainty in clean air regulation. The uncertainty surrounding clean air regulation includes the potential changes in deadlines and provisions of proposed legislation, such as S. 843 introduced in the 108th Congress. The evolving nature of the Managers' Mark proposal and the uncertainties and delays in finalizing regulations further contribute to the unpredictability of future regulations. The regulations supporting passed legislation may face uncertainties and delays similar to finalized regulations not included in EPA's baseline. EPA's cost analysis focuses on Electric Demand Price Elasticity, analyzing scenarios with different levels of demand response to increasing electricity prices. The EPA analyzes scenarios with zero price elasticity and very inelastic short-term price elasticity in response to increasing electricity prices. Construction constraints and electricity demand growth are also considered in the analysis. The EPA analyzes scenarios with different assumptions on electricity demand growth and natural gas prices. Four scenarios were developed based on these assumptions, including zero price demand elasticity in the base case scenario. EPA developed four scenarios with different assumptions on electricity demand growth and natural gas prices, including zero price demand elasticity in the base case scenario. The report compares different scenarios developed by EPA regarding electricity demand growth and natural gas prices, with a focus on short-term construction constraints and price elasticity. The Demand Response Scenario is used as a benchmark analysis due to a lack of alternative combinations. Including a short-term demand response function in the modeling is argued to be the strongest case based on established electricity price elasticities. The EPA included a short-term demand response function in their modeling, based on established electricity price elasticities. This refinement was only included in the Demand Response Scenario, leading CRS to adopt it. The decision to exclude this refinement from other scenarios remains unclear. The EPA included a short-term demand response function in their modeling, based on established electricity price elasticities. This refinement was only included in the Demand Response Scenario, leading CRS to adopt it. EPA assumes limited boilermaker labor for constructing SO2 and NOx control equipment until 2010, which has been questioned by some, including the Institute of Clean Air Companies. The Institute of Clean Air Companies (ICAC) questioned the EPA's assumption of limited boilermaker labor for constructing air pollution control equipment until 2010. ICAC conducted their own analysis and found no constraint on construction, demonstrating the industry's ability to install significant amounts of equipment in short periods of time. This was evidenced by recent installations of selective catalytic reduction controls in the US, Germany, and Japan. The installation of SCRs for NOx SIP call and control installations in Germany and Japan have shown the industry's ability to install air pollution control equipment efficiently. The resources needed for projected installations under IAQR are expected to be sufficient, with factors like modular construction methods reducing demand for union boilermakers. This, combined with a six-month compliance time window, will further alleviate demand on boilermaker labor. The demand for boilermaker labor will decrease due to reduced demand and a longer compliance time window. Additional labor can be sourced from Canadian boilermaker union, ship builders, and iron workers. There will be sufficient capacity to complete the projected IAQR and control installations for 2010 and 2015, with the possibility of finishing the 2015 requirements by 2010. Limited availability of boilermakers only affects certain alternatives. The limited availability of boilermakers only affects certain alternatives in the 2010 timeframe. Despite questions about assumptions, it is more important to include a demand elasticity function in the analysis than to remove the feasibility constraint. The EPA's demand response scenario was chosen as the base case for the analysis. Sensitivity analysis is crucial due to uncertainties in future natural gas supply, with EPA projecting more availability at lower prices compared to EIA. The EPA's demand response scenario projects more natural gas availability at lower prices compared to EIA's supply curves. However, the historic volatility of the natural gas market and uncertainties in future supply raise questions about the accuracy of these projections. The analysis discusses the Demand Response Scenario, which is based on recognizing questions about EPA's feasibility constraints and the historic volatility of the natural gas market. Clear Skies is highlighted as a cost-effective option compared to other bills, with minimal costs and benefits in the short- and long-term. Clear Skies is the most cost-effective option with less stringent requirements and later deadlines compared to other bills. It aims to revamp the Clean Air Act's structure with a focus on cost-effectiveness, resulting in lower benefits than other bills designed to reduce pollution faster. The Clear Skies bill is more cost-effective but offers lower benefits compared to the Carper and Jeffords bills, which have more stringent pollution caps and earlier deadlines. EPA estimates Clear Skies would provide $6 billion in annual benefits in 2010, while Carper and Jeffords bills would offer $51 billion and $83 billion respectively. By 2020, Clear Skies benefits almost merge with baseline increases, lagging behind the $19 billion and $66 billion annual benefits of the other bills. The Carper and Jeffords bills offer higher benefits due to more stringent pollution caps and earlier deadlines compared to the Clear Skies bill. EPA's analysis shows that when current Clean Air Act requirements are taken into account, Clear Skies has minimal additional costs and benefits. EPA has successfully integrated a market-based regulatory scheme into the legislation. The EPA has successfully incorporated a market-based regulatory scheme into new regulations, with Clear Skies showing minimal additional costs and benefits compared to current Clean Air Act requirements. Senator Jeffords' bill (S. 150) is projected to have the greatest benefits, surpassing other bills in both 2010 and 2020. In 2020, Senator Jeffords' bill is projected to have benefits of $66 billion annually, exceeding those of other bills by three-and-a-half times and 22 times more than Clear Skies. EPA estimates show significant cost and benefit advantages compared to existing laws. The EPA 2020 Cost and Benefit Estimates for Three Multi-Pollutant Proposals show that S. 150 would be the most costly bill. The Jeffords bill would reduce coal production and coal-fired electric generation by about 40%, according to EPA. The Jeffords bill would significantly reduce coal production and coal-fired electric generation by about 40%, leading to a shift towards renewable sources and additional oil- and gas-fired capacity. The bill would result in a substantial increase in generation from renewable sources and a significant decrease in coal use compared to other options like Clear Skies or the Carper bill. While the cost of S. 150 may be seen as high, the net benefits of the bill are emphasized. The net benefits of S. 150 exceed those of Clear Skies and S. 843 (Carper), with lower costs compared to S. 843 but higher than Clear Skies. S. 843 aims for substantial emission reductions beyond the Clean Air Act, with a phased-in schedule to mitigate short-term constraints. The phased-in schedule of S. 843 helps mitigate short-term constraints on emission reductions, with a flexible CO2 requirement at a nominal cost. EPA conducted sensitivity analyses on various bills, highlighting price elasticity, construction constraints, and electricity growth. The EPA conducted sensitivity analyses on various bills, focusing on price elasticity, construction constraints, and electricity growth. Different scenarios were examined, including limited short-term price elasticity and construction constraints. The EPA conducted sensitivity analyses on various bills, focusing on price elasticity, construction constraints, and electricity growth. Different scenarios were examined, including limited short-term price elasticity and construction constraints. The scenarios included the EPA Base Case Scenario, Higher Electricity Growth and Natural Gas Scenario, and No Construction Constraint Scenario. The latter removes the short-term construction constraint assumption but includes a zero demand price elasticity assumption. This swap of assumptions has minimal impact on S. 843 and the Managers' Mark. The removal of zero demand price elasticity assumption in the scenario has a substantial impact on the cost of S. 150, with a 36% increase in short-term and 157% increase in long-term costs. This exceeds the savings gained by removing EPA short-term construction constraint assumptions. The removal of any price elasticity exceeds the savings gained by removing EPA short-term construction constraint assumptions, resulting in a significant compliance cost for S. 150. The second alternative, the EPA Base Case Scenario, replaces the short-term price elasticity estimate with zero elasticity, confirming the dramatic effect on costs. The removal of any short-term price elasticity has a significant impact on the costs of S. 150 and S. 843, with cost estimates increasing by 63% in 2010 and 147% in 2020 for S. 150, and 86% higher than the benchmark estimate for 2010 for S. 843. This highlights the influence of demand response and short-term construction constraint assumptions on EPA's cost estimates for these scenarios. The EPA's assumptions heavily impact cost estimates for S. 843 in 2010, but have little effect in the long-term or for the Managers' Mark. The Higher Electricity Growth and Natural Gas Scenario combines zero price elasticity and short-term construction constraints from the EPA Base Case with EIA's higher electricity growth and steeper natural gas supply curves. This scenario maintains short-term construction constraints, removes demand price elasticity, and uses EIA assumptions for electricity growth and natural gas supply. The combination of zero demand response, higher electricity demand, and tighter natural gas supply leads to increased costs, especially for S. 150. The impact is most significant for S. 150 compared to S. 843 and the Managers' Mark, putting pressure on the EPA's assumption of zero demand price elasticity, particularly for 2020. The EPA's assumption of zero demand price elasticity has a significant impact on cost estimates for S. 150, especially in the long term. A more comprehensive analysis of future natural gas availability could help determine appropriate targets for multi-pollutant legislation. When EIA higher electricity growth and natural gas assumptions are used, it has a significant impact on cost estimates for S. 843 in both the short and long term. EPA's assumptions of zero demand price elasticity and short-term construction constraints also play a significant role in the short term but decrease over time. These assumptions have little effect on the Managers' Mark cost estimates. The EPA's assumptions have minimal economic impact on the Managers' Mark compared to existing laws and regulations. Two bills analyzed by the EPA, S. 150 and S. 843, aim to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. S. 150 sets an emissions cap of 2.05 billion tons annually starting in 2010. Jeffords' S. 150 and Senator Carper's S. 843 aim to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. S. 150 sets an emissions cap of 2.05 billion tons annually starting in 2010, while S. 843 would set a lower cap of about 2.655 billion tons in 2009, decreasing to 2.454 billion tons in 2013. The costs for CO2 allowances under S. 843 are significantly lower compared to S. 150 due to a more modest reduction requirement and slower schedule. S. 150 aligns more closely with the Kyoto Protocol than S. 843. The costs for CO2 allowances under S. 150 are estimated to be $19 per metric ton in 2010 and $33 per metric ton in 2020, aligning closely with the Kyoto Protocol. This estimate range is comparable to current EU market prices as they prepare to meet their 8% reduction target below 1990 levels. The EU price for a metric ton of carbon dioxide reduction is around $25. The EPA did not develop new data on the cost of control technologies for a study with a short deadline, relying on assumptions from 2005. This may overstate the cost of emission controls for mercury. The effectiveness of mercury control technology has advanced rapidly since 2003, leading to a substantial decrease in the cost of activated carbon injection (ACI) controls. The EPA's analysis of S. 150 suggests that 40% of coal-fired plants would be shut down by 2010 under the bill. The EPA's analysis of S. 150 indicates that 40% of coal-fired plants could be shut down by 2010 under the bill. The benefits of reducing emissions of SO2 and fine particles outweigh the costs, with monetized human health effects being a significant factor. The EPA's analysis of S. 150 indicates that 40% of coal-fired plants could be shut down by 2010 under the bill. The benefits of reducing emissions of SO2 and fine particles outweigh the costs, with significant environmental benefits not estimated in the analysis. Reductions in SO2 emissions could have significant environmental benefits, including the formation of regional haze and mercury deposition leading to fish consumption advisories. The analysis does not account for these environmental benefits, especially in bills S. 150 and S. 843 with aggressive control schemes. Additionally, the analysis does not model mercury health effects, which could have economic impacts ranging from millions to billions of dollars per year. The economic benefits of reducing mercury health effects range from millions to billions of dollars per year. Omitting these benefits could significantly impact bills S. 150 and S. 843 with aggressive control schemes. The analysis did not consider the possible benefits of controlling CO2 emissions, which could understate the potential benefits of the Jeffords and Carper bills. The absence of considering CO2 emissions control in the analysis may significantly impact the potential benefits of the Jeffords and Carper bills. The Jeffords bill is the most aggressive in controlling CO2, unlike Clear Skies. EPA's analysis shows little cost and a small benefit after adjusting for Clear Skies rules. After adjusting for promulgated rules, EPA's analysis finds minimal cost and some benefit with Clear Skies legislation. In contrast, the Jeffords and Carper bills impose stricter standards, resulting in significant benefits outweighing costs. Carbon dioxide reduction costs are low for S. 843 due to modest requirements and relaxed schedule, but costs increase with higher reductions and tighter schedules. Mercury control costs vary based on data timeliness. EPA's analysis does not include CO2 emissions control, which could impact the benefits of the Jeffords and Carper bills. The EPA's analysis of costs for mercury control is dependent on data timeliness, with Clear Skies alternatives benefiting from overstated costs. The analysis is limited and incomplete, favoring Clear Skies options by assuming constraints on labor availability. The analysis of mercury control costs favors ClearSkies alternatives by overstating costs and penalizing short-term pollution reduction schedules due to labor availability constraints. It fails to consider the impact of natural gas price volatility on implementation strategies and costs, relying on outdated 2003 assumptions. This outdated analysis may not contribute significantly to current congressional debates."
