    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Consumer Assurance of Radiologic Excellence Act of 2003\". Congress finds that over 300 million medical imaging exams and radiation therapy treatments are conducted annually in the US, with 7 out of 10 Americans undergoing these procedures each year. These procedures have a significant impact on public health, safety, and interstate commerce, making it crucial to prioritize public health and safety. The performance of medical imaging and radiation therapy procedures by personnel lacking appropriate education and credentials has a direct effect on public health and safety. It is essential to have a continuing supply of adequately educated individuals and accreditation programs administered by State governments. The protection of public health and safety in medical imaging and radiation therapy is crucial. Personnel must demonstrate competence through education, training, and experience. Both State and Federal Governments share the responsibility for ensuring efficacious procedures. Facilities conducting medical imaging or radiation therapy impact interstate commerce as patients travel across state lines for services. Congress enacted the Consumer-Patient Protection Act in 1981. In 1981, Congress enacted the Consumer-Patient Radiation Health and Safety Act of 1981 (Public Law 97-35) to establish federal standards for accreditation of education programs for medical imaging and radiation therapy. The Act also provided a model State law for licensing such professionals. Twenty-two years after the Consumer-Patient Radiation Health and Safety Act of 1981, 13 States do not require licensure for medical imaging and radiation therapy, while 37 States regulate radiographers, 28 States license radiation therapists, and 22 States license nuclear medicine technologists. The Act aims to accredit education programs and license individuals performing patient dose for medical imaging and radiation therapy. States vary in licensing requirements for radiographers, radiation therapists, nuclear medicine technologists, medical physicists, and medical dosimetrists. The Act aims to accredit education programs and license individuals who perform, plan, evaluate, or verify patient dose for medical imaging and radiation therapy to ensure safety and accuracy. The Act focuses on accrediting education programs and licensing individuals for medical imaging and radiation therapy to ensure safety and accuracy. It includes a section on the quality of medical imaging and radiation therapy. The Secretary will establish standards for the safety and accuracy of medical imaging and radiation therapy, including licensure, certification, and accreditation. Exemptions are provided for physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. The Secretary will establish standards for the safety and accuracy of medical imaging and radiation therapy, including licensure, certification, and accreditation. Individuals must pass a national examination approved by the Secretary and meet other requirements before performing or planning medical imaging or radiation therapy. Approved bodies will be certified by the Secretary. The Secretary certifies private nonprofit organizations or State agencies as approved bodies for accrediting educational programs or administering examinations. Minimum standards are set for certification, including recordkeeping. The Secretary certifies approved bodies for accrediting educational programs or administering examinations. Standards include recordkeeping, curriculum approval, instructor approval, reasonable fees, and additional requirements set by the Secretary. Approved bodies must provide assurances of compliance with these standards. Approved bodies must comply with standards, notify the Secretary of any changes, and provide required information. The Secretary can withdraw certification if standards are not met. The Secretary can withdraw certification of an approved body if standards are not met. Accreditation or examination completion will remain valid for a reasonable period for individuals to obtain another accreditation or complete another examination. The Secretary can withdraw certification if standards are not met. Existing State standards will be deemed compliant unless determined otherwise. The Secretary will periodically evaluate and report. The Secretary will periodically evaluate the performance of approved bodies and include the results in a report to the Senate and House committees. Additionally, the Secretary must deliver and pay for services within 18 months of enactment. The Secretary must promulgate regulations within 18 months to ensure all medical imaging and radiation therapy programs meet established standards. Alternative standards may apply to payment for services in rural areas. The Secretary must develop alternative standards for payment in rural areas for medical imaging and radiation therapy to ensure access to quality care. Regulations must be promulgated within 18 months to meet established standards. The Secretary will promulgate regulations within 18 months to implement standards for accrediting bodies in medical imaging and radiation therapy. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of medical imaging and the act of performing medical imaging or radiation therapy. It includes procedures for diagnosis or treatment of diseases in humans using diagnostic X-rays, nuclear medicine, and magnetic resonance procedures. The term 'perform' refers to directly exposing a patient to radiation. The curr_chunk defines medical imaging and radiation therapy as the act of exposing a patient to radiation or a magnetic field for imaging or therapy purposes, and preparing for such procedures by evaluating site-specific information. The curr_chunk discusses customizing radiation therapy procedures for patients based on site-specific information and radiation dose distribution analysis."
