    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Forest Landscape Restoration Act\" and its purpose is outlined in Section 2. The Forest Landscape Restoration Act aims to promote collaborative ecosystem restoration in priority forest landscapes by encouraging sustainability, leveraging local and national resources, reducing wildfire management costs, and demonstrating the effectiveness of ecological restoration techniques. The Forest Landscape Restoration Act promotes collaborative ecosystem restoration in priority forest landscapes by utilizing various ecological restoration techniques to achieve ecological health objectives and impact wildfire activity and management costs. Additionally, the use of forest restoration byproducts can help offset treatment costs, benefit rural economies, and improve forest health. The Forest Landscape Restoration Act defines key terms such as \"covered Federal lands,\" \"Fund,\" \"program,\" and \"Secretaries\" for the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program. The Forest Landscape Restoration Act defines terms for the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program. The Forest Landscape Restoration Act establishes a Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program for ecological restoration treatments in priority forest landscapes. Activities must comply with the Endangered Species Act and the National Environmental Policy Act. Eligibility criteria are required for nomination and funding under the program. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program requires proposals to have a complete landscape restoration strategy that prioritizes ecological treatments for a 10-year period on at least 50,000 acres of primarily forested Federal lands. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program requires proposals for landscape restoration on at least 50,000 acres of forested Federal lands in need of ecosystem restoration and accessible by wood-processing infrastructure. The ecological restoration treatments involve small-diameter wood removal and incorporate the best available science and tools. It also includes requirements for old-growth maintenance, restoration, and large-tree retention. The collaborative process for developing and implementing ecological restoration treatments must include diverse representation and be transparent. It should not involve the establishment of permanent roads. The resource advisory committee must have a successful record of ecological restoration projects on federal lands and describe plans for using fire, improving habitat, and maintaining water quality. The resource advisory committee must have a successful record of ecological restoration projects on federal lands, including improving habitat for endangered species, maintaining water quality, controlling invasive species, managing roads, utilizing woody biomass, and reporting on performance annually. Develop small business incubators and provide employment and training opportunities in rural communities through local entities and youth partnerships. The program aims to create employment opportunities in rural communities through partnerships with youth groups, small businesses, and other local entities. It also considers community wildfire protection plans and analyzes cost savings. The proposal aims to estimate the annual Federal funding needed for implementing a wildfire protection plan and the amount of new non-Federal investment that would be leveraged. It also analyzes cost savings from reduced wildfire management costs and decreased unit costs of ecological restoration treatments over time. The proposal aims to estimate Federal funding for ecological restoration treatments and be subject to necessary requirements for program administration. Collaborative forest landscape restoration proposals must be submitted to the Bureau of Land Management and Regional Forester for each State with covered Federal lands. The proposal involves Federal lands and collaborative forest landscape restoration nominations by State Directors or Regional Foresters. Documentation for each nomination is required. The State Director or Regional Forester making the nomination must propose using Federal funds for ecological restoration treatments on covered Federal lands in line with the landscape restoration strategy. The State Director or Regional Forester must propose using Federal funds for ecological restoration treatments on Federal lands consistent with the landscape restoration strategy, ensuring funds are used for treatments in the same fiscal year they are transferred. The State Director or Regional Forester must propose using Federal funds for ecological restoration treatments on Federal lands consistent with the landscape restoration strategy, ensuring funds are used for treatments in the same fiscal year they are transferred. If the collaborative forest landscape restoration proposal includes activities on non-covered Federal land, evidence of the owner's participation and funding commitment is required. The Secretaries will select collaborative forest landscape restoration proposals that have been nominated and meet eligibility criteria. The Secretaries will give special consideration to the ecological case, collaborative process, and potential reduction of relative. The Secretaries will consider the ecological case, collaborative process, reduction of relative costs, long-term wildfire management costs, landscape restoration proposal strength, and non-Federal investment leverage in evaluating restoration strategies. The Secretaries will establish a scientific advisory panel to evaluate collaborative forest landscape restoration proposals, with limitations on the number of proposals funded each fiscal year. The Secretaries will establish a scientific advisory panel of up to 12 experts in ecological forest restoration and fire ecology to evaluate nominated proposals for landscape restoration based on ecological strength and likelihood of success. The Secretaries may establish a technical advisory panel of experts in rural business development and woody biomass to evaluate proposals for landscape restoration and their potential for reducing long-term wildfire management costs. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Fund is established in the Treasury of the United States to pay up to 50 percent of the cost of carrying out ecological restoration treatments on covered Federal lands for each collaborative proposal meeting eligibility criteria to reduce costs and provide local economic benefit. The Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Fund covers up to 50% of ecological restoration costs on Federal lands selected for restoration projects. The Fund includes appropriated amounts and interest earned on investments. The Treasury transfers funds to the Secretaries upon request for project expenditures. The Secretary of the Treasury transfers funds from the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Fund to the Secretaries for ecological restoration treatments. The Secretaries establish an accounting system for the Fund and authorize $40,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2008 to 2018. Program implementation and monitoring include the development of a work plan within 180 days. Program Implementation and Monitoring: Within 180 days of selecting a collaborative forest landscape restoration proposal, the Secretaries will create an implementation work plan and budget in collaboration with interested parties. This plan will detail how the proposal will be executed to achieve ecological and community economic benefits. The proposal aims to achieve ecological and community economic benefits through capacity building for restoration. It includes a business plan addressing cost reductions, infrastructure needs, and sustainability of woody biomass supply. The proposal includes a plan for ecological restoration treatments using woody biomass and small-diameter trees, as well as projected local economic benefits. Non-Federal investments in the priority landscape are also documented. Amounts from the Fund will be used for restoration treatments consistent with landscape restoration goals. The Secretaries from the Fund will carry out ecological restoration treatments consistent with the landscape restoration proposal and identified through a collaborative process. An annual report will be prepared on the accomplishments of each selected collaborative forest landscape restoration proposal, detailing the treated and restored acres. The restoration proposal includes a description of treated and restored acres, progress evaluation with performance measures, community benefits achieved, and results of the monitoring process. The Secretaries will use a multiparty monitoring process to assess the effects of collaborative forest landscape restoration projects, including costs of treatments and fire management activities. The Secretaries will submit a report every 5 years on the collaborative forest landscape restoration projects' effects and fulfillment of the program's purposes to specific Senate committees. The Secretaries will submit a report every 5 years on the collaborative forest landscape restoration projects' effects and fulfillment of the program's purposes to specific Senate and House committees."
