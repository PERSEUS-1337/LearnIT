    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Environmental Justice Enforcement Act of 2006\". The Act, known as the \"Environmental Justice Enforcement Act of 2006,\" is necessary due to a Supreme Court decision in Alexander v. Sandoval that weakens statutory protections against discrimination established by Congress over almost four decades. The decision undermines these protections by denying victims of discrimination the right to seek redress in Federal court. The Sandoval decision undermines the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by casting doubt on regulations and attacking settled expectations created by Title VI to prevent discrimination in programs using Federal funds. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 aimed to prevent discrimination in programs receiving Federal funds by prohibiting activities that discriminated based on race, color, or national origin. Regulations under Title VI ensured broad protections for beneficiaries and forbade discriminatory criteria or methods of administration. The regulations under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibit discrimination and retaliation against individuals participating in discrimination charges. These regulations, drafted by executive branch officials, have never been invalidated despite a proposal by Congress in 1966. Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 aimed to benefit those facing discrimination and relied on private attorneys for enforcement. The Supreme Court has upheld regulations under Title VI, indicating congressional intent. Compliance was acknowledged to require more than just enforcement actions. The Supreme Court has affirmed that individuals facing discrimination under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 have a private right of action in Federal courts for effective protection of the law. This right was deemed necessary despite not being explicitly stated in the statute. (Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, 390 U.S. 400 (1968); Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677 (1979)) Congress and the Courts have recognized an implied right of action under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, despite the Supreme Court's decision in Cort v. Ash to require explicit statutory statements. Congress has provided means for enforcing the statutes, including establishing a right to attorney's fees in 1972. In 1972, Congress established a right to attorney's fees in private actions brought under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Supreme Court had no basis in law or legislative history in Sandoval for denying a right of action under regulations promulgated pursuant to title VI while permitting it under the statute. The regulations under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 were congressionally mandated to effectuate antidiscrimination provisions, stressing their importance by requiring approval from the President. Regulations prohibiting discriminatory practices are consistent with prohibitions of disparate treatment that require intent. The effect of discrimination is in line with prohibitions of disparate treatment that require intent, as recognized by the Supreme Court in cases such as Griggs v. Duke Power Co. (1971) and Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Hous. Dev. Corp. (1977). The Supreme Court has recognized in cases like Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Hous. Dev. Corp. (1977) that an invidious purpose can be inferred from the totality of relevant facts, including disparate impact on one race. The interpretation of title VI of the Civil Rights Act is crucial in addressing intentional discrimination. The interpretation of title VI of the Civil Rights Act prohibits practices with disparate impact not justified to achieve program goals, as reinforced by enforcing title VII. Congress reinstated the disparate impact standard in the Civil Rights Act of 1991, ensuring entities are not unfairly accused of discrimination under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The legal standard for disparate impact claims does not allow discrimination findings based solely on numerical imbalances. The disparate impact claim does not allow discrimination findings based solely on numerical imbalances. A private right of action is necessary to ensure individuals have a remedy if denied equal access to various opportunities. Individuals must have a remedy if denied equal access to education, housing, health, and other services due to discriminatory practices under title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Courts have dismissed claims challenging unjustified discriminatory effects following the Supreme Court's decision in Sandoval. Maintaining a private right of action is crucial for addressing discrimination. The right to maintain a private right of action under a provision added to title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 will be effectuated by waiving sovereign immunity. SEC. 3. PROHIBITED DISCRIMINATION. Section 601 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is amended to include provisions regarding discrimination based on disparate impact. An aggrieved person must demonstrate that a covered entity has a policy or practice causing a disparate impact on race, color, or national origin. The covered entity must show that a policy causing disparate impact is necessary for nondiscriminatory goals or the aggrieved person can demonstrate a less discriminatory alternative policy exists. The covered entity must demonstrate that a policy causing disparate impact is necessary for nondiscriminatory goals or the aggrieved person can show a less discriminatory alternative policy exists. The aggrieved person must show that each challenged policy causes a disparate impact, unless the decision-making process cannot be separated for analysis. The covered entity must demonstrate that a policy causing disparate impact is necessary for nondiscriminatory goals. If the entity shows that a specific policy does not cause disparate impact, it is not required to prove it is necessary for its goals. Demonstrating necessity of a policy cannot be used as a defense against intentional discrimination claims. In the United States, no person shall face discrimination or retaliation for opposing a prohibited policy, making a charge, or participating in an investigation under this title. The term 'demonstrates' in this context means meeting burdens of production and persuasion. SEC. 4. RIGHTS OF ACTION. Amends Section 602 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to allow any person aggrieved by a covered entity's failure to comply with the title to bring a civil action in Federal or State court. SEC. 5. RIGHT OF RECOVERY. Amends Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to provide for the right of recovery after section 602. SEC. 5. RIGHT OF RECOVERY. Amends Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to provide for the right of recovery for aggrieved persons. In an action brought under this title against a covered entity for intentional discrimination, the aggrieved person may recover equitable and legal relief, attorney's fees, and costs. Punitive damages are not available against government entities. In an action brought under this title against a covered entity for unlawful discrimination based on disparate impact, the aggrieved person may recover equitable relief, attorney's fees, and costs. SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act and its amendments are retroactive to April 24, 2001, and apply to all actions pending on or after that date, except for actions against a State under the disparate impact standard, which have the effective date of the Act's enactment."
