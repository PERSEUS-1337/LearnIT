    "content": "Services are a diverse group of economic activities that involve the provision of human value-added in various forms. They are intangible, cannot be stored, and must be consumed at the point of production. Rapid changes in technology are reducing these restrictions on services. The service sector in the U.S. economy is diverse and includes wholesale and retail trade, transportation, information, banking, professional services, education, healthcare, construction, communication, and public administration. In 2010, services accounted for 83% of nonagricultural payroll jobs in the U.S. The service sector is a significant part of the U.S. economy, accounting for 83% of nonagricultural payroll jobs in 2010 and 65% of GDP. Financial services play a crucial role in capital flow, while delivery services are essential for ensuring goods availability. Delivery services are crucial for ensuring goods availability in the economy, with distribution services providing means for goods to reach consumers. U.S. trade in services, while smaller than trade in goods, accounted for 30% of total U.S. exports and 17% of total U.S. imports in 2010. Inefficiencies in these industries could have adverse consequences for the economy. In 2010, services accounted for 30% of total U.S. exports and 17% of total U.S. imports. Service providers often establish a presence in the country of the consumer for direct contact. Cross-border services trade data may not capture all service transactions. In 2008, U.S. firms sold $1,137 billion in services to foreigners through their majority-owned foreign affiliates, while foreign firms sold U.S. residents $727 billion in services through their majority-owned foreign affiliates located in the United States. Foreign firms sold $727 billion in services to U.S. residents through their majority-owned foreign affiliates in the United States, compared to $366 billion in cross-border imports. Multilateral negotiations in services trade began over a quarter century ago. The seeds for multilateral negotiations in services trade were planted over a quarter century ago, with a push for an agreement on trade in services under GATT. Developing countries were hesitant due to less advanced service sectors. During the Uruguay Round negotiations in 1986, services were included in international trade rules with the creation of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) and the World Trade Organization (WTO). Trade scholar Geza Feketekuty highlights three main challenges in establishing rules for international trade in services. Trade scholar Geza Feketekuty outlines challenges in creating rules for international trade in services, including targeting domestic regulations as barriers, distinguishing legitimate regulations from protectionism, and considering services transactions behind customs borders. Technology advances, like the internet, present an additional challenge. The challenges in creating rules for international trade in services include targeting domestic regulations as barriers, distinguishing legitimate regulations from protectionism, and considering services transactions behind customs borders. Technology advances, such as the internet, have made once non-tradable services tradable and led to the rapid introduction of services products that can be \"outsourced\" across borders. These challenges suggest the need for flexible yet disciplined rules for WTO members' activities. The GATS recognizes that most services transactions occur within borders, with barriers inside customs barriers. Trade rules must consider different modes of delivery to identify barriers for foreign service providers. The GATS categorizes delivery modes into four, with concessions in opening services markets being mode-dependent. The GATS recognizes that services transactions mostly occur within borders, with barriers inside customs barriers. Concessions in opening services markets are mode-dependent, with four modes of delivery identified. One mode is cross-border supply, where services are supplied from one country to another. Another mode is consumption abroad, where the consumer physically travels to another country to obtain the service. The GATS identifies four modes of delivery for services transactions, including cross-border supply, consumption abroad, commercial presence, and presence of natural persons. These modes involve different ways in which services are provided across borders or within a foreign country. The GATS is a multilateral framework of principles and rules for trade in services among 153 WTO members. It aims to promote economic development, liberalize trade, preserve governments' right to regulate services, and support developing countries. The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) is a multilateral framework among 153 WTO members that aims to promote economic development, liberalize trade, and preserve governments' right to regulate services sectors. It is divided into six parts, with Part I defining its scope and application to all services except those under government authority. Part II outlines principles and obligations for all services sectors. Part II of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) presents principles and obligations that apply to all services sectors, regardless of whether they are listed in a member's schedule of commitments. These include most-favored-nation treatment, transparency, and impartial administration. Part II of the GATS outlines principles such as transparency, impartial administration, and obligations for monopoly suppliers. It also includes exceptions for balance of payments difficulties and national security. Part III establishes market access and national treatment obligations for members. The GATS Part III establishes market access and national treatment obligations for members, binding each member to its commitments and prohibiting less favorable treatment. It also prohibits member-country governments from placing limits on suppliers of services from other member countries. The GATS Part III establishes market access and national treatment obligations for members, ensuring fair treatment for service providers from other member countries. This includes the type of legal entity or joint venture for services, share of foreign capital, and the ability to negotiate further reductions in trade barriers. The GATS Part III imposes market access and national treatment obligations on service providers, applying only to listed services and modes of delivery in each member's schedule of commitments. This positive list approach excludes services sectors not included in the schedule. Each member's commitments are detailed in an annex to the GATS. The GATS Part III imposes market access and national treatment obligations on service providers for listed services and modes of delivery in each member's schedule of commitments. Parts IV-VI require new negotiations to expand coverage and handle conflicts in the WTO's dispute settlement mechanism. The GATS also includes annexes on MFN exemptions and financial services. The GATS includes annexes on MFN exemptions, financial services, transportation services, telecommunication services, maritime services, and mode-4 delivery. Negotiations on financial services, telecommunication services, maritime services, and mode-4 delivery were to continue as signatories determined negotiations had not been completed. The GATS stipulated negotiations on financial services, telecommunication services, maritime services, and mode-4 delivery. Agreements were reached on basic telecommunications in February 1997 and financial services in December 1997. Negotiations on mode-4 ended in July 1995 with few results, while negotiations on maritime services ended in June 1996 without conclusion. Commitments made by WTO members on national treatment and market access in specific service sectors are a significant part of their obligations. The commitments made by WTO members on national treatment and market access in specific service sectors are a major part of their obligations under the GATS. Each member is required to submit a schedule of commitments (SC) during negotiations, which is compared to tariff schedules. The SC in the GATS contains commitments on market access and national treatment for specific service sectors. The schedule is more complex than tariff schedules, divided into four columns listing sector/subsector, restrictions on market access, restrictions on national treatment, and any additional commitments made by the member. The GATS schedule lists restrictions on national treatment for each mode of delivery, along with additional commitments made by the member. It is divided into two parts: horizontal commitments that apply to all service sectors, and sector-specific commitments. The documents are lengthy as each service sector and subsector must be identified for trade liberalization commitments, including exceptions on market access and national treatment. The WTO member must identify service sectors and subsectors for trade liberalization commitments, including exceptions on market access and national treatment for each mode of delivery. The negotiations aim to reform GATS rules, expand commitments, and reduce limitations on national treatment and market access. This section explores the evolution, structure, and status of the current negotiations. The current negotiations aim to reform GATS rules, expand commitments, and reduce limitations on national treatment and market access. It examines the evolution, structure, and status of the negotiations, including U.S. goals and those of other major trading partners. The negotiators acknowledged the need to maintain momentum in service negotiations after the Uruguay Round, leading to new negotiations on services as part of the WTO \"built-in agenda.\" The GATS mandates new negotiations on services within five years of its entry into force as part of the WTO \"built-in agenda.\" Issues to be addressed include special treatment for least developed countries, government subsidies, emergency safeguard measures, and government procurement in services trade. These negotiations began in 2000. The new services negotiations under the GATS began in 2000 but progressed slowly due to political climate. In March 2001, the WTO's Council for Trade in Services approved guidelines for the current negotiations, focusing on progressive liberalization of trade in services. The guidelines for the GATS negotiations focus on progressive liberalization of trade in services, covering all service sectors and modes of delivery. Negotiations are conducted in special sessions of the Council for Trade in Services, open to all WTO members and acceding countries. Safeguards measures negotiations were extended to the end of the DDA. The GATS negotiations focus on progressive liberalization of trade in services, conducted in special sessions of the Council for Trade in Services. Special attention is given to the special needs of developing countries. Modalities were adopted on September 3, 2003, including negotiating credit for autonomous liberalization. The WTO members successfully launched the DDA in November 2001 after a false start in Seattle. The Ministerial Declaration folded services negotiation into the DDA round agenda, reaffirming guidelines from March 2001 with added deadlines to spur negotiators. The DDA round mandates included deadlines to push negotiators to submit requests for market access and national treatment commitments by June 30, 2002, and offers of commitments by March 31, 2003. The services negotiations stalled as deadlines passed, leading to potential collapse of the DDA negotiations after disagreements at the September 2003 Ministerial in Cancun. After disagreements at the September 2003 Ministerial in Cancun, WTO members forged a negotiating framework in July 2004 to put the round back on track. The framework reaffirmed the mandates from the Doha Ministerial Declaration and charged negotiators to submit initial offers promptly, revise offers by May 2005, and ensure high-quality offers. The DDA negotiators were urged to submit initial offers promptly, revise offers by May 2005, and ensure high-quality offers in response to complaints from WTO officials. Services were mentioned briefly in the July framework, placing them on par with negotiations on agriculture and market access for non-agricultural goods. Negotiations on rules are conducted by working groups of interested members. The negotiations on national treatment and market access commitments in the WTO involve working groups of representatives from interested members. Each member submits a \"wish-list\" or \"request\" for commitments from other members, followed by offers and negotiations until a consensus is reached on acceptable commitments. The WTO services negotiations involve negotiations on commitment offers among members through bilateral, plurilateral, and multilateral discussions. The final agreements must be accepted by all members to become part of the GATS, with negotiations ongoing for over five years. Negotiations in WTO services have been ongoing for over five years, facing delays and disagreements. In 2006, Director-General Pascal Lamy suspended the DDA negotiations, including services, due to disagreements on agriculture trade modalities. Negotiations resumed in 2007 but have yet to reach a draft text agreement. Negotiations for the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) Round have been ongoing since 2007. The United States and chief trading partners have been working to establish basic elements of a draft text, but consensus on negotiating objectives has not been reached. The US outlined its goals for the DDA negotiations in July 2002, derived from earlier sessions. The US outlined its goals for the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) negotiations in July 2002, derived from consultations with service industry representatives. The main goal is to secure market access commitments from trading partners, with a focus on liberalizing existing market environments. The Uruguay Round saw reluctance from WTO members to commit to maintaining market openness at existing levels. The US urged countries to increase bindings to prevent slippage. Government regulation in services trade is more prevalent than in manufactured goods trade, with GATS rules recognizing the need for regulation to ensure consumer health and safety. Government regulation in the services sector is essential to ensure consumer health and safety. Different agencies regulate various service sectors, with some being overseen by central or regional authorities. Service providers, both domestic and foreign, must be familiar with regulations to conduct business effectively. US service providers have raised concerns about the lack of transparency in regulations. U.S. service providers face challenges due to lack of transparency in regulations, hindering foreign trade in services. The United States urges WTO members to establish clear, publicly available domestic procedures for licensing and informing the public of regulatory changes. The United States urges WTO members to establish clear, publicly available domestic procedures for informing the public of regulations and providing opportunities for input from interested parties. U.S. negotiators seek commitments to eliminate unnecessary restrictions on foreign direct investment across all sectors. The United States is urging WTO members to commit to eliminating unnecessary restrictions on foreign direct investment across all sectors, including in financial services such as insurance, banking, and securities. They are also requesting transparency and fairness in financial services regulations. The United States is pushing for increased market access and commitments in various sectors, including telecommunications, insurance, and road freight transport. They are also advocating for transparency and fairness in financial services regulations. The United States is requesting increased market access for various services, including road freight transport and express delivery. They are also addressing the issue of cross-subsidization in express delivery services. The United States is seeking increased market access for various services, including energy conservation, anti-pollution, and environmental protection services. They are also requesting commitments from trading partners regarding third-party access to energy transportation facilities. The United States is requesting increased market access for various services related to environmental protection, including wastewater treatment, waste management, and biodiversity conservation. They are also seeking full market access for retail, wholesale, and franchising services, including remote delivery through catalogues, videos, or electronic sales. Additionally, the U.S. is requesting access for higher education, training, and testing services in universities and schools. The United States is requesting increased market access for various services related to environmental protection, retail, wholesale, and franchising services, including remote delivery through catalogues, videos, or electronic sales. ETS includes higher education, training services, and testing services provided in universities and schools, as well as in work places. Training services include job-related courses. The U.S. requests for commitments to increased market access do not aim to replace public education. The United States has asked that trading partners increase market access for foreign lawyers, accounts, and other providers of professional services by removing citizenship requirements for licensing, restrictions on foreign ownership, and restrictions on form of organization. The United States is requesting increased market access for various services, including computer consulting, software development, data processing, systems integration, maintenance services, audiovisual, and advertising services. They are asking for the removal of citizenship requirements for licensing, restrictions on foreign ownership, and restrictions on form of organization. The initial offer of proposed commitments was presented on March 31, 2003. The United States presented initial and revised offers for increased market access in various services, including audiovisual and advertising services. The offers would commit the U.S. to maintain national treatment and market access for foreign service providers without reducing current trade liberalization levels. The United States defends its offers for increased market access in various services, stating that its services markets are already open and competitive. However, not all U.S. WTO-trading partners have been as positive about the offers, which include commitments to maintain current trade liberalization levels. The U.S. offers include horizontal commitments that apply to all sectors and subsectors listed in the schedule of commitments. These commitments cover temporary entry of personnel, with specific groups allowed entry for up to 90 days. Some U.S. WTO-trading partners have not been as positive about these offers. The United States allows temporary entry for various personnel, including sales persons, inter-corporate transferees, personnel establishing a business entity, fashion models, and service providers in specialty occupations. Additionally, personnel engaged in land acquisition in scheduled services sectors can also enter temporarily. The United States allows temporary entry for personnel engaged in land acquisition in scheduled services sectors. Foreigners providing scheduled services are taxed similarly to U.S. residents, with some exceptions. The U.S. has offered scheduled commitments in various sectors such as business services, accounting, taxation, and engineering. The United States has offered commitments in various services sectors, including professional services, accounting, taxation, and architectural and engineering services. WTO members must identify exceptions for each delivery mode and sector. Exceptions for business services mostly involve state restrictions on foreign service providers. Additionally, the U.S. has offered commitments in market research, management consulting, computer services, and real estate services. The United States has made commitments in various services sectors including market research, management consulting, computer services, real estate services, agriculture, telecommunication, wholesale and retail trade, higher education, environmental services, financial services, health and social services, travel and tourism, transportation services, and energy. The United States has made commitments in various services sectors including market research, management consulting, computer services, real estate services, agriculture, telecommunication, wholesale and retail trade, higher education, environmental services, financial services, health and social services, travel and tourism, transportation services, and energy. Developing countries criticize the U.S. for not offering broader commitments, especially in maritime and postal services. India criticizes the U.S. for limited offers under mode-4 delivery, arguing for access for software specialists and IT engineers not directly affiliated with Indian-owned firms in the U.S. The negotiations for mode-4 delivery in the DDA have faced delays, with deadlines for procedural steps being rescheduled. The negotiating format and underlying challenges have been cited as reasons for the slow progress. Negotiators in the DDA face challenges with the \"request-offer\" format. The US and EU proposed sector benchmarks for commitments, with the US suggesting six core sectors and the EU advocating for a smaller list. These proposals were met with strong opposition. The US and EU proposed sector benchmarks for commitments in the DDA negotiations, facing strong opposition from developing countries. Developing countries argued that the \"benchmark\" proposals were too late and favored sectors preferred by developed countries. Some developing countries opposed sector benchmarks proposed by the US and EU, fearing they would favor sectors preferred by developed countries. The US services business community expressed concerns that focusing on benchmarks could cause delays in negotiations. Canada, supported by the US and other developed countries, suggested changes to the negotiating process to accelerate progress in services negotiations. The proposal to change the sequencing of negotiations in agriculture and non-agricultural issues has been rejected by developing countries. The positive list approach for market access commitments has also faced criticism for potentially discouraging market participation. The positive list approach for market access commitments has been criticized for potentially discouraging market participation, as it may disincentivize market access liberalization. The United States prefers the \"negative list\" approach in free trade agreements. The United States prefers the \"negative list\" approach in free trade agreements, particularly in services negotiations. Mode-4 delivery, temporary entry of supply personnel, has become a controversial issue dividing developed and developing countries. Developing countries criticize the U.S. over mode-4, creating tension between the U.S. business community and government, despite its minimal impact on world trade. Mode-4 delivery, pertaining to the supply of services through the presence of natural persons in another country, has caused tension between the U.S. business community and government. Despite accounting for less than 1% of world trade in services, mode-4 is controversial due to its connection to immigration policy and the tightening of restrictions post-9/11. Mode-4 delivery involves supplying services through natural persons in another country. Developing countries criticize the U.S. for limited mode-4 commitments, especially regarding visa restrictions on temporary workers. India calls for more transparency in U.S. policies. The U.S. faces criticism for visa restrictions on temporary workers entering the country, with calls for greater transparency in immigration regulations. Congressional committees objected to changes in visa policies allowing more workers to enter during consideration of trade agreements in 2003. The Judiciary Committee objected to changes in U.S. visa policies allowing more workers to enter the country during trade agreement considerations in 2003. Compromises were made to separate the two bills for voting, with bipartisan warnings against including visa policy changes in trade agreements. The U.S. business community argues for more flexibility in visa offers to avoid negotiation stalls. The United States is urged to be more flexible in its mode-4 offers to progress negotiations with developing countries. Business groups suggest alternative options. Little progress has been made on establishing rules for subsidies and emergency safeguard measures in services, which are a priority for East Asian developing countries. Basic questions remain unresolved, such as defining countervailable subsidies and measuring import surges. Negotiators have struggled to resolve key questions on countervailable subsidies, import surge measurements, and government procurement. Services negotiations have not advanced significantly in over a decade, with many WTO members, especially developing countries, offering little change from previous commitments. The best offers made so far are deemed inadequate. The study shows that WTO members' offers in services negotiations are 1.9 times more restrictive than actual policies, indicating a lack of commitment to openness. WTO Director-General Pascal Lamy suspended the DDA, including services negotiations, in 2006, after G-6 WTO members' meeting. Pascal Lamy suspended the DDA, including services negotiations, indefinitely in 2006 after G-6 WTO members failed to agree on conditions. Progress on services negotiations has been slow, with developed and developing countries divided. The lack of progress in services negotiations in the DDA is due to the division between developed and developing countries. Developed countries are more open to market competition, while developing countries are protective of their domestic providers. The slow progress is also hindered by issues in agriculture and NAMA negotiations. Developing countries are waiting for the US and EU to reduce agriculture subsidies before improving their offers. Some developing countries are holding back on improving their offers in services negotiations until the US and EU reduce agriculture subsidies. Developed countries are seeking commitments from developing nations to reduce the \"water\" in their commitments, which is the difference between bound and actual market liberalization levels. The complexity of the services negotiations and the variety of players involved are also contributing factors. Services negotiations face challenges due to the diverse range of economic activities involved, each with unique trade barriers. Participants include trade ministers and regulatory agencies, making evaluation of prospects difficult. Negotiations often stall until crucial deadlines, with outcomes dependent on various factors. Negotiations in services face challenges due to diverse economic activities with unique trade barriers. Completion depends on political will, willingness to compromise, and resolution of issues in agriculture and market access. Services negotiations were discussed at WTO trade meetings in December 2005. At the sixth WTO Ministerial in Hong Kong in December 2005, trade ministers aimed to accelerate DDA negotiations by resolving issues in agriculture and market access. The Hong Kong Ministerial Declaration reaffirmed commitment to completing services negotiations with special consideration for developing countries. Annex C provided modalities for the negotiations. At the WTO Ministerial in Hong Kong in December 2005, trade ministers aimed to accelerate DDA negotiations by resolving issues in agriculture and market access. Annex C to the Declaration provided modalities for completing the negotiations. In September 2007, the chairman of the trade in services negotiations began developing a draft text of an agreement, but by the end of the year, countries were still divided on basic objectives. Developed countries, like the United States, pushed for binding commitments on trade in services, while developing countries, such as Argentina, opposed such benchmarks. In July 2008, WTO General Director Lamy called a ministerial meeting in Geneva to hammer out modalities for agriculture and NAMA negotiations. A \"signaling\" conference was held with 32 representatives, including the US and EU, to assess offers and expectations in trade negotiations. The conference in 2008 aimed to assess offers and expectations in trade negotiations among 32 representatives, including the US and EU. However, little progress was made in moving the negotiations forward in subsequent years due to limited results in cluster meetings and reluctance to go beyond current levels of liberalization. The 2008 conference aimed to assess trade negotiations progress among 32 representatives, including the US and EU. Limited progress was made due to reluctance to go beyond current levels of liberalization, as highlighted by Senator Charles Grassley's concerns about the stalled Doha services negotiations."
