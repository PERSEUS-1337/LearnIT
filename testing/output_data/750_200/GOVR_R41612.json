Critics argue that this has reduced the country's capacity to provide assistance. President Obama made alleviating global hunger a top priority during his administration. President Obama made alleviating global hunger a top priority during his administration, pledging $3.5 billion over three years for the Feed the Future initiative to promote agricultural development and food security, especially for vulnerable populations. Some argue for reform of American food aid and foreign assistance to improve food security and nutrition, especially for vulnerable populations like women and children. There is a call for more innovative approaches with increased local buy-in and engagement. A new U.S. global food security initiative should adopt innovative approaches with increased local buy-in and engagement from the private sector to effectively achieve humanitarian objectives. Interagency reviews of development and foreign assistance policies will be relevant to Congress for funding and oversight of agricultural development programs. The U.S. global food security initiative is funded and overseen by Congress through various U.S. agencies and international organizations. Congress influences the initiative through annual appropriations and may consider legislation to authorize and fund its aspects. Legislation for this purpose was introduced in the 111th Congress. The 112th Congress may consider legislation to authorize and fund aspects of the food security initiative, building on similar efforts in the previous Congress. Bills introduced in the 111th Congress aimed to increase support for agricultural development, international agriculture research, and food security safety net assistance. Additionally, legislation to revise the authorizing statute for U.S. foreign assistance could impact the global food security initiative. Given the change in House leadership and the federal budget deficit, the prospects for increased funding for U.S. foreign assistance are uncertain. The prospects for consideration of increases to U.S. foreign assistance funding for the global food security initiative are uncertain due to the change in House leadership and the federal budget deficit situation. The primary objectives of the report include providing a context for food insecurity worldwide, overviewing the Obama Administration's Feed the Future initiative, and discussing issues that the 112th Congress may consider regarding agricultural development and global food security. The global food security situation worsened in 2009, with over 1 billion people undernourished. The number of chronically hungry individuals is estimated to be 925 million in 2010, down from 1.023 billion in 2009. This was a result of food price and economic crises. The number of undernourished people globally decreased to 925 million in 2010 from 1.023 billion in 2009. This decline followed a period of steady increase in hunger over the past decade, despite a previous decrease in the 1980s and 1990s attributed to increased agricultural investment. However, between 1995-1997 and 2004-2006, hunger rose in all regions except Latin America and the Caribbean due to a decline in official development assistance for agriculture. The decline in official development assistance for agriculture led to an increase in hunger globally, except in Latin America and the Caribbean. Despite progress in reducing hunger, recent food and economic crises have reversed the declining trend. The proportion of hungry people in the world dropped from about 20% in the early 1990s to about 16% in the mid-2000s, but current estimates show a reversal of this trend. The proportion of hungry people in the world dropped from about 20% in the early 1990s to about 16% in the mid-2000s, but rose a percentage point in 2008. The U.N. Secretary General suggests progress in meeting the MDGs of reducing hunger, alleviating poverty, and improving health for the world's poor has slowed or even reversed. The majority of the world's undernourished live in developing countries, with Asia and the Pacific having 578 million people suffering from chronic undernourishment, sub-Saharan Africa with 239 million, Latin America and the Caribbean with 53 million, and the Near East with 37 million. In Asia and the Pacific, 578 million people suffer from chronic undernourishment, 239 million in sub-Saharan Africa, 53 million in Latin America and the Caribbean, 37 million in the Near East and North Africa, and 19 million in developed countries. The global hunger figure in 2010 decreased by 9.6% from 2009, with Asia showing the most significant reduction. Sub-Saharan Africa saw a smaller drop, with about 12 million fewer people going hungry in 2010. Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest rates of food insecurity in the world, with one out of three people undernourished. Two-thirds of the world's undernourished population live in seven countries. The 2010 Global Health Index shows improvements in reducing hunger, with varying progress across regions and countries. The Global Health Index (GHI) scores have decreased significantly in various regions since 1990, with a 14% decrease in sub-Saharan Africa, 25% in South Asia, and 33% in the Near East and North Africa. Southeast Asia and Latin America saw even greater progress, with GHI scores decreasing by 40% or more. South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa have the highest regional GHI scores, but South Asia has made more progress since 1990. The causes of hunger differ between these regions, with factors such as low nutritional, educational, and social status of women contributing to high hunger levels in South Asia. According to a think tank, the causes of hunger in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa differ. In South Asia, low nutritional, educational, and social status of women contribute to underweight children under five. In contrast, in sub-Saharan Africa, factors like low government effectiveness, conflict, political instability, and high rates of HIV and AIDS lead to high child mortality and food insecurity. Most countries with high GHI scores are in these regions, where progress in reducing hunger has been slower compared to Latin America. Countries in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia have high Global Hunger Index (GHI) scores, with slow progress in reducing hunger compared to Latin America. Few countries achieved a 50% reduction in GHI scores over the past decades. Conflict and political instability have worsened hunger in countries like The Democratic Republic of Congo and Burundi. According to IFPRI, conflict and political instability have increased hunger in countries like The Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi, Comoros, Guinea-Bissau, and Liberia. In Swaziland, high prevalence of HIV and AIDS, coupled with high inequality, has undermined food security. In the Gambia, undernourishment rose due to lower social protection spending. In Zimbabwe, economic collapse has led to more underweight children and child mortality. The economic collapse in Zimbabwe has increased child mortality and underweight children. Some countries like Angola, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mozambique, Nicaragua, and Vietnam have made significant progress in improving their Global Hunger Index scores. President Obama made global hunger a top priority during his administration. President Obama prioritized alleviating global hunger during his administration, pledging $3.5 billion over three years at the G8 Summit in Italy. The Global Partnership for Agriculture and Food Security was launched to mobilize $20 billion to combat hunger and poverty. The G8 summit committed to mobilizing $20 billion over three years for a food security initiative, focusing on sustainable production and rural economic growth. Key principles include supporting comprehensive strategies, country-owned plans, donor coordination, leveraging multilateral institutions, and delivering accountable commitments. Social protection mechanisms like safety nets are also emphasized. The G8 leaders pledged sustainable funding to enhance world production capacity and reverse the trend of decreasing official development assistance for agriculture, supporting country and regional agricultural strategies. The G8 leaders pledged sustainable funding to enhance world production capacity and reverse the trend of decreasing official development assistance (ODA) funding for agriculture. The initiative aims to support the implementation of country and regional agricultural strategies through country-led coordination processes, in line with the Accra Agenda for Action (AAA) which focuses on reforming development aid practices. Developing countries commit to taking control of their futures through country-led strategies, while donors pledge to coordinate better among themselves. The G8 leaders have committed to sustainable funding for agriculture to support country-led strategies. The Comprehensive Africa Agricultural Development Program (CAADP) under NEPAD focuses on improving food security and increasing incomes for smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa. CAADP, part of NEPAD under the AU, aims to improve food security, nutrition, and increase smallholder farmers' incomes by raising agricultural productivity by 6% annually and increasing public investment in agriculture to 10% of national budgets. The L'Aqulia declaration aligns with the U.N. High Level Task Force on Global Food Security Crisis to address rising global food prices. The Comprehensive Framework for Action (CFA) was established in April 2008 by U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon to address the global food price challenge. It proposed immediate actions for vulnerable populations and longer-term strategies for global food security, including enhancing emergency food assistance, supporting smallholder farmers, adjusting trade policies, and expanding social protection systems. The CFA proposed immediate actions for vulnerable populations and longer-term strategies for global food security, including expanding social protection systems and developing an international biofuels consensus. The G20 Summit endorsed the L'Aquila food security initiative and called for a World Bank Food Security Trust Fund to finance investments in agricultural productivity in low-income countries. At the G20 Summit, countries pledged $2 billion to support the Global Partnership for agricultural productivity in low-income countries. The United States collaborated with private sector actors for food security efforts. FAO convened a World Summit on Food Security in Rome with global leaders in attendance. At a World Summit on Food Security in Rome, global leaders endorsed the Global Partnership to reduce hunger by half by 2015. FAO reported the need for a 70% increase in agricultural output to feed a growing population expected to reach 9 billion by 2050. The U.S. State Department issued a Global Hunger and Food Security Initiative (GHFSI) Consultation Document in 2009, leading to the launch of the \"Feed the Future\" (FtF) Initiative in 2010 to address the need for a 70% increase in agricultural output to feed a growing population expected to reach 9 billion by 2050. The \"Feed the Future\" (FtF) Initiative, launched in 2010, released a new guiding strategy document and implementation documents developed through a consultative process with various stakeholders. The initiative builds on principles for sustainable food security and mentions three cross-cutting priorities. The \"Feed the Future\" (FtF) Initiative, launched in 2010, focuses on accelerating inclusive agriculture sector growth and improving nutritional status in specific countries. It emphasizes interventions to improve agricultural productivity and expand markets for agricultural commodities. The \"Feed the Future\" (FtF) Initiative aims to enhance agricultural productivity, expand markets, and develop policies and infrastructure to support smallholder farmers. Progress will be measured by changes in agricultural production and income levels of rural farmers. Activities will vary by country based on their priorities. The FtF initiative focuses on country-owned plans to strengthen agriculture-nutrition links. It will coordinate with governments and partners to implement nutrition strategies based on specific needs. Progress will be measured by changes in child malnutrition rates. The FtF initiative aims to improve nutrition by measuring changes in child malnutrition rates. It will also invest in regional programs, the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program, partnerships with countries like Brazil, India, and China, and global research and innovation. Emergency and humanitarian food assistance will continue to be provided by the United States. The FtF initiative focuses on 20 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean, selected based on criteria including chronic hunger, agricultural-led growth potential, regional synergies, government commitment, and resource availability. The Feed the Future initiative focuses on 20 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean, selected based on criteria including chronic hunger, agricultural-led growth potential, regional synergies, government commitment, and resource availability. FtF investments will take place in two phases, with Phase 1 countries preparing their country investment plans (CIPs) through capacity-building, technical assistance, stakeholder consultations, and policy environment improvements. Phase 2 countries should have completed a CIP that includes priority areas, clear costing, financial projections, defined targets, beneficiary analysis, gender assessment, technical feasibility, and an implementation plan. They must also commit their own resources and establish a policy environment for agricultural development. Phase 2 countries must commit resources and establish a policy environment for agricultural development. The Administration's FY2011 budget request includes $1.64 billion for Feed the Future activities. The FY2011 budget request includes $1.64 billion for Feed the Future activities, which is about 3% of the total international affairs budget. The request for FtF activities is 40% greater than the estimated FY2010 allocations. The U.S. State Department notes that $200 million for nutrition activities are part of the food security effort but have been requested through the Global Health and Child Survival Account within the Global Health Initiative, not directly through FtF. The FY2011 budget request for Feed the Future activities is 40% greater than the estimated FY2010 allocations, with a significant portion allocated to a new multilateral trust fund for global food security at the World Bank. The FY2010 estimate does not include Haiti-related supplemental appropriations, which focus on emergency food aid and debt cancellation, not covered under Feed the Future framework. The Administration's FY2011 budget request for Feed the Future (FtF) represents only a portion of foreign assistance requested for food and agriculture activities. Additionally, for FY2011, the Administration is requesting an extra $4.2 billion for humanitarian and emergency assistance, including funds for Food for Peace Title II emergency and non-emergency food aid, Migration and Refugee Assistance, International Disaster Assistance, and Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance. These programs encompass activities related to food security. The FY2011 budget request includes funding for food and agriculture activities, as well as humanitarian and emergency assistance programs. There have been discussions about reforming U.S. foreign aid to better address national security challenges and development needs. Critics argue that current aid programs are ineffective, inefficient, and not aligned with national security interests or host country needs. The Obama Administration criticized U.S. aid programs as inefficient, uncoordinated, and not aligned with national security interests or host country needs. In response, the State Department launched the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR) in 2009 to reform U.S. development policy. The Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR) aimed to develop a whole-of-government approach to U.S. development policy. Led by the Secretary of State and Deputy Secretary for Management and Resources, the findings were released in a strategy document titled \"Leading Through Civilian Power\" on December 15, 2010. The QDDR outlined goals to elevate American \"civilian power\" to better advance national interests and be a stronger partner to the U.S. military. The QDDR aimed to elevate American \"civilian power\" to advance national interests and be a better partner to the U.S. military. It developed a statement of U.S. foreign policy and development objectives, recommended strategies, tools, resources, and organizational reforms. Additionally, the Administration launched a Presidential Study Directive on Global Development Policy (PSD-7) in August 2009 to review the roles of U.S. government agencies in global development. The U.S. government initiated a review of global development policy to assess the roles of government agencies and enhance the effectiveness of development policy. The process is led by key officials and focuses on questions regarding U.S. development policy objectives. A draft document titled \"A New Way Forward on Global Development\" was released in May 2010 as part of the review. The PSD review in May 2010 emphasized economic growth, democratic governance, and a new government structure to prioritize development in U.S. foreign policy. The QDDR will complement the PSD by assessing interagency coordination. The QDDR will contribute to the PSD by assessing how its results fit into broader interagency approaches and the Administration's foreign policy framework. The completion of the PSD-7 process has been delayed, and it is unclear if the final outputs will be made public. President Obama announced a new Presidential Policy Directive on Global Development in September 2010, emphasizing the importance of development in American power. Obama announced a new Presidential Policy Directive on Global Development, emphasizing the elevation of development as a core pillar of American power. The directive highlights Global Food Security, Climate Change, and Global Health as key development initiatives. The national security staff will coordinate interagency efforts to implement the directive starting with the FY2012 budget process. In November 2010, the USAID Administrator officially announced the establishment of... The USAID Administrator announced the establishment of a new Bureau for Food Security (BFS) to lead food security efforts and coordinate interagency efforts for President Obama's Feed the Future initiative. The BFS will work with the State Department, Millennium Challenge Corporation, USDA, and expand partnerships with the private sector and NGOs. The 112th Congress may face issues and policy options on agricultural development and global food security. The 112th Congress may address agricultural development, global food security, food aid, and U.S. foreign aid reform. The President pledged $3.5 billion over three years for the Global Agriculture and Food Security Partnership at the G8 Summit in 2009. Congress is considering FY2011 appropriations for agricultural development and food security within the Feed the Future Initiative. The House and Senate are considering FY2011 appropriations for agricultural development and food security within the Feed the Future Initiative. The House bill proposed $52.81 billion, $4 billion less than the Obama Administration request, with $1 billion allocated for food security and agricultural development. The Senate also approved a funding bill for State-Foreign Operations. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved a FY2011 State-Foreign Operations funding bill, S. 3676, with a proposed appropriation of $54.22 billion, $2.61 billion below the Administration's request. The bill included $1.3 billion for food security and agriculture development programs, $344 million less than the Administration's request. Congress did not pass any of the 12 regular appropriations bills for FY2011, instead enacting funding through continuing resolutions. The federal government did not enact any of the 12 regular appropriations bills for FY2011, funding was continued through continuing resolutions. The Administration's priorities and funding requests for food security and agricultural development may face additional debate due to the current fiscal situation and shift in congressional leadership. The G8 L'Aquila commitment to the Global Partnership stands at $22 billion over three years. The G8 L'Aquila commitment to the Global Partnership, totaling $22 billion over three years, faces skepticism in meeting pledges. The Global Agriculture and Food Security Program Trust Fund received $914 million in pledges but only $263 million in actual resources. Previous commitments, like the $50 billion aid pledge to sub-Saharan Africa, have fallen short by $15 billion. The G8 pledged $50 billion in development aid to sub-Saharan Africa by 2009, but is $15 billion short. Concerns have been raised about the lack of leadership at USAID, with key posts remaining unfilled. The Obama Administration faced criticism for delays in appointing USAID officials. Critics have raised concerns about key posts remaining unfilled at USAID, leading to a \"leadership vacuum\" that allows other federal agencies to take on development activities typically under USAID's jurisdiction. This divided approach has been questioned for potentially undermining USAID's authority and resources. The Center for Global Development criticizes USAID for being absent in key foreign policy challenges in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq. Concerns have been raised about the decline in staff capacity at USAID, with Secretary of Defense Robert Gates highlighting this issue in a 2009 article. In a 2009 article, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates highlighted the imbalance and lack of capacity in the United States' national security apparatus, attributing it to the consequences of the 1990s when key instruments of U.S. power abroad were reduced. The State Department froze hiring of Foreign Service officers and USAID saw a decline in staff capacity. The State Department froze hiring of new Foreign Service officers and USAID's staff capacity dropped significantly. In 1980, USAID had 2,000 permanent foreign officers, which decreased to about 1,000 by 2008. Currently, USAID only has two engineers, 16 agriculture experts, and 17 education experts, leading to concerns about the agency's on-the-ground effectiveness. Staff cuts at USAID have led to a significant reduction in capacity, with only two engineers, 16 agriculture experts, and 17 education experts remaining. This has resulted in the agency contracting out a large portion of its foreign aid program, leading to concerns about coherence, effectiveness, flexibility, and leverage with other funders. Since staff cuts at USAID, there has been a reduction in capacity, with limited expertise in agriculture and related technical areas. This has led to concerns about coherence, effectiveness, flexibility, and leverage with other funders. USAID has been actively working to rebuild its technical capacity by hiring additional agriculture foreign-service officers since the launch of the Feed the Future initiative. Since the 1990s, USAID has been rebuilding its technical capacity by hiring more agriculture foreign-service officers. Land-grant universities have played a role in international development efforts since the 1970s. Since the 1990s, USAID's focus on capacity building has declined, leading to reduced support for post-graduate training and agricultural research. This has weakened partner institutions in developing countries, despite acknowledging the importance of long-term institutional building for aid effectiveness. USAID has acknowledged the importance of long-term institutional building for aid effectiveness. However, questions remain about the funding, scope, and duration of USAID training and capacity-building programs, especially in agriculture. There are concerns about the institutional capacity in both the United States and developing countries, particularly in Africa, to effectively implement agricultural research and education. There are concerns about the institutional capacity in the United States and developing countries, particularly in Africa, to effectively implement agricultural research, education, training, and market development programs. USAID, the State Department, and USDA are involved in formulating policy and implementing agricultural development and food security assistance. U.S. agencies involved in agricultural development and food security assistance include USAID, State Department, USDA, MCC, Treasury Department, and USTR. Interagency coordination is crucial for effective provision of assistance, as highlighted in a report by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. The Chicago Council on Global Affairs highlighted the challenge of interagency coordination in foreign assistance, particularly in food aid and nutrition. They recommended creating an Interagency Council on Global Agriculture and a White House National Security Council deputy for global agriculture to ensure consistent priorities and actions among U.S. government agencies in this area. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) also issued reports on this issue. The Chicago Council recommended creating a White House National Security Council deputy for global agriculture to improve coordination in food aid and development assistance. The Government Accountability Office highlighted coordination problems between USDA, USAID, and the Millennium Development Corporation. The Feed the Future initiative aims for a \"whole-of-government\" approach, but some see challenges in interagency coordination and fragmentation across government agencies in U.S. food security efforts. The QDDR states that USAID will lead the Feed the Future initiative, but coordination with other U.S. government entities is unclear. Funding implications of a whole-of-government approach have not been clearly articulated. Bills in the 111th Congress also emphasize the need for interagency coordination in addressing global hunger. In the late 1990s, donors and aid agencies recognized the need for coordination to make international aid more effective and efficient. Bills in the 111th Congress highlighted the importance of interagency coordination in addressing global hunger, but it is uncertain if this will be a priority in the 112th Congress. The United States continues to work on harmonizing strategies and activities with other donors to enhance its role in addressing global hunger. The United States works with other donors to make international aid more effective and efficient through coordination and discussions. They play a leading role in international bodies like the United Nations, OECD's Development Assistance Committee, and collaborate with organizations such as the World Bank and African Development Bank. Global summits sponsored by the United Nations also contribute to donor coordination efforts. Global summits sponsored by the United Nations, like those in Rome in 2003, Paris in 2005, and Accra in 2008, play a crucial role in donor coordination and establishing international development goals. Donors have agreed to increase aid predictability and flexibility, aligning with other donors to enhance effectiveness. The United States aligns with other donors to enhance effectiveness in providing aid, including support for African-led initiatives like the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP). Some argue that aid reform is progressing too slowly. Some argue that the aid reform process is moving too slowly in multilateral forums like the Accra Agenda for Action. The United States is urged to prioritize foreign assistance activities aligned with its strategic and domestic interests, while ensuring country-led planning for program sustainability. Members of Congress have expressed concerns over these issues. Some Members of Congress have concerns about country-led planning in foreign assistance, as it may reduce donor control and oversight. There are worries that developing countries lack the capacity for robust strategic planning and accountability measures. Civil society sectors fear that government-led strategies may exclude their involvement. Some argue that country-led planning may shift to government-led strategies, potentially excluding civil society and private sector actors. Coordination lacks mention of U.S. food aid, despite its significant role in food security assistance. The Administration's FY2011 request includes $1.69 billion for Food for Peace Title II food aid. The Administration's FY2011 request includes $1.69 billion for Food for Peace Title II food aid, which is a significant part of food security assistance. Key questions arise regarding the coordination of U.S. commodity food aid with Feed the Future activities in focus countries and how food aid can support or potentially hinder the objectives of Feed the Future. The Feed the Future strategy emphasizes cross-cutting initiatives like gender, global health, environmental sustainability, and climate change. The Feed the Future strategy emphasizes cross-cutting initiatives such as gender, global health, environmental sustainability, and climate change. However, it is unclear how these issues will be integrated into country plans, the resources needed, progress tracking metrics, and coordination with other USG initiatives like PEPFAR and GCCI. The Administration is working on components of the Feed the Future results framework, but it is unclear which agency will be responsible for monitoring progress. It is also uncertain when results will be realized and if Feed the Future will help achieve MDG1 in the 20 countries involved. It is unclear over what time period results from the initiative will be realized, if Feed the Future will lead to achieving MDG1 in the 20 countries, and how often Congress will receive updates."
