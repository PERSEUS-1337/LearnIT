    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Paleontological Resources Preservation Act\" and includes definitions for various terms. The \"Paleontological Resources Preservation Act\" defines casual collecting as the non-commercial collection of common invertebrate and plant paleontological resources with minimal disturbance, determined by the Secretary. The term \"negligible disturbance\" is determined by the Secretary, who is either the Secretary of the Interior for lands under their control or the Secretary of Agriculture for National Forest System Lands. Federal lands refer to lands controlled or administered by the Secretary of the Interior, excluding Indian lands, or National Forest System lands controlled by the Secretary of Agriculture. The term \"Indian lands\" refers to lands of Indian tribes or individuals held in trust or with restrictions against alienation by the United States. The term \"State\" includes the fifty States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and other U.S. territories or possessions. The term \"paleontological resource\" refers to fossilized remains, traces, or imprints of organisms that provide information about the history of life on earth, excluding materials associated with archaeological resources. The term \"paleontological resource\" refers to fossilized remains, traces, or imprints of organisms that provide information about the history of life on earth, excluding materials associated with archaeological resources. A cultural item is defined in the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act. The Secretary is responsible for managing and protecting paleontological resources on Federal lands using scientific principles. Plans for inventory, monitoring, and use of these resources must be developed in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, emphasizing coordination with non-Federal partners, the scientific community, and the public. Coordination between the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture is encouraged. The Secretary is responsible for managing and protecting paleontological resources on Federal lands. A program will be established to increase public awareness about the significance of these resources. The Secretary requires a permit for collecting paleontological resources on Federal lands, except for casual collecting on certain lands without a permit. The Secretary may issue a permit for collecting paleontological resources on Federal lands if the applicant is qualified and the activity furthers paleontological knowledge or public education. This does not affect valid permits issued before the enactment of this Act. Permits for collecting paleontological resources on Federal lands are issued if the activity promotes paleontological knowledge or public education, aligns with management plans, and does not endanger natural or cultural resources. Permit specifications include terms deemed necessary by the Secretary to fulfill the Act's purposes. Permits for collecting paleontological resources on Federal lands include requirements that the resources remain the property of the United States, be preserved in an approved repository for scientific research and public education, and that specific locality data not be released without permission from the Secretary. The Secretary has the authority to modify, suspend, or revoke permits issued for collecting paleontological resources on Federal lands for various reasons, including resource management, safety, or violations of permit conditions. The permit will be revoked if any individual working under it is convicted under section 7. The permit may be revoked if a person working under it is convicted under section 7 or assessed a civil penalty. The Secretary has the authority to restrict access to areas for the protection of paleontological resources and public safety. SEC. 6. CURATION OF RESOURCES. Any paleontological resource collected under a permit must be deposited in an approved repository. The Secretary can make agreements with non-Federal repositories for curation. SEC. 7. PROHIBITED ACTS; CRIMINAL PENALTIES. (a) Prohibits excavation, removal, damage, or alteration of paleontological resources on Federal lands without following the Act's guidelines.\n(b) Prohibits exchange, transport, export, or receipt of paleontological resources if obtained unlawfully from Federal lands. The Act prohibits the excavation, removal, sale, purchase, exchange, transport, or receipt of paleontological resources from Federal lands in violation of any laws. It also prohibits false labeling of such resources. The Act prohibits false labeling or identification of paleontological resources excavated from Federal lands. Violators may face fines or imprisonment up to 10 years, or both, depending on the value of the resources involved. If the repair of resources does not exceed $500, a person may be fined or imprisoned for up to one year. This does not apply to any person who lawfully possessed the paleontological resource before the enactment of the Act. SEC. 8. CIVIL PENALTIES. The Secretary may assess penalties for violations of regulations or permits under this Act after a hearing. The amount of the penalty is determined by regulations considering factors like scientific or fair market value. Each violation is considered a separate offense. The Secretary may assess penalties for violations of regulations or permits under this Act, considering factors like the scientific or fair market value of the paleontological resource, the cost of response, restoration, and repair, and any other relevant factors. For a second or subsequent violation by the same person, the penalty amount may be doubled. In case of multiple offenses, the penalty amount may be doubled for a second or subsequent violation by the same person. The penalty for any one violation shall not exceed double the cost of response, restoration, and repair, plus double the scientific or fair market value of resources destroyed. Judicial review can be requested by any person against whom an order is issued. Any person issued a penalty under subsection (a) can file a petition for judicial review within 30 days in the United States District Court. The Secretary must promptly provide a certified copy of the record. The court will hear the action based on the record before the Secretary and will uphold the action if it is supported by substantial evidence. If a person fails to pay a penalty within 30 days after the order becomes final and no petition for judicial review has been filed, or after a court action has been brought, penalties will apply. After a court action has been brought, the Secretary may request the Attorney General to institute a civil action in a district court to collect the penalty. The district court has jurisdiction to hear and decide actions regarding civil penalties. The validity, amount, and appropriateness of the penalty are not subject to review. Failure to pay the penalty on time will result in additional fees and costs. Penalties collected under this section may be used for protecting, restoring, or acquiring paleontological resources and sites. Hearings during proceedings must comply with section 554 of title 5, United States Code. Additionally, the paragraph requires payment of attorneys' fees and costs for collection proceedings. To protect, monitor, and study resources and sites, acquire equivalent sites, provide educational materials to the public about paleontological resources, and pay rewards as provided in section 9. SEC. 9. REWARDS AND FORFEITURE. The Secretary may pay rewards from penalties collected under section 7 or 8 to individuals who provide information leading to civil or criminal violations. The reward amount is determined by regulations or is one-half of the penalty, up to $500 if no regulation exists. All paleontological resources involved in violations under section 7 or 8 may be subject to civil or criminal forfeiture, along with any vehicles or equipment used in the violation. No government official providing information in their official capacity is eligible for payment under this provision. The Act allows for the seizure, forfeiture, and transfer of paleontological resources for violations. Seized resources can be transferred to educational institutions for scientific or educational purposes. Procedural provisions of the United States Code apply to these seizures and forfeitures. SEC. 10. CONFIDENTIALITY.\n\nInformation about paleontological resources requiring a permit is confidential unless disclosure serves the Act's purpose, poses no risk to the resource, and complies with other laws. The Secretary will issue regulations to implement the Act, allowing for public input. Additionally, confidentiality of paleontological resource information is maintained unless disclosure aligns with the Act's goals and poses no risk to the resource. Nothing in this Act will affect activities permitted under existing mining, leasing, and land management laws, including the Federal Land Policy Management Act and the Mining in the Parks Act. The \"Mining in the Parks Act\" (16 U.S.C. 1901 et seq.), Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (30 U.S.C. 1201-1358), and Organic Administration Act (16 U.S.C. 478, 482, 551) do not impose additional restrictions on activities permitted under existing laws. The Act does not require a permit for casual collecting of certain rocks, minerals, or fossils not protected under this Act. The Act does not impose restrictions on casual collecting of rocks, minerals, or fossils not protected under it. It does not affect non-Federal lands or lawful recovery of paleontological resources. It also does not diminish Federal agency authority to protect paleontological resources on Federal lands. The Act does not create any rights for individuals not employed by the US government. Non-government individuals cannot file civil actions in US courts to enforce provisions of the Act. Authorization of appropriations is granted to carry out the Act."
