    "content": "The Act titled \"Federal Crop Insurance Fairness Act\" allows for coverage levels exceeding 75 percent of recorded or appraised average yield. Subsection (a) of section 508 of the Federal Crop Insurance Act is amended to allow the Corporation to insure producers of agricultural commodities in the United States against unavoidable causes of loss. The Federal Crop Insurance Act allows the Corporation to insure producers of agricultural commodities in the United States against unavoidable causes of loss, such as drought, flood, hail, wind, frost, winterkill, lightning, fire, excessive rain, snow, wildlife, hurricane, tornado, insect infestation, and plant disease. Insurance coverage does not extend beyond the period the insured commodity is in the field. The term 'field' refers to the environment where aquacultural species are produced. Insurance against yield loss must cover 75% of the average yield on the insured farm for a specific period. The Corporation offers lesser levels of yield coverage, including a 50 percent coverage option based on the average yield of the insured farm. Adjustments may be made to ensure fairness for farms in the same area with similar conditions. The Corporation provides lower levels of yield coverage, such as 50 percent of the average yield, with adjustments made for fairness among farms in the same area. Adjusted yields are considered for commodities with established yields by the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service. Insurance coverage may be provided for a commodity based on the adjusted yield established by the Service, rather than the recorded or appraised yield set by the Corporation. Additional premiums for this coverage will be determined by the Board. The Board determines additional premium rates for insurance coverage based on adjusted yield, not exceeding 75 percent of recorded or appraised average yield, to cover losses and establish reserves. The Corporation may offer coverage exceeding 75 percent of average yield if normal yield variations haven't led to losses, with a maximum coverage limit set, except in specific cases. The Corporation may offer coverage up to 75 percent of the average yield, with a maximum limit set. One price election must approximate the projected market price for the commodity. Insurance provided does not cover losses due to uninsured reasons. The Board may limit or refuse insurance based on the insurance risk involved, such as losses due to neglect, malfeasance, failure to reseed, or failure to follow good farming practices. The Board has the authority to limit or refuse insurance based on insurance risk. Insurance may not be provided for agricultural commodities in counties where the income from the commodity is insignificant, except for farms in a local producing area bordering a county with a crop-insurance program. The Corporation is required to submit annual reports. The Corporation must report annually to Congress on its operations for each insured commodity. Starting in 1992, a minimum price level for each insured commodity will be set by the Corporation. Insurance coverage will be based on the price level established by the Board. Insurance coverage will be available to a producer at a price equal to or less than the market price determined by the Board, quoted in dollars per acre. Late planting coverage is provided under Section 3. Late planting coverage is offered under Section 508 of the Federal Crop Insurance Act, allowing planting after the final planting date for a commodity by up to 25 days with a reduction in yield guarantee. Late planting coverage under Section 508 of the Federal Crop Insurance Act reduces the yield guarantee by 1-2 percent per day for delays beyond the normal final planting date, with additional adjustments to offset insurer risk. Late planting coverage is included in a basic insurance policy for producers on a farm unless they opt out. If offering late planting coverage would significantly increase premiums and discourage participation, it will be offered as a separate endorsement. SEC. 4. PREVENTED PLANTING COVERAGE. Section 508 of the Federal Crop Insurance Act is amended to include prevented planting coverage for producers on a farm entering into a crop insurance contract. This coverage applies if producers are unable to plant a crop due to excess moisture, drought, or other natural disasters, with eligibility for 50 percent coverage. The Federal Crop Insurance Act now includes prevented planting coverage for producers on a farm who are unable to plant a crop due to excess moisture, drought, or other natural disasters. Producers can receive coverage equal to 50 percent of the guaranteed level for the crop, and have the option to plant a substitute crop instead. The Federal Crop Insurance Act now includes prevented planting coverage for producers who are unable to plant a crop due to natural disasters. Producers can receive coverage equal to 50 percent of the guaranteed level for the crop, with the option to plant a substitute crop instead. The Act also states that prevented planting coverage may be offered as a separate endorsement if it would discourage participation in the program. The Federal Crop Insurance Act now includes prevented planting coverage for producers affected by natural disasters. Producers may receive coverage for disaster losses without deductions if the estimated market value of the actual production is less than the cost of harvesting. Section 508A(b) of the Federal Crop Insurance Act is amended to include yield averages for crop insurance coverage based on a producer's actual proven crop yields over 4 to 10 years. The Corporation will establish a minimum level of insurance protection for those covered. The Corporation will establish a minimum level of insurance protection for covered producers with reduced yields due to natural disasters. Transitional yield data can only be used if actual production history is not established for the first 4 crop years on the farm. Producers on a farm can use actual production history for yield coverage after the first 4 crop years. If operating a new parcel of land, they may choose to use previous yield history for crop insurance purposes. Producers may choose to use previous yield history or transitional yield data for crop insurance purposes. The Corporation will adjust Nonstandard Classification procedures to accommodate producers. The Corporation will adjust regulations to account for producer yield declines due to natural disasters, defining transitional yield as the countywide average used when no actual production records are available."
