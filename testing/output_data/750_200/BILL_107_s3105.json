    "content": "The Act is titled the \"West Nile Virus and Arboviral Disease Act\" and includes a temporary program for West Nile Virus and related arboviral diseases. Section 319 of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include a temporary program for West Nile Virus and related arboviral diseases, allowing the Secretary to make grants to States for prevention and control efforts. States receiving grants are encouraged to collaborate with local entities. The Secretary may give preference to States with a substantial incidence or prevalence of West Nile Virus or related arboviral diseases, or increased risk, when awarding grants for prevention and control programs. Funds from grants under this subsection are to be used for developing and implementing community-based mosquito control plans and programs on vector-borne diseases. The grant funds support programs on medical entomology, arbovirology, and vector-borne diseases to aid in prevention and control efforts, including training for a competent workforce. States must assure matching funds and not supplant existing resources to be eligible for the grant. The State must provide non-Federal contributions amounting to at least 50% of the program costs under the grant, which can be in cash or in kind. Federal contributions required under subparagraph (A) may be in cash or in kind, including plant, equipment, or services. Amounts provided by the Federal Government or services subsidized by the Federal Government cannot be counted as non-Federal contributions. Grants under this subsection should supplement, not supplant, State and local funds. Grants under this subsection must supplement, not replace, State and local funds. The Secretary can waive requirements for a State due to economic conditions. States must involve local entities when receiving funds. A State receiving funds under this subsection must involve localities in planning, implementing, and evaluating mosquito control plans. At least 85 percent of the grant amount must be spent at the local level or for local public health improvement. The grant funds must be used at the local level for public health improvement related to West Nile Virus or arboviral diseases. Appropriated amounts can be used for technical assistance to enhance CDC's support for mosquito control programs and disease containment at state and local health departments. The grant funds are used for public health improvement related to West Nile Virus or arboviral diseases. Technical assistance is provided to enhance CDC's support for mosquito control programs and disease containment at state and local health departments, with a limitation of 20 percent of the appropriated amount for this purpose. Guidelines for mosquito abatement are developed by the Secretary through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control. The Secretary, in consultation with health and mosquito control organizations, will develop guidelines for sustainable mosquito control programs at the state and local level. The Secretary, in consultation with health and mosquito control organizations, will develop guidelines for sustainable mosquito control programs at the state and local level. The guidelines will focus on functions deemed appropriate by the Director for building the public health infrastructure, including identifying new human cases of disease, tracking disease spread through monitoring infection in various creatures, providing laboratory support for testing, and increasing participation in surveillance systems for arboviruses. The Secretary will conduct an evaluation of the program established under this subsection, which includes providing laboratory support for testing, increasing participation in surveillance systems for arboviruses, conducting educational outreach campaigns, and outlining procedures for mosquito control and monitoring health and environmental effects. The Secretary will evaluate the program established under this subsection and submit a report to Congress within 18 months of the enactment of the West Nile Virus and Arboviral Disease Act, including the evaluation results and related information. The report to Congress will include the evaluation results, progress in developing a sustainable mosquito abatement program, implementation of guidelines, and overall costs and benefits of the program. The report to Congress will evaluate the costs and benefits of the program established under this subsection and authorize appropriations for fiscal years 2003 and 2004. Additional funding is available for control programs responding to public health emergencies like the West Nile Virus. The program established for public health emergencies will receive additional funding for fiscal years 2003 and 2004, with the possibility of extension based on evaluation. SEC. 249. ARBOVIRUS RESEARCH PROGRAM is added to the Public Health Service Act for research purposes. The President is mandated to expand research to control insect populations transmitting diseases like West Nile Virus, develop screening tools for the virus in blood, create pathogen inactivation technologies, and devise containment methodologies. The activities mandated by the President include expanding research to control insect populations transmitting diseases like West Nile Virus, developing screening tools for the virus in blood, creating pathogen inactivation technologies, and devising containment methodologies through various entities. The President is authorized to coordinate efforts between federal agencies, private sector, and experts in public health, entomology, arbovirology, and veterinary health to control insect-borne diseases. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 2003 through 2007."
