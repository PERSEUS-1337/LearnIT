    "content": "In enacting the CAA of 1970, Congress differentiated between existing and new stationary sources of air pollution. Existing sources were deemed difficult to retrofit with new technology, while new sources were required to install state-of-the-art controls to prevent new pollution problems. States had discretion to set emission standards for existing sources of major air pollutants under the CAA of 1970. The CAA of 1970 differentiated between existing and new stationary sources of air pollution. States had discretion to set emission standards for existing sources, while EPA set strict technology-based standards for new sources that may endanger public health or welfare. The 1977 amendments further enhanced regulations in areas with cleaner air than national standards require. The 1977 amendments to the Clean Air Act required new major sources in areas with cleaner or dirtier air than national standards to undergo New Source Review (NSR) before construction. This process includes obtaining a pre-construction permit with emission limits based on \"best available control technology\" or \"lowest achievable emission rate.\" The RMRR issue arises because the CAA applies NSR not only to newly constructed stationary sources but also to existing ones. The Clean Air Act requires New Source Review (NSR) for new major sources in areas with different air quality standards. This includes obtaining permits with emission limits based on \"best available control technology\" or \"lowest achievable emission rate.\" NSR applies to both newly constructed and existing stationary sources in PSD and nonattainment areas. The Clean Air Act mandates New Source Review (NSR) for new major sources in areas with varying air quality standards. NSR applies to both new construction and existing stationary sources in PSD and nonattainment areas. The key issue is determining what changes to a stationary source constitute a \"modification,\" as defined by the CAA. The Clean Air Act requires New Source Review (NSR) for new major sources in areas with different air quality standards, applying to both new construction and existing stationary sources in PSD and nonattainment areas. The definition of a \"modification\" under the CAA determines which changes trigger NSR, focusing on increases in emissions from a source. This definition raises questions about phrases like \"physical change\" and \"change in the method of operation,\" leading to legal disputes. The EPA defines \"reconstruction\" as the replacement of components in an existing facility where the fixed capital cost of the new components exceeds 50% of the cost to build a new facility, and it is feasible to meet NSPSs. This triggers NSPSs and NSR, similar to modifications in a facility. The EPA defines \"reconstruction\" as replacing components in an existing facility where the cost exceeds 50% of building a new facility and is feasible to meet NSPSs. This triggers NSPSs and NSR, similar to modifications. In contrast, a change in a facility can constitute reconstruction regardless of emission increases. EPA's definition of \"modification\" includes exceptions for certain changes in a stationary source that do not trigger heightened pollution-control requirements. The EPA's definition of \"reconstruction\" involves replacing components in an existing facility exceeding 50% of building a new facility cost, triggering NSPSs and NSR. On the other hand, any change at a source, no matter how minor, would subject it to heightened pollution-control requirements. The EPA's RMRR exemption was previously determined through case-by-case analysis, weighing various factors for a common-sense determination. The EPA's case-by-case approach to determining RMRR exemptions was approved in the WEPCO case, where extensive renovations were proposed for generating units. EPA required a permit for the proposed renovations triggering NSPS and PSD-area NSR, dismissing WEPCO's argument for RMRR. The Seventh Circuit ruled in WEPCO that EPA's case-by-case approach was appropriate in determining that the proposed renovations went beyond routine maintenance, citing the substantial and unprecedented nature of the work on the plant. The project's purpose, infrequency, and high cost all indicated non-routineness, leading to the conclusion that a permit was required before construction could begin. The RMRR exemption has been a focal point in recent years, with the Clinton Administration's enforcement actions bringing attention to the issue. The RMRR exemption has been a focal point in recent years, with enforcement actions by the Clinton Administration against electric utilities for exceeding \"routine maintenance\" without installing NSR controls. President Bush's National Energy Policy directed EPA to review NSR's impact on investment in new utility and refinery generation capacity. The RMRR exemption has been a focal point in recent years, with enforcement actions by the Clinton Administration against electric utilities for exceeding \"routine maintenance\" without installing NSR controls. President Bush's National Energy Policy directed EPA to review NSR's impact on investment in new utility and refinery generation capacity, resulting in EPA's June, 2002 report to the President on the impact of NSR. EPA published final regulations on December 31, 2002, affecting how sources calculate emission increases for NSR purposes and proposed a rule to clarify the RMRR exception. The EPA proposed a rule to clarify the RMRR exception in its NSR rules, following a decision in EPA v. Whitman where the Eleventh Circuit ruled that the TVA violated the CAA through projects exceeding RMRR without permits. This decision was embodied in an administrative compliance order. The EPA issued an administrative compliance order (ACO) after plants exceeded RMRR without permits. The Eleventh Circuit found that the CAA was unconstitutional in imposing penalties for noncompliance with ACOs without proof in district court, allowing TVA to violate the ACOs without fear of penalty. The Eleventh Circuit found that EPA must prove CAA violations in district court, allowing TVA to violate ACOs without penalty. The RMRR exception was reshaped in October 2003 with a new equipment-replacement rule. The RMRR exception was reshaped in October 2003 with a new equipment-replacement rule that provides greater regulatory certainty without sacrificing environmental protection. EPA is not taking action on the proposed annual maintenance, repair, and replacement \"allowance\" at this time. The EPA is not currently implementing the proposed annual maintenance, repair, and replacement \"allowance.\" The new rule states that replacing components of a process unit with identical or equivalent ones constitutes RMRR if the replacement cost is less than 20% of the unit's current value, does not alter its design, and maintains emission and operational limits. The new EPA rule allows for the replacement of components in a process unit as long as it does not change the unit's design parameters and continues to meet emission and operational limitations. This new approach is expected to reduce the need for case-by-case evaluations. No recordkeeping requirements are imposed under the new rule. The new EPA rule allows for component replacement in process units without changing design parameters or emission limitations. No recordkeeping requirements are imposed, relying on existing business records and EPA's inspection authority for enforcement. The rule applies only to conduct after its effective date and does not serve as a defense in pending CAA enforcement actions. Multiple lawsuits have been filed challenging the rule by fifteen states, several localities, and environmental groups. Fifteen states, along with localities and environmental groups, challenge the EPA's equipment-replacement rule, arguing it exceeds the agency's authority under the CAA. The lawsuits have been consolidated under State of New York v. Environmental Protection Agency. The court granted a stay on the rule pending full review, citing irreparable harm and likelihood of success for the petitioners. The court granted a stay on the EPA's equipment-replacement rule, citing irreparable harm and likelihood of success for the petitioners. The rule was suspended, and the old case-by-case approach continues to apply. The court declined to consolidate the actions with another group of cases but designated the same panel for both groups due to their related nature. The court designated the same panel for equipment-replacement rule cases as for the December 2002 final rule cases due to their related nature."
