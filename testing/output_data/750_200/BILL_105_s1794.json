    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Gulf War Veterans' Iraqi Claims Protection Act of 1998\". Adjudication of claims is addressed in the Act. The United States Commission is authorized to receive and determine claims by U.S. nationals against Iraq, applying applicable laws and principles of justice. Priority is given to non-commercial claims before other claims are decided. The United States Commission is responsible for deciding non-commercial claims related to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and the attack on the USS Stark. The International Claims Settlement Act applies to these claims, with certain exceptions. SEC. 3. CLAIMS FUNDS. The Secretary of the Treasury can establish the Iraq Claims Fund for paying claims under section 2(a). Proceeds from Iraqi asset liquidation will be allocated by the President between the Iraq Claims Fund and other appropriate accounts. The President can allocate funds between the Iraq Claims Fund and other accounts for US Government claims, with a limitation on the amount. The term \"certified claims of the United States Government\" refers to claims determined by the Secretary of State to be valid and outside the jurisdiction of the United Nations Commission, with certified amounts established by the President's procedures. The President is authorized to vest and liquidate Iraqi assets in the US to satisfy claims under section 2(a) and claims of the US Government against Iraq. Additionally, reimbursement for administrative expenses is provided. SEC. 5. REIMBURSEMENT FOR ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. The Secretary of the Treasury deducts 1.5 percent from the Iraq Claims Fund for administrative expenses. Amounts deducted are deposited as miscellaneous receipts in the Treasury of the United States. SEC. 6. PAYMENTS. The United States Commission certifies awards to the Secretary of the Treasury for payment from the Iraq Claims Fund in order of priority. Payment includes $10,000 or the award's principal amount, additional $90,000 for certain claims, and periodic payments towards unpaid balances. After certifying awards, payments are made from the Iraq Claims Fund in order of priority. Payments include the principal amount of the award, additional amounts for certain claims, and periodic payments towards unpaid balances and accrued interest. Any remaining funds in the fund are distributed after all awards have been paid in full. After all awards have been paid in full from the Iraq Claims Fund, any remaining funds will be transferred to the general fund of the Treasury of the United States. Payment of an award does not extinguish any unsatisfied claim against the Government of Iraq. SEC. 7. AUTHORITY TO TRANSFER RECORDS. The head of any Executive agency may transfer records to the United States Commission for claims adjudication. SEC. 8. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS; DISPOSITION OF UNUSED FUNDS. Statute of Limitations: Any demand for payment on certified awards under this Act is barred one year after the notice is published in the Federal Register. The notice must be published 9 years after the last date of certification. The Secretary of the Treasury must publish a notice 9 years after covering amounts into the Iraq Claims Fund. After 2 years from the publication date, any unused funds must be deposited into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts if not used for additional payments. Unused funds from the Iraq Claims Fund must be deposited into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts if not used for additional payments. SEC. 9. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, definitions include terms like \"Executive agency,\" \"Government of Iraq,\" \"United Nations Commission,\" and \"United States Commission.\" The United States Commission, established under United Nations Security Council Resolution 687 (1991), refers to the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission of the United States."
