Services include nutrition programs, caregiver support, employment services, and programs to prevent abuse and neglect. The OAA has seven titles, with most programs administered by the Administration on Aging (AOA). The Older Americans Act (OAA) has seven titles, with most programs administered by the Administration on Aging (AOA) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Congress has reauthorized and amended the act numerous times since its enactment in 1965. The Older Americans Act (OAA) has been reauthorized and amended multiple times since its enactment in 1965. OAA funding has been extended through various reauthorizations, with the last one in 2006 (P.L. 109-365) authorizing appropriations through FY2011. Despite the expiration of authorizations, Congress has continued to fund OAA programs and activities. This report focuses on OAA funding, starting with an overview of FY2015 funding. The report discusses OAA funding, including an overview of FY2015 funding, a breakdown of current-year funding for programs, funding history since FY2001, legislative activity for FY2015 appropriations, and funding decisions for selected programs. Appendixes provide more detailed funding information and history. Appendix A and B in the report detail the authorizations of appropriations and funding levels for OAA programs from FY2006 through FY2015. The FY2015 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act funded OAA programs at $1.878 billion, a slight increase from FY2014. The FY2015 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act (P.L. 113-235) funded OAA programs at $1.878 billion, a slight increase from FY2014. Title III programs received the largest proportion of funding, with 70.7% allocated to nutrition, supportive services, family caregivers, and health promotion activities. Title V, the CSEOA Program, received 23.1% of funding, while the remaining funds were allocated to AOA-administered activities under Titles II and IV. In FY2015, funding was allocated to various OAA programs, with Title V receiving the largest share at 23.1%. Other funds went to activities under Titles II and IV, grants for Native Americans under Title VI, and elder rights protection under Title VII. Two exceptions were Aging Network Support Activities and Elder Rights Support Activities under Title IV, which received new funding for services for Holocaust survivors and an Elder Justice Initiative, respectively. In FY2015, Elder Rights Support Activities received $4.0 million in new funding for an Elder Justice Initiative under Title IV. Total discretionary funding for OAA programs increased slightly from FY2001 to FY2002, remained flat through FY2006, then increased steadily from FY2006 to FY2010. OAA funding levels have remained below the FY2010 level since then. Overall, OAA funding levels have fluctuated over the years. Funding increased steadily from $1.783 billion in FY2006 to $2.328 billion in FY2010, with additional funding provided in FY2009 under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. However, total discretionary funding for OAA programs declined in FY2011 through FY2013, with FY2013 funding falling below the FY2007 level. Total OAA funding levels fluctuated over the years, increasing steadily from $1.783 billion in FY2006 to $2.328 billion in FY2010. However, funding declined in FY2011 through FY2013, with FY2013 funding falling below the FY2007 level. Sequestration was a significant factor in the 5.5% reduction from FY2012 to FY2013. Funding for FY2014 and FY2015 was slightly below the FY2012 level but above FY2013. President Obama signed the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, providing $1.878 billion in FY2015 funding for OAA programs. The FY2015 appropriations law, P.L. 113-235, provided $1.878 billion for OAA programs, reflecting the new consolidated ACL account structure. This funding included program administration costs for aging and disability services programs administered by ACL. Prior to P.L. 113-235, FY2015 discretionary funding for federal agencies, including OAA programs, was provided through three continuing resolutions (CRs). These CRs funded programs at the same rate and under the same conditions as in FY2014. The FY2015 discretionary funding for federal agencies, including OAA programs, was provided through three continuing resolutions (CRs) funding programs at the same rate as FY2014, with an across-the-board reduction of 0.0554%. The House Appropriations Committee did not hold a markup for a FY2015 Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill, but a bill was introduced for $448.3 million for OAA Title V (CSEOA). The bill H.R. 5464 would have provided increased funding for OAA Title V (CSEOA) and OAA Title III senior nutrition programs in FY2015. It did not specify funding for other OAA programs and activities. The bill was referred to the House Appropriations Committee but did not progress further. On June 10, 2014, the Senate Appropriations Labor-HHS-Education Subcommittee approved an FY2015 appropriations bill for OAA programs. The bill proposed funding OAA programs at $1.871 billion, similar to FY2014 levels, with exceptions for family caregiver funding and the Nutrition Services Incentive Program. Additionally, $10.0 million was proposed for a new Elder Justice Initiative. The subcommittee proposed $10.0 million for a new Elder Justice Initiative, excluded from the OAA total. President Obama's FY2015 budget requested $1.819 billion for OAA programs, $52.5 million less than FY2014. Most OAA programs were to be funded at FY2014 levels, with exceptions for Aging and Disability Resource Centers. The FY2015 budget includes funding for various programs at their FY2014 levels, with exceptions such as new mandatory funding for Aging and Disability Resource Centers, discretionary funding for the CSEOA Program, a Holocaust Survivor Assistance Fund, and the White House Conference on Aging. Additionally, there is a request for new discretionary funding for an \"Elder Justice Initiative\" authorized under OAA Sections 451 and 751 and the Elder Justice Act. The ACL Budget Justification did not specify further details. The FY2015 budget proposed funding for various programs at FY2014 levels, with exceptions for new mandatory funding for Aging and Disability Resource Centers, discretionary funding for the CSEOA Program, a Holocaust Survivor Assistance Fund, and the White House Conference on Aging. There was also a request for new discretionary funding for an \"Elder Justice Initiative\" authorized under OAA Sections 451 and 751 and the Elder Justice Act. The ACL Budget Justification did not specify funding amounts under OAA authority. The FY2015 budget also proposed transferring the administration of the CSEOA program from DOL to ACL. The FY2015 Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill (Senate bill), House minority FY2015 Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill (H.R. 5464), and final FY2015 funding enacted under P.L. 113-235 included funding for programs like CSEOA, Holocaust survivors' support, ADRCs, and the White House Conference on Aging. CSEOA, also known as SCSEP, provides part-time opportunities in community service for unemployed low-income individuals aged 55 and older. The FY2015 budget proposed transferring administration of the CSEOA program from DOL to ACL. The FY2015 budget proposed transferring administration of the CSEOA program from DOL to ACL, with a funding decrease of 13% compared to FY2014. Of the 56 state and territorial grantees, 17 are in state labor departments, while the rest are in aging, senior services, or health and human services departments. ACL shared CSEOA's mission of providing part-time opportunities in community service for unemployed low-income individuals aged 55 and older. The FY2015 budget proposed transferring administration of the CSEOA program from DOL to ACL, with a funding decrease of 13% compared to FY2014. 17 state labor departments and other aging, senior services, or health and human services departments are involved. Congress would need to pass legislation for the transfer to take effect. The FY2015 budget proposed transferring administration of the CSEOA program from DOL to ACL, with a funding decrease of 13% compared to FY2014. Congress would need to pass legislation for the transfer to take effect, as the law does not allow for administrative action alone. ACL would target the program to those with the greatest need and consider all sources of income for eligibility. They also proposed restructuring CSEOA as a community service program. The CSEOA program was proposed to be restructured as a community service program by ACL, as it did not align well with the Workforce Investment Act framework. The Senate bill aimed to fund CSEOA at the FY2014 level, while the subcommittee recommended keeping it in DOL. H.R. 5464 also addressed the placement of CSEOA within the government structure. The subcommittee recommended keeping CSEOA in DOL with funding at $448.3 million for FY2015. The program remains administered under DOL with the same appropriations as in FY2014. The Secretary of Labor can reserve 0.5% of the funding for program evaluation. Approximately 130,000 Holocaust survivors live in the US, with 25% living in poverty. The President's FY2015 budget proposed $5.0 million in OAA Title IV funding to establish a Holocaust Survivor Assistance Fund, which would provide supportive services for Holocaust survivors. The Senate bill did not propose funding for the Fund due to budget constraints, but urged ACL to prioritize this population within its existing programs. The draft report proposed funding for the Holocaust Survivor Assistance Fund due to budget constraints, but urged ACL to prioritize this population within its existing programs. H.R. 5464 did not specify funding for Holocaust survivors. FY2015 final funding included $2.5 million for supportive services for aging Holocaust survivors. Aging and Disability Resource Centers aim to provide a single entry point for information on long-term services and supports. Aging and Disability Resource Centers (ADRCs) serve as centralized information hubs for long-term services and supports, offering counseling on public and private options, access to programs like Medicaid, and discharge planning services. With over 500 sites nationwide, ADRCs aim to help individuals transition back home after hospital stays or nursing facility visits, with 5.2 million client contacts in FY2012. In FY2012, ADRCs had 5.2 million contacts with clients and received $10 million in mandatory funding under the ACA. The President's FY2015 budget proposed no discretionary funding for ADRCs but $20.0 million each year for five years in renewed mandatory funding. The Senate bill would have provided $6.1 million in discretionary funding for ADRCs to improve coordination among ADRCs, Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs), and Centers for Independent Living (CILs) for consumer access to long-term care services. The Senate bill provided $6.1 million in discretionary funding for ADRCs to enhance coordination with AAAs and CILs for consumer access to long-term care services. H.R. 5464 did not specify a dollar amount for ADRCs and did not meet the President's budget request for additional mandatory funding. White House Conferences on Aging have historically focused attention on concerns of older individuals and guided federal policymakers.

The first conference was held in 1961, with subsequent conferences in 1971, 1981, 1995, and 2005. The President's FY2015 budget proposed $3.0 million for a conference in 2015, while the Senate bill did not allocate specific funding for it.
