    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Math and Science Incentive Act of 2005\". Congress finds that the United States needs a strong scientific and technical enterprise, which requires producing more scientists and engineers. The education system must encourage students to study science and mathematics and pursue related careers, as current performance in these fields lags behind international peers. The United States needs to recommit to leadership in science, mathematics, and engineering, especially in areas like nanotechnology. A program of loan forgiveness can attract students to careers in these fields, including teaching. Encouraging students to pursue careers in science, mathematics, engineering, and technology, including teaching, can help the United States maintain its technological leadership. Establishment of program. The Secretary will implement a program to cover interest payments on loans for eligible undergraduate students who have applied in accordance with the Act. The program covers interest payments on loans for eligible undergraduate students who obtained loans as undergraduates, are new borrowers, are teachers of STEM subjects, and enter into an agreement with the Secretary.

Loan interest payments under this Act are subject to the availability of appropriations. If funds are insufficient, priority will be given to individuals who received interest payments in the previous fiscal year. The Secretary has the authority to establish regulations. The Secretary can prescribe regulations for interest payments made on behalf of individuals.
