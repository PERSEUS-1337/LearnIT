    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Artists' Rights and Theft Prevention Act of 2004\" or the \"ART Act\". Congressional findings are also included in the Act. Congress finds that intellectual property is crucial for innovation and economic development, deserving protection under the law. Music, film, software, and other forms of intellectual property are vital sectors of the US economy. Intellectual property is a significant sector of the US economy, accounting for over 5% of GDP in 2001, nearly 6% of all US employment, and leading in foreign sales and exports. This sector is facing challenges from illegal reproduction and distribution facilitated by the Internet and technology. The No Electronic Theft (NET) Act was passed in 1997 to combat illegal reproduction and distribution of copyrighted materials facilitated by the Internet and technology. It allows prosecution of individuals involved in large-scale infringement cases where the infringers act willfully. The No Electronic Theft (NET) Act's economic harm requirement makes investigations of copyright infringements resource-intensive. To deter egregious violations, recognizing economic harm from distributing prerelease commercial works is crucial. The use of camcorders for recording is also a concern. The distribution of prerelease commercial works can cause significant economic harm. Camcorders used in movie theaters to make illegal copies of films are a serious threat to the industry, with 92.4 percent of first copies available for download originating from camcorders. Online theft of music, film, software, and intellectual property is on the rise, posing enforcement challenges. The negative impact of online theft on intellectual property industries, such as music and film, is significant, with a 31 percent drop in music industry sales from 2000 to 2003. Federal legislation is needed to address this issue due to its detrimental effects on the economy. The United States economy is impacted by the importance of intellectual property industries like music, film, and software, as outlined in Article 1, section 8 of the Constitution.
