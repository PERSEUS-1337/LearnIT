The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 prioritizes a child's health and safety, aiming to provide each child with a permanent home. This Act also offers incentives for adoptions, resulting in the placement of nearly 53,000 children from State care in fiscal year 2002. The Adoption Promotion Act of 2003 further emphasized moving older children into permanent homes. In 2003, despite increased adoptions, over 118,000 foster children still await adoption, many with special needs requiring federal support for healing from past abuse and neglect. SEC. 3.
