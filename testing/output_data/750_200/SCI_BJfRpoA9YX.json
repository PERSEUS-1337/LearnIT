    "content": "The proposed generative model architecture aims to learn image representations that separate a single attribute from the rest of the representation, allowing for manipulation of attributes without changing the object's identity. This is particularly relevant in scenarios like altering glasses on a human face without affecting the person's identity. Learning a representation of an image that separates object identity from attributes is challenging. The success of a factorization approach is demonstrated by synthesizing faces with and without specific attributes. The model achieves competitive scores on facial attribute classification tasks using generative models like GANs and VAEs. Latent space generative models like GANs and VAEs learn a mapping from a latent encoding space to a data space, showing that the latent space is often organized linearly. Directions in latent space correspond to changes in attributes, such as the extent of a smile on a face. Latent space generative models allow for meaningful changes in images by manipulating the latent space, useful for image synthesis and editing. Research includes class conditional image synthesis for specific object categories. Latent space generative models focus on class conditional image synthesis, including fine-grained categories like different dog breeds or celebrities' faces. Instead of fine-grain categories, the proposal aims to tackle image attribute manipulation. The proposal aims to address image attribute manipulation by synthesizing images with only one element or attribute changed, such as editing a person's smile in a face synthesis scenario. This problem is distinct from fine-grain synthesis as it requires generating two similar faces with a single chosen attribute altered. The paper proposes a new model for image attribute manipulation by learning a factored representation for faces, separating attribute information from the rest of the facial representation. The model is applied to the CelebA BID21 dataset to control several facial attributes. The core contribution is a novel cost function for training a VAE encoder to learn a latent representation that factorizes binary facial attribute information. The core contribution of the paper is a novel cost function for training a VAE encoder to learn a latent representation that separates binary facial attribute information. The model achieves competitive classification scores and can successfully edit the 'Smiling' attribute in over 90% of test cases. The latent variable generative model successfully edits the 'Smiling' attribute in over 90% of test cases. The paper discusses the distinction between conditional image synthesis and image attribute editing, and provides code to reproduce the experiments. Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are state-of-the-art generative models for synthesizing novel data samples from latent encodings. Variational autoencoders (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are models that allow synthesis of new data samples from latent encodings. VAEs consist of an encoder and decoder, often implemented as neural networks with learnable parameters. The VAE is trained to maximize the evidence lower bound (ELBO) on log p(x), where p(x) is the data-generating distribution. The encoder predicts \u00b5 and \u03c3 for a given input x, and a latent sample is drawn from the encoder. Variational autoencoders (VAEs) use a chosen prior distribution like p(z) = N(0, I). The encoder predicts \u00b5\u03c6(x) and \u03c3\u03c6(x) for input x, and a latent sample \u1e91 is drawn from q\u03c6(z|x). New data samples are synthesized by drawing latent samples from the prior z \u223c p(z) and then generating data samples from p\u03b8(x|z) through the decoder D\u03b8(z). VAEs provide a generative model p\u03b8(x|z) and an analytical calculation of the KL-divergence with a multivariate Gaussian prior. Variational autoencoders (VAEs) synthesize data samples by drawing latent samples from a prior distribution, p(z), and generating data samples from p\u03b8(x|z) through the decoder D\u03b8(z). VAEs offer a generative model, p\u03b8(x|z), and an encoding model, q\u03c6(z|x), useful for image editing in the latent space. However, VAE samples are often blurred. An alternative model for sharper images is the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), consisting of a generator, G\u03b8(\u00b7), and a discriminator, C\u03c7(\u00b7), both implemented using convolutional neural networks. GAN training involves a mini-max game between the two networks. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) training involves a mini-max game between a generator, G\u03b8(\u00b7), and a discriminator, C\u03c7(\u00b7), both implemented using convolutional neural networks. The discriminator is trained to classify samples as 'fake' or 'real', while the generator aims to synthesize samples that confuse the discriminator. The objective function includes the distribution of synthesized samples, p g (x), and a chosen prior distribution, p(z). The vanilla GAN model lacks a simple way to map data samples to latent space. Only one approach allows faithful reconstruction of data samples, requiring adversarial training on high dimensional distributions. Training adversarial networks on high dimensional data samples remains challenging despite proposed improvements. In contrast to the vanilla GAN model, which struggles with mapping data samples to latent space, a new approach combines a VAE with a GAN to improve the quality of data samples outputted from the decoder. Various methods have been proposed to combine VAEs and GANs, but none are specifically designed for attribute editing. The combination of VAEs and GANs has been explored with different structures and loss functions, but none are tailored for attribute editing. Image synthesis in VAEs and GANs depends on the latent variable z drawn from a random distribution. Vanilla VAEs cannot choose to synthesize samples from a specific category, unlike conditional VAEs and GANs. Conditional VAEs and GANs offer a solution for synthesizing class-specific data samples, allowing for category-conditional image synthesis by appending a one-hot label vector to the encoder and decoder inputs. This approach prevents the label information from being ignored, unlike vanilla VAEs. A more interesting approach for conditional autoencoders is presented by BID22, where the encoder outputs both a latent vector and an attribute vector. The encoder is updated to minimize a classification loss between the true label and the attribute vector. Incorporating attribute information in this way has drawbacks when the model's purpose is to edit specific attributes rather than synthesize samples. In a naive implementation of conditional VAEs, changing the attribute vector for a fixed latent vector can lead to unpredictable changes in synthesized data samples. This indicates that information about the attribute to be edited is partially contained in the latent vector rather than solely in the attribute vector. Similar issues have been discussed in GAN models. The text suggests that information about the attribute to be edited is partially contained in the latent vector rather than solely in the attribute vector. A proposed process involves separating this information using a mini-max optimization with the encoder, auxiliary network, and the attributes involved. The proposed process involves separating information about the attribute from the latent vector using mini-max optimization with the encoder and auxiliary network. This process is referred to as 'Adversarial Information Factorization'. The goal is to describe a face using a latent vector for identity and a unit vector for a desired attribute. If the latent encoding contains attribute information that should be in the attribute vector, a classifier should accurately predict the attribute from the latent vector. The proposed approach involves training an auxiliary network to predict the desired attribute from the latent vector, while updating the VAE encoder to output values that prevent the auxiliary network from succeeding. This process aims to ensure that the latent vector does not contain information about the attribute, which should instead be encoded in a separate attribute vector. The approach involves training an auxiliary network to predict the attribute from the latent vector, while updating the VAE encoder to prevent the auxiliary network from succeeding. This ensures that the latent vector does not contain information about the attribute, which should be encoded in a separate attribute vector. The novel method factorizes label information out of the latent encoding in a VAE-GAN model to improve image quality. The architecture includes an encoder, decoder, discriminator, and an auxiliary network for latent encoding. The encoder also functions as a classifier, outputting attribute and latent vectors. Parameters of the decoder are updated using a binary cross-entropy loss function. The encoder's parameters are used for synthesizing images from a specific category.

Parameters of the decoder are updated using a binary cross-entropy loss function. The encoder's parameters are used for synthesizing images from a specific category. The loss function in Equation FORMULA7 is not sufficient for training an encoder used for attribute manipulation. An additional network and cost function are proposed for this purpose. The current work introduces adversarial information factorization in a VAE model with a GAN architecture. The core model includes an encoder, decoder, and auxiliary network. The encoder is split into latent encoding and label components. A discriminator is added to classify decoded samples. The previous work involved the cVAE-GAN architecture. The current work introduces adversarial information factorization in a VAE model with a GAN architecture. It includes an encoder, decoder, and auxiliary network. The discriminator is used to classify decoded samples as \"fake\" or \"real\". The previous work involved the cVAE-GAN architecture without an auxiliary network for information factorization. The Information Factorization cVAE-GAN (IFcVAE-GAN) model encourages the encoder to not include attribute information in the latent output. Training is complete when the auxiliary network is unable to predict the true label from the latent output. The encoder loss is determined by this confusion. The training procedure is outlined in Algorithm 1 for editing images to have desired attributes. The training procedure for Factorization cVAE-GAN (IFcVAE-GAN) involves encoding images to obtain a representation, appending a desired attribute label, and passing it through the decoder. Attribute manipulation is achieved by switching between different modes of the desired attribute. Quantitative and qualitative results are presented to evaluate the model's performance. The study evaluates the proposed model by quantitatively assessing the contribution of adversarial information factorization. Facial attribute classification is performed using a deep convolutional GAN architecture, incorporating residual layers to achieve competitive results. The evaluation concludes with a qualitative assessment of the model. The study incorporates layers BID12 into the model for competitive classification results compared to a state-of-the-art model. Qualitative evaluation demonstrates the model's potential for image attribute editing. Two types of cVAE-GAN models are discussed: naive cVAE-GAN and Information Factorization cVAE-GAN (IFcVAE-GAN). The study introduces an Information Factorization cVAE-GAN (IFcVAE-GAN) for image attribute manipulation. It quantifies reconstruction quality using mean squared error and measures the proportion of edited images with desired attributes through a trained classifier. The study introduces an Information Factorization cVAE-GAN (IFcVAE-GAN) for image attribute manipulation. It quantifies reconstruction quality using mean squared error and measures the proportion of edited images with desired attributes through a trained classifier. Images are synthesized with classification scores for smiling and not-smiling attributes. The model successfully edits images to have the 'Not Smiling' attribute in 81.3% of cases and the 'Smiling' attribute in all. Our model successfully edits images to have the 'Not Smiling' attribute in 81.3% of cases and the 'Smiling' attribute in all cases. The absence of the proposed L aux term in the encoder loss function results in the model failing to perform attribute editing. The classification loss on reconstructed samples was explored to assess its impact. The effect of including a classification loss on reconstructed samples was explored to maximize information content, but did not contribute to attribute factorization. The IcGAN was included in the study for further analysis. The IcGAN was included in the study for further analysis, showing similar reconstruction error to the model but performing less well at attribute editing tasks. The model aims to factorize attribute information from the representation for faces, minimizing mutual information between identity and facial attributes. The model aims to separate facial attribute information from identity encoding by minimizing mutual information, encouraging label information in \u0177 rather than \u1e91. This suggests potential for facial attribute classification, demonstrated by the encoder's ability to classify attributes. Our model effectively separates facial attribute information from identity encoding, demonstrating competitive performance in facial attribute classification compared to a state-of-the-art classifier. The model effectively factorizes attribute information from identity representation, focusing on attribute manipulation. A cVAE-GAN may struggle to edit attributes when trained for low reconstruction error. Previous work emphasized synthesizing images with desired attributes rather than editing specific attributes. Learning a representation that preserves identity while allowing attribute editing is challenging. The cVAE-GAN model failed to edit images for the 'Not Smiling' attribute, highlighting the need for models with a factored latent representation. Good reconstruction quality was achieved by reducing facial attribute classification. Comparing the performance of the classifier E y,\u03c6 to a state-of-the-art classifier was also done. The model achieved good reconstruction by reducing facial attribute classification. Performance was compared to a state-of-the-art classifier, using specific weightings and training parameters. The IFcVAE-GAN model was trained with the same optimizer and hyper-parameters as the BID3 model, with additional hyper-parameters included. Our model, trained with additional hyper-parameters, achieved good reconstruction and successfully synthesized images with the 'Not Smiling' attribute at a 98% success rate, outperforming the naive cVAE-GAN model. Our model, IFcVAE-GAN, achieved a 98% success rate in synthesizing images with the 'Not Smiling' attribute, outperforming the naive cVAE-GAN model. Our model, IFcVAE-GAN, successfully synthesizes images without smiles, outperforming other models in the ablation study. Additionally, the model is applied to manipulate other facial attributes, such as 'Blonde Hair'. The IFcVAE-GAN model can edit desired attributes in images by factorizing attributes from identity and synthesizing samples with different attribute modes. The novel IFcVAE-GAN model learns to factor attributes from identity, uses an auxiliary classifier for representation factorization, and achieves competitive scores on facial attribute classification. Adversarial training is used to extract attribute label information from the latent representation, similar to other related approaches like Schmidhuber FORMULA3 and BID16. Our work, the IFcVAE-GAN model, incorporates factorization of attribute information from the latent representation using adversarial information factorization. This approach differs from BID16, which also factorizes the latent space but does not predict attribute information. Our model is similar to cVAE-GAN architecture and achieves competitive scores on facial attribute classification. Our work, the IFcVAE-GAN model, incorporates adversarial information factorization to minimize the gap between latent representations and labels. It is similar to the cVAE-GAN architecture proposed by BID3, which focuses on synthesizing samples of a specific class rather than manipulating single attributes of an image. Our objective differs as we aim to manipulate attributes like \"Hathway smiling\" or \"Hathway not smiling\", requiring a different type of factorization in the latent representation. Our model focuses on changing specific attributes in images with minimal impact on the rest of the image, while also learning a classifier for input images. This approach differs from previous works like BID0 and BID17, which also emphasize the importance of preserving identity in the latent space but use different methods such as identity classification loss and VAE-GAN. Our work emphasizes the importance of preserving identity in the latent space by focusing on changing specific attributes in images with minimal impact on the rest of the image. We highlight the difference between category conditional image synthesis and attribute editing, showing that what works for one may not work for the other. It is necessary to factor label information out of the latent encoding for successful attribute editing. In this paper, the focus is on latent space generative models that enable small changes in latent space to result in meaningful changes in image space. This approach is different from image-to-image models that aim to learn a single latent representation for images in various domains. Recent advancements in image-to-image domain adaptation have allowed for the translation of images from one domain to another. In image-to-image domain adaptation, progress has been made in translating images from one domain to another. By performing factorization in the latent space, a single generative model can be used to edit attributes with small changes in encoding. This approach differs from image-to-image models and allows for meaningful changes in image space. Our approach involves supervised factorization of the latent space to learn disentangled representations of images, minimizing mutual information to exploit regularities in the data. This differs from other models that learn representations from unlabelled data. Our approach involves supervised factorization of the latent space to learn disentangled representations of images, minimizing mutual information to exploit regularities in the data. Using a mini-max objective to approximately minimize I(z; y), we propose a novel approach to learning image representations that allows for modification of image attributes. Demonstrated on human face images, the method is generalizable to other objects by modeling images with separate representations for the object and its attributes. Our model, Information Factorization conditional VAE-GAN, separates object and attribute representations in images, allowing for easy attribute editing without affecting object identity. The model outperforms existing models in this aspect. Our model, Information Factorization conditional VAE-GAN, separates object and attribute representations in images, allowing for easy attribute editing without affecting object identity. It outperforms existing models and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on facial attribute classification. The approach to learning factored representations for images is a novel and important contribution to representation learning. Learning factored representations for images is a novel and important contribution to representation learning. A table and Figure 5 demonstrate the need for L aux loss and show that increased regularization reduces reconstruction quality. There is no significant benefit to using the L class loss. These findings are consistent with the ablation study in the main body of the text for the IFcVAE-GAN with the GAN architecture of BID27. Results show that small amounts of KL regularization are necessary for good reconstruction, while models trained without L gan achieve slightly lower reconstruction error but produce blurred images. Interestingly, even without L gan or L KL loss, the model can still accurately edit attributes, although the visual quality of samples is poor. This indicates that attribute information is still extracted from the images. In our model, we use labelled data to learn factored representations, while other models can learn disentangled representations from unlabelled data. The latent encodings learned by these models can be evaluated by training a linear classifier for facial attribute classification. The performance of our classifier, E y,\u03c6 , is compared to a linear classifier trained on latent representations from a DIP-VAE model, known for learning disentangled representations from unlabelled data."
