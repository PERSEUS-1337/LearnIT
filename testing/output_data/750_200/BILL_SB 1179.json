    "title": "SB 1179",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 9002 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to include definitions for terms such as \"active militia,\" \"armed services,\" \"board of trustees,\" and \"district\" in relation to public cemetery districts in California. The curr_chunk defines \"board of trustees\" as the legislative body of a district, \"district\" as a public cemetery district, and \"domestic partner\" as two adults in a committed relationship registered with the Secretary of State. The curr_chunk defines \"family member\" as a spouse, domestic partner, child, parent, sibling, in-law, nephew, niece, aunt, uncle, cousin, or grand/great relative. It also defines \"firefighter\" and \"interment right\" related to plot usage for human remains. The interment right allows the owner to control the use of a plot for human remains, including determining who can be interred and managing memorial markers. It is a transferable property interest governed by specific regulations. An interment right is a transferable property interest governed by specific regulations, including definitions for \"nonresident,\" \"peace officer,\" \"principal county,\" and \"voter.\" Interment rights, defined in Section 9069.10 of the Health and Safety Code, do not allow for disinterment of human remains without consent from the cemetery district and specific family members. This chapter does not restrict the relocation of remains within the same cemetery or removal by a cemetery district with proper authorization. The cemetery district must maintain a duplicate copy of an order for removal of remains, as well as a record including the date, name, age at death, cemetery, and plot from which the remains were removed. The cemetery district must keep a record of the date, name, age at death, cemetery, and plot from which remains were removed. Additionally, if remains are reinterred, the record should include the plot number, cemetery name, and location of reinterment, or if disposed of elsewhere, a record of the alternate disposition. If reinterred at the cemetery, the date of reinterment should also be documented. If remains are disposed of other than by reinterment, a record of the alternate disposition is required. If reinterred at the cemetery, the date of reinterment must be documented. The person removing the remains must provide a complete copy of the record to the cemetery district. An interment right provides a transferable property interest to the owner listed in the cemetery district records. The owner can designate who can be interred in the plot. The owner of an interment right must designate a successor owner in writing at the time of purchase. The use of a transferred interment right must comply with state and local laws and district board policies. If the owner of an interment right dies without a valid disposition, the right passes according to intestate succession laws. If there are no heirs, the district follows abandonment procedures. When a public cemetery district transfers ownership rights based on an affidavit, they are not liable for any claims unless they had actual knowledge of false information provided. A successor owner of an interment right must sign an affidavit confirming their entitlement, efforts to find other claimants, and lack of opposition. Upon the sale of a cemetery plot, the district must inform the buyer about interment rights, succession of ownership, and district policies. The successor owner must sign an affidavit confirming their entitlement and lack of opposition. The act does not require reimbursement for certain costs incurred by local agencies or school districts related to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes or infractions. The Commission on State Mandates will provide reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for costs mandated by the state, as outlined in the Government Code."
