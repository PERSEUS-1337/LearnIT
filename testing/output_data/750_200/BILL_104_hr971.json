HOMEOWNER RIGHT OF ACTION. Whenever a person carries out an activity authorized by a permit, license, or other approval that generates pollutants causing a significant reduction in the value of private homes, the affected homeowner can take legal action against the responsible party. Any homeowner whose property value is reduced by authorized activity can sue the responsible party. Before filing a lawsuit, the homeowner must give a 30-day notice to the defendant and the relevant agency. The agency can attempt to resolve the claim if requested by either party. In any action under this section, the homeowner must prove that the defendant's activity caused a decrease in the home's value. The agency can mediate a resolution if requested, but the homeowner can still pursue legal action after a 30-day notice period. The homeowner must prove that the defendant's activity caused a decrease in the home's value. Similarly affected homeowners can file class actions in federal court. Homeowners can recover the reduction in their home's value caused by the defendant's activity. The homeowner can receive compensation for the decrease in their home's value caused by the defendant's activity, not exceeding the median value of nearby homes. They are entitled to attorney's fees and other costs. Injunctions can be issued for violations of Federal statutes.

An activity that generates pollutants or adverse impacts may reduce the value of a private home if it causes physical damage or unreasonable interference with its use and enjoyment. (3) Private home is defined as any owner-occupied dwelling, including multi-family dwellings and condominiums. (4) Reduction in value for a private home affected by certain activities refers to the difference in fair market value caused by those activities.
