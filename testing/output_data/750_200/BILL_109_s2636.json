The \"Oil Company Accountability Act\" introduces an Energy Tax Rebate under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Each individual is treated as having made a $500 payment against the tax for the 2006 taxable year, to be remitted by the Secretary within 30 days. Certain individuals with no adjusted gross income or exceeding $120,000 are not eligible for this rebate. The Oil Company Accountability Act excludes individuals with no income or AGI over $120,000, those eligible for a deduction under section 151, estates, trusts, and nonresident aliens from the Energy Tax Rebate. Amendments are made to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
