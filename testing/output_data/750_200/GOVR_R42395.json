The Democratic critique of the Republicans' management of the House during their majority was primarily focused on ethics and conduct. The majority control in Congress from the 104th to the 109th Congress was driven by concerns over ethics and legislative management. Democrats made changes to ethics rules and laws when they took control in the 110th Congress. Incremental rules changes were made by Democrats in the 110th and 111th Congresses regarding legislative management.

In the 106th Congress, Democrats proposed new clauses to the Code of Ethics to prevent Members from intervening in hiring processes based on political affiliation and to prohibit leadership from threatening lobbying firms based on political contributions. These changes were aimed at addressing concerns about the K Street Project. In the 108th Congress, the Republican rules package included provisions from a bipartisan agreement on ethics rules but also made three changes that the Democratic motion sought to eliminate. These changes allowed limited income from medical practice by Members who were doctors or dentists, permitted gifts of perishable food to House offices, and exempted certain activities from ethics rules. The Republican rules package for the 109th Congress made changes to the Standards of Official Conduct Committee procedures, which Democrats criticized as weakening ethical standards in the House. Republicans defended the changes as ensuring a Member's right to counsel and presumption of innocence, while Democrats argued it would render the ethics committee ineffective. Democrats opposed changes to the ethics committee procedures in the Republican rules package for the 109th Congress, arguing it would weaken ethical standards. They criticized rules allowing indicted Members to hold leadership positions and sought to remove a provision dismissing ethics complaints after 45 days. In response to changes in ethics rules during the 109th Congress, Democrats criticized the weakening of ethical standards and pushed for reinstating previous rules. They also proposed various programs for enhancing ethics standards, with Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi releasing the \"New Direction for America\" plan in June 2006. In June 2006, Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi released the Democrats' \"New Direction for America,\" which included measures such as banning gifts and travel from lobbyists, doubling the lobbying cooling-off period to two years, and requiring lobbyists to disclose campaign contributions and client fees. The House rules reform includes increased disclosure requirements for campaign contributions and client fees, electronic filing, certification of ethics rule compliance, criminal penalties for violations, restrictions on lobbying firms influencing hiring decisions, disclosure of outside employment negotiations, open conference committee meetings, conferees voting on agreements, disclosure of earmarks, and electronic posting of conference reports before House consideration.

This included proposals for individual votes on Budget Act waivers and amendments to remove provisions on \"dynamic estimates\" of tax legislation and content restrictions on appropriations bills. In the 106th and 108th Congresses, Democrats proposed rules changes related to budgetary impact, including a pay-as-you-go rule and the removal of provisions on tax legislation estimates and appropriations bill content. In the 108th Congress, Democrats proposed amendments to rules resolutions seeking to eliminate procedural changes, such as replacing a \"tax complexity analysis\" with a \"macroeconomic impact analysis\" in committee reports. In the 106th Congress, Democrats proposed amendments to committee rules, including granting voting rights to the Delegate from the District of Columbia in the Committee of the Whole and reformulating legislation drafting to make changes to existing law more discernible. In the 108th Congress, a Democratic motion sought to strike changes to House rules proposed by Republicans, including allowing committees to postpone votes, permitting motions to instruct conferees after specific timeframes, and extending the days for motions to suspend the rules. The motion to commit in the 108th Congress addressed transparency issues in the legislative process by reducing waivers in special rules, allowing more amendments, and extending the days for motions to suspend the rules.

Democrats criticized Republican legislative management and proposed changes, including \"New House Principles\" and \"New Direction for America.\" Nancy Pelosi announced House Democrats' \"New House Principles: A Congress for All Americans\" and \"New Direction for America\" in June. The proposals focus on regular consultations between party leaders, a predictable schedule, and meetings between committee members and staff.

The report criticized the special rules used in the House, emphasizing the importance of a deliberative process with hearings, debates, and amendments to develop legislation deserving of the people's support. The \"Broken Promises\" report in 1994 criticized special rules used in the House, recommending more serious amendments and bills considered under open rules to increase accountability and budget discipline in federal spending. The curr_chunk discusses the need for more bills to be considered under open rules, allowing for debate and up-or-down votes. It also suggests increasing the percentage of bills debated under open rules and decreasing those passed under closed rules. Additionally, it calls for more consideration of major, controversial legislation and fewer suspension bills to allow for expanded debate time and amendments. The Republican leadership should expand debate time and quantity of amendments on bills by restricting suspensions to Mondays and Tuesdays. Regular order should be the rule, not the exception, and Members should have three days to read conference reports. Representative Slaughter and other Democratic members of the Rules Committee support these changes. The Democratic members of the Rules Committee, led by Representative Slaughter, introduced a resolution (H.Res. 686) to end the practice of granting 'blanket waivers' to conference reports and to promote transparency, accountability, and oversight in House rules. The resolution aims to require disclosure of scope violations, prohibit special rules from waiving points of order against violations, and ensure proper consideration of scope violations.

During the 2008 presidential campaign, Senator Barack Obama addressed reform issues related to Congressional procedures and practices, emphasizing the need for transparency in lawmaking to prevent pork-barrel projects and corporate welfare from being slipped into laws unnoticed. Obama pledged to make meetings where laws are written more open to the public to eliminate secrecy.

In response to the Republican rules package for the new Congress, Democrats proposed an amendment to overturn a provision exempting certain tax laws from the operation of the Statutory. The amendment proposed by Democrats aims to overturn a provision exempting certain tax laws from the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act, which limits mandatory spending and tax breaks that increase deficits. It is seen as a way to bypass the pay-as-you-go law signed by President Obama and allow for special interest tax breaks that add to the deficit. The proposed rule change eliminates restrictions on adding to the deficit through special interest tax breaks.

Rules changes in the 116th Congress are expected to be incremental, considering the party majority's size and composition while balancing minority prerogatives with the need to govern effectively. The House majority party in the 116th Congress needs to consider balancing majority control of the Senate, party arrangements, and the effectiveness of the President and Congress over the past 30 years. President Clinton, President George W. Bush, President Obama, and President Trump all faced different party arrangements in Congress during their presidencies. Success and failure with major policy initiatives occurred under each arrangement. During his presidency, Trump faced Republican control of both chambers.
