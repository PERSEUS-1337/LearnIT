    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Commercial Motor Vehicle Advanced Safety Technology Tax Act of 2007\". Congress finds that commercial motor vehicle crashes are a major concern in the United States, especially with the increasing number of trucks and their role in transporting hazardous materials. A 2004 report showed that crashes involving large trucks are 2.6 times more likely to result in fatalities compared to passenger cars. The number of fatalities from large truck crashes is a significant portion of all crash fatalities. In 2005, 5,212 individuals died and 114,000 were injured in large truck-related crashes in the United States, totaling 25,533 fatalities from 2001 to 2005. These crashes also have a significant economic cost on society, as estimated by the Department of Transportation. The Department of Transportation estimates that highway crashes cost society $230.6 billion a year, with an average cost of $91,112 for each crash involving a truck over 10,000 pounds. Investments in advanced safety systems by vehicle suppliers and manufacturers have led to improved safety technologies. Motorcoach manufacturers have developed advanced safety systems and technologies to address commercial vehicle crash scenarios. The Department of Transportation aims to reduce the traffic fatality rate, and the use of these safety technologies can help achieve this goal. Congress aims to increase the deployment of advanced safety technologies on commercial motor vehicles through tax incentives to reduce injuries and fatalities on the nation's roads. The new section SEC. 45O provides a tax credit for commercial vehicles equipped with advanced safety systems to reduce injuries and fatalities on the roads. The new section SEC. 45O offers a tax credit for qualified commercial vehicle advanced safety systems. The credit is 50% of the system's cost, not exceeding $1,500 per system or $3,500 per vehicle. The tax credit for qualified commercial vehicle advanced safety systems is limited to $3,500 per vehicle, reduced by prior credits received. The maximum credit per taxpayer for the taxable year is $350,000. For the purposes of this section, a qualified commercial vehicle advanced safety system refers to a system installed on a qualified commercial vehicle that includes brake stroke monitoring, lane departure warning, collision warning, or vehicle stability systems. The system can also be identified by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration as significantly enhancing safety or security. The qualified commercial vehicle advanced safety system must be certified by the manufacturer before installation on the vehicle. The system should be appropriate for the make, type, and model of the vehicle. The qualified commercial vehicle advanced safety system must be appropriate for the make, type, and model of the vehicle and function as designed when properly installed. If the system is not installed by the manufacturer or an authorized installer, it must be certified by the installer to be properly installed and functioning before the vehicle is used for its intended purpose. The qualified commercial vehicle advanced safety system must be properly installed and functioning before the vehicle is used for its intended purpose. The system must be used by the taxpayer for the first time, and depreciation or amortization is allowed. A qualified commercial vehicle is defined as a highway motor vehicle used to transport persons. A qualified commercial vehicle is a highway motor vehicle used to transport persons or property in commerce. It must have a gross combination weight rating or gross vehicle weight rating of 26,001 pounds or more, or a seating capacity of at least 15 individuals (excluding the driver). A qualified commercial vehicle must have a seating capacity of at least 11 individuals (excluding the driver) and be intended for use as a school bus or an intercity/local bus. The term 'brake stroke monitoring system' refers to an onboard system for air-braked vehicles. The term 'brake stroke monitoring system' refers to an onboard system for air-braked vehicles that uses electronic sensors to detect brake issues and alerts the driver. The term 'lane departure warning system' alerts the driver of unintended lane departures. The 'lane departure warning system' alerts drivers of unintended lane departures, while the 'collision warning system' warns of potential collision risks. The 'vehicle stability system' is an active safety system. The term 'vehicle stability system' refers to an active safety system that intervenes in high-risk situations by automatically adjusting vehicle speed or applying brakes to prevent rollover or directional instability. Controlled groups are defined as all persons treated as a single employer under specific subsections. For tax purposes, controlled groups are treated as a single taxpayer. Special rules include reducing the basis of property by the amount of any allowable credit. The basis of property for which a credit is allowed is reduced by the amount of the credit. Regulations provide for recapturing credits if the property is no longer eligible. No credit is allowed for property used outside the United States or certain specified property. The text chunk discusses the treatment of property used by tax-exempt entities in relation to qualified commercial vehicles with advanced safety systems. The seller of the property is treated as the taxpayer placing it in service if certain conditions are met. The taxpayer must disclose the amount of any credit allowable for qualified commercial vehicles with advanced safety systems. If the taxpayer elects not to take the credit, no credit will be allowed. The taxpayer must provide supporting documentation for any qualified commercial vehicle advanced safety system to claim the credit. This documentation must include details about the type of system to be installed on the vehicle. The taxpayer must provide documentation identifying the type of advanced safety system to be installed on the vehicle and the purchase or installation date. The certification required under subsection (c)(2) must also be included. If a certification is required under subsection (c)(3), it must be provided at the time of installation. The certification required under subsection (c)(2) and, if applicable, subsection (c)(3) must be provided at the time of installation. This section does not apply to property placed in service after December 31, 2012. The general business credit under section 38 of the Code is amended to include the new paragraph. The Code is amended to include a new paragraph for the commercial vehicle advanced safety system credit under section 45O(a). Conforming amendments are made to sections 1016(a) and 6501(m) of the Code. The Code is amended to include a new paragraph for the commercial vehicle advanced safety system credit under section 45O(a), with additional amendments to sections 1016(a) and 6501(m) of the Code. The amendments made by this section provide a credit for commercial vehicle advanced safety systems, effective for property placed in service after the enactment of this Act."
