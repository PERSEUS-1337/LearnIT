    "content": "The Act titled \"Conventional Arms Threat Reduction Act of 2004\" is cited as the short title. The findings and sense of Congress are outlined in the following sections. The global proliferation of MANPADS, small arms, light weapons, and tactical missile systems poses a direct threat to US national security. Their use by terrorists hampers peace efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the spread of missile systems threatens international peace and security. The Government Accountability Office estimates that there are 500,000 to 750,000 MANPADS worldwide. Many countries have these weapons but lack the means to eliminate or secure them, posing a threat to international peace and security. The United States lacks a program to address conventional arms threat reduction and tactical missile elimination in other countries. The Department of State has not used the Nonproliferation and Disarmament Fund for this purpose since 2002. Congress believes the US should assist countries in securing, removing, or eliminating such systems. The United States Government should provide assistance to countries in securing, removing, or eliminating stocks of MANPADS, conventional weapons, and tactical missile systems to combat proliferation threats. Additionally, there should be a focus on combating the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons within the broader nonproliferation strategy. The United States aims to help other countries safeguard or eliminate MANPADS, conventional weapons, and tactical missile systems that pose a proliferation threat. This is part of a global program to address the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons within the broader nonproliferation strategy. The Secretary of State is authorized to implement a global program to secure, remove, or eliminate stocks of MANPADS, conventional weapons, and tactical missile systems that pose a proliferation threat. This program may include activities such as humanitarian demining, destruction of small arms and light weapons, and securing or eliminating tactical missile systems and MANPADS. Programs for the elimination or securing of tactical missile systems and MANPADS, as well as assistance with safe handling and storage of these weapons, are authorized. Cooperative programs with international organizations are also supported for this purpose. The curr_chunk discusses the utilization of funds for the elimination or safeguarding of MANPADS, conventional weapons, and tactical missile systems, as well as the management of these weapons at locations where US funds have been used for security. Actions are also taken to ensure equipment and funds for security upgrades at storage locations for these weapons. The Secretary of State determines security upgrades for storage locations of MANPADS, conventional weapons, and tactical missile systems to prevent proliferation threats. The Department of State establishes an Office of Conventional Arms Threat Reduction to formulate policy and administer programs for reducing conventional arms threats. Additionally, a report on conventional arms threat reduction is required. The Secretary of State must submit a report on conventional arms threat reduction to congressional committees within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The report will detail prior Department of State efforts, progress in establishing the Office of Conventional Arms Threat Reduction, and country-specific descriptions of the threat reduction efforts. The report on conventional arms threat reduction must include a country-by-country description of the global strategy for eliminating or safeguarding MANPADS and other weapons, along with an evaluation of the effectiveness of US programs in this area. The report required under subsection (a) shall include an evaluation of the integration of activities under this Act and other US programs to ensure consistency with US policy in countries receiving assistance, as well as a description of US programs related to the elimination of tactical missile systems. SEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. $50,000,000 authorized for the President in fiscal year 2005. Limitation: $10,000,000 cannot be obligated until the Secretary of State submits the required report. SEC. 8. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"appropriate congressional committees\" refer to specific committees in the Senate and House of Representatives. \"Nonproliferation and Disarmament Fund\" is defined as a fund established under a specific section of the FREEDOM Support Act. \"Small arms and light weapons\" include various types of firearms.
