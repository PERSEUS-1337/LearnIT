    "content": "The Act titled \"Hydrographic Services Improvement Act Amendments of 2007\" redesignates sections and adds new findings and purposes. The Congress finds that in 2007, the Survey of the Coast, established by President Thomas Jefferson in 1807, evolved into the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, providing research, development, and services for safe navigation along the coastline. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration provides services related to hydrographic surveying, cartography, tides, currents, and maintaining a national spatial reference system to support marine transportation and international trade. The Nation's marine transportation system is vital for international trade and commerce, but is becoming increasingly congested. The volume of maritime commerce is expected to double in the next 20 years, with nearly half of the cargo in U.S. waters being oil or other hazardous substances. Hydrographic data and services also support national needs for the Great Lakes. Hydrographic data and services support national needs for the Great Lakes, coastal waters, territorial sea, Exclusive Economic Zone, and continental shelf of the United States. This includes emergency response, homeland security, marine resource conservation, coastal resiliency, ocean and coastal science advancement, and integrated ocean observing system. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, along with other agencies and states, establishes and maintains national standards for hydrographic data. The Director of NOAA's Office of Coast Survey serves as the U.S. National Hydrographer and represents the U.S. in the international hydrographic community. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, through its hydrographic expertise, provides the authoritative basis for boundary demarcation and jurisdiction, including the Exclusive Economic Zone. Research and development of new technologies will enhance efficiency in this area. The Act aims to enhance efficiency, competitiveness, and safety through the research, development, and application of new technologies in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to support international trade and commerce. The Act aims to provide accurate hydrographic data and services for safe international trade, interstate commerce, homeland security, emergency response, and coastal resiliency. The Act aims to promote resiliency by providing hydrographic data and services for various applications such as storm surge, tsunami monitoring, coastal flooding, and pollution trajectory predictions. It also supports research and development in integrated ocean and coastal mapping and observations. The Act aims to enhance hydrographic data and services through research and development, promote national and international leadership in hydrographic technologies. SEC. 4. CHANGES IN DEFINITIONS. Section 303 of the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 is amended to define hydrographic data as information acquired through various surveying methods for providing hydrographic services. The Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 is amended to include the management, maintenance, interpretation, certification, and dissemination of various types of data for producing nautical charts and other products. The Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 is amended to include the definition of the Coast and Geodetic Survey Act, which outlines the functions and duties of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. SEC. 5. Changes in functions of the Administrator. Section 304 of the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 is amended to fulfill data gathering and dissemination duties under the Coast and Geodetic Survey Act, promote safe marine transportation, and fulfill the purposes of the Act. The Geodetic Survey Act is amended to provide hydrographic services and fulfill data gathering duties to promote safe marine transportation. The Administrator may procure, operate vessels, equipment, and technologies for safe navigation and hydrographic data acquisition. They shall design and maintain real-time hydrographic monitoring systems to enhance navigation safety and efficiency. The Administrator may acquire hydrographic data and provide services to support conservation, manage coastal resources, save lives, protect property, and resume commerce during emergencies. The Administrator has the authority to create joint centers, enter contracts, leases, grants, or agreements to support emergency response, disaster recovery, homeland security, and maritime awareness needs. The Administrator has the authority to award contracts for hydrographic data acquisition in accordance with the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949. Changes to quality assurance program and hydrographic services review panel are being made in accordance with the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998. Section 306 of the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 is amended to change subsection numbers and membership composition of the hydrographic services review panel. The Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 is amended to change the membership composition of the hydrographic services review panel, with voting members being individuals qualified in disciplines related to hydrographic data and services. The term \"Secretary\" is replaced with \"Administrator\" in certain subsections. The Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 is amended to change the membership composition of the hydrographic services review panel. Voting members will now be reimbursed for expenses incurred in the performance of their duties. The Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998 is amended to authorize appropriations of $168,771,000 in fiscal year 2008 and subsequent years for carrying out the Act."
