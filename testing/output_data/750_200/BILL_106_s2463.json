    "content": "The Act titled \"National Death Penalty Moratorium Act of 2000\" establishes a moratorium on the death penalty. Congress finds that death sentences are disproportionately imposed on the poor and certain racial and ethnic groups, with the majority of individuals facing capital charges unable to afford their own attorney. Additionally, no state has met the standards set by the American Bar Association for providing counsel to indigent prisoners. Since 1976, African-Americans have been disproportionately represented in executions, death row populations, and victims of the death penalty, despite making up only 13% of the population. In death penalty cases, 84% of victims are white, even though they only make up 50% of murder victims.
