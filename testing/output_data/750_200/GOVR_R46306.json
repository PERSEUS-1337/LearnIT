    "content": "In recent years, there has been interest in increasing financial support for non-degree instructional and work-based learning programs for individuals beyond high school age. These programs include apprenticeships, college certificate programs, and courses leading to professional certificates or licensure. Demand for these programs is expected to continue. There is a demand for non-degree programs and courses leading to professional certificates or licensure. Jobs that require training or postsecondary education but not a college degree are increasing. Despite over $100 billion in federal financial aid for postsecondary education, most of it is not accessible to many individuals. Despite the availability of over $100 billion in federal financial aid for postsecondary education, a significant proportion of individuals pursuing non-degree programs are unable to access these funds. Some schools are exploring innovative approaches to boost enrollment and revenue by targeting adults interested in short programs that lead to quick reentry into the workforce or higher earnings. Congress may need to consider viable options to meet the demand for workers with postsecondary non-degree credentials. Several proposals have emerged to increase federal support for students pursuing short-term non-degree programs, such as allowing Pell Grants for these programs. The College Affordability Act (H.R. 4674) was ordered reported by the House Committee on Education and Labor in October 2019. The College Affordability Act (H.R. 4674) aims to expand Pell Grants for short-term non-degree programs to help individuals gain skills for the changing economy and increase economic growth. The President's FY2021 budget proposed expanding Pell Grants to short-term programs not currently eligible, supported by education and business organizations. Concerns exist about promoting non-degree programs and increasing financial support for students pursuing them. Some stakeholders express concerns about promoting non-degree programs and increasing financial support for students pursuing them, citing worries about program quality, high federal costs, the need for student supports and business coordination, and the potential perpetuation of income inequalities. Some stakeholders have raised concerns about promoting non-degree programs, citing worries about program quality, high costs, the need for student supports and business coordination, and the potential perpetuation of income inequalities. Additionally, there are questions about the diminishing labor market returns over time for some technical non-degree programs and the fact that some non-degree educational programs may not be required or preferred by employers. Employers are increasingly relying on degrees when establishing hiring requirements. Employers prefer degrees over non-degree credentials, leading to challenges in securing employment for non-degree holders. Adults with degrees in positions not requiring a degree may crowd out non-degree holders in some occupations. In 2018, 28% of jobs required a degree, while 42% of adults had one. This report outlines federal programs supporting individuals in training. This report provides an overview of federal programs supporting individuals in non-degree training and education programs, addressing employer demand and key characteristics of such programs. The report discusses non-degree programs, including work-based learning and formal instructional programs. It details six federal programs and three tax benefits that support students in non-degree education. The descriptions highlight gaps, limitations, eligibility requirements, and federal oversight. The report provides data on employment and wages based on entry-level education requirements for non-degree programs, highlighting the importance of financial support for individuals pursuing training and postsecondary education in non-degree programs. In May 2018, around 6.2% of national jobs required a non-degree postsecondary credential for entry-level education. This data gives insight into the market for non-degree credentials, but does not cover the full impact of completing non-degree programs on the labor market and society. The Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics assigns entry-level education requirements for occupations it tracks, with mean annual wages varying across education categories. However, these wages do not capture differences within categories, leading to potential earnings differentials. Postsecondary non-degree programs offer training primarily to individuals beyond typical secondary education age, preparing them for specific occupations. Research shows earnings premiums for various certificate programs, including long-term certificates, technical certificates (e.g., electronics), health certificates, and those from community colleges. Postsecondary non-degree programs are designed for individuals beyond typical secondary education age to prepare them for specific occupations. These programs can be classified as instructional or work-based learning, with a combination of postsecondary courses or curriculum to achieve educational or professional goals without earning a degree upon completion. Non-degree instructional programs prepare individuals for specialized jobs and general employment by offering postsecondary courses or curriculum. Upon completion, individuals receive a postsecondary educational certificate as a credential. People pursue these programs to expand knowledge and skills. Non-degree instructional programs are pursued for various reasons such as expanding knowledge and skills, preparing for further education or employment, and seeking promotion. These programs exclude postbaccalaureate certificates and transfer programs, which provide education for at least two academic years towards a bachelor's degree. Non-degree instructional programs should not be confused with certifications and licenses for occupational purposes. Non-degree instructional programs are different from certifications and licenses, which are occupational credentials. Certifications demonstrate competency in an occupation, while licenses are required for certain professions. Some certifications and licenses may require completion of a non-degree instructional program. Various entities offer non-degree instructional programs, including traditional postsecondary educational institutions like colleges and universities. Non-degree instructional programs are offered by a variety of entities, including traditional postsecondary educational institutions like colleges and universities, as well as trade, vocational, and technical schools. In fall 2018, nearly 1.9 million non-degree seeking undergraduate students were enrolled in these programs across almost 3,000 institutions of higher education. Additionally, businesses, professional organizations, trade unions, nonprofit organizations, governments, museums, bootcamps, hospitals, the military, and over 4,500 for-profit non-traditional postsecondary educational institutions also offer non-degree instructional programs. One study estimated over 4,500 for-profit non-traditional postsecondary educational institutions enrolling almost 670,000 students in AY 2009-2010. Non-degree instructional programs vary in length, related to curriculum requirements, industry expectations, and skills instilled. Program length may be affected by entities requiring minimum educational hours for employment or certification. The program duration can be influenced by federal, state, and private entities setting minimum educational hours for employment or certification. Programs can be offered in various formats such as classrooms, online, or through a combination of methods. Students are responsible for funding the program costs, living expenses, and potential lost wages. Students are responsible for funding the cost of a program, including tuition and fees, living expenses, and potential lost wages. Program costs vary depending on the length, resource requirements, and provider. In non-degree instructional programs, there is a distinction between credit courses and noncredit courses, but courses with the same vocational objective and industry recognition may be offered. Credit courses and programs can be offered for credit or noncredit, depending on the institution. Completing credit courses earns transferable credits towards other programs. Credit programs are approved by accrediting entities and have stricter requirements. Noncredit programs offer a broader range of topics, are less expensive, and can be quickly adapted to industry needs. They do not lead to credit programs but may provide vocational certificates or continuing education units. Noncredit programs cover a broader range of topics, can be quickly modified to industry needs, and may satisfy career entry requirements. Enrollment data from nine colleges showed 38% in noncredit courses: vocational (18%), ABE (9%), ESL (7%), and GED (4%). National data on non-degree programs is incomplete. National data on non-degree programs like ABE, ESL, and GED is incomplete, with some states and the federal government not collecting data on noncredit programs. A 2016 survey found that 8% of adults aged 16-65 had a postsecondary certificate. Educational institutions participating in federal student aid programs awarded almost 1 million for-credit non-degree undergraduate credentials and approximately 3 million undergraduate degrees. In AY2017-2018, federal student aid programs awarded almost 1 million for-credit non-degree undergraduate credentials and approximately 3 million undergraduate degrees. Work-based learning involves training individuals in workplace skills through time spent at an employer's worksite or a simulated work location. Work-based learning encompasses various forms of training, such as on-the-job training, apprenticeships, internships, and cooperative programs. Earn and learn programs provide wages or remuneration and are overseen by the Department of Labor. Earn and learn programs, known as RA programs, are a unique form of work-based learning overseen by the Department of Labor. These programs must be registered with DOL or a DOL-approved state agency, meeting federal standards. Registration includes a work process schedule outlining competencies and how OJT and/or related instruction will lead to proficiency. Programs are reviewed every five years to ensure compliance. The registration agency must review work-based learning programs every five years to ensure compliance. Programs may be deregistered for persistent failure. Various entities can offer work-based learning, including employers, labor unions, training providers, educational institutions, or partnerships. Work-based learning can be offered by various entities such as labor unions, training providers, educational institutions, or partnerships. Programs like summer internships provide informal or formal training opportunities, while Registered Apprenticeship (RA) programs require at least 2,000 hours of supervised on-the-job training and typically last four years. Registered Apprenticeship (RA) programs typically last one to six years, with most being four years in duration. These programs can take a time-based or competency-based approach, or a hybrid of both. Related instruction is included to supplement on-the-job training, with costs primarily covered by the provider. The costs of work-based learning programs are primarily borne by the provider, but trainees may need to cover living costs. Program costs include lost work time, trainer fees, and trainee wages. Trainees may need to pay for related instruction or other costs. Those not receiving remuneration must provide for their own expenses. The data on employer-provided training in the 1990s is limited and varies in methodology. Most establishments offer some form of training, but details differ among surveys. In the 1990s, government surveys showed that 16% to 70% of workers received employer-provided training. A 2016 survey found that 21% of adults aged 16-65 completed work-based learning programs, with healthcare and teaching being the most common fields. In FY2019, there were approximately 633,000 active apprentices in 25,000 programs reported by the DOL. In FY2019, DOL reported about 633,000 active apprentices in 25,000 programs, with 81,000 completing a program. The construction industry has the largest share of apprenticeships, but they are also available in manufacturing and transportation. The federal government supports individuals in training and education for workforce entry and personal growth, with no exclusive focus on promoting training or education. The federal government supports individuals in training and education for workforce entry and personal growth through various programs, including the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) Title I program. These programs do not exclusively focus on promoting training or education through non-degree programs. The design and implementation of federal programs differ in aspects such as the choice and monitoring of non-degree programs. The federal government supports training and education through programs like the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) Title I program, federal student aid programs, federal tax benefits, and veterans educational assistance. WIOA Title I subsidizes training costs, while federal student aid programs provide grants and loans for postsecondary education. The Higher Education Act (HEA) and Internal Revenue Code provide financial support for postsecondary education. The Department of Veterans Affairs offers programs like the Post-9/11 GI Bill and VET TEC for educational assistance. Courses (VET TEC) provide financial support for students to pursue educational and training programs. Two programs, SNAP Employment & Training and TANF, offer education and training opportunities for individuals at risk. The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, administered by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), allows states to use funds for workforce development through training and education. The report highlights federal programs supporting students in non-degree programs, focusing on key design elements and differences among programs. Title I of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) is a primary federal workforce development program. WIOA Title I is the primary federal workforce development legislation aimed at increasing coordination among federal programs. It is administered by DOL and funded through discretionary appropriations to increase employment, retention, earnings, and postsecondary credentials attainment for participants, improving the workforce quality and reducing welfare dependency. The Adult and Dislocated Worker Employment and Training Activities program under WIOA Title I provides formula grants to states for improving workforce quality, reducing welfare dependency, and meeting employer skill requirements. Funds are allocated to local Workforce Development Boards for establishing One-Stop delivery systems, providing career and training services, building relationships with employers, and developing industry sectors. The WIOA program serves five main purposes: establishing a One-Stop delivery system, providing career and training services, building relationships with employers, and developing industry partnerships. Participants have consumer choice and access to basic and individualized career services. Eligible participants can pursue training opportunities. The WIOA program offers career services and training opportunities to eligible participants. Training can be pursued at an Eligible Training Provider of choice listed on the state's ETPL. The WIOA program supports training activities at recognized postsecondary credential providers or other training providers. Training must be for in-demand occupations in the local area, region, or areas with high growth potential. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) program supports training activities at recognized postsecondary credential providers or other training providers for in-demand occupations with high growth potential. Local areas under WIOA may reserve up to 20% of funds for incumbent worker training. The program aims to provide industry-recognized certificates, licenses, degrees, or employment opportunities through structured training services. Under WIOA, up to 20% of adult and dislocated worker funds can be reserved for incumbent worker training. The program offers universal access to career services for adults aged 18 and older, regardless of qualifying characteristics. Individualized career services are provided to help individuals secure and maintain employment. Training eligibility is based on the individual's likelihood or ability to participate. Under WIOA, individuals must be unlikely or unable to obtain or retain employment leading to economic self-sufficiency to be eligible for training services. They need to have the skills for successful training, choose a service linked to a local occupation, and not be able to receive other grant assistance. These determinations are made by a One-Stop operator. Priority for career and training services is given to individuals who are unlikely or unable to obtain employment leading to economic self-sufficiency, have the necessary skills for training, choose a service linked to a local occupation, and cannot receive other grant assistance. One-Stop operators assess and evaluate individuals to determine eligibility for training services. Under WIOA, priority for career and training services is given to recipients of public assistance, low-income individuals, and those with basic skills deficiencies. Local Workforce Development Boards, in consultation with the state's governor, determine fund allocation among these groups. Training can be provided through Individual Training Accounts (ITAs) or contracts for services, with funds also allowed for supportive services and needs-related payments. WIOA allows for funds to be used for supportive services and needs-related payments to enable individuals to participate in training. When deemed eligible by a One-Stop operator, individuals can choose training services from the ETPL, establishing an ITA for payment to the ETP. Local WDBs can set limits on training type, duration, and ITA amounts based on individual circumstances. Local WDBs have the authority to set limits on training type, duration, and ITA amounts for WIOA participants. ITA funds can be used for non-degree instructional and degree programs, as well as supportive services like transportation and child care to enable participation in training. Local WDBs may provide training through a contract for services, including work-based learning. The contract is an agreement between the WDB and an employer or RA sponsor for occupational training for a WIOA participant in exchange for reimbursement. This option can be used if consumer choice requirements are met, and there is a lack of training providers in the area to meet ITA requirements. Local WDBs may contract training services for WIOA participants with barriers to employment, reimbursing up to 50% of the wage rate to employers for occupational training. This option is used when there are insufficient training providers in the area to meet ITA requirements or for in-demand occupations. Local WDBs can reimburse OJT providers for up to 50% of a participant's wage rate through a contract. RA sponsors can also be reimbursed for up to 75% of an apprentice's wages. States are responsible for developing the ETPL, while local WDBs and One-Stop operators administer training programs and payments to providers. Quality assurance for providers is ensured through eligibility processes. Quality assurance for training providers is established through initial and continued eligibility processes. The governor and state WDB set criteria for funding eligible training services in local workforce areas. Non-RA providers must apply for initial eligibility, and existing providers must maintain continued eligibility. WIOA provides general requirements for training providers, with local WDBs having discretion on specific factors such as the duration of OJT contracts. The length of OJT contracts is determined by the local WDB based on participant's work experience and service strategy. WIOA requires consideration of individual characteristics and training relevance for employer eligibility for funding. ETPs and states must report program participation and outcomes, while RA programs are exempt from ETP performance reporting. Providers must submit eligibility updates to the governor every two years for continued approval. Providers must submit performance and cost information every two years to the governor for continued eligibility under WIOA Title I. This includes data on program participants' employment status, earnings, credential attainment, and program exit. Providers must submit performance and cost information every two years to the governor for continued eligibility under WIOA Title I. This includes data on program participants' employment status, earnings, credential attainment, and program exit. States are required to publish annual ETP performance reports with specific information on program completion rates and postsecondary credentials received by participants. States must publish annual ETP performance reports detailing the total number of participants in WIOA Title I programs, participants who exited training services, and average cost per participant. Reports must also include data on participants with barriers to employment served by WIOA Title I programs. The ETP performance reports for WIOA Title I programs must include data on participants with barriers to employment, disaggregated by program of study, subpopulation, race, ethnicity, sex, and age. Recent data shows 955,094 adult participants and 469,572 dislocated worker participants in work-based learning, with the majority being age 30 and over. In 2017, data shows 955,094 adult participants and 469,572 dislocated worker participants in WIOA Title I programs. The majority are age 30 and over, unemployed or have received a layoff notice. Many have no postsecondary education experience, but a notable percentage have a degree. In program year 2018, fewer than 20% of participants engage in work-based learning, while over 66% pursue skills training or upgrading through non-degree programs. In 2018, fewer than 20% of WIOA Title I participants engage in work-based learning. The majority pursue skills training through non-degree programs, with healthcare, transportation, and production being popular occupations. The program supports adult entry into the workforce primarily through career services, short-term training, and education. WIOA Title I supports adult entry into the workforce by providing career services and short-term training. Suggestions to enhance support for non-degree training include increasing access to non-degree training, dedicating additional funding for wage reimbursement and ITAs, relaxing the 20% limit on incumbent training, and removing restrictions on recipients obtaining other services. The curr_chunk discusses potential changes to incumbent training and training services, including relaxing restrictions on current workers and eliminating restrictions on obtaining other grant assistance. It also mentions the variability in non-degree program quality due to state and local flexibility in developing the ETPL. The chunk also touches on Title IV of the Higher Education Act, which provides financial assistance to students for higher education at certain institutions. Title IV of the Higher Education Act provides financial assistance for higher education at certain institutions through grants and loans administered by the Department of Education. Key programs include Federal Pell Grants and federal student loans through the Direct Loan program, designed to offer portable aid to students. Title IV of the Higher Education Act provides portable aid through Pell Grants and Direct Loan program loans, available to all eligible individuals regardless of congressional appropriations. Pell Grants are considered a quasi-entitlement, while Direct Loans are a mandatory entitlement for budgetary purposes. The Pell Grant program is a quasi-entitlement that allows eligible students to receive their entitled award regardless of discretionary appropriations levels. Pell Grants and Direct Loans can be used for Title IV-eligible programs offered by participating institutions, including non-degree instructional and degree programs. Eligibility criteria for programs and institutions include quality assurance measures. Title IV-participating IHEs must meet eligibility criteria, including quality assurance. Non-degree programs must lead to a recognized credential. Title IV aid is not available for noncredit programs. Non-degree work-based learning programs must lead to a recognized credential. Title IV aid is generally not available for noncredit programs. Work-based learning programs must have the OJT portion supervised by an IHE. Non-degree programs have specific durational requirements for Pell Grants. Non-degree programs for Pell Grants and Direct Loan program have specific durational requirements, including weeks of instructional time and clock hours. Pell Grants require at least 15 weeks of instructional time and 600 clock hours, or 10 weeks of instructional time and 300 clock hours. Non-degree programs for Pell Grants and Direct Loan program have specific durational requirements. For the Direct Loan program, non-degree programs must be at least 10 weeks of instructional time and 300-599 clock hours. Students must be enrolled at least half-time in an eligible program to borrow through the Direct Loan program. Non-degree programs at public and private nonprofit institutions that are at least one academic year in length and lead to a certificate are eligible for both Pell Grant and Direct Loan. Non-degree programs at public and private nonprofit institutions that are at least one academic year in length and lead to a certificate are eligible for both Pell Grant and Direct Loan programs, without specific durational requirements. To receive Title IV funds for higher education, students must be enrolled in a Title IV-eligible program, be a U.S. citizen or eligible noncitizen, and have a high school diploma or equivalent. To be eligible for Pell Grants or Direct Loan program loans, individuals must be enrolled in an undergraduate program, not have completed a bachelor's degree, demonstrate financial need, and meet specific criteria. Recipients are subject to a lifetime eligibility cap on Pell Grants. The Pell Grant program has a lifetime eligibility cap of 12 full-time semesters. To receive Direct Loan program loans, students must meet specific criteria and be enrolled at least half-time. Additional eligibility criteria may be required for specific loan types, including Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans for undergraduate students with financial need. The Direct Loan program offers various loan types, including Direct Subsidized Loans for undergraduates with financial need, Direct Unsubsidized Loans for all students, and PLUS Loans for parents and graduate students. New borrowers after July 1, 2013, can only borrow Direct Subsidized Loans for up to 150% of their program length. Eligibility for Title IV aid is determined by statutory rules. The amount of Title IV aid for students is guided by statutory award rules and cannot exceed the cost of attendance (COA), which includes tuition, fees, books, supplies, room and board, transportation, and dependent care expenses. Pell Grant awards are determined without considering other financial assistance eligibility. The Pell Grant award rules determine the grant amount without considering other financial assistance. The maximum Pell Grant award for AY 2020-2021 is $6,345 for full-time students. The award amount may be adjusted based on the student's COA, financial need, enrollment rate, or program duration. Pell Grant awards for non-degree programs may be subject to income taxation. The Pell Grant award amount may be adjusted based on COA, financial need, enrollment rate, or program duration. Pell Grants for non-degree programs may be subject to income taxation. Direct Loan program award rules vary by loan type and other factors. Other financial assistance received by the student must be considered when awarding Direct Loan program loans. When awarding Direct Loan program loans, other financial assistance received by the student must be considered. The amount of Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans awarded cannot exceed statutory annual and aggregate limits based on dependency status and class level. For example, a dependent undergraduate student may borrow up to $5,500 in loans for the first year, while an independent undergraduate student may borrow up to $9,500. The Office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) administers Title IV aid programs, with FSA handling high-level functions like system maintenance and customer service for aid processing. Independent undergraduate students can borrow up to $9,500 in loans in their first year, with prorated amounts for shorter academic programs. The Office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) administers Title IV aid programs, handling functions such as system maintenance, customer service, and ensuring program integrity. Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs) are responsible for day-to-day tasks like verifying student eligibility, calculating aid amounts, disbursing funds, and managing program finances. Additionally, under the Pell Grant program, IHEs receive administrative payments from the Department of Education (ED). The Pell Grant program under the Department of Education (ED) pays administrative costs to participating Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs) for managing program funds. Various provisions in the Higher Education Act (HEA) aim to ensure the quality of Title IV-eligible programs and protect students and taxpayers through the program integrity triad of state authorization, accreditation, and ED certification. State authorization, accreditation, and ED certification are key components of the program integrity triad for Title IV-eligible programs. Non-degree programs may also need to meet gainful employment requirements. Institutions of Higher Education must be authorized to operate within their state to participate in Title IV programs. Compliance with these requirements is essential for program eligibility. An IHE must be authorized by the state to offer postsecondary education for Title IV programs, complying with state approval and licensure requirements. States vary in their approval processes, some approving individual programs while others only require approval of the institution as a whole. Evaluation criteria may include program curricula, objectives, enrollment projections, student outcomes, and justification. To participate in Title IV programs, an IHE must be accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by ED as a reliable authority on education quality. Accrediting agencies review educational institutions for quality assurance. Accrediting agencies are private associations that review educational institutions for quality assurance. An IHE must be accredited by a regional or national accreditor recognized by ED to participate in Title IV programs. The accreditor evaluates if the IHE meets prescribed criteria related to faculty, curricula, facilities, student support services, and student achievement. Accrediting agencies evaluate various aspects of an institution, including faculty, curricula, facilities, student support services, and student achievement. They have discretion in choosing evaluation measures and may assess the institution as a whole or sample programs. Programmatic accreditation is not required for Title IV purposes but can be sought for employer and licensure requirements. To gain programmatic accreditation, an educational program offered by an IHE is evaluated on established standards for the particular field of study. When seeking Title IV participation, an IHE must apply for certification from ED, which evaluates if the institution meets eligibility requirements, including durational requirements. The ED reviews educational programs to determine Title IV eligibility, including durational requirements and completion/placement rates. IHEs can self-certify new programs or submit applications for approval. Non-degree programs must prepare students for gainful employment in a recognized occupation. The Higher Education Act requires new clock-hour programs to apply for approval from the Department of Education. The 2014 gainful employment regulations, which aimed to measure program quality through debt-to-earnings rates, were rescinded in 2019. The regulations were intended to ensure that educational programs lead to sufficient earnings for students to repay their loans. Under the Gainful Employment (GE) framework, educational programs must meet quality standards to ensure students can repay their loans. Programs failing to meet standards may lose Title IV eligibility for three years. Third-party standards, such as accreditation, are also required. No program has lost Title IV eligibility under these rules yet. The rules for Title IV programs require institutions to meet third-party standards, state recognition, programmatic accreditation, and educational prerequisites for professional licensure. Performance measures are not defined by the HEA, but reporting on enrollment, degrees conferred, student charges, and other relevant information is mandatory. Title IV participating IHEs and ED report enrollment, certificates, degrees conferred, student charges, and other relevant information. Data on non-degree instructional for-credit programs is collected annually. In AY2017-2018, 4,618 out of 6,418 Title IV-participating IHEs offered non-degree for-credit programs, with private for-profit IHEs offering half of these programs. In AY2015-2016, approximately 765,000 Pell Grant recipients pursued non-degree credit programs and received about $2.7 billion in Pell Grant awards. Roughly 10% of total recipients and dollar amount of awards went to non-degree programs. Additionally, around 10% of undergraduates who borrowed a Direct Loan were pursuing certificate programs. Support for non-degree programs is limited as Title IV aid is only available to eligible programs. Support for non-degree programs is limited in several ways: Title IV aid is only available to support individuals pursuing credit programs of a specified duration at Title IV-participating IHEs. Some students who may choose to pursue training or education via non-degree programs will not be eligible, including those without a high school diploma or not enrolled in a career pathway program. Non-degree programs have limited support, as Title IV aid is only available for credit programs at Title IV-participating IHEs. Students ineligible for aid include those without a high school diploma, not enrolled in a career pathway program, or with a bachelor's degree for Pell Grants. Program quality is assessed by state authorizers and accreditors, with flexibility in criteria application. State authorization requirements and program quality have been minimally studied. Few reports have examined state authorization requirements and their impact on program quality. The variation among state authorization requirements is seen as a complicating factor in assessing institutional experiences. Researchers have identified potential weaknesses in some states' authorization processes. Researchers have identified potential weaknesses in some states' authorization processes for non-degree programs, including concerns about oversight, input requirements, elongated timeframes, and conflicts across state laws. The state authorization process for educational programs may face challenges such as elongated timeframes, conflicts across state laws, and limited use of student outcomes for renewal decisions. A 2014 GAO report highlighted strengths and weaknesses of the accreditation system, including tailored peer reviews by institutional accreditors and programmatic alignment. The accreditation system has strengths like tailored peer reviews and programmatic alignment. Weaknesses include conflicting interests, lack of resources, and difficulty in assessing innovative education methods. Education tax benefits help offset higher education costs for eligible taxpayers. Education tax benefits, administered by the IRS, provide advantages to upper middle income taxpayers when they file their federal income tax return, offsetting some higher education costs. Taxpayers claim these benefits after paying for education expenses, sometimes months later. Education tax benefits are available to individuals enrolled in degree programs and some non-degree programs, reducing federal revenues rather than increasing outlays. These benefits are considered a form of \"spending through the tax code\" and are not subject to annual appropriations. Eligibility rules vary, but individuals who meet the requirements can claim these benefits on their federal income tax return. Education tax benefits are a form of \"spending through the tax code\" that do not require annual appropriations. Eligible individuals can claim these benefits on their federal income tax return, which may lead to overconsumption of education or subsidize education that would have occurred anyway. Non-degree program taxpayers may qualify for the Lifetime Learning Credit, providing financial assistance for education pursuits. The Lifetime Learning Credit reduces income tax liability for education expenses. Employer Provided Educational Assistance excludes educational costs from taxable income. 529 accounts help save for future education expenses. These benefits can be used for non-degree programs at eligible institutions. The Lifetime Learning Credit and 529 accounts can be used for eligible education expenses related to non-degree programs at Title IV-eligible IHEs. Qualified education expenses for the credit include tuition, books, supplies, and equipment required for enrollment, excluding living expenses. The Lifetime Learning Credit and 529 accounts can cover tuition, books, supplies, and equipment necessary for enrollment in non-degree programs at Title IV-eligible IHEs. Expenses not required for enrollment, like living expenses, must be reduced by tax-free educational assistance. Employer-provided educational assistance can be used for various educational expenses to improve job skills. Tax-free withdrawals from 529 accounts are allowed for qualified expenses, including tuition, fees, books, supplies, and equipment for any form of instruction or training that improves skills. Employer-provided educational assistance can cover up to $5,250 of tuition costs for an employee's course to enhance skills, which is not included in the employee's wage income. The institution providing the program does not have to be a Title IV-eligible IHE. Tax-free withdrawals from 529 accounts are allowed for qualified expenses, including tuition, fees, room and board, books, supplies, equipment, and additional expenses for special needs beneficiaries at a Title IV-eligible IHE. Eligibility for tax benefits depends on filing a federal income tax return or being claimed as a dependent or spouse. Taxpayers can claim a credit for qualified education expenses paid for themselves, spouses, or dependent children. The credit cannot be claimed if filing as married filing separately, if they are nonresident aliens, or if income is $68,000 or more ($136,000 or more if married filing jointly). This tax benefit can only be used if the employer offers an educational assistance program. Beneficiaries of a 529 account are designated at the time of its establishment and funds can be transferred to another 529 account for certain relatives. Taxpayers can claim a credit for qualified education expenses paid for themselves, spouses, or dependent children. The LLC is calculated as 20% of the first $10,000 of qualified education expenses, yielding a maximum credit of $2,000 per taxpayer. The maximum credit amount phases out for taxpayers with income between $58,000 and $68,000 ($116,000 and $136,000 for married joint filers) in 2019. The Lifetime Learning Credit (LLC) is a nonrefundable tax credit of up to $2,000 per taxpayer, which phases out for taxpayers with income between $58,000 and $68,000 ($116,000 and $136,000 for married joint filers) in 2019. If a taxpayer has little to no federal income tax liability, they may receive little to no benefit from the LLC. Employers can provide up to $5,250 in tax-free tuition assistance per year under an employer-sponsored educational assistance program, which is not included in employees' wages. Employees can receive up to $5,250 in tax-free tuition assistance per year under an employer-sponsored educational assistance program. This assistance is not included in their wages and is not subject to federal income taxes or payroll taxes. Taxpayers can withdraw funds from their 529 accounts tax-free to pay for qualifying education expenses for non-degree programs, with restrictions. Taxpayers can transfer child's 529 account balance to certain relatives tax-free. IRS relies on taxpayers, employers, and states for benefit administration. Taxpayers apply for LLC by filing Form 1040 and Form 8863 for education tax credits. Eligibility rules and credit calculation are described in the forms. Course enrollment details are not required. Taxpayers can apply for the Lifetime Learning Credit (LLC) by filing Form 1040 and Form 8863. Eligibility rules and credit calculation are described in the forms. Course enrollment details are not required. Employer's educational assistance program must meet specific requirements to qualify. Funding and IRS approval are not mandatory. Employees can request IRS determination on whether a plan is a qualified program. Programs cannot favor certain employees and must provide reasonable notice of terms. States typically sponsor 529 plans for individuals to establish accounts for beneficiaries. When withdrawing from a 529 plan, taxpayers receive a Form 1099-Q showing the total amount withdrawn and the breakdown between earnings and basis. If funds are used for non-eligible expenses, a portion may be subject to taxation on federal income tax returns. Documentation of how withdrawals are spent is not required unless audited. The IRS does not require documentation of how withdrawals from a 529 plan are spent unless audited. Approximately 0.5% of taxpayers were audited in 2018. The IRS does not have rules regarding the quality of training and education programs for tax benefits. Limited IRS data show that in 2015, 2.5 million taxpayers claimed $2.1 billion in education tax benefits. In 2015, approximately 2.5 million taxpayers claimed $2.1 billion of the LLC education tax credit, with an average credit of $830 per taxpayer. Half of the LLC dollars were claimed by taxpayers with AGI between $50,000 and $200,000. Taxpayers with AGI below $15,000 or over $200,000 generally did not claim the LLC due to its nonrefundability and phase-out. No studies have evaluated the impact of the LLC on enrollment in non-degree programs or its effectiveness in improving job skills. No studies have evaluated the impact of the LLC on enrollment in non-degree programs or its effectiveness in helping non-degree candidates improve their job skills. Data on employer provided educational assistance and 529 plans are unavailable. Survey data suggests that few families have 529 plans, and those who do tend to have higher assets and income. Survey data analyzed by GAO shows that few families have 529 accounts, with those who do having higher assets and income. Research on education tax benefits has shown limited impact on increasing enrollment, indicating potential limitations for non-degree programs. Education tax benefits may provide limited assistance to students unable to afford upfront costs. Determining eligibility for different benefits can be confusing for taxpayers. These benefits only help taxpayers with income tax liabilities, excluding many low-income individuals. Veterans education programs were originally meant to assist former military personnel. Veterans education programs like the GI Bill aim to help former servicemembers transition to civilian life by providing various benefits. These programs have evolved over time to also address issues like compulsory service, veteran unemployment, and military retention. The VET TEC initiative offers alternative education courses for veterans. The VET TEC initiative and GI Bills provide financial assistance for veterans in approved education programs, administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs. The GI Bills and VET TEC, administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs, are funded through mandatory spending. VET TEC receives a limited allocation from GI Bill appropriations. The Post-9/11 GI Bill is the primary program, accounting for 80% or more of total GI Bill participation and spending since FY2013, supporting education and training for veterans. The Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits support education through degree pursuit and also training and education in non-degree programs at various establishments. Eligible programs include credit and noncredit instructional programs, OJT, apprenticeships, and courses leading to specific objectives. VET TEC benefits offer non-degree high-technology programs of education at contracted training providers, focusing on computer programming, software, media application, data processing, and information science. Training providers must meet specific criteria and not offer degrees or charge for the programs. The VET TEC program offers non-degree high-technology programs in computer software, media application, data processing, and information science. Eligible servicemembers and veterans, along with their family members, can access Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits. The program has specific criteria for training providers and eligibility requirements for servicemembers and veterans. Transfer of benefits to family members is also possible. The VET TEC program allows eligible servicemembers and veterans to transfer benefits to family members. To qualify, individuals must be GI Bill-eligible veterans enrolled in a VET TEC-eligible program. Both the Post-9/11 GI Bill and VET TEC provide living stipend payments and cover program costs. The Post-9/11 GI Bill and VET TEC programs provide stipend payments and cover program costs for eligible individuals. The Post-9/11 GI Bill offers educational assistance payments over 36 months, while VET TEC pays costs during and after program pursuit. Counseling services are also available to help individuals make the most of their benefits and achieve their career goals. Transfer of benefits between veterans must be shared within the 36-month entitlement period. Under the Post-9/11 GI Bill, benefit payments depend on an individual's level, program pursued, enrollment rate, charges, location, and mode of education delivery. Benefit level is determined by qualifying active duty service length. Transfer of benefits must be shared within a 36-month entitlement period. The Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits are based on an individual's qualifying active duty service length and other eligibility characteristics. Payments for tuition, fees, housing allowance, books, supplies, tutorial assistance, and additional monthly payments are provided while enrolled in an educational program. In AY2019-2020, a veteran at a private educational institution could receive up to $24,476.79. In AY2019-2020, veterans enrolled in educational programs may receive tuition and fee payments up to $24,476.79, housing allowance between $800 and $4,300 monthly, and $1,000 for books and supplies. Veterans in OJT or apprenticeship programs receive decreasing housing allowances and may not receive tuition benefits if none are charged. Payments are provided under VET TEC. Under VET TEC, veterans receive payments while enrolled full-time in training programs. The VA reimburses training providers for tuition and fees, paying 25% upon enrollment, 25% upon completion, and 50% upon employment in a suitable field. Training providers cannot charge tuition directly to VET TEC participants. Under VET TEC, veterans receive payments while enrolled in training programs. The VA reimburses training providers for tuition and fees, paying 25% upon enrollment, 25% upon completion, and 50% upon employment in a suitable field. Training providers cannot charge tuition directly to VET TEC participants. Potential participants apply to the VA for eligibility under the Post-9/11 GI Bill or VET TEC. Eligible individuals can enroll in approved programs, with educational institutions certifying enrollment and pursuit to the VA. Payments are verified and distributed by the VA. The VA verifies eligibility, calculates payment amounts, and distributes payments for GI Bill-approved programs. Program quality is determined by state approving agencies, with oversight from the VA. VET TEC programs focus on participant employment outcomes, with shared oversight responsibilities between the VA and SAAs. The VA contracts with SAAs for approval and ongoing oversight of education programs. The VA and SAAs share oversight responsibility for education programs. VA contracts with SAAs for approval and quality assurance of GI Bill benefits. Standards are in place to ensure program quality and prevent abuse. Four prominent standards apply to the quality of most education programs: program objective, independent study restrictions, the 85-15 rule, and contractual arrangement restrictions. The program objective must not be avocational, recreational, or personal development. Independent study programs must be accredited by an ED-recognized agency and lead to a degree or certificate meeting specified criteria. The 85-15 rule limits the percentage of students with tuition covered by aid or GI Bill. More than 85% of students in education programs may have tuition covered by institutional aid or GI Bill. Non-degree programs have specific requirements for facilities, instructors, and curricula. Programs for state licensure or certification have additional standards. Programs preparing individuals for state licensure or certification must meet recognized standards. Non-degree programs approved by government agencies include FAA flight training, DOL Registered Apprenticeships, and state-approved apprenticeships. The VA is the sole arbiter in determining if a facility is eligible for VET TEC, with payment structure designed to ensure program quality and value by reimbursing training providers upon completion of the program and finding meaningful employment. The VET TEC program payment structure reimburses training providers upon veterans completing the program and finding meaningful employment within 180 days. Training providers must meet quality requirements, be licensed or approved, and adhere to the 85-15 rule. Self-paced programs are not eligible. The VA is required to report annually on program outcomes. The VET TEC program requires training providers to adhere to the 85-15 rule and report annually on program outcomes. Performance measures include program admittance rate, job placement and retention rates, and median annual salary for program completers. In the field of study, program completers' employment rates, median annual salary, and transfer rates are reported. GI Bill participants show low interest in non-degree programs, with only 9% pursuing certificates in 2013. In FY2018, 0.4% of Post-9/11 GI Bill participants were in OJT or apprenticeship programs. In FY2018, approximately 0.4% of Post-9/11 GI Bill participants were pursuing on-the-job training (OJT) or apprenticeship programs. Out of the approved educational institution locations, around 500 flight school locations, over 18,000 school locations, and over 9,000 OJT/apprenticeship locations did not offer any degrees. Private for-profit schools accounted for 37% of the school locations, public schools for 37%, and private nonprofit schools for 27%. The most popular certificates completed by Post-9/11 GI Bill participants were in welding, information technology, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning, and health. In AY2018-2019, popular certificates completed by Post-9/11 GI Bill participants were in welding, information technology, HVAC, healthcare, and gunsmithing. Program eligibility is limited to military personnel and their families. Concerns have been raised about the oversight process for program quality. The oversight process for the SNAP program may be compromised, as indicated by a 2018 GAO report and a 2018 VA OIG report. The reports highlighted limitations in funding, oversight actions, and the selection of institutions to audit. SNAP, administered by the Department of Agriculture, provides benefits to low-income households for eligible foods at authorized retailers. The SNAP program, administered by the Department of Agriculture, provides benefits to low-income households for eligible foods at authorized retailers. Federal funding for SNAP includes food benefits and other funding for SNAP Employment & Training (E&T) to provide employment and education services for participants. Established in 1987, SNAP E&T aims to help participants gain skills and training for increased employment opportunities. The SNAP E&T program aims to assist SNAP participants in gaining skills for employment. States can choose to make participation in E&T mandatory or voluntary. The majority of state agencies operate voluntary SNAP E&T programs, offering components such as job search programs, workfare, education, and job retention programs. SNAP E&T funding includes mandatory funding of nearly $124 million without a state match, with additional federal matching funds available for administrative expenses and reimbursements. Total funding varies based on states' use of matching funds. USDA-FNS has partnered with Seattle Jobs Initiative since October 2015 for SNAP to Skills, a capacity-building project addressing education needs. USDA-FNS, in partnership with Seattle Jobs Initiative, operates SNAP to Skills, a project providing technical assistance to states for more effective SNAP E&T programs. The program integrates with the statewide workforce development system and includes a learning academy for additional states. The SNAP E&T program must integrate with the statewide workforce development system and can provide education activities to improve basic skills and employability for recipients. Services can be accessed through WIOA One-Stop centers, with SNAP staff addressing unique challenges such as low basic skills, housing instability, and mental health issues. Services and programs vary by state. Educational programs under SNAP E&T aim to enhance basic skills and employability, including high school equivalency programs, literacy education, and English as a second language instruction. These activities must directly improve job readiness to be approved. SNAP E&T education activities must have a direct link to employment and help participants move promptly into jobs. Vocational training, basic education, apprenticeships, subsidized employment, and unpaid internships are common offerings. SNAP E&T serves SNAP participants who must meet work requirements and income eligibility criteria. Apprenticeships, subsidized employment, and unpaid internships are allowable. Household income must be at or below 130% of the federal poverty level to qualify for SNAP. Under current law, SNAP participants must meet work requirements and income eligibility criteria. Household income must be at or below 130% of the federal poverty level, with certain state options allowing for thresholds up to 200%. General work requirements are in place for non-disabled adults, who must register for work, accept job offers, and maintain at least 30 hours of work per week. States have the flexibility to design SNAP E&T programs to focus on specific populations within the work registrant group. The eligible population for SNAP E&T programs can be tailored by states, with the option to make E&T mandatory for certain groups. The process of assigning individuals to E&T programs varies, with USDA guidance requiring assessment for effective program placement. The 2018 farm bill mandates all states to provide case management services like intake assessments for participants. The 2018 farm bill requires states to offer case management services for SNAP E&T participants, excluding TANF cash assistance recipients. Some individuals enrolled half-time or more in an IHE may be ineligible for SNAP, but can qualify through specified programs like WIOA Title I or SNAP E&T. Individuals may be eligible for SNAP E&T if placed in an IHE through programs like WIOA Title I. SNAP E&T funds cover education costs, including dependent care and transportation, and are administered by state agencies or contracted programs. USDA-FNS promotes third-party partnerships for program implementation. USDA-FNS advocates for third-party partnerships in SNAP E&T programs, where states collaborate with entities like community colleges. These partnerships involve financial or in-kind contributions from the third party, with federal funds reimbursing them. Pell Grants are prioritized for eligible students to cover college expenses. The Pell Grant must be the first payer for college expenses, with E&T benefits covering expenses not included in the Pell Grant. E&T funds must be used for reasonable and necessary expenses, prioritizing other funding sources before tuition. Workforce partnerships were added to the E&T program by the 2018 farm bill, including private employers and nonprofit organizations. The 2018 farm bill added workforce partners to the SNAP E&T program, which can include private employers, nonprofit organizations, and training providers. Each program is designed by the state within federal rules and requires USDA-FNS approval. State programs vary in services offered and must be implemented in consultation with the state workforce. Per the 2018 farm bill, SNAP E&T programs must be implemented in consultation with state workforce development boards or private employers. Participants learn about available programs through the SNAP state agency or partner referrals. States monitor program quality, with USDA-FNS providing assistance. The 2014 farm bill required USDA to establish a performance indicators reporting process for SNAP E&T programs. USDA has finalized the regulation for this reporting, with the first annual report due in January 2018. As of the report date, USDA has not published any information based on the reports. The national reporting measures include unsubsidized employment and median quarterly wages in the second quarter after completion of participation in SNAP E&T. The majority of SNAP E&T participants received services other than education. In FY2016, 38 state agencies included an education component in their E&T program, serving almost 70,000 participants. In FY2016, 38 state agencies provided an education component in their SNAP E&T program, serving almost 70,000 participants. Some states served fewer than 100 participants, while others served nearly 100,000. However, fewer than 10% of participants receive education, and information on the quality of educational programs or work experience is not available. The quality of educational programs or work experience for SNAP E&T participants is not available. A forthcoming evaluation on the 2014 farm bill pilot projects may provide future guidance. Wages earned through SNAP E&T may increase household income, potentially reducing eligibility for SNAP and SNAP E&T. The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families block grant aims to promote work and end dependence on government benefits. The Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block grant aims to help needy families with children by promoting work, job preparation, and marriage, reducing out-of-wedlock pregnancies, and supporting the formation of two-parent families. States have flexibility in how they use TANF funds to achieve these goals. TANF is administered by HHS and is a mandatory spending program, not specifically for education or training. TANF is a broad-purpose block grant that provides monthly assistance to needy families with children, primarily single mothers. Funds can be used for various benefits, services, and activities, including subsidized employment and training programs. TANF funds can support career pathways by providing access to education programs and support services for students and workers to advance in their chosen career paths. One state program uses TANF funds to pay coordinators at a community college who serve as case managers, recruit students, and ensure access to support services, including college work-study jobs. The TANF program allows for various types of training and education programs for low-income families with children. States have the flexibility to determine eligible vocational educational training. Financial eligibility rules are set by the state of residence, leading to significant variation. The TANF program provides training and education opportunities for low-income families with children. Financial eligibility rules vary by state. In 2015, a significant number of TANF recipients had limited education. TANF funds state assistance programs for needy families with children. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 created TANF, which allows states to determine eligibility rules, benefit amounts, and required activities for adult recipients of assistance. Benefits can be reduced or ended if recipients refuse to participate in required activities, including training and education. TANF provides funding for benefits and support services other than cash assistance, including advising, career planning, and employment services at the state and local level. States decide which participants receive these services. State TANF programs may refer assistance recipients to a WIOA One Stop Center for education or employment, while some states operate employment and training services for TANF recipients separately. States have the flexibility to establish rules for training and education programs, with the minimum work participation rate (WPR) being TANF's sole performance measure. Each state must meet a performance standard requiring a minimum percentage of its assistance caseload to be working or engaged in activities. TANF requires states to meet a performance standard for work participation, with limits on training and education. States can reduce cash assistance caseload to meet the standard. Data on TANF participation in education and outcomes is limited. The TANF program aims to reduce cash assistance caseload by promoting work participation. Limited data exists on TANF participation in training and education. Child care and educational barriers hinder TANF recipients from pursuing non-degree programs. States can use TANF funds for child care assistance. The 12-month lifetime limit on vocational training restricts the types of programs TANF recipients can pursue. The 12-month lifetime limit on vocational training restricts the types of programs TANF recipients can pursue, potentially limiting their choices. Income eligibility thresholds may be exceeded in apprenticeship programs, and the quality of training and education programs is uncertain."
