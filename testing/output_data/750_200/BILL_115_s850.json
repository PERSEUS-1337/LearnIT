    "content": "The \"Foreign Medical School Accountability Fairness Act of 2017\" aims to establish consistent eligibility requirements for graduate medical schools outside the US and Canada to increase accountability and protect American students and taxpayer dollars. Congress finds that three for-profit schools in the Caribbean receive the majority of Federal funding under title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 for students enrolled at foreign graduate medical schools, despite being exempt from meeting the same eligibility requirements as other schools. The National Committee on Foreign Medical Education and Accreditation recommend that all foreign graduate medical schools should meet consistent requirements. Foreign graduate medical schools should meet the same eligibility requirements for Federal funding as US schools. US medical schools have a 3.4% attrition rate, while for-profit Caribbean schools can reach 30%. Residency match rates for foreign trained graduates are 54%, compared to 94% for US graduates. In 2016, residency match rates for foreign trained graduates were 54%, compared to 94% for US graduates. Students at for-profit medical schools outside the US and Canada accumulate more student debt than those in the US. SEC. 4. REPEAL GRANDFATHER PROVISIONS. Section 102(a)(2) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to require that at least 60 percent of enrolled and graduating students in a foreign medical school are not individuals described in a specific section. The Higher Education Act of 1965 now requires that at least 75 percent of students or graduates from a foreign medical school outside the United States or Canada are not individuals described in section 484(a)(5) in the year prior to seeking a loan under part D of title IV. Canada nationals, including those from the United States, who took exams by the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates and passed in the year before applying for a loan under part D of title IV are eligible. The authority for this provision expires. The authority for Canada nationals, including those from the United States, who passed exams by the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates in the year before applying for a loan under part D of title IV expires on the first July 1 following the date of enactment of the Foreign Medical School Accountability Fairness Act of 2017. Loss of eligibility under SEC. 5. If a graduate medical school loses eligibility for loan programs under the Higher Education Act of 1965, enrolled students can still receive loans if they meet academic progress requirements. Students at a graduate medical school can continue to receive loans under the Higher Education Act of 1965 if they maintain satisfactory academic progress, until they withdraw, complete their program, or reach the fourth June 30 after losing eligibility."
