SEC. 4. GUIDELINES FOR NEW UNILATERAL ECONOMIC SANCTIONS LEGISLATION. Any new unilateral economic sanctions legislation should include a statement of the foreign policy or national security objective, provide authority for the President to refrain from imposing or suspend sanctions if in the national interest, and ensure contract sanctity unless determined otherwise. The United States legislation on unilateral economic sanctions should provide for contract sanctity unless the President determines it would hinder the effectiveness of the sanction. It should also allow the President to consider the impact of sanctions on innocent parties and not restrict humanitarian or human rights assistance. The legislation on unilateral economic sanctions should target sanctions narrowly and not restrict humanitarian assistance, agricultural exports, or activities aimed at changing the targeted conduct, unless the President deems it necessary for national interest. The legislation should impose sanctions only if it is in the national interest of the United States. The President must review the effectiveness of the sanctions annually and report to Congress.

SEC. 5. GUIDELINES FOR CONGRESSIONAL CONSIDERATION OF NEW UNILATERAL ECONOMIC SANCTIONS LEGISLATION. In considering new unilateral economic sanctions legislation, Congress should ensure complete information on projected costs and gains to US national interests, take into account international legal obligations, and provide the President an opportunity to submit a report assessing such costs and gains. When considering new unilateral economic sanctions legislation, Congress should consider the extent to which it may conflict with international legal obligations, consistency with existing sanctions, and administrative costs.

The proposed legislation may result in retaliation against US interests and harm the interests of US business, agriculture, and consumers. It could also damage the international reputation of the US as a reliable supplier of various products and services. SEC. 6. CONGRESSIONAL RULES OF PROCEDURE. The House and Senate cannot consider new unilateral economic sanctions legislation unless it includes specific matters. Any new sanctions legislation is considered a Federal private sector mandate. The Congressional Budget Office must provide a report on the mandate. The Budget Act of 1974 requires a report by the Congressional Budget Office on the costs of proposed sanctions legislation to the US economy, including impact on trade, employment, and international reputation. The section enacted by Congress focuses on maintaining the international reputation of the United States as a reliable supplier and supporting the economic well-being of US industries, firms, workers, and communities. The rules of the Representatives and the Senate are considered part of each House's rule and can override other rules if inconsistent. Each House has the constitutional right to change its rules regarding procedures at any time. The President should adopt guidelines for imposing sanctions and establish procedures for public outreach regarding United States policy on sanctions. SEC. 8. RULES REGARDING SANCTIONS IMPOSED BY THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH OR BY STATUTORY ENACTMENTS. The President has the authority to suspend, terminate, or not impose sanctions if the gains for the United States national interests do not outweigh the costs. This includes refraining from imposing sanctions or suspending/terminating their application. Additionally, the President can also reimpose sanctions if necessary. The President can refrain from imposing or suspend sanctions, and has the authority to reimpose them if needed, with notification to Congress. The President can refrain from imposing or suspend sanctions, and has the authority to reimpose them if needed, with notification to Congress. If Congress does not approve the decision within 30 days, the sanctions will take effect immediately. In cases of suspending or terminating sanctions, the President must submit a report to Congress, and the suspension or termination will take effect after 30 days unless Congress disapproves. Congressional procedures for joint resolutions are outlined in the Senate. The provisions of section 601(b) of the International Security Assistance and Arms Export Control Act of 1976 apply to the Senate. In the House of Representatives, a motion to proceed with a joint resolution is treated as highly privileged. This section supersedes any other provision of law."
