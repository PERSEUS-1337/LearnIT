    "content": "The 114th Congress has been debating the role of natural gas in the U.S. economy, with multiple hearings and bills introduced. Natural gas is seen as a potential bridge fuel to a lower-carbon economy due to its cleaner burning properties compared to coal and oil. Natural gas combustion emits less carbon dioxide, particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides than coal or oil. The United States has seen a shale gas revolution, increasing its natural gas resource profile. The United States has become the home to the shale gas revolution, with improved extraction methods increasing natural gas resources. Other countries are trying to develop shale gas, but progress is slow. If the US and other countries can bring large volumes of natural gas to market at a competitive price, it could play a larger role in the world's economy. Key factors will determine the availability of significant new quantities of natural gas, especially unconventional resources. The development of U.S. unconventional natural gas resources is being closely watched by many countries due to its potential impact on the world energy mix. Factors such as price, technical capability, environmental concerns, and political considerations will determine the availability of significant new quantities of natural gas. Natural gas consumption is expected to increase globally, with the United States consuming a significant portion in 2015. The world consumed 122,442 billion cubic feet of natural gas in 2015, with the United States leading at 23%. Global natural gas consumption grew by 1.7% in 2015, while U.S. consumption grew by 3%. Shale gas now makes up 51% of U.S. natural gas reserves and 56% of production, shifting the country from a net importer to a potential net exporter. The U.S. has become a potential net exporter of natural gas due to new shale gas resources, accounting for 56% of production. Global natural gas trade is increasing, with the U.S. as the largest consumer at 22.8% of global consumption in 2015. Russia is the second-largest consumer at 13,820 bcf. Global natural gas consumption grew at 1.7% in 2015, with the United States leading in consumption growth at 3%. Russia, the second-largest consumer, saw a decline of 8% in natural gas consumption between 2011 and 2015 due to economic factors. China and Iran experienced increased natural gas consumption in 2015, with China being one of the largest global energy consumers due to its growing economy. China accounts for almost half of the world's total coal consumption and is expanding natural gas imports for energy security. Iran also saw a growth in natural gas consumption. China and Iran are increasing their natural gas consumption. China, one of the largest global energy consumers, is expanding natural gas imports for energy security. Iran, with the world's second-largest natural gas reserves, has a thriving domestic energy demand but has faced stagnation in its energy sector due to international sanctions and lack of foreign investment. Iran's natural gas production capacity and role in the global energy market are key discussion points for policymakers following the lifting of international sanctions in 2016. The United States is the largest consumer of natural gas, with electric power generation accounting for 35% of consumption in 2015. The United States is the largest consumer of natural gas, with electric power generation accounting for 35% of consumption in 2015. Demand for natural gas for power generation has more than doubled since 2000 and is expected to grow by 40% by 2040, driven by low prices and policies promoting lower emissions. The U.S. industrial sector also increased its consumption of natural gas by 10% between 2010 and 2015. The U.S. industrial sector increased its consumption of natural gas by 10% between 2010 and 2015. Global proved natural gas reserves amounted to 6,599,400 bcf in 2015, providing a 53-year supply at current production levels. New reserves are developed annually as existing reserves are consumed. Manufacturing industries like bulk or primary metals could experience further growth with expanding resource base. Global natural gas reserves have grown by 19% since 2005, with over half controlled by the top 10 government-owned companies, mostly state-owned. Gazprom in Russia and Iran's National Iranian Oil Company are significant players in reserve holdings. In 2015, U.S. natural gas reserves were 368,700 bcf, with shale gas driving the increase. Global natural gas production grew by 2.2%, with the U.S. accounting for 22% of total production. In 2015, U.S. natural gas production increased by 5.4%, reaching 27,086 bcf. The growth was driven by unconventional resources like the Marcellus and Utica shale formations, accounting for 85% of the increase since 2012. U.S. natural gas production is rising due to unconventional resources like the Marcellus and Utica shale formations, accounting for 85% of the increase since 2012. By 2040, shale gas production is projected to increase by 73% to 19.6 tcf, leading to a 45% overall increase in total U.S. natural gas production. LNG, a liquid form of natural gas, is becoming more prevalent for global markets. In 2015, LNG trade increased by 1.8%, with LNG accounting for 33% of the global gas trade. Countries are expanding their LNG export capacity in response to the growing demand. Australia and the United States launched their first LNG shipments in 2016. In February, states in the lower 48 began shipping LNG, as the U.S. natural gas market transitions due to abundant domestic gas. There is a push to modify and expand existing LNG terminals for increased export capacity, requiring authorization from the Department of Energy and FERC. The U.S. natural gas market is transitioning with abundant domestic gas supply, driven by technologies like hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling. Production has shifted to unconventional resources like shale gas in regions such as the Marcellus and Utica Basins. The U.S. natural gas market has shifted away from traditional sources like the Gulf of Mexico to unconventional resources in regions such as the Marcellus and Utica Basins. This shift has reduced the need for gas from the Rockies or Gulf Coast, leading to lower prices and decreased imports from Canada. Increased production is expected from shale plays like Marcellus, Eagle Ford, Anadarko, and Utica in the future. Increased production from unconventional resources like Marcellus, Eagle Ford, Anadarko, Utica, and Haynesville Basins has led to the U.S. transitioning from a net importer to a projected net exporter of natural gas by 2017. The first LNG shipments from the lower-48 occurred in February 2016 from the Sabine Pass LNG Terminal in Louisiana. The Panama Canal reopening in June 2016 has reduced transit time from the U.S. by about 10 days. The Panama Canal reopened for commercial business, offering a potential shipping route for U.S. LNG. However, only 10% of LNG carriers can fit the canal, and no LNG transits have been scheduled. This development places the United States strategically in the global natural gas market, raising questions about the impact on domestic gas prices and the economy. The export of U.S. natural gas raises questions about its impact on domestic gas prices and the economy. Concerns also exist about the size of shale gas resources, sustainability of development, and potential limitations. Water use in hydraulic fracturing is a key issue, with concerns about drinking water quality and competition for water resources. The practice of hydraulic fracturing raises concerns over the quality and quantity of drinking water, competition for water resources, and wastewater disposal. The EPA is studying the impact of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water, with concerns about deep-well injection and human-caused earthquakes. Deep-well injection of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing may be linked to human-induced earthquakes. Concerns also exist about methane emissions from the natural gas sector, as methane is a precursor to smog and a potent greenhouse gas. The EPA established national air standards in 2012 to reduce methane and volatile organic compound emissions. In 2012, the EPA set national air standards to reduce methane and VOC emissions in the natural gas sector. The standards were updated in 2016 to include more equipment in the gas production chain. However, federal methane emission standards do not cover all sources, like offshore sources or coalbed methane facilities. As natural gas production grows in the US, methane pollution could become a significant issue for policymakers. Coalbed methane production facilities are a concern for policymakers due to methane emissions. Natural gas production in the US is increasing, with about 30% traded internationally. Global LNG trade rose by 1.8% in 2015, with pipelines and tankers being the primary transportation methods. Global LNG trade increased by 1.8% in 2015, with LNG's share of the global gas trade at 33%. Natural gas is typically sold under long-term contracts indexed to oil prices, except in the US where prices are market-based. US LNG exports have influenced other countries to reconsider their pricing strategies. Most international gas trade is conducted through long-term contracts, lasting around 20 years, due to the high cost of gas transportation. Global LNG trade increased by 1.8% in 2015, with LNG's share of the global gas trade at 33%. Natural gas is typically sold under long-term contracts indexed to oil prices, except in the US where prices are market-based. Most international gas trade is conducted through long-term contracts, lasting around 20 years, due to the high cost of gas transportation. LNG producers can sell excess gas on the spot market, which is growing. Russia is the world's largest natural gas exporter, primarily through its pipeline network to Europe, and opened its first LNG export terminal in 2009 targeting the Asian market for flexibility. Russia is a major natural gas exporter, with a large pipeline network to Europe. In 2009, Russia opened its first LNG export terminal to target the Asian market. Qatar leads in LNG exports, mainly to Asia and Europe. Europe imports natural gas primarily from Russia, Norway, and Algeria, but recent events have prompted the EU to seek more secure sources. Asia relies heavily on LNG, while China is increasingly importing gas via pipelines. The European Union is considering more secure sources of natural gas. China has become increasingly reliant on imported gas via pipelines from Kazakhstan, Myanmar, and Turkmenistan. The United States and Canada have an integrated pipeline system, with Mexico and Canada being the main recipients of U.S. natural gas. Export projections show an increase in exports to Mexico and a slight rise in exports to Canada by 2040. The export of U.S. LNG is a topic of debate among policymakers, with questions about its impact on the global market, geopolitics, and domestic prices. In February 2016, the first cargo of U.S. LNG was shipped from the Sabine Pass Liquefaction export terminal in Louisiana to Brazil. By 2040, exports to Mexico are expected to increase to almost 1.5 tcf, while exports to Canada are projected to rise slightly to 0.75 tcf. The U.S. natural gas export terminals include Sabine Pass Liquefaction, Dominion-Cove Point LNG, Cameron LNG, Freeport LNG Expansion, and Cheniere Marketing-Corpus Christi LNG. The Kenai LNG terminal in Alaska supplies LNG to Japan. The Kenai LNG terminal in Alaska, operational since 1969, supplies LNG primarily to Japan. In 2016, the US started shipping LNG to Barbados from Miami in cryogenic containers. These containers can be transported over land and loaded onto ships. The natural gas from these shipments is sold at a higher price than Sabine Pass exports, ranging from $10 to almost $16 per MBtus. In 2014, a small amount of LNG was shipped to Honolulu using this method for the first time. Alaska has great potential for LNG exports. Alaska has great potential to become a major source of natural gas, with estimates exceeding 200,000 bcf on the North Slope. However, most gas is currently used for oil production and not brought to market. Officials are pushing for a pipeline to sell natural gas internationally as LNG, but as of 2016, this is not yet commercially viable. Alaskan officials are advocating for a pipeline to sell natural gas internationally as LNG, but commercial viability remains a challenge. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade agreement was signed in 2016, potentially impacting U.S. natural gas trade by expediting permits for exports to member countries. This agreement could grant free trade status to key LNG consumers. The United States has an FTA under the Natural Gas Act, granting free trade status to key LNG consumers. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) aims to promote trade and economic growth between the US and EU, addressing market access and regulations. The TPP and TTIP have not been ratified. The COP-21 conference in Paris in December 2015 aimed to address climate change. The United States signed the Paris Agreement in April 2016 to address climate change and establish measures for emissions mitigation, adaptation, and finance. U.S. infrastructure may struggle to keep up with growing natural gas supplies due to aging pipelines built in the 1950s and 1960s. Investment in natural gas is crucial. Investment in natural gas infrastructure may face challenges due to aging pipelines from the 1950s and 1960s. Estimated annual investment in natural gas interstate pipelines could range from $2.6 billion to $3.5 billion between 2015 and 2030. Factors affecting the market include oil prices, new infrastructure, technological developments, interdependence between gas and electric sectors, and climate policies. The Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF) may also impact the market. The Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF), known as gas OPEC, is a cartel organization based in Qatar with 11 natural gas producing countries. Formed in 2001, they account for a significant portion of global natural gas reserves and trade. However, due to the vast U.S. natural gas resources, the GECF is unlikely to impact U.S. consumption in the near future. The Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF) is unlikely to significantly affect U.S. natural gas consumption in the next five years or longer. Europe, heavily reliant on cartel members like Russia and Algeria for gas imports, is more vulnerable to possible cartel control. However, the current structure of natural gas markets makes supply or price manipulation difficult, requiring significant changes before the GECF could have influence. Global natural gas production in 2015 grew by 2.2%, below the 10-year average of 2.4%. The United States surpassed Russia as the world's largest natural gas producer in 2009, leading to an evaluation of potential natural gas resources by most countries. Significant commercial production outside of Canada is unlikely before further shale gas development. Outside of Canada and the United States, most countries lack the data, technology, and equipment needed to evaluate and exploit their shale gas resources. Natural gas prices in the US, Canada, and the UK are market-driven, with hubs like the Henry Hub in Erath, LA, providing competitive price data. Commercial production of shale gas in other countries is unlikely before the end of the decade. The Henry Hub in Erath, LA is a well-known natural gas hub in the United States, providing competitive price data for buyers and sellers. Different categories of consumers pay varying prices for natural gas, with residential consumers paying the highest. By 2040, the EIA projects the Henry Hub natural gas spot price to increase to $7.85 per MBtu due to growing domestic and international demand, necessitating more well completions to meet production levels. The EIA projects an increase in the Henry Hub natural gas spot price to $7.85 per MBtu by 2040 due to growing domestic and international demand. Natural gas is mostly sold under long-term contracts outside the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, with prices linked to crude oil. The disparity between contract and spot prices for natural gas has pressured producers to reconsider pricing strategies. Some producers are now incorporating spot prices into their formulas, reflecting the regional nature of the industry. Asia, in particular, is willing to pay high prices for natural gas supplies. The natural gas industry faces a disparity between contract and spot prices, with Asia willing to pay high prices for supplies. Take-or-pay clauses in contracts require buyers to pay regardless of gas receipt, typically for at least 80% of the contracted volume. The natural gas industry is facing a shift towards more efficient markets with destination clauses allowing redirection of cargoes. The main question now is whether natural gas will become the world's primary energy source. The International Energy Agency predicts a 60% increase in demand for natural gas by 2040. The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts a 60% increase in natural gas demand by 2040, with most growth coming from non-OECD countries like China and the Middle East. Global energy dynamics are changing as North America leads in unconventional gas production, while China drives global energy trends with a shift in its economic model. China is transitioning to a services-focused economy, which will reduce its energy needs by 85%. Uncertainty surrounds China's future energy consumption. India is expected to drive global energy demand, requiring a significant investment of $2.8 trillion to meet its needs. Natural gas currently makes up 6% of India's energy supply. India's energy demand is projected to require a $2.8 trillion investment by 2040. Natural gas currently accounts for 6% of India's energy supply and is expected to make up less than 10% of the energy mix by 2040. The U.S. electric power industry leads the growth in natural gas demand due to factors like low prices and competitive financing. Government policies on carbon dioxide emissions will influence the growth of natural gas usage. Globally, natural gas is projected to contribute 28% to total world electricity generation by 2040. Natural gas production needs to increase to meet rising demand and prevent price spikes. Unconventional gas resources like coal bed methane, shale gas, and tight gas account for 60% of global supply growth. However, development outside North America is slower and uneven, with China facing challenges like limited water availability and geology. China's policies encourage natural gas production, but challenges like limited water availability and geology may hinder full capacity realization."
