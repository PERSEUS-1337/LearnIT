    "content": "The President signed H.R. 4899, P.L. 111-212 on July 29, 2010, which allocated $59.2 billion for war costs, disaster assistance, Haiti relief, and benefits for Vietnam veterans. The bill was passed by both the House and Senate, with the House receding from an amended version with higher spending. H.R. 4899, P.L. 111-212 allocated $58.8 billion in new budget authority, with $380 million in rescissions. The bill included $22.1 billion more in domestic spending in the previous House version, offset by $12.2 billion in rescissions and $4.5 billion in mandatory savings over 10 years. Rescissions and mandatory savings reduce the amount of new budget authority needed for spending. The House debated H.R. 4899, which included $380 million in rescissions and $4.5 billion in mandatory savings over 10 years. Additionally, a resolution proposed withdrawing U.S. troops from Pakistan within 30 days or by December 31, 2010. The resolution to withdraw U.S. troops from Pakistan within 30 days was defeated by a vote of 38 to 372. The Senate disagreed with the House version of the bill, leading to a failed cloture vote and signaling an inability to limit debate. The House adopted the Senate version of H.R. 4899 due to concerns about funding for the Army and dropped support for the House version which included additional funds for various purposes. The House adopted the Senate version of H.R. 4899 to address concerns about Army funding, including $59.2 billion for wars, Haiti relief, FEMA, and new VA benefits. The debate excluded funds for Pigford II and Cobell court cases requested by the Administration. The House and Senate debated on H.R. 4899, focusing on additional domestic spending proposals and the new war policy in Afghanistan. Representative David Obey introduced the Senate version of the bill, adding funds to FEMA disaster funding. Representative David Obey added funds to FEMA disaster funding in the FY2010 Supplemental bill to address various emergencies, including teacher job losses, Pell fund shortfalls, and border security. However, these domestic proposals were ultimately not included in the final bill, leading Obey to oppose the war funding included in the legislation. Representative Obey opposed the war funding in the bill due to Afghanistan and Pakistan's lack of support and the absence of a proposed House amendment for Congress to vote on continuing the policy. Despite this, he believed the process should move forward. Representative Lewis praised the Senate for rejecting billions of dollars. Representative Lewis praised the Senate for rejecting nonemergency spending on troops and urged support for the bill to aid military personnel and disaster-stricken areas. Other members supported DOD's war funding and disability benefits for Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange. Representative Skelton backed the bill, while Representative McGovern also voiced support. Representative Ike Skelton, Chair of the House Armed Services Committee, supported the bill for veterans with diseases linked to Agent Orange exposure. Representative Jim McGovern raised concerns about corruption and incompetence in the Afghan Government and the role of Pakistani intelligence services. Representative Norm Dicks and Representative Chris Van Hollen cited Secretary of Defense Robert Gates' concerns about war funding running out in August. The House voted on H.Res. 1556 as part of the consideration of H.R. 4899. The House voted on H.Res. 1556 as part of the consideration of H.R. 4899, which included a resolution invoking the War Powers Act to withdraw U.S. troops from Pakistan within 30 days or by December 31, 2010. The debate also touched on the effectiveness of U.S. aid in Pakistan since FY2002. The House resolution invoking the War Powers Act to withdraw U.S. troops from Pakistan was defeated by a vote of 38 to 372. The Senate failed to adopt cloture on the House version of H.R. 4899, indicating it would not pass. The final version of H.R. 4899 appropriates $59.2 billion in spending. The Senate sent the House an amended version of H.R. 4899 with a message of disagreement. The final version appropriates $59.2 billion in spending, matching or close to the Administration's request for various funds including FEMA's Disaster Assistance Fund, Vietnam veterans affected by Agent Orange, Department of Defense war-related funding, and Haiti relief. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 appropriated $59.2 billion in spending, with key differences from the Administration's request including reduced funding for war-related foreign aid, no funding for settling court cases, and additional funding for Mexico, Jordan, El Salvador, and Vietnam. In the final version, Congress appropriated $59.2 billion in spending, including $600 million for foreign aid and humanitarian assistance for Mexico, Jordan, El Salvador, Vietnam, and Congo that was not requested, and $400 million for flood and drought relief. Domestic funding for teacher layoffs, Pell grants, summer jobs, and agricultural and energy grants funding was not included. The House passed a bill on July 1, 2010, which was later withdrawn on July 27, 2010. The final version of H.R. 4899 did not include $600 million for border security and $129 million for reducing patent backlogs in the Commerce Department. Separate bills were passed for this funding on July 28, 2010. The FY2010 Supplemental, P.L. 111-212, included a total of $34.2 billion in spending. The FY2010 Supplemental, P.L. 111-212, allocated $34.2 billion for the Defense Department and State Department for the Afghan and Iraq wars. $31.5 billion was designated for the Afghan war, with $29.8 billion for DOD and $1.7 billion for State/USAID programs. $2.7 billion was allocated for the Iraq war, including $1.0 billion for DOD and $1.7 billion for State/USAID programs. Total funding for the Afghan and Iraq wars in FY2010 also considered previous appropriations and war-related VA medical costs. Total FY2010 funding for the Afghan and Iraq wars, including previous appropriations and war-related VA medical costs, amounts to $169.9 billion. This includes $104.4 billion for the Afghan war and $65.5 billion for the Iraq war. Additionally, $2.0 billion in non-war funding was provided to DOD, and $375 million was allocated for foreign aid for Pakistan in P.L. 111-212. Congress addressed the Administration's $64.3 billion request for supplemental spending for FY2010 between March 24, 2010, and July 27, 2010. The House passed H.R. 4899 with $5.1 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund and $600 million for the Department of Labor's summer jobs program. The Senate passed H.R. 4899 on May 27, 2010 with $59.2 billion in spending for various purposes including disaster relief, war funding, foreign assistance, and Vietnam veterans benefits. The House adopted the Senate's version and added funds for education. The House and Senate passed H.R. 4899 with funding for various purposes including disaster relief, war funding, education, and Vietnam veterans benefits. The total spending amounted to $81.8 billion, funded with $65.1 billion in new BA and $16.7 billion in rescissions and mandatory savings. The Senate disagreed with the House's amended version and sent a message of disagreement on July 22, 2010. The House then withdrew its support for the amended version and adopted the Senate's May version. The House and Senate passed H.R. 4899 with funding for various purposes totaling $81.8 billion. The House receded from its version and adopted the Senate's version on July 27, 2010. The President signed the bill into law on July 29, 2010, allocating $64.4 billion in supplemental funding for various purposes including deploying more troops for the Afghan War and supporting recovery efforts in Haiti. The FY2010 supplemental requests included $5.1 billion for U.S. Disaster Relief Fund, $33.0 billion for Defense Department, $4.5 billion for foreign assistance, $2.8 billion for Haiti reconstruction, $13.4 billion for veterans exposed to Agent Orange, and $243 million for appropriations-related purposes. The Senate and House considered H.R. 4899, which included $2.8 billion for Haiti reconstruction, $13.4 billion for veterans exposed to Agent Orange, $243 million for Deepwater Horizon oil spill responses, $600 million for border security, $3.4 billion for American Indian land trust claims, and $1.2 billion for discrimination claims of black farmers. The main concern was the impact on the federal deficit. The Senate and House considered H.R. 4899, focusing on the effect of supplemental spending on the federal deficit. Different versions of the bill included rescissions to offset discretionary spending and mandatory savings spending. The House version had $600 million in offsets for $5.7 billion in spending, while the Senate version had $380 million in offsets for $59.3 billion in spending. In the second and third versions of H.R. 4899, offsets were included to counterbalance proposed spending. The House version had $12.2 billion in rescissions and $4.5 billion in mandatory savings to offset $81.8 billion in spending. Congressional rules dictate that spending must align with budget resolution totals, unless designated as emergencies. The final version of H.R. 4899 included $45.8 billion in discretionary spending designated as emergency, which would not count against budget caps. If spending exceeds the caps, a point of order would be needed to approve it. Federal budget rules distinguish between discretionary and mandatory spending. The President's supplemental request includes $64.4 billion in spending, with $46.3 billion as discretionary and $18.1 billion as mandatory. The requests were submitted to Congress as part of the FY2011 budget and in budget amendments on various dates in 2010. Emergency supplemental appropriations are seen as undermining budgetary discipline as they are not subject to annual caps on discretionary spending. Congress decides if spending qualifies as emergency, leading to less scrutiny compared to regular appropriations. In the current fiscal environment, some Members are concerned about the impact of additional spending on the deficit. Congress debates whether to increase spending above the appropriated levels for the year and subsequent years, deciding if it warrants increasing the budget deficit or offsetting the spending by cutting federal spending. Congress must decide whether to increase the budget deficit or offset additional spending by cutting federal spending or increasing revenues. The FY2010 supplemental appropriations request was considered within budget constraints and rules, including the Statutory PAYGO Act of 2010. Congress could have exempted spending from budget constraints by designating it as an emergency or for overseas deployments. Waiving applicable points of order or not raising them during consideration of the supplemental appropriation measure were also options. However, an emergency designation itself could be subject to a point of order. During consideration of H.R. 4899 in 2010, various government agencies and plaintiffs in legal cases were involved in the appropriations process. Waivers were used to exempt spending from budget rules, with the House requiring a special rule and the Senate needing a three-fifths vote to waive applicable points of order. In late March to late July 2010, various government agencies and plaintiffs in legal cases cited deadlines for supplemental funding needed. Admiral Thad Allen and Secretary Janet Napolitano urged Congress to raise the cap on funds from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund for response activities. The Administration proposed raising the cap on funds from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund for response activities due to concerns about insufficient funding for Federal response operations within two weeks. The Coast Guard could reach the $150 million annual cap by June 18, 2010, prompting the need to tap into other funding sources. The House and Senate passed S. 3473, P.L. 111-191, on June 9 and June 20, 2010, raising the cap on funds from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund to $1 billion specifically for the Deepwater Horizon Spill. Funds can be withdrawn in $100 million increments and must be reported to Congress within seven days. The Department of Defense received $129.6 billion, 80% of its total FY2010 war funding. The Department of Defense received $129.6 billion in FY2010 war funding, with funds to be withdrawn in $100 million increments and reported to Congress within seven days. Secretary of Defense Gates stated that an additional $33 billion was needed for troops deploying to Afghanistan by Memorial Day. In February testimony, the Secretary of the Army stated that war funding could be comfortably funded by the end of June or beginning of July. Based on calculations, the Army, Navy, and USMC could cover regular base activities and war operations through August 2010. Secretary of Defense Gates mentioned the need for additional funds for troops deploying to Afghanistan by Memorial Day. In June 16, 2010, Secretary of Defense Gates expressed concern about the lack of progress on the supplemental funding, urging passage by July 4 to avoid disruptions in Navy and Marine Corps operations. Funds from the overseas contingency fund may run out in July, leading to potential disruptions in Army operations by August. In mid-July, DOD press spokesman Geoff Morrell warned that the Army and Marine Corps could run out of funding in August, potentially leading to furloughs for civilians and unpaid active duty military. Under Secretary of the Army, Joseph Westphal, testified that the Army had funds until mid-August and could last through the recess with approved reprogramming requests. Based on the DOD Cost of War report, the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, and Air Force had funds available in their War Bridge Operation and Maintenance accounts. The Army had $15.3 billion, Marine Corps had $1.2 billion, Navy had $1.5 billion, and Air Force had $2.2 billion. Monthly spending was projected to increase by 20% as more troops arrived in theater. Army and Marine Corps were the most heavily taxed by war spending. Monthly spending increased by 20% from April 2010 as additional troops arrived in theater. The Army and Marine Corps relied on already appropriated war bridge funds through August. Services have tapped base budget funding since 2004 to finance war funding temporarily. Each service could have lasted through the end of the fiscal year with requested supplemental funds. The services used base budget funding to temporarily finance war funding, allowing them to last through July and into August. FEMA took measures to extend the Disaster Relief Fund, but it was estimated to become insolvent by the end of June. FEMA extended the Disaster Relief Fund using base budget funding to last through July and into August. In May 2010, FEMA estimated the fund would become insolvent by the end of June with average monthly spending of $350 million and a balance of $600 million. However, as of June 7, 2010, FEMA had a balance of $952 million in the fund, including recoveries from previous years, due to a policy of prioritizing immediate needs and life-threatening situations. FEMA extended the Disaster Relief Fund using base budget funding to last through July and into August. As of June 2010, FEMA had a backlog of $1.4 billion in projects awaiting payment for existing or approved infrastructure and mitigation projects across the nation. The State Department reported that its disaster assistance funding needed replenishment by June 1, 2010 to respond to future humanitarian crises. The U.S. State Department's disaster assistance funding needed replenishment by June 1, 2010 to address humanitarian crises. Congress did not approve the $1.15 billion appropriation for the Pigford II court case settlement by the mid-April 2010 deadline. The settlement for the Cobell suit for government mismanagement of funds and lands was included in the final version of H.R. 4899. The deadline for Congress to approve the settlement of the Cobell suit for government mismanagement of funds and lands held in trust for individual American Indians is August 6, 2010. It is uncertain if another extension will be granted. Members of Congress raised concerns about setting a timeline for evaluating spending on the Afghan War and ensuring effective use of foreign aid for Afghanistan and Iraq. The Administration requested $5.1 billion for the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) to prevent the fund from running out of funds for expected disaster needs and unanticipated claims. FEMA requested $5.1 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund to prevent anticipated fund shortages for disaster needs and arbitration awards. FEMA projected the fund would run out in May or June 2010, prompting guidance to limit expenditures. In June 2010, FEMA implemented measures to reduce expenditures from the Disaster Relief Fund by limiting payments and delaying projects to address an anticipated shortage. Representative James Oberstar raised concerns about FEMA's actions to stretch available funds, prompting questions from Congress about the timing of disaster relief requests and delays in congressional action on the supplemental funding. Questions were raised about FEMA's delay in requesting disaster relief funds earlier, the timing of congressional action on the supplemental funding, and the agency's budgeting practices. The Obama Administration criticized previous administrations for irresponsible budgeting in its first budget blueprint. In its first budget blueprint, the Obama Administration criticized previous administrations for irresponsible budgeting practices. The Administration requested $2.0 billion for the DRF in FY2010, but Congress provided $1.6 billion. For FY2011, the Administration is requesting $1.9 billion for the DRF due to the increase in disasters in 2009 and 2010. The current moratorium on funding increases for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) is being questioned due to the high number of disasters in recent years, including those related to Hurricane Katrina. Higher funding levels may be necessary to address the ongoing recovery needs from Gulf Coast hurricanes in 2005 and 2008, which could take five years or longer. Some argue for higher funding for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) to avoid supplemental funding needs due to unpredictable disasters. However, FEMA provided limited information for Congress to evaluate the request. FEMA's request for replenishing the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) lacks sufficient information for Congress to evaluate. The only example provided is a $475 million arbitration ruling for Charity Hospital in New Orleans post-Hurricane Katrina. More details on DRF usage for past disasters and pending arbitration cases could strengthen the case for additional funding. P.L. 111-212, enacted as H.R. 4899, allocated the requested $5.1 billion for the DRF. The final version of H.R. 4899 allocated $5.1 billion for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) and included $396 million for various disaster relief funding. The Senate Appropriations Committee expressed dissatisfaction with the timeliness of information provided by OMB regarding disaster relief funding requirements. The FY2011 request is expected to be $1 billion to $2 billion short of previous disaster requirements, including Hurricane Katrina. Additionally, H.R. 4899 included funding for disaster-relief activities in other agencies. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 allocated $5.1 billion for the Disaster Relief Fund. Other agencies received funding for disaster-relief activities, including $100 million for Housing and Urban Development, $227 million for the Army Corps of Engineers, $49 million for the Commerce Department, and emergency funds for the Agriculture Department. The final version of H.R. 4899 allocated $10 million for drought relief and $18 million for emergency forest restoration. It also stipulated a federal cost share of no less than 90% for flood recovery in Rhode Island and Tennessee. FEMA is directed to create an interagency taskforce to address community concerns related to flood map updates. The DOD and State Department/USAID FY2010 supplemental requests provide funding primarily for deploying additional troops to Afghanistan and economic assistance to support military operations. The Obama Administration requested a $33 billion supplemental appropriation for FY2010 in its FY2011 budget submission. The Obama Administration requested a $33 billion supplemental appropriation for FY2010 to deploy 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan, targeting insurgency and securing population centers to transfer responsibility to Afghans by July 2011. The Obama Administration requested a $33 billion supplemental appropriation for FY2010 to deploy 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan, aiming to transfer responsibility to Afghans by July 2011. By June 1, almost 94,000 troops were in Afghanistan, with the remainder expected to arrive by September 2010. Before leaving office, President Bush increased troop numbers in response to concerns from the U.S. Commander in Afghanistan. Before leaving office, President Bush increased troop numbers in Afghanistan in response to security concerns. The Obama Administration approved additional troop increases, bringing the total to 98,000 troops by fall 2009. NATO allies also increased their troop levels in Afghanistan. The FY2011 budget adds 4,000 support troops in Afghanistan, bringing the total number of foreign troops to about 148,000 by fall. Plans call for Afghan security forces to total 243,000, resulting in a total of 389,000 foreign and Afghan forces. The Defense Department's budget includes $33 billion for additional troops in Afghanistan, $1 billion for training Iraq Security Forces, and $2 billion for fuel costs. In FY2010, additional troops were deployed to Afghanistan, $1 billion was allocated for training Iraq Security Forces, and $2 billion was designated for higher fuel costs in DOD's budget. Total DOD war spending for FY2010 increased to $160 billion, with $99 billion for Afghanistan and $61 billion for Iraq. This marked a $12 billion increase from FY2009 and was almost the same as the FY2011 request. Before the FY2010 Supplemental, DOD appropriations for the Afghan War totaled $284 billion, which rose to $314.1 billion with the passage of the FY2010 Supplemental. The FY2010 Supplemental increased DOD appropriations for the Afghan War to $314.1 billion, with the FY2011 request potentially raising it to $427.7 billion. In comparison, Iraq's total spending is now $706.2 billion, expected to reach $752 billion with the FY2011 request. These figures exclude war funding for State/USAID and VA Medical. President Obama approved a new deployment in Afghanistan with a timeline for withdrawal starting in July 2011, but there are concerns that the drawdown may be minor. Both Secretary of Defense Gates and Admiral Mullen have cautioned about potential delays in the withdrawal process. The U.S. drawdown in Afghanistan starting in July 2011 may be delayed, with Secretary Gates stating it could be a several-year process. General Petraeus described it as an 18-month campaign to be evaluated in September 2011. Members of Congress have raised concerns about the timing of the evaluation. Members of Congress raised concerns about the timing of the evaluation of the 18-month campaign in Afghanistan, with three amendments debated and rejected during House consideration of H.R. 4899 on July 1, 2100. Amendment No. 3 aimed to cut off all funding for Afghanistan, Amendment No. 4 sought to limit DOD funding to troop withdrawal, and Amendment No. 5 required increased congressional participation in decision making about the U.S. military commitment. Amendment No. 5, which required a new National Intelligence Estimate and a timetable for troop redeployment in Afghanistan, was defeated 162 to 260. The defeat of Amendment No. 5, which called for a new National Intelligence Estimate and troop redeployment timetable in Afghanistan, raised concerns about the situation in the country. The operation to re-take Marjah with additional U.S. troops was launched, but reports suggest a mixed outcome. The focus was shifting to the campaign for Kandahar, a Taliban stronghold, which was delayed from its planned summer date. Of the $33 billion in DOD's supplemental request, $30 billion was allocated for Afghanistan. The $30 billion allocated for Afghanistan in the DOD's supplemental request included funds for various purposes such as military operations, force protection, training Afghan security forces, and equipment reconstitution. The DOD's supplemental request includes $30 billion for Afghanistan, with funds allocated for training Afghan security forces, higher fuel costs, equipment reconstitution, military and national intelligence, military construction, and defeating Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). Some policymakers estimate the cost of deploying 30,000 more troops at $1 million per troop. The DOD's $30 billion request for Afghanistan includes funding for various activities such as training Afghan security forces, higher fuel costs, equipment reconstitution, military construction, and defeating IEDs. Different functional categories show varying increases in funding, with the Operations category expected to rise by 123%. Funding for the Afghan war between FY2009 and FY2011 is detailed in Table 3. The DOD's estimates for the FY2010 cost of deploying 30,000 troops to Afghanistan reflect a per troop cost of $875,000 based on the \"Operations\" category in the FY2010 Supplemental request. DOD's reported obligations for the first five months of the fiscal year suggest that their estimates may be somewhat high unless spending increases substantially later in the year. The DOD's per troop cost for deploying 30,000 troops to Afghanistan is $875,000, which is almost double the CBO's estimate of $467,000. The high cost is attributed to setting up and operating facilities in southern Afghanistan where troop presence was limited. The DOD's high per troop cost for deploying 30,000 troops to southern Afghanistan is attributed to setting up and operating facilities in the region. In 2009, concerns about accurate budgeting for the wars led to transferring $5 billion of DOD's funding to the Overseas Contingency Operations Transfer Fund. The DOD transferred $5 billion to the Overseas Contingency Operations Transfer Fund (OCOTF) for accurate budgeting concerns in 2009. Concerns may arise about DOD's FY2010 request due to high estimates, with obligations in the first five months only at 22% of the total requested amount. Monthly spending would need to double in the next seven months to utilize all funds, indicating that DOD's estimates may be too high. The DOD requested an additional $2.6 billion to accelerate training and expand the Afghan Security Forces Fund, bringing total FY2010 ASFF funding to $9.2 billion, an increase of 63%. Concerns were raised about whether all the additional funds were necessary to meet current plans given the current spending rate. The DOD requested an additional $2.6 billion to accelerate training and expand the Afghan Security Forces Fund, bringing total FY2010 ASFF funding to $9.2 billion, a 63% increase. Concerns were raised about the need for all the additional funds, the achievability of DOD's plan, oversight issues, training problems, contracting disputes, and possible shortages in trainers. The new plan aims to increase Afghan Security forces to 243,000 by October 2010 and 305,600 by FY2011, with the Afghan Army growing to 171,000 by October 2011. The Afghan Army and Police were set to increase in size, with the Army growing from 97,000 in November 2009 to 171,000 in October 2011, and the Police from 93,800 to 134,000 in the same period. NATO partners endorsed these increases in January 2010. The DOD requested an additional $2.6 billion to sustain the growth of the Afghan Army and provide additional infrastructure. The DOD requested an additional $2.6 billion to sustain the growth of the Afghan Army, pay soldiers more, and provide infrastructure and equipment. Congress has appropriated $25.5 billion for Afghan Security Forces so far, with pending requests for FY2010 and FY2011 totaling $14.2 billion, bringing the total through FY2011 to $39.8 billion. General Gary McChrystal had proposed the increase in size of the Afghan Army and Police. General Gary McChrystal proposed doubling the Afghan Army and Police to 400,000, but General Mullen called it an aspirational goal not endorsed by the Obama Administration. The training of Afghan Security forces is conducted by U.S. military personnel, NATO coalition teams, and private contractors. The training of Afghan Security forces is carried out by U.S. military personnel, NATO coalition teams, and private contractors. Issues include attrition rates, leadership deficiencies, absenteeism, logistical limitations, and questionable behavior in the Afghan Army. Police training faces challenges like illiteracy, corruption, and attacks by insurgents on recruits and officers. Problems in Afghan police training were highlighted in hearings in 2010. The hearings in 2010 on Afghan police training revealed issues such as difficulties in coordinating training efforts, problems with private contractors including poor performance and unauthorized firearm use, and a lack of personnel for contract management and oversight. The 2010 hearings on Afghan police training highlighted issues with coordinating training, poor contractor performance, lack of personnel for contract oversight, and trainer shortages for the Afghan army and police. Members may want to know the current status of trainer assignments in Afghanistan, with only 44% of the required trainers currently assigned. Questions arise about the availability of trainers for initial and follow-on training, including the number of U.S. military personnel, coalition partner teams, and contractors. Shortfalls in personnel could impact DOD's funding and hamper the ramp-up efforts. The availability of personnel for Afghan police training could impact DOD's funding and hamper ramp-up efforts. A sustained bid-protest may have delayed contract award, but Congress allowed reliance on a previously awarded contract. DOD's plan for training Afghan police is uncertain, with a potential full and open competition suggested. DOD Assistant Secretary David Sedney mentioned uncertainty regarding a contract, suggesting a full and open competition could delay training and reduce funding. DOD still has almost $3.6 billion available from FY2009 and FY2010 appropriations, with funds being obligated at a rate of $540 million per month in FY2010. This surplus suggests DOD had an additional six months of funding available even without the requested $2.6 billion supplemental funding. Some Members question the need for emergency war supplementals as DOD had surplus funding for FY2010 even before the $2.6 billion supplemental request. The original FY2010 request was included in the DOD Appropriations Act, but the decision to deploy more troops later could justify an emergency designation for the supplemental request. The Administration's decision to deploy 30,000 more troops in December 2009 led to a debate on whether the FY2010 supplemental request for war funding should be considered an emergency. Some argue that certain expenses, such as training Iraqi Security Forces and offsetting fuel increases, may not be directly related to the new deployments and should be scrutinized. The $1.7 billion for reset or replacement of war-worn equipment may not be directly related to the new deployments, and some argue it should be part of DOD's regular FY2011 appropriation request. Congress has become less willing to fund Iraqi security forces due to the turnover of responsibility to the Iraqi government and the rise in oil prices. DOD argues that the $1 billion for the ISFF is necessary for modernization efforts and to ensure Iraq's security, especially with lower oil prices. The emergency designation of these funds could be challenged. The emergency designation of $2 billion to cover higher fuel costs in DOD's base budget could be challenged, as DOD has historically used cash resources or transferred funds from less urgent needs to cover such expenses. DOD argues that an infusion of budget authority is necessary due to the difficulty of these actions. Some argue for an infusion of budget authority to address the difficulty of covering higher fuel costs, while others suggest estimating equipment replacement needs for additional troops based on past experience. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 provided DOD with $32.9 billion, $148 million less than the DOD request, including adjustments for excess funding, fuel pricing changes, and combat losses. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 provided DOD with $32.9 billion, $148 million less than the DOD request. This included a $436 million decrease to operation and maintenance, a $400 million cut rejecting funding for Army force protection programs, and a $512 million increase to procurement accounts for additional combat losses. These adjustments were included in the Senate version of H.R. 4899 and ultimately adopted by the House. The final version of H.R. 4899 approved the amounts requested for training Afghan and Iraq security forces. It also included a requirement for intelligence committees to receive threat assessments from Guantanamo detainees but dropped a provision for $300 million for base closure transportation improvements. The Administration requested $529 million for military construction in its supplemental budget. The Administration requested $529 million for military construction in its supplemental budget, including $521 million for military construction in Afghanistan. Questions arise about whether DOD is building facilities to support temporary troops or creating permanent bases in Afghanistan. In its supplemental budget, the Administration requested $529 million for military construction, with $521 million designated for projects in Afghanistan. Questions have been raised about whether the Department of Defense is establishing temporary facilities or permanent bases in the country. Congress has allowed spending for a \"long-term presence\" but prohibited funds for \"permanent stationing\" of troops. The urgency of the current funds needed for military construction in Afghanistan is also unclear. The request for military construction in Afghanistan aims to create and expand infrastructure to support 30,000 additional U.S. troops. The justification includes expanding airfield capacity, logistics capacity, and providing necessary infrastructure. The supplemental request is split between Army and Air Force construction, focusing on provinces in the south and north of Afghanistan. The military construction in Afghanistan is focused on provinces in the south and north, including Helmand, Nimruz, Kandahar, Balkh, and Kunduz. Air Force construction is planned for Nimruz, Balkh, and Herand provinces to support airlift and special operations forces. Army construction includes waste management systems, fuel storage facilities, utilities infrastructure, gravel roads, and a command headquarters at Forward Operating Base (FOB) Tombstone near Lashkar Gah in Helmand. The military construction in Afghanistan includes facilities such as perimeter security, helicopter aprons, and aircraft aprons at various Forward Operating Bases (FOBs) across the country. Air Force construction projects involve runways, aprons, and fuel storage at different FOBs, supporting airlift and special operations forces. The military construction in Afghanistan includes facilities like perimeter security, helicopter and aircraft aprons at various Forward Operating Bases (FOBs) across the country. Congress is concerned about long-term U.S. troop commitment and has adopted language to prevent the establishment of permanent bases in Afghanistan. Congress has adopted language to prevent the establishment of permanent military bases in Afghanistan, as seen in the FY2010 National Defense Authorization Act. The FY2009 Supplemental Appropriation and P.L. 111-84 prohibit the establishment of permanent military bases in Afghanistan, but allow for the use of Operation & Maintenance funds for projects supporting a \"long-term presence.\" The FY2009 Supplemental Appropriation and P.L. 111-84 allow the use of Operation & Maintenance funds for military construction supporting a \"long-term presence\" in Afghanistan, despite the ban on permanent military bases. Congress has struggled to define the line between funding for permanent stationing and long-term presence, leading to uncertainty in project approval. Congress has denied funds for projects seen as indicating a permanent military presence without proper justification. The FY2010 Supplemental projects may face similar scrutiny. In response to ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Department of Defense (DOD) received flexibility to use funds for temporary facility construction from FY2004 to FY2009. Congress limited the amount and prohibited construction at sites with expected long-term presence. DOD anticipates a continued U.S. military presence in Afghanistan even after operations cease. DOD planners anticipate a continued U.S. military presence in Afghanistan even after operations end. Congress authorized the use of $200 million in O&M funds for projects in U.S. Central Command and an additional $300 million for construction in Afghanistan to meet urgent military requirements. The FY2010 NDAA extended the authority to use O&M funding for military construction with a $500 million total limit on projects. The FY2010 NDAA extended the authority to use O&M funding for military construction with a $500 million total limit on projects in Central Command. In FY2009, DOD added $409 million from O&M accounts for construction in Afghanistan, raising the total to $1.4 billion, nearly equaling the entire amount spent on construction between FY2003 and FY2008. In FY2009, DOD allocated $1.4 billion for construction in Afghanistan, almost matching the total spent on construction from FY2003 to FY2008. If the full $500 million in O&M funds were used in FY2010, the total investment would reach $2.4 billion, doubling the prior seven-year investment. DOD also proposed using O&M funds for minor construction until October 1, 2012, potentially increasing military construction funding in Afghanistan in FY2011. If approved by Congress, total funding for military construction in Afghanistan could increase further. Key bases like Bagram Air Base, Kandahar Air Base, and Forward Operating Base Tombstone/Bastion have received significant investments. The DOD has requested $181 million for Air Base and $595 million for Forward Operating Base Tombstone/Bastion. Additionally, new language has been requested for FY2011 DOD authorization to use O&M funds for unspecified military construction projects up to $3 million each in support of contingency operations until September 30, 2012. The DOD has requested funds for Air Base and Forward Operating Base Tombstone/Bastion. A proposal seeks temporary authority for DOD to use O&M funds for unspecified military construction projects up to $3 million each in support of contingency operations worldwide. There would be no limit on the total amount of funds that could be used for these projects. DOD proposed quarterly reporting to congressional defense committees within 60 days for using O&M funds for military construction in support of contingency operations worldwide. Questions raised about the urgency of a $521 million supplemental request given DOD's current spending rates in Afghanistan. $2.1 billion in budget authority from previous acts still available. DOD had $2.1 billion in unobligated budget authority from previous acts. In FY2009, $607 million was obligated for military construction projects in Afghanistan, but in FY2010, the average monthly obligation dropped to $26 million. To use up the $2.1 billion by the end of the fiscal year, DOD would need to increase monthly obligations to $300 million. DOD had $2.1 billion in unobligated budget authority from previous acts. To use up this amount by the end of the fiscal year, DOD would need to increase its monthly obligations six-fold to $300 million. $700 million must be obligated by September 30, 2010, and another $1.4 billion by September 30, 2011. To spend all FY2009 monies, DOD would need to increase its monthly obligation rate four-fold to $100 million. Similarly, to spend the $1.4 billion available for FY2010 projects, monthly obligations would need to average $116 million. The DOD had $2.1 billion in unobligated budget authority from previous acts. To use up this amount by the end of the fiscal year, DOD would need to increase its monthly obligations six-fold to $300 million. With the additional supplemental funds, monthly obligations would have to treble from the FY2009 rate (to $150 million a month) and increase six-fold from the current FY2010 rate. Some may argue that the FY2010 supplemental request could be considered as part of DOD's FY2011 war request when there could be additional evidence about current spending rates and the prospects for the Afghan war. Total funding for military projects in FY2010 is $1.4 billion. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 included $657 million for military construction/family housing, with $649 million allocated for war-related construction in Afghanistan and $8 million for non war-related Air Force expenses. The final military construction funding was $127.5 million above the request to accelerate projects funded by the Air Force in FY2011 using contingency-related funds. The Senate report added $127.5 million above the request for military construction projects funded by the Air Force in FY2011 using contingency-related funds. The funds would be available for two years instead of four, with a recommendation for including known contingency construction requirements in the budget request. The military construction funds for projects would be available for two years instead of four, with specific foreign economic assistance addressed for Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan. The final bill did not include funding for a new Soldier Readiness Processing Center at Fort Hood. The budget request for foreign economic assistance in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan aimed to support civilian operations in response to military drawdowns and increased responsibilities. The total budget for these war-related programs was $4.46 billion. The international affairs budget request for war-related programs in Pakistan aimed to strengthen the government's presence in insurgent areas. The total budget was $4.46 billion, with $1.8 billion for State Department programs and $2.6 billion for foreign aid to support various objectives. Funding was requested for specific needs in each country, excluding P.L.480 food aid. The FY2010 international affairs budget request aimed to strengthen government presence in insurgent areas in Pakistan. The Administration requested funding for specific needs in each country, excluding P.L.480 food aid. The enacted version of the FY2010 supplemental increased total funding to about $9.2 billion, a 55% increase over FY2009. The FY2010 supplemental budget increased total international affairs funding to $9.2 billion, a 55% rise from FY2009. The enacted version provided $3.7 billion for war-related foreign aid and diplomatic operations, $714 million less than the Administration's request. The focus in Afghanistan was on civilian programs alongside military efforts. The December 2009 \"surge\" strategy in Afghanistan accelerated the need for civilian assistance delivery to support U.S. military efforts, focusing on increasing stability, reducing insurgency strength, and providing social services to contested areas. The new strategy in Afghanistan aims to increase stability and weaken the insurgency by creating jobs and providing social services through a more capable Afghan government. Key concerns include government leadership, coordination between U.S. military and civilian aid programs, cooperation from local communities, and the impact of corruption on government effectiveness. The Afghanistan supplemental request aims to boost U.S. international affairs funding levels, but concerns about corruption in the Afghan government may hinder effective service delivery and accountability for aid programs. The increase in U.S. aid personnel and requests for inspector general oversight reflect worries about the impact of corruption on aid programs. The Afghanistan supplemental request aims to boost U.S. international affairs funding levels, but concerns about corruption in the Afghan government may hinder effective service delivery and accountability for aid programs. The increase in U.S. aid personnel and requests for inspector general oversight reflect worries about the impact of corruption on aid programs. The total FY2010 State Department diplomatic operations account would rise by nearly 90% above the previous year's level under the request. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 increases the total FY2010 diplomatic operations account by 86%. The foreign aid portion of the supplemental request raises total FY2010 levels of civilian aid accounts for Afghanistan by 67% over FY2009. The legislation raises total FY2010 aid levels by 55% over the previous year, with specific funding requests for Economic Support Funds (ESF), International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INCLE), and Diplomatic and Consular Programs (D&CP). The FY2010 supplemental request includes $211 million in Diplomatic and Consular Programs (D&CP) funds and $135 million for alternative development in poppy-production areas. Additionally, $216 million is allocated for conflict mitigation, $50 million for the rule of law, and $760 million for good governance. In addition to the funds allocated for conflict mitigation, rule of law, and good governance, there are investments in various sectors such as health, education, macroeconomic growth, and trade and investment in Afghan government agencies. The curr_chunk discusses financial support for various sectors in Afghanistan, including education, macroeconomic growth, trade and investment, the financial sector, agriculture, private sector development, and economic opportunity. The INCLE account received $200 million request for supporting justice sector activities, with a focus on rule of law in provinces. This included funding for expanding credit union services, Islamic-compliant financing, corrections program, model prisons, increasing judges and prosecutors, and counter-narcotics programs. The FY2010 State Department Diplomatic and Consular Programs requested $211 million to increase judges, prosecutors, criminal investigators, and support various justice activities, including counternarcotics police and drug treatment facilities. The FY2010 State Department Diplomatic and Consular Programs requested $211 million to increase civilian personnel, including 457 new positions for work in Kabul ministries, Provincial Reconstruction Teams, and at the district level. The positions were funded in addition to the 764 positions already funded in the regular FY2010 appropriations. The Administration applied a \"whole of government\" approach by drawing federal employees from various departments on an as-needed reimbursable basis. The Department of State proposed hiring federal employees from various agencies on a reimbursable basis to provide expertise in specialized skills. They also planned to hire 200 locally employed staff to support American personnel in Kabul. The Inspector General's report praised the embassy's management but expressed concerns about staff being overworked due to a tripling in numbers. The U.S. embassy in Kabul is facing challenges due to a tripling of staff over the past year, leading to concerns about overworked employees. The proposed expansion in the supplemental request would further strain resources, impacting staff management and housing. Additional funding for security needs and oversight agencies like SIGAR and the State Department Inspector General was also requested. An additional $14 million in funding for SIGAR and $3 million for the State Department Inspector General was requested to support oversight of the assistance program. The final enacted version of H.R. 4899 provides $1.7 billion for Afghanistan foreign aid and diplomatic operations, compared to the $2.0 billion request. Major differences exist between P.L. 111-212 and the Administration request. The enacted version of the bill provides $1.7 billion for Afghanistan foreign aid and diplomatic operations, cutting the ESF request by $267 million. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommends specific funding levels for various program sectors within the ESF account, notably reducing proposed good governance activities by $160 million and alternative development by $35 million. Concerns are raised about providing aid directly to the government of Afghanistan, with recommendations for assessments of aid effectiveness. The Senate report limits direct government budget support to $100 million for Afghanistan, citing concerns about the effectiveness of aid and the weak and corrupt justice system. The enacted version of the bill also addresses oversight issues and rejects the request for additional funding for SIGAR. The enacted legislation addresses oversight issues and rejects additional funding for SIGAR. It rescinds $7.2 million in FY2009 supplemental SIGAR appropriations and re-appropriates it in the FY10 supplemental, with conditions on Afghanistan aid. The Secretary of State ensures Afghan government involvement in project design and implementation, with progress measured by specific benchmarks. Aid is contingent on Afghan government cooperation in reforms, respect for women's rights, and removal of corrupt officials. Electoral Commission funding depends on no involvement in fraud during the 2009 elections. Funds for the Electoral Commission are conditional on no involvement in fraud during the 2009 elections. Aid for reconciliation with former combatants, like the Taliban, requires Afghan women's participation in government and protection of their rights. H.R. 4899 allows up to $300 million for DC&P and Embassy Construction and Maintenance in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 allows up to $300 million in DC&P and Embassy Construction and Maintenance funding to Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan from any year's appropriation to be transferred or merged with funding for activities supporting U.S. civilian security in any of these countries. The Administration's international affairs request for Iraq in the FY2010 supplemental had two components, both reflecting the new strategic environment created by the drawdown of U.S. military forces. The U.S. significantly increased assistance and State Department operations in Iraq in FY2010, with a 64% rise in aid programs and a 79% increase in State operations. The enacted legislation boosted total economic aid programs by 89% over the previous year, with a request for $517.4 million in INCLE funding being the most significant element. The State Department saw a 43% increase in operations over FY2009 levels, with a focus on transitioning police training responsibilities from the Department of Defense to the State Department for Iraq. This transition includes advising the Ministry of Interior, police, and border forces. The State Department is transitioning police training responsibilities from the Department of Defense to advise the Ministry of Interior, police, and border forces in Iraq. A successor program is needed by the end of FY2010 for a smooth transition. The INCLE request includes deploying 350 advisors to work at Ministry and police colleges, academies, and headquarters, with up to 2,000 personnel expected to be employed ultimately. Funding would also support infrastructure construction and security staff for expert personnel travel around the country. The FY2010 supplemental request for INCLE's program in Iraq includes funding for up to 2,000 U.S. government and contractor personnel, aircraft for staff travel, and State Department operational costs totaling $1.57 billion. This funding aims to maintain civilian outreach to provinces post-military drawdown, with over 1,200 direct-hire American employees currently stationed in Iraq. The United States has over 1,200 direct-hire American employees from 14 civilian agencies stationed in Iraq, conducting various diplomatic missions. The United States has over 1,200 civilian federal employees in Iraq conducting a broad range of diplomatic missions, including furthering U.S. economic interests, providing political analysis, public diplomacy outreach, oversight of government assistance programs, supporting reconstruction efforts, rule of law programs, and training Iraqi ministry and local government personnel. Embedded Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) are being phased out as combat battalions withdraw from cities. The State Department plans to establish two consulates and three temporary Provincial Diplomatic Teams (PDTs) to replace the phased-out Embedded Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) in Iraq. Two U.S. Forces-Iraq managed PRTs will remain through 2011, with supplemental funding requested for infrastructure realignment. The State Department plans to establish two consulates and three temporary Provincial Diplomatic Teams (PDTs) in Iraq, transitioning responsibilities from the military to the State Department. Costs for infrastructure, security, and construction development will be assumed by the State Department. The State Department will need to provide for large increases in contract employees to meet security and operational needs as it takes over responsibilities from the Department of Defense for housing, protecting, and maintaining its staff. The State Department faces challenges in managing contracts and overseeing its responsibilities in Iraq, with criticism for inadequate personnel. Funding for Iraq assistance was included in the House-amended version of H.R. 4899. The final enacted version of H.R. 4899 provides $1.7 billion for Iraq, with cuts to diplomatic operations and funding for site development and construction of consulates in Basrah and northern Iraq. Senate appropriators recommended prioritizing these facilities within regular appropriations bills. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 increases the amount requested for INCLE by $133 million, reconfiguring the use of funds for police training. It cuts the original request for startup expenses by $67 million to $450 million and adds $200 million for implementation, management, and security. This funding is contingent on the Iraqi Government's support. The Pakistan supplemental request for funding for police training program is subject to approval by the Secretary of State based on Iraqi Government's support. There is a modest shift in funding for Pakistan between FY2009 and FY2011, with the FY2010 supplemental request focusing on specific infrastructure needs. The FY2010 supplemental request for Pakistan focused on specific infrastructure needs to demonstrate continued U.S. support and help the government meet the needs of its population in vulnerable areas. The largest portion of the request was for $244 million in ESF, including funds for cash payments, water and sanitation infrastructure, and agriculture irrigation. The FY2010 supplemental request for Pakistan included $65 million for water and sanitation infrastructure, $65 million for agriculture irrigation systems, $64 million for solutions to Pakistan's energy crisis, and $40 million for police training and related infrastructure. Additionally, $60 million in Foreign Military Financing assistance was expected to provide five Bell-412 utility and troop transport helicopters. In FY2010, the Administration requested $26 million for State Department operations in Pakistan to increase staffing at U.S. diplomatic facilities by 56 positions. This would include both U.S. direct-hire personnel and Locally Employed Staff (LES) to better manage and support operations. The Administration requested $26 million in FY2010 to increase staffing at U.S. diplomatic facilities in Pakistan by 56 positions, including U.S. direct-hire personnel and Locally Employed Staff (LES). The increased staffing aims to better manage and support military and economic assistance, enhance logistical support, and strengthen U.S. outreach and programs. The Administration requested increased staffing at U.S. consulates in Lahore, Karachi, and Peshawar to strengthen outreach and programs at provincial and local levels. H.R. 4899 provides $375 million for Pakistan aid and diplomatic operations, $5 million more than the request. The enacted legislation, H.R. 4899, provides $375 million for Pakistan aid and diplomatic operations, including adjustments for FMF and ESF funding. A $15 million addition to ESF is allocated for human rights and assisting families affected by military operations. The act also requires a human rights strategy submission before ESF funds can be used and includes $1.5 million for leasing aircraft to monitor programs in Pakistan. The Obama Administration requested $2.8 billion in FY2010 supplemental funding for relief and reconstruction support in Haiti after the earthquake. $1.5 million was allocated for leasing aircraft to monitor programs in the country. Some funds are available until September 30, 2012, others until expended. The Obama Administration requested $2.8 billion in FY2010 supplemental funding for relief and reconstruction support in Haiti after the earthquake. Approximately 55% of the total Haiti supplemental request is for reimbursement of relief activities related to the earthquake disaster, 40% for new recovery and reconstruction activities, and 6% for diplomatic operations administration. The Haiti earthquake may have been the most devastating catastrophe any country has ever experienced, affecting approximately 3 million people, roughly one-third of the overall population in Haiti. The Haiti earthquake was a devastating catastrophe, affecting approximately 3 million people, with 230,000 deaths and 300,600 injured. The relief effort is expected to last for many months. Haiti was already designated as one of the 50 least developed countries in the world before the earthquake. The Haiti earthquake caused widespread devastation, with millions affected and hundreds of thousands dead or injured. The displaced population in Port-au-Prince faces challenges, with many lacking basic services. Some Haitians have sought refuge in other countries like the Dominican Republic and the United States. Aid workers are providing essential supplies to affected areas. In Haiti, aid workers are delivering basic necessities to areas with Internally Displaced Populations (IDPs), but emergency shelter is scarce. Providing waterproof shelter and sanitation for the displaced is a top priority as the rainy season approaches. The focus is on meeting the basic needs of the displaced and vulnerable Haitians. The Haiti Post Disaster Needs Assessment found that $11.5 billion is needed for recovery and reconstruction. A donors conference pledged nearly $10 billion, with the U.S. pledging $1.2 billion. Improved accountability of donor assistance is emphasized by the Obama Administration and others. The Obama Administration, international donors, and the Haitian government emphasize the need for improved accountability of donor assistance to Haiti to reduce corruption. Haiti has made progress in reducing corruption and increasing transparency, qualifying for debt relief. The U.S. Agency for International Development has helped establish an online monitoring system for donor pledges and assistance spending. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 includes $2.93 billion for Haiti, $129 million more than the request. It includes $1.642 billion for relief activities, $1.140 billion for recovery and reconstruction, and $147 million for diplomatic operations. The Administration requested a total of $1.5 billion. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 includes $2.93 billion for Haiti, $129 million more than the request. It covers relief activities, recovery, reconstruction, and diplomatic operations. The Administration requested a total of $1.5 billion in relief and disaster assistance funding for Haiti. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 includes $2.93 billion for Haiti, covering relief activities, recovery, reconstruction, and diplomatic operations. Additional funding includes $150 million for Agriculture Department emergency food assistance, $96.5 million for State Department peacekeeping activities, $655 million for Department of Defense, $45 million for U.S. Coast Guard relief, $220 million for Health and Human Services grants to States for Haitian evacuees, $15 million for Homeland Security immigration fees, and $100 million in humanitarian assistance announced by President Obama. USAID reported that the United States has provided over $1.1 billion in aid as of June 11, 2010. The United States has provided over $1.1 billion in humanitarian funding for Haiti as of June 11, 2010. The FY2010 supplemental request included $350.7 million for International Disaster Assistance, with $126.6 million allocated for USAID to reimburse other U.S. government agencies for earthquake relief efforts in Haiti. Additional funding covered services already provided, including $35.6 million for Search and Rescue agreements. The United States provided $35.6 million for Search and Rescue agreements, USAID/Disaster Assistance Response Team Program Support, and USAID/Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance Relief Commodities. The remaining $188.5 million covered ongoing humanitarian assistance activities in Haiti, coordinated through the U.N. cluster system. In Haiti, relief activities are organized into twelve clusters led by various agencies, funded by IDA for humanitarian coordination, logistics, shelter, health, water, sanitation, and child protection programs. Additionally, $150 million was requested for emergency food assistance, with $68 million allocated to the World Food Program. The request under Food for Peace (FFP) Title II Grants included $150 million for emergency food assistance in Haiti, with $68 million for the World Food Program and $55 million for Private Voluntary Organizations. Up to two million people may need food aid due to the earthquake, with relief operations expected to continue through 2010. Food activities will target the most vulnerable and focus on food-for-work programs as recovery progresses. Relief operations in Haiti will continue through 2010, targeting the most vulnerable with food-for-work programs. Recovery efforts after natural disasters often involve a mix of relief and reconstruction activities. The international community has provided significant humanitarian assistance in response to Haiti's frequent natural disasters. The international community, including the United Nations and the United States, has been actively involved in providing humanitarian assistance in Haiti in response to frequent natural disasters, particularly hurricanes. There is a strong focus on developing disaster response capacity to minimize humanitarian consequences and sustain reconstruction efforts in the future. Humanitarian assistance in Haiti receives bipartisan congressional support. The United States is a leader in providing humanitarian assistance in Haiti, with a focus on minimizing consequences and supporting reconstruction efforts. Disaster accounts are being depleted to aid Haiti, and resources need to be replenished by June 1, 2010 to maintain the capacity to respond to future crises. The State Department reported that resources for humanitarian crises need to be replenished by June 1, 2010 to maintain U.S. capacity to respond. The relief funding in the current request would reimburse funding for the earthquake disaster in Haiti, which has received global attention. The United Nations has requested $1.44 billion for Haiti, with $874 million (58%) committed as of June 4, 2010. The United Nations has requested $1.44 billion for Haiti, with $874 million (58%) committed as of June 4, 2010. It is uncertain if donor amounts represent pledges or actual contributions, and funds allocated for relief may not be new contributions. The distribution of costs among international donors for the Haiti disaster will become clearer over time. Sustaining donor interest and commitment to Haiti will be crucial as the situation stabilizes. The actual costs of the Haiti disaster will be shared among international donors. Sustaining donor interest in Haiti and honoring existing pledges may be challenging. Criticisms have been made about the slow delivery of humanitarian assistance. The weakened capacity of the Haitian government, damaged infrastructure, and logistical challenges are hindering the aid effort. There has been unfair criticism of the pace of international aid in Haiti due to challenges like the weakened capacity of the Haitian government, damaged infrastructure, and logistical issues. Concerns remain about bureaucratic red tape, government capacity, and coordination among international actors. The response to the disaster in Haiti faced challenges due to the capacity of the Haitian government, coordination issues among international actors, and overall obstacles on the ground. The DOD requested $655 million and the U.S. Coast Guard requested $45 million for humanitarian relief efforts in Operation Unified Response. The DOD and U.S. Coast Guard requested $700 million for humanitarian relief efforts in Haiti, covering expenses incurred through June 15, 2010. The funds provided soldier support, relief supplies, and various projects in Operation Unified Response. The DOD's response to the Haitian earthquake included providing subsistence, support, relief supplies, and various projects. Over 20,000 U.S. military personnel were involved in transporting supplies, evacuating people, providing security, and conducting repairs. The mission ended on June 1, 2010. The DOD's earthquake response mission in Haiti ended on June 1, 2010, with the redeployment of the last 300 U.S. military personnel. Further assistance will be provided through the U.S. Southern Command-sponsored \"New Horizons\" annual humanitarian exercise involving National Guard and Reserve soldiers. The ongoing humanitarian mission in Haiti involves about 500 National Guard and Reserve soldiers working on engineering projects like building schools, clinics, and community centers that can double as hurricane shelters. The U.S.S. Iwo Jima is set to arrive in Port de Paix in July for medical assistance and surgeries. Concerns have been raised about the premature withdrawal of U.S. forces providing security, given the weakened state of Haitian security forces. Some also worry about the ability of U.N. security personnel to fill the gap. The Administration requested $96.5 million for the State Department's Contributions to International Peacekeeping Activities (CIPA) account to fund U.S. assessed contributions to the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH), a peacekeeping operation. The increased assessment responded to the U.N. Security Council's January increase in MINUSTAH levels by 3,500. The United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) saw an increase in military personnel and police component levels after the earthquake. The Security Council's resolution 1927 further increased the police component to provide temporary surge capacity. Additionally, funds were requested to aid Haitian evacuees and migrants to the United States. The Administration requested funds to aid Haitian evacuees and migrants to the United States, including making them eligible for benefits programs and waiving fees for immigration requests. The President's request would provide $256.2 million for activities of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), with $220.0 million directly to HHS and $36.2 million to USAID for certain activities. The $220.0 million requested by the President would fund various activities related to Haitian evacuees, including Medicaid and CHIP costs, medical evacuations, assistance for evacuees, and public health activities in Haiti. The allocation of funding for each activity was not specified, and there were no proposed changes in eligibility for assistance. The request for $220.0 million for Haitian evacuees includes funding for Medicaid and CHIP costs, medical evacuations, assistance, and public health activities in Haiti. Haitians with humanitarian parole status are eligible for Medicaid as Cuban-Haitian Entrants for seven years in the U.S. States must cover a portion of care costs for eligible individuals. The request for funds includes Medicaid coverage for Cuban-Haitian Entrants for seven years in the U.S. States have the option to continue providing Medicaid after the initial seven years. Funds would also reimburse HHS NDMS for medical evacuation costs of earthquake victims to the U.S. hospitals. NDMS will cover care costs for 30 days for evacuated individuals. The HHS policy will reimburse U.S. hospitals for 30 days of care for individuals medically evacuated from Haiti by NDMS. Costs beyond 30 days, services from non-hospital facilities, and care for those not evacuated through NDMS are not covered. Requested funds will provide cash and medical assistance to Haitian humanitarian parolees, along with repatriation costs. These parolees are eligible for federal resettlement assistance. Haitian parolees eligible for federal resettlement assistance may receive cash and medical aid, along with repatriation costs. They can also qualify for social services and benefits like SSI, TANF, and Medicaid if they meet certain criteria. Requested funds would support public health activities in Haiti, including disease surveillance, laboratory capacity reestablishment, and environmental health. The $36.2 million requested for USAID reimbursements to HHS would cover medical, surgical, and mortuary assistance teams deployed to Haiti, including personnel and supplies for a 250-bed hospital. The requested funds would cover medical, surgical, and mortuary assistance teams deployed to Haiti, including personnel and supplies for a 250-bed hospital. U.S. disaster assistance to other nations does not typically involve accepting large numbers of disaster victims into the United States. Some forms of assistance rendered to Haitian earthquake victims may be unprecedented, such as using NDMS for mass medical evacuation. The NDMS system was used for the first time to airlift victims of foreign disasters into the U.S. for medical care, requiring rapid policy development. The President's supplemental request included $15 million for USCIS to cover immigration-related costs for Haitian migrants affected by the 2010 earthquake. USCIS funds immigration-related costs for Haitian migrants affected by the 2010 earthquake through fees collected from various adjudications and services. For FY2010, USCIS has a budget authority of $2.727 billion, with $2.503 billion coming from collected fees. Refugees and asylum seekers are traditionally exempt from Examination Fees. The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act 2010 provided $224 million in direct appropriations to USCIS, including $50 million for processing refugee applications and asylum claims. The Administration proposed using $15 million in supplemental appropriations to reimburse USCIS for waived fees for eligible Haitians granted TPS and humanitarian parole, as well as for processing adoption of Haitian orphans. The enacted version of H.R. 4899, P.L. 111-212 includes $1.6 billion in humanitarian assistance for Haiti, with additional funding for IDA relief activities and food needs. The final version also approves $655 million for the Department of Defense. The final version of the enacted H.R. 4899, P.L. 111-212 includes $150 million for P.L. 480-Title II assistance to address food needs in Haiti. Additionally, $255 million is transferred from the Overseas Humanitarian, Disaster, and Civic Aid Account to the Department of Defense. $5 million is added to the Coast Guard's request for operations in Haiti, and $96.5 million is endorsed for Contributions to International Peacekeeping Activities in Haiti. $220 million is approved for the Department of Health and Human Services for services and benefits extension. The enacted version of H.R. 4899, P.L. 111-212 includes $220 million for the Department of Health and Human Services to provide services and benefits to Haitian evacuees and migrants. Additionally, $10.6 million is approved for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services for costs related to Haitian migrants. The total request for Recovery and Reconstruction funding in this supplemental proposal was $1.1 billion, primarily for new activities. The 111th Congress expressed bipartisan support for providing substantial assistance to Haiti. The 111th Congress expressed bipartisan support for providing Haiti with substantial assistance in response to the crisis generated by the January earthquake. Members stressed the need for a coordinated international effort for immediate humanitarian needs and long-term development. Strategies must aim to create a more sustainable Haiti and increase Haitian capacity to utilize foreign aid effectively. To coordinate aid programs better, donors have agreed to focus on urgent infrastructure repairs in energy and agriculture, critical healthcare, governance, and security in Haiti. Some observers are concerned that U.S. assistance is neglecting areas like improving the educational system, which other donors are focusing on. Critics question this approach, while advocates argue it avoids duplication among donors. The Inter-American Development Bank, Canada, and France are focusing on the educational system in Haiti to avoid duplication among donors. Critics question the limited approach to aid, while the revised Haitian development strategy aims to catalyze economic growth outside of Port-au-Prince and correct the urban-rural imbalance in the country. The supplemental request aims to address the unsustainable urban-rural imbalance in Haiti by supporting decentralization strategies, including meeting the immediate needs of displaced populations and developing new growth poles outside of Port-au-Prince. Scientists are assisting in selecting less vulnerable areas for development. Scientists are assisting Haitian authorities in selecting less vulnerable areas for development, aiming to address the urban-rural imbalance in Haiti. While there is general support for this strategy, officials note the high cost of developing neglected areas and caution against forcibly relocating populations. Experts emphasize the need for targeted poverty reduction programs, as economic growth alone is not sufficient. Aid to Haiti should focus on building the capacity of Haitians to eventually take responsibility for projects. Aid to Haiti should prioritize building the capacity of Haitians to take over projects. However, there is a tension between standard effectiveness and efficiency measures and the time and funding needed for capacity building. Aid organizations face pressure for quick, measurable outcomes on short-term contracts. If foreign aid programs include thorough training and coordination with Haitian ministries, they may require more time, funding, and personnel, with results taking longer to achieve. The supplemental proposal requested $749 million in Economic Support Funds for International Assistance programs in Haiti, focusing on infrastructure rehabilitation, technical assistance for public outreach, and reconstruction projects for essential services like shelter, water, sanitation, healthcare, and electricity. The Administration requested up to $120 million of Economic Support Funds to be transferred to a multi-donor trust fund for Haiti, to leverage resources from other donors. ESF monies could also be transferred to USAID's Operating Expenses account for staffing needs. Transfers to the Development Credit Authority account would be in addition to already appropriated funds. Some experts suggest developing small-scale, alternative or clean energy sources at the local level in Haiti instead of rebuilding the ineffective electricity service. Concerns have been raised about insufficient funding for children's needs and psychological support for the traumatized population. No additional funding was allocated for Global Health and Child Survival in the supplemental request. The State Department would receive about $144 million for International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement activities in Haiti to strengthen law enforcement and security. Many troops of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti had shifted to development work due to improved security. The United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) is expanding its presence in Haiti with INCLE funds to strengthen the Haiti National Police, enhance criminal justice sector support, and combat human trafficking. This is to improve accountability and oversight as funding for relief and reconstruction in Haiti increases. The supplemental funding requested for Haiti includes $1.5 million for the Office of the Inspector General of USAID to improve accountability and oversight, $690,000 for a Treasury Department attach\u00e9 to oversee technical advisors, and $7.1 million for advisors to restore basic treasury processes, reduce corruption, and enhance economic management skills. The Administration requested up to $120 million in Economic Support Funds for a Multi-Donor Trust Fund in Haiti to improve coordination and tracking of foreign assistance. Financial management progress in Haiti was set back due to the earthquake, which killed government officials and destroyed Ministry of Finance buildings. The Administration proposed $252 million in U.S. contributions to help cancel Haiti's debts of $781 million to three international organizations, aiming to facilitate better coordination and implementation of foreign assistance to Haiti. Haitian President and Prime Minister acknowledged limited capacities post-earthquake, leading to the establishment of a development authority for long-term guidance. The Administration proposed $252 million in U.S. contributions to help cancel Haiti's debts of $781 million to three international organizations: the Inter-American Development Bank, World Bank, and International Fund for Agriculture and Development. They also requested reallocating up to $40 million from the Treasury Department's Debt Restructuring Account for multilateral debt relief. Congressional authorization is required for the $40 million reallocation, and both authorization and appropriations are required for the new contributions of $212 million. The final version of H.R. 4899, P.L. 111-212 approves $1.140 billion for all FY2010 recovery and reconstruction activities for Haiti, including $212 million for multilateral debt relief. Direct budget support to the Haitian government requires written agreements with clear goals and mechanisms to prevent fund misuse. Funding to the Haitian government should be suspended if conditions are not met. The final version of H.R. 4899, P.L. 111-212 approves $1.140 billion for all FY2010 recovery and reconstruction activities for Haiti, including $212 million for multilateral debt relief. Direct budget support to the Haitian government requires clear goals and mechanisms to prevent fund misuse. Restrictions and reporting requirements are imposed on recovery and reconstruction funding, with disbursement of funds contingent on the involvement of Haitian government at various levels in program design and execution. The Secretary of State reports that Haitian government involvement is necessary in program design and execution, despite their limited ability. Funding for ESF and INCLE is contingent on Haiti carrying out reforms and removing corrupt officials. No funding for \"justice programs\" is allowed until an investigation into alleged extrajudicial killings by Haitian police in 2010 is completed. The Haitian government takes action on killings of prisoners by police in January 2010. $770 million approved for ESF, with $10 million for children's education and directives on renewable energy collaboration with Haiti. The enacted version of the bill provides directives on various issues including development and governance programs, family-based care for orphans, access to reconstruction grants for small NGOs, and reforestation. It approves $148 million for INCLE funding, with additional funds for correction facilities, combatting human trafficking, and replenishing funds borrowed from other countries. The enacted version of the bill approves $3 million for USAID's Office of the Inspector General for oversight of increased funding for Haiti and the requested funding for a Treasury Department attach\u00e9 and advisors. It also authorizes a $120 million contribution for a multi-donor trust fund, requiring consultation on accountability mechanisms before funding is provided. The enacted version of the bill authorizes up to $252 million in U.S. contributions for multilateral debt relief for Haiti, with additional funds transferred from existing sources. The Secretary of State is required to submit progress reports every 90 days until September 30, 2012, assessing U.S. contributions towards Haitian development goals and donor coordination. The Administration requested $155 million for diplomatic and broadcasting operations in Haiti, with $149.5 million for the State Department. $65 million is for logistical support and assistance for U.S. government personnel in Haiti, and $84.5 million for repairing or replacing staff housing and other buildings. Some funds may be used for evacuating Embassy family members and repatriation loans for American citizens. The State Department requested $155 million for diplomatic and broadcasting operations in Haiti, including funds for evacuating Embassy family members, repatriation loans for American citizens, and staffing support for relief efforts. Additionally, $5 million was allocated for the Broadcasting Board of Governors' Creole Language Service to increase broadcasts after the earthquake. The Broadcasting Board of Governors' Creole Language Service received $5 million to increase broadcasts five-fold after the earthquake, repair affiliate stations, hire staff, and establish a Reporting Center in Port-au-Prince. This funding is part of the $147 million allocated for State Department operations and broadcasting in Haiti in the enacted version of H.R. 4899. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 includes $147 million for State Department operations and broadcasting in Haiti, $8 million less than requested. Additionally, $592 million was added for foreign economic and humanitarian assistance programs for various countries. Mexico receives $5 million for emergency security support and $175 million for narcotics and law enforcement. The Diplomatic and Consular Program (DC&P) funding includes $175 million for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INCLE) activities related to the Merida Initiative. Jordan receives $100 million in Economic Support Fund (ESF) aid for Iraqi refugee and economic issues, and $50 million in Foreign Military Financing (FMF) for security needs. El Salvador gets $25 million in ESF for Hurricane Ida relief. The Democratic Republic of Congo is provided $15 million to assist civilians, particularly victims of violence.

The Senate Appropriations Committee report recommends $12 million for Vietnam to address dioxin contamination. In the Senate Appropriations Committee report, appropriators recommended $12 million in ESF funds for Vietnam to remediate dioxin contamination at Da Nang Airport. The Administration requested an additional $600 million for border security due to security concerns, with earlier requests including funding for Capitol Police. No additional funding was requested for preventing teacher, law enforcement, and firefighter layoffs, providing financing for farmers, energy loans, Pell Grants, or mine safety. The House's amended version of the bill, H.R. 4899, passed on July 1, 2010, without including substantial funding for preventing teacher, law enforcement, and firefighter layoffs, and providing additional Pell Grants. Funding for these proposals may be considered in other bills. Funding for Pell Grants was not included in H.R. 4899, but may be included in other bills. The Senate passed an amendment to H.R. 1586, providing $10 billion for the Education Jobs Fund and increasing federal Medicaid reimbursements. This is expected to free up additional funds for states to retain law enforcement and firefighters. The House plans to consider this bill after returning from recess. The House plans to return from recess the week of August 8 to consider a bill that would provide additional funds for states to retain law enforcement and firefighters. According to CBO, the bill is offset over ten years. The Administration did not request additional funds in FY2010 to prevent layoffs of teachers and other school staff, law enforcement officers, or firefighters. President Obama and Secretary of Education Arne Duncan emphasized the need for federal funds to prevent teacher layoffs, but a budget request for funds was not made. The final version of H.R. 4899 did not include funds to prevent teacher layoffs. The final version of H.R. 4899 did not include funds to prevent teacher layoffs as it was not included in the Senate version passed by the House. The House initially included $10 billion for the Education Jobs Fund in an amended bill, but later withdrew its support and adopted the Senate version. The earlier House bill would have provided $10 billion for the Education Jobs Fund, offset by cuts to Race to the Top grants and the Teacher Incentive Fund. The House bill initially included $10 billion for the Education Jobs Fund but later withdrew its support and adopted the Senate version, which did not include funds to prevent teacher layoffs. The proposed offsets for the Education Jobs Fund included cuts to Race to the Top grants, the Teacher Incentive Fund, and the Charter School Program, triggering a veto threat from the Administration. The American Association of School Administrators estimated that without additional funding, around 275,000 teachers and school staff could be laid off in the 2010-2011 school year. In 49 states, around 275,000 teachers and school staff could face layoffs in the 2010-2011 school year without additional funding. The American Association of School Administrators predicts an increase in pupil-to-teacher ratios from 15:1 to 17:1. The Education Jobs Fund proposed distributing funds to state governors based on a population-based formula used in the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund under the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA). The Education Jobs Fund proposed distributing funds to state governors based on a population-based formula used in the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund under the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA). Funds were to be distributed to prevent teacher layoffs, with a requirement for states to meet maintenance of effort (MOE) requirements to receive funds. The U.S. Department of Education (ED) would need to distribute funds within 45 days of enactment to states that had submitted applications for funding. Additional MOE requirements would apply specifically to Texas. The final version of H.R. 4899 did not include supplemental funding for hiring programs under the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Office, funding that was not requested by the Administration. The House Appropriations Committee (HAC) had proposed $1.179 billion for the COPS hiring program, but this funding was dropped from the House-amended version approved on July 1, and later receded from by the House on July 27, 2010. The House Appropriations Committee proposed $1.179 billion for the COPS hiring program, but this funding was dropped from the House-amended version approved on July 1, and later receded from by the House on July 27, 2010. If tax revenues do not rebound, states may need to lay off officers again. The proposed funding might not be enough to meet the current demand for hiring funds. The COPS program received over 7,200 applications requesting $8.3 billion for 40,000 positions in response to the $1 billion provided in the ARRA. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 did not include funds for firefighter hiring and retention. The House proposed $500 million for the SAFER program, but the amended version provided no200 million. The SAFER program provides grants to local fire departments for firefighter hiring and retention. Funding for SAFER was $210 million in FY2009, $420 million in FY2010, and $305 million in FY2011. Proponents argue for an additional $500 million to prevent firefighter layoffs due to budget shortfalls. Opponents believe current funding levels are sufficient given the need to reduce federal spending. In FY2010, SAFER received its highest appropriation in history, with current funding deemed appropriate to reduce federal spending. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 allocated $32 million for the Department of Agriculture to address credit shortages in the farm loan program and rural housing. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 allocated $32 million for the Department of Agriculture to address credit shortages in the farm loan program and rural housing, responding to high demand for government loans since 2008 due to banks making credit less available. Without supplemental appropriations, qualified loan applications from farmers or rural homebuyers may go unfunded for the rest of FY2010. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 allocated $32 million for the Department of Agriculture to address credit shortages in the farm loan program and rural housing. Qualified loan applications from farmers or rural homebuyers may go unfunded for the rest of FY2010. The $50 million offset within agriculture comes from a mandatory bioenergy program. For Section 502 rural housing loans, fees for loan guarantees are raised, and $697 million of loan guarantee authority is added. Additionally, $12 billion in guaranteed loans and $1.1 billion in direct loans are available from regular FY2010 appropriations. The Agriculture Department is requesting $75 million for $1.2 billion of direct loans under Section 502 for the regular FY2011 appropriation. The Agriculture Department is requesting $75 million for $1.2 billion of direct loans under Section 502 for the regular FY2011 appropriation. They are also seeking a new fee structure to allow $12 billion of loan guarantees at no cost to the government. Additionally, $151 million is requested to support $4.7 billion of farm loans for FY2011. The final version dropped $50 million for The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP). The Agriculture Department is requesting $151 million to support $4.7 billion of farm loans in the FY2011 appropriation. The final version dropped $50 million for The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) and made other rescissions from Agriculture Department accounts. The FY2010 supplemental funding included $300 million for rural broadband and $70 million from the Natural Resources Conservation Service. The Department of Energy's Loan Guarantee Program did not receive funding in the FY2010 supplemental, but the Administration's FY2011 request is pending. The Administration aimed to accelerate private sector investment in clean energy projects and move forward with three nuclear power plant projects in 2010. The DOE's Loan Guarantee Program (LGP) is under review for conditional commitment in 2010. The OMB stated that the FY2011 LGP request for $500 million would be reduced by $180 million. The House included $180 million for innovative energy technology projects, with $90 million for advanced nuclear power facilities and $90 million for renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. DOE estimates that $180 million could support up to $18 billion in loan guarantee authority. The DOE's Loan Guarantee Program requested $36.0 billion in additional loan guarantee authority for nuclear power projects in FY 2011. Established in 2005, the program received its first real funding in FY2009 through the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act, with $6 billion appropriated solely for commercial energy and energy efficiency technology projects. The American Reinvestment and Recovery Act (ARRA) in FY2009 allocated $6 billion for commercial renewable energy projects. $2 billion was later redirected to the Cash-for-Clunkers program. The enacted version of H.R. 4899, P.L. 111-212, did not include an additional $4.95 billion for the Federal Pell Grant Program as proposed in the House. The House proposed additional funding of $5.7 billion for the Federal Pell Grant Program in FY2011 to maintain the current award level. The House Appropriations Committee allocated this amount, but the Senate did not include it. The Committee FY2011 subcommittee allocations include an additional $5.7 billion for the Federal Pell Grant Program, which the Senate Appropriations Committee did not include. The program provides need-based grant aid to approximately 8.3 million undergraduate students and is funded through discretionary appropriations. The Administration requested an additional $600 million for border security along the Southwest Border of the United States, partially offset by rescinding $100 million in Department of Homeland Security funds for SBInet. $399 million would be designated as emergency requirements. The Administration requested $600 million for border security along the Southwest Border, with $399 million for DHS and $201 million for DOJ. DHS funding includes hiring 1,000 new Border Patrol agents, new detection systems, ICE agents, CBP officers, and canine teams. DOJ funding would be for unspecified purposes. The $201 million of DOJ funding would increase the presence of Federal law enforcement in the Southwest border districts by adding ATF Gunrunner Teams, FBI Hybrid Task Forces, DEA agents, equipment, operational support, attorneys, immigration judges, and support for detention and incarceration costs for criminal aliens. Funding would also support Mexican law enforcement. The FY2010 Supplemental, P.L. 111-212 did not include funding for border security, but H.R. 5875 passed by the House allocated $701 million for this purpose. This amount is $100 million more than the Administration's request and includes $201 million for DOJ to increase law enforcement presence in Southwest border districts and support Mexican law enforcement operations. The House amended July version includes $201 million to DOJ for border security efforts, $100 million more than the Administration's request. The Administration also requested $118 million for activities related to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The Administration proposed increasing funding for the U.S. Coast Guard under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 to prevent running out of funds for response activities. This was enacted separately in P.L. 111-191 on June 15, 2010. The request included $50 million for an Oil Spill Relief Employment Assistance program. The Administration requested funding for various programs related to the oil spill, including $50 million for an Oil Spill Relief Employment Assistance program, $29 million for additional inspections by the Department of the Interior, and $13 million for NOAA to help fishermen affected by the spill. The Administration requested funding for various programs related to the oil spill, including $10 million for enforcement actions, $7 million for research support, and $5 million for economic grants in affected areas. The final version of H.R. 4899 approves $94 million for oil spill response programs, including funding for economic assistance, long-term impact studies, and seafood inspection technologies. The final version of H.R. 4899 approves $94 million for oil-spill related programs, including funding for fisheries disaster relief, stock assessment of Gulf fisheries, and a study on the long-term effects on the Gulf ecosystem. The House July-amended version approved $50 million for an employment assistance program and added $12 million for a National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling. The enacted version also allows the Army Corps of Engineers to use a portion of discretionary funds for dredging to mitigate oil spill impacts. The Administration requested $17.9 billion for additional mandatory spending, including benefits for veterans exposed to Agent Orange in Vietnam. The Administration requested $17.9 billion in additional mandatory spending, including benefits for veterans exposed to Agent Orange, settling the Cobell and Pigford II cases, and increasing funding for the Coast Guard's response activities. The Administration proposed $17.9 billion in additional mandatory spending, including benefits for veterans exposed to Agent Orange and settling legal cases. The Secretary of the VA has authority to determine service-connected health problems for veterans. This spending would not be subject to budget constraints like PAYGO rules. The Administration proposed additional mandatory funding for VA benefits and court settlements, exempt from budget constraints like PAYGO rules. Some Members suggest finding offsets or designating funding as emergency. The Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs has authority to establish presumptions of service connection for conditions related to Agent Orange exposure, including Parkinson's disease, ischemic heart disease, and leukemia for Vietnam veterans. Regulations were proposed in 2010. The Department of Veterans Affairs established presumptions of service connection for conditions related to Agent Orange exposure, including leukemia for Vietnam veterans. Proposed regulations were issued in 2010, estimating costs at $13.4 billion in FY2010. Approximately 86,000 veterans are eligible for retroactive benefits and an increase in disability ratings. Disability compensation payments will begin once final regulations are in place. The Department of Veterans Affairs established presumptions of service connection for conditions related to Agent Orange exposure, including leukemia for Vietnam veterans. Proposed regulations were issued in 2010, estimating costs at $13.4 billion in FY2010. Disability compensation payments will begin when final regulations are published, with an estimated $5 billion needed in FY2010 according to CBO. The CBO estimated that $5 billion, not $13.4 billion, would be needed in FY2010 to compensate veterans once regulations are issued. The differences in estimates are due to uncertainty about when final regulations for service connection presumptions will be released and the time for processing disability compensation claims by the VA. H.R. 4899 includes the $13.4 billion for additional veterans benefits related to Agent Orange, as requested by the Administration. The Administration requested $4.6 billion for settling claims related to Agent Orange, approved by both the Senate and House versions. Section 902 prohibits VA from paying these claims until Congressional review period expires. Veterans disability compensation will not be impacted as claims will be back-dated to date of eligibility. The Administration requested $4.6 billion to settle two longstanding cases against the government: $1.15 billion for the Pigford Black Farmers Discrimination Case and $3.4 billion for the Cobell Indian Trust Litigation Settlement. Claimants argue that settlements could be voided without appropriated funds before certain dates, but deadlines have been extended. The most recent deadline for the Cobell case is August 6, 2010. The Pigford II discrimination case settlement was announced on February 18, 2010, by Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack and Attorney General Eric H. Holder, Jr. The settlement is final and non-appealable, with a provision stating that the funds were not appropriated in the FY2010 Budget. The Pigford II settlement requested $1.15 billion in FY2010 Budget but funds were not appropriated by the deadline. If Congress fails to make the appropriation, claimants could void the settlement, but it is unlikely in the near term. The Administration also requested $3.4 billion in FY2010 supplemental appropriations for the Cobell v. Salazar case. The $3.4 billion requested in FY2010 supplemental appropriations for the Cobell v. Salazar case includes $1.4 billion for plaintiffs and $2 billion for trust land interests and education scholarships. The settlement deadline was extended for a fifth time, with uncertainty about further extensions. The Cobell lawsuit, initiated in 2009, requires legislative authorization by August 6, 2010, with the deadline recently extended for a fifth time. The lawsuit arose from Interior's inability to accurately account for payments into and from Individual Indian Monies (IIM) trust accounts set up in the 19th century. Interior's management of these accounts was challenging due to the age of the allotments and the splitting of interests in each tract among generations of heirs, resulting in an estimated 384,000 IIM accounts. The Cobell lawsuit, initiated in 2009, requires legislative authorization by August 6, 2010, with the deadline recently extended for a fifth time. The lawsuit arose from Interior's inability to accurately account for payments into and from Individual Indian Monies (IIM) trust accounts set up in the 19th century. The splitting of interests in each tract among generations of heirs created an estimated 384,000 IIM accounts with a current total asset value over $460 million. Both plaintiffs and defendants may support the Cobell settlement to end years of costly litigation. Some Indian organizations and plaintiffs oppose congressional approval of the settlement, while others approve. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 does not include the $4.6 billion appropriation for the Cobell and Pigford II court settlements as requested by the Administration. The enacted version of H.R. 4899 does not include the $4.6 billion appropriation for the Cobell and Pigford II court settlements as requested by the Administration. The House version passed on July 1, 2010, included language providing direct spending authority to use the Judgment Fund to pay for these settlements. The final version of H.R. 4899 does not include funding for the Cobell and Pigford II court settlements as requested by the Administration. Senator Reid's office may propose passing these provisions in a separate bill or attaching them to other bills, which would require offsets or savings in mandatory programs under PAYGO provisions. The final version of H.R. 4899 did not include provisions from the earlier House July amended version that identified $4.68 billion in mandatory savings over ten years. One provision aimed to increase rebates states receive from drug manufacturers by including more forms of drugs in the calculation of Average Manufacturer Price (AMP). Another provision intended to reduce drug expenditures for federal programs by giving the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) authority. The final version of H.R. 4899 did not include provisions from the earlier House July amended version that aimed to increase rebates states receive from drug manufacturers by including more forms of drugs in the calculation of Average Manufacturer Price (AMP). Another provision intended to reduce drug expenditures for federal programs by giving the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) authority to limit deals between brand name and generic drug makers. The July 1 amended House version of the supplemental appropriations act would have amended Medicaid law to include different dosage forms of outpatient drugs in determining AMP. AMP is a benchmark price used to calculate rebates. The proposed amendment to Medicaid law on July 27, 2010, aimed to include injected, infused, and inhaled forms of outpatient drugs in determining the Average Manufacturer Price (AMP) for calculating rebates. This change was intended to ensure consistent calculation of rebates for prescription drugs purchased by states on behalf of Medicaid beneficiaries. The proposed amendment to Medicaid law on July 27, 2010, aimed to include injected, infused, and inhaled forms of outpatient drugs in the AMP calculation for Medicaid drug rebates. This change would increase manufacturer obligations and reduce federal Medicaid expenditures by $2.1 billion over 10 years. The Senate did not accept the provisions to add additional drug forms to the definition of AMP that was included in the House amended version. A similar provision to the AMP changes proposed earlier was included in S.Amdt. 4567 offered in the nature of a substitute to H.R. 1586 on July 29, 2010. Sections 4201-4206 of the House July amended version of H.R. 4899 form the Preserve Access to Affordable Generics Act that aims to stop the practice of reverse payments. The House amended version of H.R. 4899 includes Sections 4201-4206, forming the Preserve Access to Affordable Generics Act, which targets the practice of reverse payments in the pharmaceutical industry. This practice involves brand-name drug companies compensating generic drug companies to delay the entry of generic drugs into the market. Since the Hatch-Waxman Act in 1984, the FDA can approve generic drugs after the patent period ends, allowing for lower prices compared to brand-name drugs. The House-passed health reform package included a provision targeting the practice of brand-name drug companies compensating generic companies to delay market entry, but it was not included in the enacted health reform bills. The FDA can approve generic drugs after the patent period ends, leading to lower prices. Delays in generic drug availability increase costs to consumers and the government. Provisions in the FTC Act aim to make agreements involving compensation for delaying generic drug development unlawful. The FTC Act aims to make agreements involving compensation for delaying generic drug development unlawful, with provisions for rulemaking authority, judicial review, and civil penalties. Implementing this provision could reduce federal budget deficits by $2.68 billion over the 2010-2020 period. The Senate did not accept these provisions. The enacted version of the bill did not include $538 million for waste, fraud, and abuse initiatives in federal programs, which were intended for various government agencies. The House July amended version of the bill allocated $538 million for waste, fraud, and abuse (WFA) initiatives in federal programs. This funding was designated for activities such as enhanced tax enforcement by the IRS and the HHS Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Account. The House amended bill allocated $538 million for waste, fraud, and abuse initiatives in federal programs, including tax enforcement by the IRS and funding for HHS Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Account. Approximately half of the funds would be used by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for Medicare Advantage, Medicare drug benefits, Medicaid, and the State Children's Health Insurance Program. $65 million would go to the HHS Office of the Inspector General, and $60 million would be transferred to the Department of Justice for fraud and abuse investigations. Additionally, $38 million would be allocated for the SSA to conduct disability reviews and eligibility redeterminations. The House amended bill allocated $538 million for waste, fraud, and abuse initiatives in federal programs, including tax enforcement by the IRS and funding for HHS Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Account. $38 million would be for the SSA to conduct continuing disability reviews of Social Security Disability Insurance beneficiaries and eligibility redeterminations for Supplemental Security Income recipients. $5 million would be for the DOL to conduct in-person reemployment reviews, eligibility assessments, and unemployment insurance improper payment reviews. These funds were not designated as emergency funding and would be available until September 2011 for the DOL, SSA, and IRS, and until September 30, 2012 for HHS. CBO estimated that the additional PI funding would increase the federal deficit by $538 million in 2010. The Administration proposed to expand the Coast Guard's funds from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund for response activities and establish a new unemployment assistance program. The Administration proposed to expand the Coast Guard's funds from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund for response activities and establish a new unemployment assistance program for individuals not entitled to other benefits. This includes a $150 million annual withdrawal limit supported by an excise tax on petroleum. Additionally, a 1 cent increase in the oil barrel tax was suggested to replenish the trust fund. The Administration proposed expanding the Coast Guard's funds from the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund for response activities and establishing a new unemployment assistance program. The program would be funded by the responsible parties under the Oil Pollution Act, with mandatory appropriations as advances from the trust fund. Later withdrawals from the fund would not require appropriations and could be recouped by the federal government.
