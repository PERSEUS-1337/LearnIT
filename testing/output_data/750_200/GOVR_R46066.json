Critics express concern over Trump's criticism of NATO. President Trump's criticism of NATO allies' defense spending has played a key role in spurring increases in European allied defense spending over the past five years. Critics are concerned that his approach could harm NATO cohesion and credibility. NATO members agreed in 2006 to allocate at least 2% of GDP to defense budgets annually and to devote 20% of defense expenditure to procurement and research. These targets were formalized at the 2014 Wales Summit, with allies pledging to move towards the 2% guideline within a decade. At NATO's 2014 Wales Summit, allies pledged to increase defense spending towards the 2% guideline within a decade. European allies and Canada have added $130 billion in defense spending since 2014, expected to reach $400 billion by 2024.

President Trump's criticism has spurred increases in European defense spending. In 2019, 9 allies are expected to meet the 2% guideline for defense spending, and 16 allies are expected to meet the 20% benchmark for major equipment spending. President Trump criticizes NATO members for not reaching defense-spending targets, including Germany, which currently spends 1.38% of GDP on defense and plans to reach 1.5% by 2024. Germany and other allies argue that contributions to NATO missions and military capabilities are as important as total defense spending levels. Allied contributions to NATO missions and military capabilities are deemed as crucial as total defense spending levels. Analysts argue that focusing on defense outputs, such as military capabilities and effectiveness in NATO missions, is equally important as defense inputs like budget size. Allied contributions to NATO missions and military capabilities are crucial, with a focus on defense outputs like military capabilities and effectiveness in missions. NATO aims for 20% of each member's defense expenditure to be spent on new equipment and research. Secretary General Stoltenberg emphasizes a broad approach to measuring contributions, including \"cash, capabilities, and contributions.\" This approach considers factors beyond just GDP defense spending metrics for a more comprehensive assessment. Allied leaders in London approved a U.S. proposal to reduce U.S. contributions and increase German contributions to NATO's common funds, totaling about $2.6 billion in 2019. This funding covers NATO headquarters' day-to-day operations, collective military assets, and infrastructure. In 2018, the U.S. contributed 22% ($570 million) to NATO's common-funded budgets, followed by Germany (15%), France (11%), and the UK (10%).

France advocates for strong European responses but opposes a larger role for NATO. Disagreements exist among allies on the appropriate response to security challenges. France advocates for strong European responses to terrorism and conflict in the Middle East but opposes a larger role for NATO. Some allies are hesitant to involve NATO in endorsing military action in the MENA region. The Trump Administration and some Members of Congress urge NATO to assess security implications of Chinese investment in Europe. The U.S. is concerned about China's strategic foothold in Europe through unfair trade practices, investments in key industries, and infrastructure, particularly in critical infrastructure and 5G networks. There are discussions about potentially limiting military cooperation and intelligence sharing with allies allowing Chinese investment in 5G networks. NATO has adopted a plan to update defense strategies.

Italy withdrew its system in December 2019, while Spain continues to deploy a Patriot missile battery. NATO Secretary General expressed concerns about Turkey's acquisition of the S-400 air defense system but emphasized Turkey's continued participation in NATO's defense. Turkey's acquisition of the S-400 air defense system is deemed \"not good\" for NATO, with some suggesting excluding Turkey from NATO's defense systems. The North Atlantic Treaty does not explicitly allow action against a member without consent, but measures could be taken to affect allied cooperation with Turkey. Some NATO members may change contributions or activities in Turkey in response to Turkish actions. US Defense Secretary urges NATO allies to take diplomatic and economic measures. European leaders emphasize the need for coordinated European defense capabilities independent of NATO.

Critics argue that this has damaged essential relationships, undermined NATO's credibility, and could embolden adversaries like Russia. Additionally, there are concerns about the Administration's reported lack of coordination with allies on policies with significant security implications for Europe. Many Members of Congress support robust U.S. leadership of NATO to address potential threats from Russia and advocate for enhanced military responses to Russian aggression in Ukraine. Some have called for stronger European contributions to collective defense measures. There are increasing questions about whether NATO should take formal action against allies like Turkey. European contributions to collective defense in Europe are being questioned by some Members of Congress, particularly regarding whether NATO should address allies like Turkey pursuing policies that could threaten alliance security. Congress may need to consider NATO's strategic value to the U.S., U.S. leadership within NATO, and the possibility of adopting a new strategic concept to better address security threats from Russia and emerging cyber and hybrid warfare threats. The alliance is considering adopting a new strategic concept to address security threats from Russia, cyber, and hybrid warfare. They are also examining NATO's capacity to address security threats from the MENA region, consequences of member states not meeting defense spending targets, U.S. force posture in Europe, and European allies' contributions to NATO deterrence efforts. The U.S. is evaluating European allies' contributions to NATO deterrence efforts, considering sanctions for actions jeopardizing security, reassessing NATO's enlargement policy, and developing a strategy towards China amidst concerns about increased Chinese investment in Europe."
