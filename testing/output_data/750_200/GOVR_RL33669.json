    "content": "The national debate arose over the NSA's secret Terrorist Surveillance Program (TSP), questioning its compliance with FISA and the need for additional authority. The program involved warrantless surveillance of international communications involving individuals in the US believed to be linked to al Qaeda. The Bush Administration asserted constitutional and statutory support for its program involving warrantless surveillance of international communications linked to al Qaeda. Senator Mitch McConnell introduced the Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006 as part of a series of bills addressing terrorism in the 109th Congress. The Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006 was part of a series of bills introduced in the 109th Congress to address electronic surveillance programs for detecting and preventing international terrorist threats. In the 110th Congress, three related bills have been introduced. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 provides a statutory framework for electronic surveillance. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA) provides a framework for electronic surveillance to acquire foreign intelligence information and combat terrorism. The Bush Administration argued that FISA lacked speed and agility in dealing with terrorism. The Bush Administration argued that FISA lacked speed and agility in dealing with terrorism, leading to the authorization of electronic surveillance by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to target international communications involving suspected members of terrorist organizations like al Qaeda. The Attorney General announced that all surveillance previously conducted under the TSP will now be subject to FISC approval, with the President deciding not to reauthorize the program when the current authorization expires. Intelligence Committees were briefed on the classified details of the FISC orders. The Attorney General informed the Intelligence Committees about the FISC orders and directed a classified briefing on the NSA program. A lawsuit challenged the program's legality, with a court ruling it unconstitutional. In a lawsuit challenging the NSA program's legality, U.S. District Court Judge Anna Diggs Taylor deemed it unconstitutional, citing violations of various laws and the U.S. Constitution. The decision was appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which stayed the judgment pending appeal. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit stayed Judge Taylor's judgment on the NSA program pending appeal. The attorneys for the appellants filed a letter regarding orders from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. New legislation would amend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The proposed legislation, S. 3931 and Title II of S. 3929, aims to create a new Title VII under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 to address electronic surveillance programs. It includes amendments to FISA provisions on electronic surveillance without a warrant, applications for Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court orders, emergency surveillance, and liability limitations for aiding the government in electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes. The proposed legislation aims to create a new Title VII under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 to address electronic surveillance programs. It includes amendments to FISA provisions on electronic surveillance without a warrant, applications for Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court orders, emergency surveillance, liability limitations for aiding the government in electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes, and changes to definitions and criminal provisions of FISA. The Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006 proposes amendments to FISA, including creating a new Title VII for electronic surveillance programs. Sec. 3 of S. 3931, Sec. 203 of S. 3929, defines \"electronic surveillance program\" under FISA. The Terrorist Surveillance Act of 2006 proposes amendments to FISA, including creating a new Title VII for electronic surveillance programs. The new Section 701 of FISA defines \"electronic surveillance program\" as a program for gathering foreign intelligence information or protecting against international terrorism, where it is not feasible to name every person, address, or location to be subjected to surveillance, and where flexibility and an extended period of surveillance are required. The proposed amendments to FISA include creating a new Title VII for electronic surveillance programs. This new section would allow the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) to review, authorize, and reauthorize electronic surveillance programs for obtaining foreign intelligence information or protecting against international terrorism. Initial authorization can be up to 90 days, with reauthorization determined by the FISC. The FISC can authorize electronic surveillance programs for up to 90 days, with reauthorization as deemed reasonable. If denied, the Attorney General can submit new applications or appeal to the FIS Court of Review. If criteria are met, surveillance under Title VII of FISA can be conducted. If surveillance criteria under Title VII of FISA are not met for a target in the US, the Attorney General must stop surveillance unless specific conditions are fulfilled. Surveillance can only continue under Title VII if an application for electronic surveillance is made under Section 104 of FISA. After determining to continue surveillance under Title VII, an application is made under Section 104 of FISA for an FISC order authorizing electronic surveillance of the target. The bills also authorize the transfer of cases challenging the legality of classified communications intelligence activity related to a foreign threat. The proposed legislation allows for the transfer of cases challenging the legality of classified communications intelligence activities to the FIS Court of Review if the Attorney General files an affidavit stating that further proceedings in the originating court would harm national security. The Attorney General's affidavit implies that cases challenging classified communications intelligence activities may be transferred to the FIS Court of Review. However, the language in the proposed subsections of FISA creates uncertainty about the transfer process and jurisdiction, particularly regarding standing and the legality of the program. The FISC has jurisdiction to determine standing and the legality of the program in criminal cases. Disclosure of national security information in criminal proceedings would be governed by specific laws. Decisions of the FISC can be reviewed by the FIS Court of Review. Under proposed subsections 702(b)(1) and (2), decisions of the FISC would be subject to review by the FIS Court of Review and may be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. The FISC or originating court can dismiss challenges to electronic surveillance programs, preserving all litigation privileges. A new Section 703 of FISA is created under Sec. 5 of S. 3931, setting out requirements for electronic surveillance program applications. Subsection 703(b) authorizes the FISC to request necessary information for court determinations under new section 704. Sec. 6 of S. 3931, Sec. 206 of S. 3929, creates a new subsection 704 addressing necessary findings and contents for electronic surveillance programs. The new subsection 704 of FISA addresses necessary findings and contents for electronic surveillance programs, including factors for assessing constitutionality and contents of an approval order. The new Sec. 705 of FISA addresses congressional oversight of electronic surveillance programs, requiring the Attorney General to submit classified reports every 180 days to congressional intelligence committees. Sec. 8 of S. 3931, Sec. 208 of S. 3929, amends FISA by repealing sections that allow the President to authorize electronic surveillance without court approval. The President can authorize electronic surveillance, physical searches, and the use of pen register or trap and trace devices without a court order for up to 15 days after a declaration of war by Congress. Current laws prohibit interception of communications unless specific exceptions apply. The President can authorize electronic surveillance, physical searches, and the use of pen register or trap and trace devices without a court order for up to 15 days after a declaration of war by Congress. Current laws prohibit interception of communications unless specific exceptions apply, such as the provision in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(2)(e) allowing officers, employees, or agents of the United States to conduct electronic surveillance in the normal course of their official duty as authorized by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. Current laws allow officers, employees, or agents of the United States to conduct electronic surveillance in the normal course of their official duty under the Constitution or the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. This provision does not affect the acquisition of foreign intelligence information from international or foreign communications conducted in accordance with applicable Federal law. The exclusive means for conducting electronic surveillance and intercepting domestic communications is defined by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, excluding other methods. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 defines the exclusive means for conducting electronic surveillance and intercepting domestic communications. Electronic surveillance is prohibited under the current law, except when authorized by FISA or specific chapters of the U.S. Code related to interception of communications and access to stored data. The amendments to FISA in Sec.8(b)(2) of S. 3931 and Sec. 208(b)(2) of S. 3929 address Section 109 of FISA, 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 1809, which provides criminal sanctions for unauthorized electronic surveillance or disclosure of information obtained through electronic means. A person would face criminal liability if they engage in electronic surveillance under color of law except as authorized by statute, or disclose/use information obtained through unauthorized electronic surveillance. The penalties for disclosing or using information obtained through unauthorized electronic surveillance would be increased from a fine of up to $10,000 to a fine of up to $100,000, with imprisonment for up to 5 years. The penalties under FISA would be increased to a fine of up to $100,000 and imprisonment for up to 15 years. Amendments to FISA definitions are also proposed. The definition of \"electronic surveillance\" under FISA would be updated to include a person other than a United States person who is reasonably expected to possess, control, transmit, or receive foreign intelligence information while in the United States. This change would be made under subsection 101(b)(1)(D) of FISA. The definition of \"electronic surveillance\" under FISA is updated to include intentional surveillance directed at a known person in the US with a reasonable expectation of privacy, or the intentional acquisition of communication contents with a reasonable expectation of privacy. The updated definition of \"electronic surveillance\" under FISA includes intentional acquisition of communication contents with a reasonable expectation of privacy for law enforcement purposes within the United States. Minimization procedures are in place to protect the privacy of unconsenting U.S. persons during electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes. The procedures allow for the dissemination of non-publicly available information on unconsenting U.S. persons obtained during electronic surveillance or physical search for foreign intelligence purposes. This information can be retained and shared with law enforcement for criminal activity evidence, but must not be disclosed in a way that identifies a U.S. person without their consent, unless necessary for understanding foreign intelligence information. The minimization procedures under FISA prevent the disclosure, dissemination, or retention of any communication involving a United States person without their consent, unless necessary for foreign intelligence purposes. The FISA minimization procedures restrict the disclosure, dissemination, or retention of any communication involving a US person, unless authorized by court order or in cases of imminent harm. The FISA minimization procedures limit the disclosure, dissemination, or retention of any communication involving a US person to 7 days, unless authorized by court order or in cases of imminent harm. The proposed changes in S. 3931 and S. 3929 would modify the definitions of \"wire communication\" and \"contents\" in FISA, potentially impacting the transmission and information included in communications. The proposed changes in S. 3931 and S. 3929 would modify the definitions of \"contents\" in FISA, specifying what information is included in a communication. This includes substance, symbols, sounds, words, purport, or meaning, but excludes dialing, routing, addressing, or signaling information. Section 102 of FISA authorizes electronic surveillance without a court order for up to one year for foreign intelligence information upon certification by the Attorney General. The proposed amendments in S. 3931 and S. 3929 expand the application of electronic surveillance under FISA to include acquisition of communications of foreign powers or agents of foreign powers. It also removes a requirement in the current FISA section. The amendment to FISA expands electronic surveillance to include foreign powers or agents, removing a certification requirement for the Attorney General. Surveillance must comply with minimization procedures and the Attorney General's assessment of compliance. The amendment to FISA allows electronic surveillance on agents of foreign powers, requiring compliance with minimization procedures and the Attorney General's assessment of such compliance. The report to congressional intelligence committees must include justification for targeting an agent of a foreign power. The Attorney General must provide a statement of facts to justify electronic surveillance on a foreign power agent. The FISA amendment requires compliance with minimization procedures and reporting to congressional intelligence committees. The proposed subsection 102(b)(1) of FISA creates new authority for the President to conduct electronic surveillance with approved security procedures. The proposed subsection 102(b)(1) of FISA, Sec. 9(c) of S. 3931, Sec. 209(c) of S. 3929, authorizes the President, through the Attorney General, to acquire foreign intelligence information for up to one year on individuals believed to be outside the U.S. if certain conditions are met. The proposed subsection 102(b)(1) of FISA authorizes the acquisition of foreign intelligence information from wire or electronic communications service providers, with a significant purpose of obtaining foreign intelligence information. The certification does not need to identify specific facilities. The Attorney General's certification for acquisition activity must meet minimization procedures under section 101(h) of FISA. Specific locations do not need to be identified in the certification. Compliance with the certification and minimization procedures is required, with the Attorney General reporting assessments to congressional intelligence committees. The certification is transmitted to the FISC and kept under seal unless legality needs to be determined. The Attorney General's certification for acquisition activity under FISA would be transmitted to the FISC and maintained under seal unless legality needs to be determined. The Attorney General can direct a person to provide assistance for the acquisition while protecting secrecy and minimizing interference with their services. The new subsection 102(d) of FISA requires the government to compensate individuals providing aid at the prevailing rate. If directed to provide aid and failing to comply, the Attorney General can seek FISC intervention for compliance. Failure to obey could result in punishment. Under proposed subsection 102(e) of FISA, the Attorney General can go to the FISC to enforce compliance with a directive, with disobedience punishable as contempt of court. Subsection 102(f) allows recipients to challenge the directive's legality by filing a petition with the FISC judges' review pool. The assigned judge must review the petition within 24 hours, dismissing frivolous ones. The assigned judge must review a petition within 24 hours, denying frivolous ones immediately. If not frivolous, the judge must make a determination within 72 hours, only granting a petition to modify or set aside a directive if it is found to be unlawful. A petition to modify or set aside a directive must be reviewed by the assigned judge within 72 hours. If found unlawful, the judge may grant the petition. If not granted, the directive must be affirmed, and compliance ordered. A petition to the FIS Court of Review for review of an FISC decision must be made within seven days, with reasons for the decision provided in writing. The FIS Court of Review must provide a written statement of reasons for its decision. A petition for review of the FIS Court of Review decision can be made to the U.S. Supreme Court. Judicial proceedings under Section 102 of FISA must be conducted expeditiously, with records maintained under security measures. The FIS Court of Review must provide a written statement of reasons for its decision and maintain records under security measures. Petitions under Section 102 of FISA are to be filed under seal, and any Government submissions containing classified information may be reviewed by the court ex parte and in camera. Proposed subsection 102(j) of FISA would preclude any cause of action against providers of communication services. Proposed subsection 102(j) of FISA would prevent legal action against communication service providers for assisting the Government under new directives. Information on a US person obtained with Attorney General authorization can be used by federal officers with minimization procedures. Information acquired under Section 102 of FISA can only be used or disclosed by federal officers in accordance with minimization procedures. No information obtained under this section can be disclosed for law enforcement purposes without the advance authorization of the Attorney General. New subsection 102(k) states that privileged communication obtained under Section 102 of FISA shall not lose its privileged character. Proposed subsections 102(m) and (n) outline procedures for using or disclosing such information in federal, state, or local proceedings. The federal government is restricted in introducing or using information acquired under Section 102 of FISA in any trial or hearing without proper authorization from the Attorney General. The government can only use information obtained under Section 102 of FISA in legal proceedings if it complies with proposed subsection 102(m), which requires notifying the aggrieved person and the court beforehand. Under proposed subsection 102(n), a state or political subdivision can only use information obtained from Section 102 of FISA in legal proceedings if the aggrieved person and the court are notified beforehand. The state or political subdivision must notify the aggrieved person, court, and U.S. Attorney General before using information from Section 102 of FISA in legal proceedings. The aggrieved person can move to suppress evidence if the information was unlawfully acquired or not in conformity with an authorization order. Proposed subsections 102(o) and 102(p) of FISA address the grounds for filing a motion to suppress evidence and the conditions under which disclosure or an adversary hearing could harm national security. Proposed subsections 102(o) and 102(p) of FISA address the grounds for filing a motion to suppress evidence and the conditions under which disclosure or an adversary hearing could harm national security. When a motion to suppress is filed or a request is made seeking to discover or obtain materials related to a Section 102 acquisition, the U.S. district court has jurisdiction over the matter. The U.S. district court has the authority to determine the lawfulness of a Section 102 acquisition and may review relevant materials in camera and ex parte. Portions of the materials may be disclosed to the aggrieved person if necessary. The U.S. district court can review Section 102 acquisitions for lawfulness and may disclose relevant materials to the aggrieved person if necessary. If an acquisition is found to be unlawful, evidence obtained would be suppressed; if lawful, the court may allow discovery or disclosure as required by due process. The court can review Section 102 acquisitions for lawfulness and disclose relevant materials if necessary. If lawful, due process may require discovery or disclosure. Federal officers acquiring foreign intelligence information under Section 102 of FISA may seek consultation. Proposed subsection 102(r) of FISA allows federal officers to consult with law enforcement at various levels to investigate or protect against threats from foreign powers or their agents, including terrorism and intelligence activities. Proposed subsection 102(u) of FISA requires retention of directives and orders for 10 years. Additionally, Sec. 103(a) of FISA is amended to allow the Chief Justice to designate 11 district court judges as FISC judges. The Chief Justice of the United States can designate 11 district court judges as FISC judges, with at least three residing within 20 miles of DC. A new provision in FISA allows for FISC orders under Title I if the President authorizes the Attorney General. FISC judges can approve electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes. The FISA allows for FISC judges to approve electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes. Amendments to FISA include new subsections and requirements for court orders. The certification for electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes would now be made by the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs or an authorized executive branch official, as per the amended FISA law. The amended FISA law now authorizes an executive branch official appointed by the President to conduct electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes, excluding certain information in the application for a FISC order. The application for surveillance under the amended FISA law must include details on whether physical entry is required and information on surveillance techniques. Proposed changes would strike current sections of FISA and redesignate others. The Attorney General must review surveillance applications for specific targets under FISA upon request from certain government officials. The list of officials requesting reviews may expand to include the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Amendments to FISA would impact surveillance procedures and requirements. The proposed amendments to FISA would impact surveillance procedures by changing the process for approving electronic surveillance applications. The proposed amendments to FISA would change the process for approving electronic surveillance applications, including redesignating subsections and replacing current specifications with new ones. The proposed amendments to FISA would change the process for approving electronic surveillance applications, including redesignating subsections and replacing current specifications with new ones. The amendments include deleting current requirements in subsections 105(c)(1)(F) and 105(d) related to specifying authorized coverage of surveillance devices and excluding certain information from applications for court orders. The proposed amendments to FISA would change the process for approving electronic surveillance applications for foreign powers, specifying the type of surveillance involved, including the need for physical entry. The proposed amendments to FISA would require specifying the type of electronic surveillance involved, including the need for physical entry. Extensions of an order authorizing electronic surveillance under FISA may be granted on the same basis as an original order with new findings, except for certain targeted surveillance cases. The proposed amendments to FISA allow for surveillance against foreign-based political organizations or entities directed by foreign governments for up to one year if no communication of a US person will be acquired. Extensions for surveillance against foreign agents can also be granted for one year. The proposed amendments to FISA allow for surveillance against foreign-based political organizations or entities directed by foreign governments for up to one year. Extensions for surveillance against foreign agents can also be granted for one year, with new findings required for each extension. The proposed amendments to FISA allow for surveillance against foreign-based political organizations or entities directed by foreign governments for up to one year, with emergency authorization of electronic surveillance without a court order for up to 72 hours by the Attorney General in certain situations. The Attorney General can authorize emergency electronic surveillance for up to 72 hours without a court order under FISA. A court order must be sought within this time frame, and surveillance must be terminated when the information is acquired, if a court order is denied, or at the end of the 72 hours. Restrictions are placed on the use or disclosure of information obtained without a court order. The current subsection 105(f) of FISA would be replaced with a new subsection 105(f) under S. 3931 and S. 3929. The new language would grant authority to an executive branch officer appointed by the President to conduct electronic surveillance without a court order on an emergency basis. The new language under S. 3931 and S. 3929 grants authority to an executive branch officer appointed by the President to conduct emergency electronic surveillance without a court order. The Attorney General must be informed of the surveillance, and a FISC judge must be notified as soon as possible after authorization. The new provision allows for emergency electronic surveillance without a court order, with an application to be made to a FISC judge within seven days. Surveillance terminates when information is obtained, the application is denied, or after 72 hours. The new provision allows for emergency electronic surveillance without a court order, with surveillance terminating when information is obtained, the application is denied, or after 72 hours. The period of 72 hours would be replaced by seven days after approval by an executive branch officer appointed by the President. The President can authorize emergency electronic surveillance without a court order, with restrictions on disclosure and use of information. The official authorizing the surveillance must ensure minimization procedures are followed. The revised language in the new subsection of FISA requires that minimization procedures be followed for emergency electronic surveillance. Additionally, modifications are made to limitations of liability for those providing information or assistance with FISA surveillance. The amended provision in FISA limits liability for providers of electronic communication services, landlords, custodians, and others who assist with electronic surveillance or physical search in accordance with court orders or emergency requests. This includes responding to requests for information or technical assistance that do not constitute electronic surveillance as defined in FISA. Sec. 106 of FISA restricts the use of information on unconsenting U.S. persons obtained through electronic surveillance. It includes notification requirements and allows aggrieved individuals to move to suppress unlawfully acquired information. Additionally, Sec. 9(g) of S. 3931 addresses the destruction of unintentionally acquired information. Sec. 106 of FISA restricts the use of information on unconsenting U.S. persons obtained through electronic surveillance, including notification requirements and the ability to suppress unlawfully acquired information. Sec. 9(g) of S. 3931 addresses the destruction of unintentionally acquired information, with proposed modifications for when communication is unintentionally acquired and must be destroyed unless indicating a threat of death or serious bodily harm. The Attorney General can order the destruction of contents unless they indicate a threat of harm. Amendments to FISA include provisions for unintentionally acquired information. The language regarding the Attorney General's determination of significant foreign intelligence information in unintentionally acquired communications under FISA is unclear and needs clarification. The proposed amendment would require the destruction of unintentionally acquired communication contents unless the Attorney General determines they contain significant foreign intelligence information or indicate a threat of death or serious bodily harm. The proposed amendment expands the circumstances for preventing the destruction of unintentionally acquired communication contents. However, there may be redundancy in the amending language. Amendments to FISA sections are also made to reflect changes in the law. Congressional oversight provisions are also amended to add new requirements. The proposed amendment expands oversight provisions of FISA to require a feasibility study for a secure document management system for electronic surveillance applications. The proposed amendment expands oversight provisions of FISA to require a feasibility study for a secure document management system for electronic surveillance applications by government personnel before submission to the FISC. Amendments to Title I of FISA were made to facilitate prompt submission of applications and rulings to the FISC. The proposed amendment to Title I of FISA expands oversight provisions by adding a new category of persons deemed as \"agents of a foreign power\" under FISA, related to the development or proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The proposed amendment to Title I of FISA expands oversight provisions by adding a new category of persons deemed as \"agents of a foreign power\" under FISA, related to the development or proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. This includes individuals engaging in sabotage, international terrorism, or activities in preparation for such acts on behalf of a foreign power. The proposed amendment to Title I of FISA expands oversight provisions by adding a new category of persons deemed as \"agents of a foreign power\" under FISA, related to the development or proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. This includes individuals engaging in sabotage, international terrorism, or activities in preparation for such acts on behalf of a foreign power. Additionally, any person who knowingly engages in activities in preparation for sabotage, international terrorism, or the development or proliferation of weapons of mass destruction for a foreign power would be considered an \"agent of a foreign power\" under FISA. The proposed amendment to FISA adds a new definition for \"weapon of mass destruction\" under Section 101, including destructive devices, toxic chemicals, biological agents, toxins, or vectors. The proposed amendment to FISA expands the definition of \"weapon of mass destruction\" to include destructive devices, toxic chemicals, biological agents, toxins, or vectors, as well as weapons designed to release radiation or radioactivity at dangerous levels. Amendments to various sections of FISA would cover not only sabotage or international terrorism but also the development or proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The proposed amendment to FISA expands the definition of weapons of mass destruction to include various types of destructive devices and substances. It also amends Sections of FISA related to the duration and extension of surveillance orders to address international movements of targets. New subsections would allow orders to remain in force even if the target is outside the United States, unless the Government files a motion to extinguish the order and the court grants it. The proposed amendment to FISA expands the definition of weapons of mass destruction and addresses the duration and extension of surveillance orders for international targets. Orders can remain in force even if the target is outside the United States, unless the Government files a motion to extinguish the order and the court grants it. Amendments to the table of contents of FISA reflect the changes made. The proposed FISA amendment includes replacing Section 102, repealing wartime authorities under FISA, and creating a new Title VII."
