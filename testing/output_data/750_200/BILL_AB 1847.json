    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature amended Section 19851 of the Revenue and Taxation Code to address the low participation rate in the federal Earned Income Tax Credit program, resulting in unclaimed federal dollars by working poor families in California. In 2015, California authorized a state EITC to enhance the poverty-reducing impact of the federal EITC for the poorest working Californians. To alleviate the tax burden on working poor persons and families in California, the state will provide information on federal and state earned income tax credits to help them claim these credits on their tax returns and boost their wages and income. The act aims to assist eligible taxpayers by providing notices from employers and state agencies about the EITC, and ensuring Californians claim both federal and state EITC. The Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to define terms like \"employer\" for this purpose. The act defines terms like \"employer\" and \"employee\" in relation to unemployment insurance and EITC, including the Federal EITC and California EITC. The California EITC is defined as the earned income tax credit in California. State departments and agencies that serve those eligible for the federal EITC and California EITC include programs like free or reduced-price meals, California Unemployment Insurance, and the Medi-Cal program. Section 19853 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to require employers to notify employees about eligibility for federal and California EITC when providing annual wage summaries. State departments and agencies must inform program recipients annually about potential eligibility for federal and California EITC, either between January and April or during regular contact via phone, mail, electronic communication, or in-person. Communication can also be indirect through other agencies or districts. State departments and agencies can inform program recipients about federal and California EITC eligibility indirectly through other agencies, districts, or regulated entities serving eligible individuals. Effective methods of providing notice are encouraged as long as the language is consistent with the required notice. The employer must provide notification to the employee either in person or by mail, including instructions on obtaining IRS and Franchise Tax Board notices and information on California EITC. Additionally, the employer can create their own notice as long as it contains similar language to the required notices. The employer must provide notification to the employee in person or by mail, including instructions on obtaining IRS and Franchise Tax Board notices and information on California EITC.

Posting on an employee bulletin board or sending through office mail does not satisfy the notification requirement. Amendments to this section apply to notices furnished on or after the effective date of the act. Section 19854 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended.
