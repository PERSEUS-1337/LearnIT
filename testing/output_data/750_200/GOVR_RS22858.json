    "content": "This report provides a cumulative history of Department of Energy (DOE) funding for renewable energy compared with funding for other energy technologies over the past 71 years. The final amount of FY2017 Energy and Water Development appropriations for DOE energy technologies was established by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31). The FY2017 Energy and Water Development appropriations for DOE energy technologies were set by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-31). Final funding for FY2018 was established by the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141). Funding levels for DOE are included in Energy and Water Development programs. The funding levels for the Department of Energy (DOE) are included in Energy and Water Development programs. Figures and tables display the fiscal year funding totals for DOE in real terms since 1978, showing cumulative funding totals for different time periods and relative shares of spending for each technology or energy source. The pie charts in Figures 2, 3, and 4 display cumulative DOE spending for different time periods from FY1948 through FY2018. Energy played a crucial role in World War II, with R&D applied to military technologies like the atomic bomb. Post-World War II, R&D was used for peacetime energy development. During the post-World War II era, R&D shifted from military technologies like the atomic bomb to peacetime energy development. The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 established the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) to oversee nuclear weapon development and civilian nuclear power management, focusing on research for civilian electric power production. The Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) focused on research for civilian electric power production and \"atoms for peace.\" In response to the 1973 oil embargo, the Federal Energy Administration was established in 1974, followed by the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA) in 1975. The Department of Energy (DOE) was created in 1977, consolidating the activities of FEA and ERDA. The Department of Energy (DOE) was established in 1977, incorporating activities of the FEA and ERDA. It brought all energy R&D programs under its administration, including fossil, nuclear, renewable, and energy efficiency. Total spending on fossil energy technologies from FY1948 to FY1977 was about $17.1 billion in constant FY2016 dollars. Since its establishment in 1977, the Department of Energy (DOE) has been the main funder of energy R&D, spending about $51.6 billion on nuclear energy R&D. The federal government expanded R&D programs to include renewable energy and energy efficiency technologies in response to the energy crises of the 1970s. Funding for renewable energy and energy efficiency began modestly in the early 1970s. Since FY1978, DOE has been the primary funder of energy R&D, with funding for energy technologies peaking at $8.6 billion in FY1979 before dropping to $2.0 billion per year in the late 1990s. Funding has gradually increased since then, with a spike to $13 billion in FY2009 due to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. In FY2018, DOE energy R&D funding was nearly $4.5 billion."
