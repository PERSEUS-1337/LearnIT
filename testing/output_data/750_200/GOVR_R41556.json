    "content": "The Middle East poses challenges to U.S. foreign policy due to various state and non-state actors aligned against U.S. interests, including Iran, Hezbollah, and Hamas. Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons capability is a major concern. Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons capability poses a major concern in the Middle East, with fears of potential preemptive strikes by Israel. Iran's strong ties to Syria complicate U.S. efforts in the region, while the Obama Administration has seen some improvement in the U.S. image in the Middle East. The Obama Administration's efforts to improve the U.S. image in the Middle East have been hindered by ongoing conflicts in Afghanistan and the failure to advance the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians. Despite outreach to the Muslim world and attempts to close Guantanamo, U.S. influence in the region is limited by state and non-state actors aligned against its interests. Regional actors like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Turkey also play a significant role in shaping the dynamics of the broader Middle East. Israel and Palestinian leadership, along with regional actors like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Turkey, have reduced U.S. influence in the Middle East. The region faces challenges from the global financial crisis, domestic socioeconomic issues, and criticism for human rights violations and lack of democracy. The Middle East region faces challenges such as high unemployment, water scarcity, and lack of respect for human rights and democracy. The United States is advocating for economic and political reform in the region. Congressional considerations include addressing Palestinian divisions, Hamas control, Israeli settlements, and obstacles to the peace process amidst budget constraints. The United States faces challenges in the Middle East region, including Palestinian divisions, Hamas control, Israeli settlements, and obstacles to the peace process. Congressional considerations include budget constraints and support for regional initiatives like foreign aid and democracy promotion. Policymakers also need to address radical regimes like Iran and Syria and the threat of terrorist attacks from Al Qaeda-inspired groups. The United States faces challenges in the Middle East region, including Palestinian divisions, Hamas control, Israeli settlements, and obstacles to the peace process. Congressional considerations include budget constraints, foreign aid, democracy promotion, and addressing radical regimes like Iran and Syria. Members of the 112th Congress may need to balance counterterrorism strategies with diplomatic efforts to improve U.S. bilateral relationships with Arab regimes. Issues of interest to members of the 111th Congress that may receive attention in the 112th Congress include the war in Afghanistan, terrorism, foreign assistance, democracy promotion, human rights concerns, and the global financial crisis. There is a growing international consensus to adopt stricter economic sanctions against Iran to compel compromise on its nuclear development. Measures by the UN Security Council, EU, and several countries complement US laws to slow Iran's alleged WMD programs. The US, along with major allies, believes sanctions should target Iran's energy sector to isolate it from the international financial system. Efforts to curb international investment in Iran's energy sector began in 1996 with the Iran Sanctions Act (ISA), which penalizes foreign companies conducting certain business with Iran. The US law, known as ISA, imposes penalties on foreign companies doing business with Iran's energy sector to limit Iran's ability to import gasoline and restrict access to the US market for banks dealing with sanctioned Iranian entities. CISADA broadens measures to restrict access to the U.S. market for banks dealing with sanctioned Iranian entities and limits high technology trade with countries aiding Iran's WMD program. It followed U.N. Resolution 1929 banning heavy weapons sales to Iran and imposing sanctions on Iranian entities linked to the Revolutionary Guard. EU sanctions also target Iran's energy and financial sectors. The EU and other major economic powers have imposed sanctions on Iran's energy sector and financial relationships, following U.N. Resolution 1929. These measures are having a growing impact on Iran's economy, despite limited empirical data. The sanctions imposed on Iran by major economic powers are having a growing impact on Iran's economy, with international firms exiting the Iranian market. There is debate on whether the sanctions are affecting Iran's nuclear program. The 112th Congress may consider additional sanctions and support for Iran's domestic opposition. The United States and Israel have strong bilateral relations based on domestic U.S. support for Israel, shared strategic goals in the Middle East, democratic values, and historic ties. U.S. foreign aid plays a significant role in strengthening these ties, despite occasional disagreements over issues like Israeli settlements and arms sales. U.S. aid packages for Israel have long been seen as a way to strengthen bilateral relations, despite occasional disagreements over issues like Israeli settlements and arms sales. Critics argue that U.S. aid exacerbates tensions in the region, with some Arab commentators suggesting it indirectly causes suffering to Palestinians. Congress has taken steps to enhance Israel's security and maintain its \"qualitative military edge\" (QME). The U.S. aid to Israel is seen as a way to strengthen bilateral relations, despite occasional disagreements. Critics argue that it indirectly causes suffering to Palestinians. Congress and successive administrations have affirmed the commitment to Israel's security and its \"qualitative military edge\" over neighboring militaries. The 112th Congress may focus on U.S. aid to Israel to preserve its Qualitative Military Edge (QME). The Obama Administration requested $3 billion in Foreign Military Financing (FMF) for Israel in FY2011. Defense appropriations for missile defense cooperation between the U.S. and Israel could also be a key issue. In FY2010, Congress allocated over $202 million for this purpose. In FY2010, Congress appropriated $202 million for U.S.-Israeli missile defense, with an additional $205 million announced by the Obama Administration for Iron Dome batteries. Congressional aid has supported peace treaties between Israel, Egypt, and Jordan since 1948. Congressional aid appropriations have reinforced Israel's peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan and have helped enable the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians to proceed. President Obama declared Israeli-Palestinian peace to be a U.S. national security interest due to its impact on U.S. relations in the Middle East and elsewhere. His call for a halt to Israeli settlement activity in the West Bank was echoed by PLO Chairman Mahmud Abbas. Israel's settlement activity in the West Bank has been a major obstacle to peace talks, with President Obama calling for a halt to it. The limited Israeli moratorium on settlements led to short-lived proximity talks, but settlements continue to persist as a point of contention. Israel's ongoing settlement activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem remains a divisive issue between the parties. Israel has continued settlement activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, despite calls for a halt by President Obama. The Administration offered incentives for a settlement freeze, but abandoned the effort in December. Final status issues in negotiations include borders, security, Jerusalem, refugees, and water. Congress may remain interested in the situation. Final status issues in the negotiations center on borders, security, Jerusalem, refugees, and water. Congress remains interested in the Arab-Israeli peace process due to its oversight role in U.S. foreign policy and support for Israel. Resolutions have been introduced in Congress regarding Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and relocating the U.S. embassy. Foreign operations appropriations legislation restricts U.S. official conduct with the Palestinian Authority in Jerusalem, emphasizing Congress's commitment to an undivided Jerusalem. Foreign operations appropriations legislation restricts U.S. official conduct with the Palestinian Authority in Jerusalem, emphasizing Congress's commitment to an undivided Jerusalem as Israel's capital. The legislation also requires a new Palestinian state to act peacefully and counter terrorism. Congress passed resolutions supporting Israel's right to self-defense against rocket attacks from Gaza and a flotilla attempting to break Israel's blockade. In the 112th Congress, legislation may revisit moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, conditions for a new Palestinian state, and reactions to possible violent confrontations between Israeli forces and Palestinian groups. If an Israeli-Palestinian peace accord is achieved, the Administration may call on Congress to provide additional assistance to Israel and the Palestinians. The Administration may request Congress for additional aid to Israel and the Palestinians to support peace efforts. U.S. aid to Palestinians aligns with key U.S. policy goals, including combating terrorism, promoting stability and prosperity in the West Bank, and addressing humanitarian needs in Gaza. U.S. aid policy towards Palestinians during the 111th Congress continues to support self-governance in Israel and address humanitarian needs in the Gaza Strip. Annual U.S. bilateral assistance to the West Bank and Gaza has averaged over $600 million annually since the split between the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Since the split, annual U.S. bilateral assistance to the West Bank and Gaza Strip has averaged over $600 million annually, including direct budgetary assistance and non-lethal security assistance for the PA in the West Bank. Additional humanitarian assistance for Palestinian refugees, provided mostly through UNRWA, has averaged over $200 million annually since 2007. U.S. assistance to the Palestinians, provided through UNRWA, has averaged over $200 million annually since 2007. Congressional concerns about potential diversion of funds to terrorist groups have led to vetting and oversight requirements. Policymakers urge Arab states to increase their contributions. Administration notified Congress of proposed military equipment sales to Saudi Arabia in 2010. The Obama Administration notified Congress in 2010 of proposed military equipment sales to Saudi Arabia worth over $60 billion, including fighter aircraft, helicopters, upgrades, and related services. The Obama Administration proposed sales of military equipment to Saudi Arabia worth over $60 billion, including fighter aircraft, helicopters, and upgrades. The sales aim to strengthen Saudi Arabia vis-\u00e0-vis Iran and ensure continued U.S. influence for decades, raising policy questions for Congress about their rationale and impact on regional security and Israel's security. The Obama Administration's proposed sales of military equipment to Saudi Arabia worth over $60 billion aim to strengthen Saudi Arabia against Iran and ensure long-term U.S. influence. U.S.-Saudi counterterrorism cooperation has improved, but challenges remain, including terrorist financing. Concerns about human rights and religious extremism in Saudi Arabia persist, with no clear solutions. Saudi leaders are wary of embracing Iraq's government despite sharing U.S. concerns about Iranian policies. Extremism persists in Saudi Arabia, with no clear solutions in sight. Saudi leaders share U.S. concerns about Iran and regional ambitions but are cautious about engaging with Iraq's government and Israel beyond the Arab Peace Initiative. In the 111th Congress, proposed arms sales to Saudi Arabia were reviewed by several committees, with concerns raised by 198 members of Congress in a letter to the Obama Administration. The Obama Administration responded to concerns raised by 198 members of Congress regarding proposed arms sales to Saudi Arabia in October 2010. They believe in strengthening the U.S. military partnership with Saudi Arabia while maintaining Israel's qualitative military edge. The U.S. government is also working on supplying Israel with fifth-generation F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft. The U.S. government is pursuing an initiative to supply Israel with fifth-generation F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft to maintain Israel's advanced fighter aircraft status in the region. H.J.Res. 104, introduced in December 2010, aimed to prohibit proposed sales to Saudi Arabia. Members of the 112th Congress may seek additional oversight of U.S. military training, arms sales, and counterterrorism cooperation with Saudi Arabia. The United States has been involved in developing, training, and arming the Saudi Arabian military since the 1940s. The United States has been heavily involved in developing, training, and arming the Saudi Arabian military since the 1940s. U.S. military training and equipment support programs in Saudi Arabia are crucial for U.S.-Saudi relations. Congress has the option to block or modify arms sales to Saudi Arabia at any time before delivery, subject to presidential veto. New U.S. programs for Saudi interior security forces and critical infrastructure security are also being implemented. Congress may seek to alter or enhance oversight of U.S. security assistance to Saudi Arabia due to policy concerns, especially regarding the threat of Yemen-based terrorists. Any action taken by Congress to block or modify arms sales would be subject to presidential veto, but would not enjoy expedited procedural privileges outlined in the Arms Export Control Act. The 112th Congress may focus on U.S. counterterrorism policy in Yemen due to the threat of Yemen-based terrorists. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) has attempted attacks on the U.S., including the failed bombing of Northwest Airlines Flight 253 in 2009 and the attempted destruction of air cargo flights in 2010. American citizen Anwar al Awlaki, a radical ideologue of AQAP, has tried to incite U.S. citizens to carry out terrorist attacks on U.S. soil. In October 2010, American citizen Anwar al Awlaki, a radical ideologue of AQAP, has been linked to radicalizing individuals like Major Nidal M. Hasan, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, and Faisal Shahzad to carry out terrorist attacks on U.S. soil. The Obama Administration is considering increasing assistance and intelligence cooperation. The Obama Administration is considering increasing assistance and intelligence cooperation with Yemen to prevent terrorist attacks like the Times Square failed car bombing. Reports suggest the CIA may use drones or place military units under JSOC control in Yemen. Limited U.S. military presence in Yemen may require time to fully utilize assets. The Obama Administration is considering increasing assistance and intelligence cooperation with Yemen to prevent terrorist attacks. U.S. intelligence agencies may need time to fully utilize assets in Yemen against Al Qaeda-affiliated groups. Congress may assess the balance between short-term counterterrorism needs and long-term stabilization goals in Yemen. Lawmakers may demand more U.S. military involvement if AQAP threatens the United States, and some may push for Yemen's cooperation in apprehending wanted AQAP operatives. The United States is considering increasing assistance and intelligence cooperation with Yemen to prevent terrorist attacks. The 112th Congress may consider new appropriations for Yemen, with the Defense Department proposing to increase security assistance to $1.2 billion over a five- or six-year period. Yemen has cautioned against overreacting to the terrorist threat, but recent months have seen Yemeni forces launching large-scale operations. In recent months, Yemeni forces have launched campaigns against suspected AQAP strongholds in Abyan and Shabwah governorates. The sustainability of U.S.-Yemeni security cooperation is a key concern for lawmakers. Disagreements may arise over Yemen's policy of releasing alleged terrorists to appease tribal leaders and domestic Islamist politicians opposing U.S. involvement in the region. Iraq's political system faces challenges with ethnic and factional infighting, delaying the formation of a new government after the 2010 elections. Holding key political offices is seen as a matter of life and death for Iraq's political communities. The formation of a new government in Iraq following the 2010 elections was significantly delayed due to ethnic and sectarian factions. With U.S. intervention, a breakthrough was achieved on November 10, 2010, leading to the agreement on key leadership positions. However, concerns remain about the government's direction and its alignment with Iran. Some worry about waning U.S. influence in Iraq and dominance of parties aligned with Iran in the new government. Concerns also exist about potential conflicts between Kurdistan Regional Government and nationalist Arabs. Despite the drawdown of U.S. forces, ongoing violence raises doubts about future stability after all U.S. forces depart in 2011. Some experts fear that Iraq could become a \"failed state\" after 2011 due to a reduction in U.S. influence and ongoing violence. U.S. officials are concerned that Iraqi Security Forces may not meet benchmarks by the end of 2011, and the formation of the government will determine the terms of a long-term strategic partnership with Iraq. The formation of the government in Iraq before the end of 2011 will allow U.S. officials to address their goals of securing a long-term strategic partnership and defining terms of security cooperation. However, opposition from some Iraqi parties and their inclusion in key ministries may complicate these efforts. The U.S. is transitioning from military to civilian leadership in Iraq, with the State Department overseeing an expansion in civilian personnel and associated costs. U.S. economic assistance to Iraq has significantly declined. The State Department is overseeing a large expansion in civilian personnel, security needs, and costs in Iraq. U.S. economic assistance to Iraq has declined significantly since the 2003-2007 period, with the Administration seeking to keep economic aid at $382.5 million in FY2010. The focus is on continuing support for Iraq's security forces. In FY2010, Economic Support Fund (ESF) assistance reached $382.5 million. The Administration's FY2011 request aimed to maintain this level of economic aid and support for Iraq's security forces. Senate appropriators recommended cuts in both areas. FY2011 funding for Iraq is provided under the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011. Future economic and security assistance for Iraq may face resistance in the 112th Congress due to concerns about Iraq's investment in its own capabilities. Future economic and security assistance for Iraq in the 112th Congress may encounter resistance due to concerns about Iraq's ability to invest in its own reconstruction and security forces. Despite potential growth in oil revenues, Iraq still faces significant challenges with domestic investment needs, foreign debts, and financial management. The transition from U.S. military operations to a civilian-led presence in Iraq will provide new opportunities for Congressional oversight. Additionally, Congress may need to review appropriations, authorization requests, and proposed arms sales to support U.S.-Iraqi security cooperation. Turkey, a long-term U.S. NATO ally, has a complex relationship with the United States. Congressional attention has focused on issues concerning diaspora communities, such as Greek-Americans and Armenian Americans, who advocate for changes in Turkey's policies on various issues. Turkey has not been a major recipient of U.S. foreign aid since the 1990s. Turkey's complex relationship with the United States has led to Congressional concern over issues such as the Armenian national \"genocide\" of 1915-1917 and Cyprus. Turkey has not been a major recipient of U.S. foreign aid since the 1990s. Recent events, including Turkey's vote against U.N. Security Council sanctions on Iran and a violent confrontation with Israeli commandos, have raised further concerns. Legislation in the 111th Congress called on the Administration to urge Turkey to respect property and religious rights. In the 111th Congress, legislation urged Turkey to respect the property and religious rights of the Greek Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarch in Istanbul and to recognize the Armenian genocide. The House passed resolutions calling for the protection of Greek Orthodox religious sites in Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus. In the 112th Congress, the House passed H.Res. 1631 to protect Greek Orthodox religious sites in Turkish-occupied northern Cyprus. Issues concerning Turkey, such as the rights of the Greek Orthodox Church and the genocide resolution, may resurface. Ankara may seek US funding for missiles and radar as part of a new missile defense system. Ankara may urge the Administration to fund missiles and radar in Turkey for a new defense system, requiring new appropriations. Congressional interest in Turkish national election outcomes and U.S. policy towards Syria may lead to oversight hearings in the 112th Congress. The 112th Congress did not vote on the nomination due to a member's hold. U.S. policy towards Syria may interest lawmakers as they consider peeling Syria away from Iran. The Obama Administration altered the approach towards Syria by engaging in diplomatic dialogue to secure cooperation on various issues. Gestures were made towards the Asad government, including high-level delegations and allowing sanctions-exempted materials to be exported to Syria. The Obama Administration shifted tactics towards Syria by applying more pressure on the government to play a constructive role in stabilizing Lebanon and advancing the Arab-Israeli peace process. U.S. sanctions against Syria have been in place since 2009, with critics questioning the effectiveness of diplomatic engagement. This change coincided with renewed international concern about Lebanon and Hezbollah. The Obama Administration shifted tactics towards Syria to play a more constructive role in stabilizing Lebanon and advancing the Arab-Israeli peace process. This shift comes amid renewed international concern about Lebanon, particularly regarding Hezbollah's threats. Additionally, there have been unsuccessful attempts to restart Israeli-Syrian peace talks, leading to the possibility of U.S.-Syrian relations becoming more tense. Congress may consider imposing new sanctions against the Asad regime in response. During the 111th Congress, lawmakers introduced H.R. 1206, the Syria Accountability and Liberation Act, which aimed to impose sanctions on countries and individuals assisting Syria in obtaining weapons of mass destruction. It also called for sanctions on those investing $5 million or more in Syria's energy sector. Appropriators may fund democracy and governance programs for opposition members and human rights activists repressed by the Asad regime. Congress may also consider funding democracy and governance programs for opposition members and human rights activists in Syria. The nomination of Robert S. Ford as Ambassador-Designate to Syria is still pending, with no confirmation vote scheduled in the Senate. Supporters argue that sending an ambassador to Syria is crucial for U.S. interests, while opponents view it as a concession to the Syrian regime. Current U.S. policy towards Lebanon aims to support the unity government led by Prime Minister Saad Hariri, counter Iranian and Syrian influence, and contain Hezbollah. The U.S. provides economic and military assistance to strengthen state institutions, particularly in the security sector, since Syria's withdrawal from Lebanon in 2005. The U.S. also supports the Special Tribunal for Lebanon with an annual contribution of $10 million. Since Syria's withdrawal from Lebanon in 2005, the United States has supported the Special Tribunal for Lebanon (STL) with an annual contribution of $10 million. Prime Minister Hariri's government is facing challenges due to pending STL indictments, leading to increased sectarian tension as Hezbollah attempts to discredit the STL. Hezbollah's leader has rejected any potential indictment, labeling it as a U.S. and Israeli attack on the \"resistance.\" The escalating rhetoric from Hezbollah and recent statements by Hariri questioning Syria's responsibility for the assassination have raised concerns about U.S. support for Hariri and the STL. The Hariri government's legitimacy relies on the STL's success, but Hezbollah and the opposition could challenge Hariri's power if the STL proceeds with indictments. Any changes in the Lebanese government could impact U.S. policy and assistance to Lebanon, especially if Hezbollah gains a larger role. Members of the 112th Congress may need to consider the Obama Administration's request for $246 million. The 112th Congress may need to consider the Obama Administration's request for $246 million in foreign assistance to Lebanon, aimed at increasing the central authority of the Lebanese state and deterring non-state actors. In August 2010, the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) clashed with the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) along the Blue Line, resulting in casualties on both sides. Some members of Congress placed a hold on U.S. assistance to Lebanon following the incident. In response to a clash between the Lebanese Armed Forces and the Israeli Defense Force in 2010, which resulted in casualties, some members of Congress placed a hold on a $100 million FMF appropriation for Lebanon. The hold was lifted in December 2010 after consultations with State Department officials, raising questions about the future of U.S. assistance to Lebanon. The 112th Congress may express support for a more democratic government in Egypt that upholds human rights and religious freedom. Egypt, as the largest Arab country, is a key partner of the United States in regional affairs and the Arab-Israeli peace process. Political liberalization in Egypt could have implications for the Middle East. Egypt's domestic politics are closely watched by U.S. policymakers due to its role in regional affairs and the Arab-Israeli peace process. Some believe that political liberalization in Egypt could have a ripple effect in the Middle East. However, others argue that a stable, autocratic Egypt at peace with Israel is in the U.S. interest to prevent a sudden takeover by the Muslim Brotherhood. In the 2010 parliamentary elections, the ruling National Democratic Party dominated, with only one independent from the Muslim Brotherhood winning a seat. In the 2010 parliamentary elections in Egypt, the ruling National Democratic Party won over 90% of seats, with just one independent from the Muslim Brotherhood securing a seat. The State Department expressed concern over reports of disruptions to opposition candidates' campaigns, arrests of their supporters, and limited media access for opposition voices. The pre-election period in Egypt saw disruptions to opposition candidates' campaigns, arrests of their supporters, and limited media access for opposition voices. Reports of election-day interference and intimidation by security forces raise concerns about the fairness and transparency of the process. Congress has provided Egypt with significant military and economic aid, with funding for democracy promotion being a controversial issue over the last six years. Funding for democracy promotion in Egypt has been controversial over the last six years, with the Egyptian government opposing foreign support to independent NGOs working on political reform. During the Bush Administration, some Economic Support Funds were directed towards USAID programming in the democracy and governance sector and direct support to Egyptian NGOs. In FY2005, Congress directed that democracy and governance activities in Egypt shall not require prior approval from the government. Funding for democracy promotion in Egypt has decreased as overall economic aid has decreased. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, FY2010, provided $25 million for democracy promotion. Some believe the Obama Administration wants to ease tensions by reducing democracy assistance. Some analysts suggest that the Obama Administration aims to reduce tensions with Egypt by decreasing democracy assistance. Critics argue that U.S. aid should be tied to improvements in Egypt's human rights and religious freedom record. The U.S. has been engaged in a global war against Al Qaeda and its affiliates since the September 11, 2001 attacks. The U.S. government's global war against Al Qaeda has weakened the organization's ability to attack the United States, but Al Qaeda's survival, regional affiliates, and appeal among some Muslims remain challenges. Al Qaeda operatives are determined to attack the U.S. and exploit vulnerabilities. Recent events show increased ideological outreach by Al Qaeda supporters. Recent events indicate that Al Qaeda supporters are using the Internet for sophisticated ideological outreach and promoting independent, low-cost operations. This could complicate counterterrorism efforts by spreading Al Qaeda's ideology and making threats less predictable and harder to disrupt. In the Middle East, U.S. policymakers face multiple challenges in balancing counterterrorism goals with other strategic priorities. The U.S. faces dilemmas in pursuing counterterrorism goals while balancing other strategic priorities in the Middle East. The costs and benefits of military operations targeting Al Qaeda have been demonstrated over the past decade. Al Qaeda continues to criticize U.S. military presence in the region despite ongoing withdrawals. The presence of U.S. military forces in the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia is a subject of Al Qaeda rhetoric despite ongoing withdrawals from Iraq. Operations against Al Qaeda figures and counterterrorism assistance programs have faced criticism. U.S. support for democratic reform risks alienating allied governments and empowering Islamist parties. The U.S. government's outreach to Muslims has expanded and changed. The U.S. government's outreach to Muslims has evolved over time, but many remain skeptical of U.S. intentions and policies. Suggestions include more direct action against Al Qaeda and religious extremism, or adopting a containment strategy based on the belief that Al Qaeda's agenda is self-defeating. Some suggest the United States should adopt a containment strategy towards Al Qaeda, believing direct intervention may have negative consequences. They argue that Muslims need to reject extremism in their own communities for lasting victory. Additionally, without a broader U.S. agenda for the Middle East, challenges in the region are likely to persist. The 111th Congress held hearings on U.S. counterterrorism policy. The 111th Congress focused on U.S. counterterrorism policy, including specific threats, foreign assistance, and financing. The 112th Congress may further evaluate counterterrorism strategy and engagement with Muslim countries. The 112th Congress may evaluate U.S. counterterrorism strategy and engagement with Muslim countries, focusing on maintaining partnerships, defeating Al Qaeda affiliates, securing cooperation from Gulf allies, and promoting peace in the Middle East. Relevant Congressional Research Service reports on Iran sanctions and regional perspectives are included in the appendix. Iran Sanctions and U.S. concerns regarding Iran's nuclear program, economic conditions, and regional perspectives are detailed in various Congressional Research Service reports.
