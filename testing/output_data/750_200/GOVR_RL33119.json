    "content": "Prior to SAFETEA, the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) authorized federal highway, highway safety, and transit programs from FY1998-FY2003. After October 1, 2003, short-term extension acts continued funding for federal surface transportation programs. Long-term reauthorizations, like TEA-21, are preferred for better long-term planning and construction needs in the surface transportation community. The passage of SAFETEA was welcomed by the transportation community as it provided long-term reauthorization for highway and transit infrastructure, reducing uncertainty about future funding. Despite delays, SAFETEA was passed as a four-year bill expiring in FY2009, closely linked to federal funding for surface transportation. The passage converted a six-year bill to a four-year bill expiring in FY2009, funded by the highway trust fund through gasoline and diesel fuel taxes. The trust fund has separate accounts for highways and mass transit, with fuel taxes providing about 90% of the income. The trust fund, funded by gasoline and diesel fuel taxes, has separate accounts for highways and mass transit. The transit account receives 2.86 cents per gallon, while 0.1 cent per gallon is reserved for an unrelated fund. Over almost 50 years, there have been several tax increases, with the last one in 1993. The trust fund has been a reliable source of funding for surface transportation, with tax revenues of $31 billion for highways and $5 billion for mass transit in FY2004. The trust fund, funded by gasoline and diesel fuel taxes, has separate accounts for highways and mass transit. In FY2004, the highway account received $31 billion in tax revenues, while the mass transit account received $5 billion. The trust fund has historically collected more than it has spent, but in recent years, the unexpended balance is declining. This trend has led to some uncertainty about the fund's future. The trust fund's unexpended balance is substantial but declining, causing uncertainty about its long-term financial health. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 provided additional income through changes in gasohol taxation, potentially adding $4 billion per year starting in FY2005. Reauthorization legislation was passed by both the House and Senate in the 2nd Session. The trust fund's financial health is uncertain due to a declining unexpended balance. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 aimed to provide an extra $4 billion annually starting in FY2005. However, disagreement between Congress and the Administration on total program funding for the next reauthorization period stalled progress. The Administration objected to raising fuel taxes for the trust funds. Some Members of Congress proposed gasohol and tax changes to support a larger program, but additional measures were needed. Conferees on SAFETEA discussed various revenue-increasing options for the trust fund. The SAFETEA program size desired by Members was considered with various tax and revenue changes to increase trust fund revenues. The finance title of the act includes provisions to modestly increase revenue by cutting tax fraud and transferring Treasury general fund revenues to the trust fund. It was believed that these changes, combined with gasohol legislation and expected economic growth, would be sufficient to finance the program. The SAFETEA program size desired by Members was considered with various tax and revenue changes to increase trust fund revenues. The act amended the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 to create new budget categories and set limitations on obligations. This, combined with gasohol legislation and expected economic growth, was expected to finance the $286.4 billion program. The TEA-21 act of 1985 created new budget categories for highway and mass transit, setting limitations on obligations for fiscal years FY1999 to FY2003. It introduced Revenue Aligned Budget Authority (RABA) to adjust highway account amounts based on revenue changes. The provision also adjusted highway program authorization levels accordingly. The TEA-21 act of 1985 established new budget categories for highway and mass transit, with Revenue Aligned Budget Authority (RABA) adjusting funding levels based on revenue changes. This set predetermined funding levels for core highway and transit programs, known as discretionary spending guarantees, with \"firewalls\" preventing funds from being used for other purposes. Annual revenues and expenditures affecting trust fund balances are still included in the federal deficit calculation. SAFETEA-21 established \"firewalls\" to guarantee funding levels for highway and transit programs. The act provided $286.4 billion in guaranteed spending authority for FY2004-FY2009, a significant increase in funding. The focus of the SAFETEA debate was mainly on money distribution. SAFETEA provided $286.4 billion in guaranteed spending authority for FY2004-FY2009, a significant increase over TEA-21. It represented a funding increase for federal surface transportation programs, although not as much as originally hoped for. SAFETEA provided just over $244 billion in guaranteed spending authority between FY2005-FY2009, with significant funding increases for all major programs. Total annual spending increased each year, with FY2009 spending almost 23% higher than FY2005. Total annual spending increases occur in each year, with FY2009 spending almost 23% higher than FY2005. The House version of SAFETEA included a provision for Congress to reconsider funding at a later date, which was objected to by the Bush Administration and not included in the final act. Detailed programmatic information can be found at http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/safetealu/fundtables.htm. TEA-21 created a spending mechanism to adjust highway program obligations based on trust fund revenue. RABA initially provided additional spending authority but called for a reduction in FY2003. Congress chose to increase spending instead of reducing it. The RABA computation in FY2003 called for a program reduction, but Congress chose to increase spending instead. SAFETEA changes how RABA is calculated by using a two-year calculation and delaying calculations until FY2007. It also reduces the likelihood of spending reductions by requiring a minimum unexpended balance in the highway trust fund. The regional character of transportation policy is evident in the debate over the distribution of federal highway aid among states. Congress has included provisions in surface transportation acts to address funding distribution concerns. Some states have been concerned about funding equity, especially in the South, Midwest, and West. Some states, mainly in the South, Midwest, and West, have raised concerns about receiving less federal highway aid than what their users contribute in taxes to the highway trust fund. Donor states seek a higher share rate-of-return, while donee states resist any reduction in their current shares. Some states, mainly in the South, Midwest, and West, have concerns about receiving less federal highway aid than their users contribute in taxes. Donor states argue for equity, stating they have been subsidizing the repair of infrastructure in donee states for years. They also claim to be more road dependent and less benefited by federal transit spending. Southern and western donor states emphasize their fast growth compared to most donee states. Southern and western donor states argue that they should benefit more from federal transit spending due to their fast growth and infrastructure needs. Donee state advocates counter that fairness should be based on needs, citing aging infrastructure, high costs of urban road maintenance, and limited resources in large western states. The high cost of working on congested urban roads and limited financial resources in large western states justify their donee status. Donee states argue for federal funds based on national rather than state boundaries. They criticize Midwestern and southern states for spending less on highways and not contributing their own resources. The debate over equity remedies has broader implications. The debate over equity remedies has broader implications for transportation funding. Questions arise about the federal government's role as the minimum guarantee approaches 100%. Some states propose broadening the Minimum Guarantee to include Federal aid highway programs. The 109th Congress faced challenges in balancing donor and donee state demands for highway funding. Broadening the Minimum Guarantee to include Federal Transit Administration programs was a controversial issue. Resolving these conflicting goals was difficult due to insufficient funding from the Highway Trust Fund. The 109th Congress struggled to balance donor and donee state demands for highway funding. Previous reauthorization bills included \"hold harmless\" provisions to maintain base shares for all states, making it challenging to increase donor state shares without increasing overall federal highway program size significantly. This equity remedy aimed to keep both donor and donee states content. Equity remedies in highway funding aimed to keep both donor and donee states content by giving more money to all states, with a focus on increasing donor state shares to a designated percentage. This approach was costly but necessary to maintain balance and ensure passage of surface transportation legislation. The SAFETEA legislation replaced the TEA-21 MG program with an \"Equity Bonus\" program to gradually increase the guaranteed rate-of-return to states. The Secretary of Transportation allocated funds to ensure each state received a minimum return percentage for fiscal years 2005-2009. The SAFETEA legislation replaced the TEA-21 MG program with an \"Equity Bonus\" program to gradually increase the guaranteed rate-of-return to states. Funds were allocated to ensure each state received a minimum return percentage for fiscal years 2005-2009, including various highway programs subject to the equity provision. The Equity Bonus program under SAFETEA legislation replaced the TEA-21 MG program, providing a guaranteed rate-of-return to states for fiscal years 2005-2009. The EB program includes hold harmless provisions for certain states based on population density, federal jurisdiction acreage, population size, and median household income. Twenty-seven states qualify for the Equity Bonus program under SAFETEA legislation based on specific criteria such as population density, federal jurisdiction acreage, population size, median household income, fatality rate on Interstate Highways, and state motor fuel excise tax rate. The Equity Bonus program under SAFETEA legislation benefits twenty-seven states based on specific criteria. Each state is guaranteed a set percentage of its average annual TEA-21 apportionments, with annual percentage floors increasing from 117% in FY2005 to 121% in FY2009. The program distributes funds to states accordingly. The Equity Bonus Program distributes funds to states based on specific criteria, with annual percentage floors increasing from 117% in FY2005 to 121% in FY2009. Funds are apportioned to the STP first, with any amount above $2.639 billion distributed to six core programs based on each program's apportionment ratio. The Equity Bonus Program distributes funds to states based on specific criteria, with annual percentage floors increasing from 117% in FY2005 to 121% in FY2009. FHWA analysis indicates that over the five-year life of SAFETEA the EB program distributions will cost $40.9 billion. Funds for all programs are apportioned to states annually using formulas in SAFETEA, sometimes referred to as \"apportioned\" or formula programs. Under TEA-21, most highway funding was reserved for five major apportioned programs, known as core programs. Under TEA-21, most highway funding was reserved for five major apportioned programs, known as core programs. SAFETEA increased the number of core programs to six, including interstate maintenance, national highway system, surface transportation program, highway bridge and bridge maintenance, congestion mitigation and air quality, and the new highway safety improvement program. The equity bonus program, which replaced the TEA-21 minimum guarantee program, is sometimes referred to as a core program. The majority of funding in the surface transportation bill goes to core highway programs, including interstate maintenance, national highway system, surface transportation program, highway bridge maintenance, congestion mitigation, and the highway safety improvement program. Additional smaller apportioned programs like metropolitan planning and recreational trails also exist. Only a few new programs were included in SAFETEA, such as the equity bonus program and the HSIP. The SAFETEA reauthorization included new formula programs like the Coordinated Border Infrastructure Program (CBI) and the Safe Routes to School Program (SRSP). Funding under the Federal-Aid Highway program was apportioned to states based on factors like lane miles and vehicle miles traveled. The SAFETEA reauthorization introduced new formula programs for Title 23 of the U.S. Code, with funding apportioned based on factors like lane miles and vehicle miles traveled. Some programs use weighted factors such as estimated tax payments to the highway account, while others are based on single factors like state share of bridge repair costs or population under the Clean Air Act. SAFETEA made adjustments to existing formulas, including eliminating the 10% safety STP set-aside from TEA-21. The SAFETEA reauthorization made adjustments to existing formulas, including eliminating the 10% safety STP set-aside from TEA-21. It also continued the STP Transportation Enhancements set-aside and created new set-asides for ferry boats and ferry terminal facilities in Alaska, New Jersey, and Washington. Adjustments were made to the calculation under CMAQ for ozone areas, and set-asides were established for the National Highway System and Territorial Highway Program. The SAFETEA reauthorization made adjustments to existing formulas, including set-asides for ferry boats and ferry terminal facilities in Alaska, New Jersey, and Washington. The National Highway System set-aside for the Territorial Highway Program is set at $40 million for FY2005-FY2006 and at $50 million annually for FY2007-FY2009. Formula distribution is weighted based on federal lane miles, vehicle miles traveled, and annual fatalities on federal-aid highways. The Railway-Highway Crossings program is funded through a takedown from HSIP but is distributed differently to the states. Crossings funding is distributed based on the ratio of public railway-highway grade crossings in each state to the total number of crossings in all states. The minimum payment to each state is set at 0.5%. The Railway-Highway Crossings program allocates funding to states based on the ratio of public railway-highway grade crossings in each state to the total number of crossings in all states. Additionally, $90 million annually is set aside for high-risk rural roads construction and operational improvements. Funding under SAFETEA is apportioned to states along the Canada-U.S. and Mexico-U.S. borders based on incoming commercial truck crossings. The funds are allocated to states along the Canada-U.S. and Mexico-U.S. borders based on specific criteria: 20% for commercial truck crossings, 30% for personal vehicle and bus crossings, 25% for total weight of incoming cargo, and 25% for the number of ports-of-entry. The funds are apportioned among states based on the total student enrollment in primary and middle schools, with a minimum allocation of $1 million per state. Non-apportioned highway programs are subject to allocations based on criteria in highway laws and may be earmarked by Congress. In highway authorization and appropriation law, programs are subject to congressional earmarking. In SAFETEA, the largest allocated program is for congressionally mandated high priority projects. Other large programs include the federal lands program, interstate maintenance discretionary program, bridge discretionary program, and transportation and community system pilot preservation program. SAFETEA includes new allocated programs such as a transportation improvement program, a national corridor infrastructure program, and a program for projects of national or regional significance, all subject to 100% earmarking. The act also outlines project selection criteria for the latter program. The Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) created innovative financing mechanisms like GARVEEs to accelerate project completion and attract additional funds for highway projects. SAFETEA introduces changes to federal innovative finance programs like TIFIA and SIBs, offering financial assistance through secured loans, loan guarantees, and standby lines of credit for transportation projects. SAFETEA provides federal financial assistance for transportation projects through secured loans, loan guarantees, and standby lines of credit. It reduces project size thresholds and supports TIFIA's leveraging activities with $122 million annually. The SIB program helps capitalize state infrastructure revolving funds, expanding beyond the four states limited under TEA-21. Any state can now enter into an agreement with DOT for funding. SAFETEA expands the SIB program to allow any state to establish infrastructure revolving funds with federal funds. It authorizes tolling programs and HOV lane tolling, with a focus on private facility bonds. The program continues with 15 tolling projects and authorizes $11 billion in funding. The program authorizes $11 million for FY2005 and $12 million annually for FY2006-FY2009, with $3 million allocated for non-tolling congestion pricing pilot projects each year. The Secretary of Transportation is directed to carry out 15 demonstration projects for states, public authorities, or designated entities. House and Senate bill provisions to change the program were dropped during Conference. The new program authorizes $11 million for FY2005 and $12 million annually for FY2006-FY2009 for 15 demonstration projects allowing toll collection to manage congestion, reduce emissions, or expand highways. Funding is expected to focus on HOT lanes with revenue use restricted to debt service and private financing returns. The new program authorizes funding for 15 demonstration projects allowing toll collection to manage congestion, reduce emissions, or expand highways. Most funding will go towards HOT lanes with revenue use restricted to debt service, private financing returns, and operating costs. Toll facilities can vary prices based on time of day or congestion levels to improve air quality and manage congestion. HOV facilities charging tolls must also vary prices accordingly. The act establishes a pilot toll program allowing toll collection on Interstate System highways, bridges, or tunnels for construction purposes. Fees collected on express lanes must vary by time of day or traffic levels and be collected electronically. The pilot toll program allows toll collection on Interstate System highways, bridges, or tunnels for construction purposes. States must demonstrate that toll financing is the most efficient way to advance the project. States cannot enter agreements preventing improvements to public roads adjacent to toll facilities. The toll program allows toll collection on Interstate System highways for construction purposes. Revenues can only be used for debt service, private investor returns, and operating costs. State departments of transportation can allow vehicles to pay a toll to use HOV lanes. Section 1121 of the act allows state departments of transportation to permit vehicles to pay a toll to use HOV lanes on the Interstate System. The provision includes requirements for enrollment, toll collection, managing traffic demand by varying toll amounts, and enforcing violations. Additionally, the tolling of \"low emission and energy-efficient\" vehicles is allowed. Section 1121 of the act allows state departments of transportation to permit vehicles to pay a toll to use HOV lanes on the Interstate System. It includes requirements for toll collection, managing traffic demand by varying toll amounts, and enforcing violations. The act also allows for tolling of \"low emission and energy-efficient vehicles\" at a preferential rate for HOV use. Additionally, the act amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow tax-exempt private activity bonds for financing highway projects and rail-truck transfer facilities. This enables state and local governments to issue tax-exempt bonds for constructing such facilities. The act allows tax-exempt private activity bonds for financing highway projects, international tunnels or bridges, and truck-train transfer facilities with a $15 billion limit on bond issuance. The provision aims to leverage infrastructure creation without estimating the potential impact. The bonding provision in SAFETEA allows tax-exempt private activity bonds for financing highway projects with a $15 billion limit on bond issuance. This provision could have a substantial impact on infrastructure creation. It is considered one of the most important tolling provisions in SAFETEA, although projects using these bonds are likely to be supported by tolls or other revenue mechanisms. The Appalachian Development Highway Program (ADHP) aims to connect Appalachia and boost economic development. It is funded by the highway trust fund and administered by the Appalachian Regional Commission. Funds are allocated to member states based on cost estimates for the approved Appalachian Development Highway System (ADHS). 85% of ADHS roads are covered by the program. The ADHP receives federal funds based on cost estimates for the ADHS. 85% of ADHS roads are completed or under construction. The program received $450 million annually under TEA-21 and $470 million under SAFETEA. The estimated additional funds needed to complete the system is $4.47 billion. The SAFETEA act provides $470 million annually for the ADHP, with a prohibition on using toll revenues as credits for non-federal matching funds. It includes over 5,092 earmarks for high priority projects, totaling more than $14.8 billion, a significant increase compared to TEA-21. The SAFETEA act includes over 5,092 earmarks for high priority projects, totaling more than $14.8 billion. Additionally, new earmarked categories have been created, including projects of national and regional significance and national corridor infrastructure improvements, with a combined value of over $3.7 billion. The SAFETEA act includes over 5,092 earmarks for high priority projects, totaling more than $14.8 billion. New earmarked categories have been created, including national corridor infrastructure improvements valued at over $1.9 billion and transportation improvements with over $2.5 billion in funding. Individual projects may appear in multiple earmarking lists. The SAFETEA act includes over 5,092 earmarks for high priority projects, totaling more than $14.8 billion. Individual projects may appear in multiple earmarking lists, with different funding amounts. There are also 32 earmarks in the highway title, totaling $774 million, and 25 earmarks in the research title, requiring $241.6 million. The bus and bus facilities program contains 662 specific projects with almost $1.6 billion in funding. The transit title of the SAFETEA act includes 662 specific projects with almost $1.6 billion in funding. There are at least 39 additional stand-alone earmarks valued at just over $191 million. The total amount of earmarking in the bill is estimated to exceed $24 billion, with much discussion focused on how earmarking affects the Equity Bonus calculation. The bill focuses on how earmarking affects the Equity Bonus calculation. Earmarks in the bill for EB purposes are categorized as \"below the line\" or \"above the line.\" This computation significantly impacts state shares due to varying levels of earmarked funds. Highway title earmarks like HPPs are below the line, while other programs and miscellaneous earmarks are above the line. Transit earmarks and TE program activities are not included in the EB calculation. The TE program funds 12 major categories of projects, including pedestrian and bicycle facilities, safety and education activities, scenic and historic easements, landscaping, historic preservation, and rehabilitation of historic transportation buildings. Transit earmarks and TE program activities are not part of the Equity Bonus calculation. The TE program funds various projects such as pedestrian and bicycle facilities, safety activities, scenic beautification, historic preservation, rehabilitation of transportation buildings, and more. Funding for TE activities has been modified under SAFETEA, with 10% of state funds now designated for TE projects. Under SAFETEA, funding for the TE program is now the greater of 10% of funds apportioned to a state under the Surface Transportation Program (STP) or the amount apportioned in FY2005. This ensures additional funding for enhancement projects as STP funding increases under P.L. 109-59. The TCSP program, established under TEA-21 and reauthorized under SAFETEA, aims to integrate transportation strategies. The TCSP program, established under TEA-21 and reauthorized under SAFETEA, aims to assist in planning, developing, and implementing strategies to integrate transportation, community, and system preservation plans. Funding is authorized for projects that improve transportation efficiency, reduce environmental impacts, and ensure access to jobs and services. The TCSP program aims to integrate transportation, community, and system preservation plans to improve efficiency, reduce environmental impacts, and ensure access to jobs and services. State, tribal, regional, and local governments are eligible for grants totaling $270 million over six years, with varying annual authorizations. The Transportation, Community, and System Preservation (TCSP) program received varying annual authorizations under TEA-21, with funding amounts ranging from $13.5 million in FY1999 to $273 million in FY2002. SAFETEA continued to provide significant funding for bicycle and pedestrian programs. SAFETEA provides significant funding for bicycle and pedestrian programs, with allocations ranging from $13.5 million in FY1999 to $273 million in FY2002. The Transportation Enhancements program supports pedestrian and bicycle mobility, allowing states to use funds for facilities, safety, and education activities. The Transportation Enhancements program allows states to allocate funds for pedestrian and bicycle facilities, safety, and education activities. Between FY1992 and FY2004, 55% of TE funds were used for these purposes, with pedestrian and bicycle facilities accounting for 46.3% of programmed activities. Other programs also support the construction of bicycle and pedestrian facilities associated with road and transit projects. The Safe Routes to School Program, part of SAFETEA, aims to promote walking and biking to school for children, including those with disabilities. It encourages a healthy lifestyle and provides funding of $612 million for FY2004-FY2009. The Safe Routes to School Program, funded at $612 million for FY2004-FY2009, aims to promote walking and biking to school for children. Funding is apportioned among states based on student enrollment ratios, with each state receiving a minimum of $1 million per year. Administrative expenses are capped at $3 million. The Safe Routes to School Program allocates over $3 million for the Secretary's administrative expenses. Each state's funding is managed by its department of transportation. The federal government covers 100% of project costs, with funds available until used. Eligible agencies include state, local, and regional entities, as well as nonprofits. Funds can be used for infrastructure planning, design, and construction. The Safe Routes to School Program provides funds for infrastructure projects to improve walking and biking to school. This includes sidewalk, traffic calming, bicycle facilities, pedestrian crossings, and secure bike parking. States can also use funds for noninfrastructure-related purposes. The Safe Routes to School Program provides funds for infrastructure projects like sidewalk improvements, traffic calming measures, bicycle facilities, and secure bike parking near schools. States can also use funds for noninfrastructure-related activities such as public awareness campaigns, traffic education, and student sessions on safety. The Safe Routes to School Program requires states to allocate 10-30% of funds for non-infrastructure spending. States must use a portion of the funds to hire a full-time coordinator for the program. The Secretary provides grants to a national nonprofit for operating a clearinghouse, developing educational programs, and offering technical assistance for successful safe routes to school programs. The Safe Routes to School Program requires states to allocate funds for non-infrastructure spending and hire a full-time coordinator. A clearinghouse will be funded by the Secretary for educational programs and technical assistance. A task force will study and develop a strategy for safe routes to school programs nationwide. SAFETEA provides $45.3 billion in transit funding for the five-year authorization period. SAFETEA provides $45.3 billion in guaranteed transit funding for the five-year authorization period (FY2005-FY2009), totaling $52.6 billion over six years, a 46% increase from TEA-21. Congress adjusted funding shares, with Urbanized Area Formula Program receiving 44.0% (down from 47.9%) and Non-Urbanized Formula Program receiving 5.2% (up from 3.3%). Funding for four largest states decreased by nearly 8%. The SAFETEA act increased transit funding by 46% from TEA-21, with adjustments to funding shares. The share going to the four largest states decreased by nearly 8%, while the 40 least-populated states saw an increase of 11.1%. Minor changes were made to the federal transit program, including new programs and funding categories. The SAFETEA act increased transit funding by 46% from TEA-21, with adjustments to funding shares. Some changes were made to existing programs, including requirements for federal agencies in the National Capital Region to offer transit passes to employees. Additionally, provisions were made for the New Starts program and Bus and Bus Facilities Program. The SAFETEA act increased transit funding by 46% from TEA-21, with adjustments to funding shares. Provisions were made for the Urbanized Area Formula and Non-Urbanized Area Formula programs, providing $1.7 billion in additional funding over the FY2006-FY2009 period. Funds are apportioned to states based on population forecasts and distributed to urban and rural areas accordingly. The SAFETEA act increased transit funding by 46% from TEA-21, with adjustments to funding shares. Provisions were made for the Urbanized Area Formula and Non-Urbanized Area Formula programs, providing $1.7 billion in additional funding over the FY2006-FY2009 period. Half of the funding is distributed based on population densities, while the other half is allocated to increase transportation services for persons with disabilities. This program is authorized at $339 million and is a discretionary grant program. The program authorized at $97 million from FY2006-FY2009 aims to provide transportation alternatives in national parks and public lands, prioritizing access for everyone, including persons with disabilities. It is exempt from labor protection provisions and includes a new formula program within the Urbanized Area Formula Program. A new formula program within the Urbanized Area Formula Program, funded by a one-percent set-aside, provides additional funding for small urbanized areas with populations under 200,000 that offer comparable transit service to larger urbanized areas. The program measures transit service based on various factors such as passenger miles, vehicle revenue hours, and passengers. The program measures transit service in small urbanized areas under 200,000 population based on factors like passenger miles, vehicle revenue hours, and passengers. Unlike larger urbanized areas, the formula for small areas does not include performance factors to reduce data collection burden on transit providers. The Urbanized Areas Formula Program is being considered for changes to reward small areas providing high levels of transit service. This change would shift approximately 1% of funding from urbanized areas. The Urbanized Areas Formula Program is undergoing changes to reward small areas with high transit service levels, shifting about 1% of funding from larger urbanized areas to smaller ones. This new category within the New Starts program allocates $200 million annually for FY2007-FY2009, with streamlined evaluation for projects seeking less than $75 million in federal funding. The New Starts program allocates $200 million annually for FY2007-FY2009, with streamlined evaluation for projects seeking less than $75 million in federal funding. The exemption for projects seeking less than $25 million is eliminated. $45 million is set aside for grants to Indian tribes for public transportation on reservations. 20% of the Non-Urbanized Area Formula program funding will be apportioned based on a state's share of non-urbanized land area. The Non-Urbanized Area Formula program funding will now be apportioned based on a state's share of the nation's total non-urbanized land area. 80% of the funding will still be allocated according to a state's share of the nation's total non-urbanized population. The act authorizes $90 million for magnetic levitation train deployment for FY2005-FY2009, with 50% of the funding designated for maglev projects. The TEA-21 authorized funding for maglev deployment, with 50% allocated for a project between Las Vegas and Primm, Nevada, and 50% for a project east of the Mississippi River. Pennsylvania and Maryland were selected for competing for the funding. The program is intended to be administered as a new program, not a continuation of any previous program. The act also reauthorizes the Swift Rail Act with expanded eligible expenses. The act reauthorizes the Swift Rail Act, expanding eligible expenses for high-speed rail development. It authorizes $70 million annually for corridor development and $30 million for technology improvements for FY2006-2013. Additionally, $50 million is allocated for rail-highway grade crossing hazard elimination in high-speed rail corridors. Grants are directed to the Alaska Railroad for capital rehabilitation. The act authorizes grants for grade crossing hazards in high-speed rail corridors and directs funds to the Alaska Railroad for passenger transportation improvements. No specific amounts are specified, with authorization for \"such sums as may be necessary.\" Additionally, funds apportioned to the Anchorage urbanized area can be used by the Alaska Railroad for passenger operations. The Federal Railroad Administration is required to establish a program for reviewing rail joint bar inspection data. The SAFETEA act requires the Federal Railroad Administration to establish a program for reviewing rail joint bar inspection data and developing regulations for pressurized tank cars. It also authorizes a new grant program for highway safety. The SAFETEA act authorizes a new grant program for highway safety, the Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP), which replaces the existing roadway hazard elimination program. This program focuses on projects like installing barriers and guard rails. Under TEA-21, funding for infrastructure hazard elimination programs was through a 10% set-aside from the Surface Transportation Program, totaling $560 million in FY2005. The HSIP Program, funded through a 10% set-aside from the Surface Transportation Program, received $560 million in FY2005. States had to spend at least $317 million annually on hazard elimination, with the remainder available for other highway projects if not needed for safety improvements. Funding for HSIP is authorized at $1.2 billion in FY2006, increasing to $1.3 billion by FY2009, apportioned using a formula with three ratios. The new HSIP Program is authorized at $1.2 billion in FY2006, rising to $1.3 billion by FY2009. Funding is apportioned based on lane-miles, vehicle miles traveled, and fatalities on federal-aid highways. States will receive a minimum of 0.5% of the funding. $220 million annually is reserved for rail-highway grade crossing hazard elimination, and $90 million each year. The HSIP has two set-asides: $220 million each year for rail-highway grade crossing hazard elimination and $90 million each year for high-risk rural road projects. States can use their funds for other safety projects if they have met their needs in these areas. States must prepare a strategic highway safety plan. Program authorization is $1.2 billion in FY2006, increasing to $1.3 billion by FY2009. The Safe Routes to Schools program under the HSIP Act allocates $1.2 billion in FY2006, increasing to $1.3 billion by FY2009. It funds infrastructure projects near schools to promote walking or biking. Funding is based on student enrollment, with a minimum of $1 million for each state. 10-30% of funds are for non-infrastructure projects. The program funds are authorized at $54 million in FY2005, increasing to $183 million in FY2009. A new grant program is created to promote seat belt use, with grants available for states with primary seat belt laws or achieving a seat belt use rate of 85% or more for two years. Grant funds can be used for various highway safety purposes. The program authorizes grant funds for highway safety purposes, with a federal share of 100%. States achieving a seat belt use rate of 85% or more for two years are eligible for grants. The program is funded at $125 million annually for FY2006-FY2009 and includes a grant program to reduce alcohol-impaired driving. States must have a low alcohol-related fatality rate or implement specific programs to qualify for grants. States receiving grant funds for highway safety purposes must carry out a series of programs to discourage driving while impaired. The specified programs include checkpoints, prosecution programs, increased blood alcohol testing, and harsher penalties for high blood alcohol content. The number of programs required increases each fiscal year, with states needing to implement 5 programs in FY2008 and FY2009. The grant funds for highway safety aim to deter impaired driving through various programs, including harsher penalties for high blood alcohol content, effective alcohol rehabilitation, prevention strategies for underage drinking, administrative license revocation, and community-based programs funded by fines collected from DUI offenses. The grant program provides funding for comprehensive impaired driving prevention programs, with a total authorization of $555 million. Additionally, there is a set-aside of up to 15% of the funds for grants to states with the highest rates of impaired driving-related fatalities. Other new programs in the act include a motorcyclist safety grant program and an incentive grant program for states with child safety seat requirements. The act authorizes funding for various safety programs, including grants for impaired driving prevention and child safety restraints. It also directs the DOT to establish standards to reduce vehicle rollover crashes and enhance occupant protection in side impact crashes. The act authorizes funding for safety programs, including grants for impaired driving prevention and child safety restraints. It also directs the DOT to establish standards to reduce vehicle rollover crashes and enhance occupant protection in side impact crashes. Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) use communication systems, sensors, and computers to improve highway or transit performance and safety by providing real-time traffic information for traffic management centers to redirect traffic, coordinate emergency response, and improve surface transportation system operation. The TEA-21 and SAFETEA acts provide funding for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) to improve highway and transit performance by providing real-time traffic information. The direct federal investment in ITS during TEA-21 was about $230 million per year, with $100 million for research and $120 million for deployment. SAFETEA allocates $110 million annually for ITS research, while the ITS deployment program was terminated after FY2005. ITS project costs are now eligible expenses in core highway programs. The ITS deployment program was terminated after FY2005, and ITS project costs are now eligible expenses in core highway programs. The act aims to advance and test new technologies, improve ITS standards, and conduct training. Research and development activities play a role in reducing challenges in surface transportation systems such as congestion and security. The federal role in research and development (RD) and technology deployment (TD) aims to address challenges in surface transportation systems, including congestion, security, and infrastructure rehabilitation. Agencies like FHWA, FTA, NHTSA, and RITA oversee this role. The federal role in surface transportation is primarily overseen by agencies like FHWA, FTA, NHTSA, and RITA. FHWA conducts an extensive RD and TD program with a budget of roughly $295 million per year authorized by SAFETEA. SAFETEA authorizes roughly $295 million annually for transportation research and education, including funds for surface transportation research, training, education, Bureau of Transportation Statistics, and University Transportation Research Program. These funds are used to advance technologies for improving highway infrastructure. Research funds are primarily used to advance and deploy technologies for improving highway infrastructure, roadway safety, and studying highway policies. State and industry experts emphasize the importance of FHWA's RD and TD funds for maximizing the effective use of federal aid funds. Title IX of SAFETEA, \"Rail Transportation,\" focuses on infrastructure capacity, rail-to-rail competition, and grade crossing conflicts in freight rail transportation. Congress is evaluating the freight railroads' ability to expand infrastructure capacity to handle increasing trade volumes and highway congestion. Freight railroads primarily finance their infrastructure needs without government aid, prompting Congress to consider federal involvement in certain circumstances. Railroads finance their infrastructure needs without government aid, but Congress is considering federal assistance for expansion. Increased freight train traffic in towns causes delays for motor vehicles. Railroads are intensifying track usage for efficiency despite reducing total miles in service. Congressional issues persist since rail price deregulation. The congressional issue of captive shippers receiving poor rail service and high rates has been a perennial concern since rail industry deregulation in 1980. This issue has been debated in the 109th Congress and is reflected in title IX of the SAFETEA act. Section 9007 requests a report from the Transportation Research Board on these issues. Title IX of the SAFETEA act in the 109th Congress addresses concerns about poor rail service and high rates for captive shippers. Section 9007 requests a report on the performance of the nation's rail system and funding mechanisms are provided to address these issues. SAFETEA (section 9003) expands a federal loan and loan guarantee program for rail track rehabilitation, increasing the total value of available loans from $3.5 billion to $35 billion. $7 billion is reserved for smaller railroads, and loan availability is expedited with the Secretary of Transportation required to provide loans without collateral. SAFETEA (section 9003) expands federal loan program for rail track rehabilitation to $35 billion, with $7 billion for smaller railroads. Loans provided without collateral, approval within 90 days. Loans may be issued for constructing rail connections between plants/facilities and second rail carriers. SAFETEA (section 9002) establishes a federal grants program for relocating or grade separating rail tracks that disrupt a community's traffic flow, quality of life, or economic development. The program allocates $350 million annually from 2006 to 2009. Additionally, the Secretary is directed to prioritize enhancing rail infrastructure capacity and alleviating rail bottlenecks when issuing RRIF loans. SAFETEA authorizes $350 million annually from 2006 to 2009 for a federal grants program to improve rail infrastructure and eliminate grade crossings. Projects of National and Regional Significance include funding for a rail line connecting Virginia seaports and Ohio, planning for a freight rail tunnel under New York harbor, and improving rail connections. SAFETEA authorizes $350 million annually from 2006 to 2009 for a federal grants program to improve rail infrastructure and eliminate grade crossings. Projects include a rail line connecting Virginia seaports and Ohio, planning for a freight rail tunnel under New York harbor, improving rail connections in Chicago, eliminating grade crossings east of Los Angeles, studying the relocation of El Paso rail yards, and relocating a rail line connection to the Port of Portsmouth, Virginia. The text chunk discusses a study on the nation's rail transportation system post-deregulation in 1980, focusing on service levels, quality, rates of major railroads, projected demand for freight rail service, and constraints. It also mentions a grant program for improving freight mobility around U.S. ports. The Pilot Grant Program allocates $6 million annually from 2005 to 2009 to enhance freight mobility at U.S. ports and intermodal facilities. Six projects in Oregon, Georgia, California, Alaska, and North Carolina are designated for this program. Additionally, SAFETEA continues the Recreational Trails Program (RTP) to support the development and maintenance of recreational trails for various activities like hiking, biking, and horseback riding. The Recreational Trails Program (RTP) provides funds for various recreational trail uses, including hiking, biking, horseback riding, and motorized activities. RTP funds cannot be used for property condemnation or constructing new motorized trails on certain lands. SAFETEA authorizes $370 million in contract authority for the RTP for FY2005-2009. SAFETEA authorizes $370 million in contract authority for the RTP for FY2005-2009, with funds allocated to states based on a legislative formula. States must use 30% of their RTP funds for motorized trail uses. Under SAFETEA, the RTP is subject to annual obligation limitations like other federal-aid highway programs. States must allocate 30% of RTP funds for motorized trails, 30% for non-motorized trails, and 40% for diverse trail uses. SAFETEA eliminates discretionary waivers for the 30% provision but keeps the small state exemption for states with less than 3.5 million acres. The \"sliding scale\" provision in 23 U.S.C. \u00a7120(b) allows for additional federal share in states with large federal lands. SAFETEA amends the federal-aid highway program to change the federal share for RTP projects to a sliding scale share. It encourages states to use youth conservation or service corps for trail construction and maintenance. The permissible uses for RTP funding are expanded to include non-law enforcement trail safety, monitoring patrols, and training, up to 5% of the apportionment. The new provision allows funding for trail condition assessment for accessibility and maintenance, not exceeding 5% of the apportionment made to the state. RTP sponsors must complete environmental compliance documentation before applying for funds, with pre-approval planning costs credited towards the non-federal share for projects. (CRS contact: [author name scrubbed]) Before final design, property acquisition, or construction on a highway or transit project can proceed, DOT (FHWA or FTA) must comply with environmental review requirements, including those of NEPA. NEPA requires federal agencies to consider environmental impacts of proposed actions and prepare an EIS for federally funded projects. NEPA mandates DOT to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) for federally funded projects that significantly impact the human environment. Projects with unclear impacts require an environmental assessment (EA), and if impacts are deemed significant, an EIS must be prepared. Projects with no significant effects are processed differently. Projects with no significant effects are processed as categorical exclusions, which do not have a significant social, economic, or environmental impact. Compliance with Section 4(f) of the Department of Transportation Act of 1966 is also required within the NEPA process. Section 4(f) requirements under the Department of Transportation Act of 1966 apply to publicly owned parks, wildlife refuges, and historic sites. The law prohibits using these resources for transportation projects unless no feasible alternative exists, and the project minimizes harm to the resource. Concerns have been raised about inefficiencies in the environmental review process for large projects, leading to delays. \"Environmental Streamlining\" provisions aim to address these concerns. The Environmental Streamlining provisions in TEA-21 aim to improve the efficiency of the review process for large transportation projects by promoting timely delivery while protecting the environment. Improved interagency cooperation is seen as crucial for the success of streamlining efforts. Improved interagency cooperation is crucial for the success of environmental streamlining efforts under TEA-21. The Department of Transportation is required to implement a coordinated environmental review process for highway projects with significant environmental impacts. This process encourages early participation by relevant federal and state agencies. Numerous administrative activities have been undertaken to facilitate this process since the passage of TEA-21. SAFETEA includes provisions to further streamline the environmental review process for highway construction and transit projects, focusing on NEPA and Section 4(f) requirements. These provisions aim to expedite compliance with environmental regulations. SAFETEA aims to expedite compliance with environmental regulations, including NEPA and Section 4(f) requirements. Unlike TEA-21, the term \"streamlining\" is not used in SAFETEA, but the intended effect is the same. Many provisions in SAFETEA codify existing regulatory requirements, such as designating DOT as the lead agency for surface transportation projects. SAFETEA includes provisions that codify existing regulatory requirements for NEPA, such as designating DOT as the lead agency for transportation projects and establishing a new entity called a \"participating agency\" for submitting comments on NEPA documentation. The SAFETEA provisions include establishing procedures for collaborative development of project statements, setting deadlines for comments, imposing a 180-day statute of limitations on judicial claims, allowing transportation funds for expediting reviews, and creating a dispute resolution process for disagreements during the environmental review. The SAFETEA provisions include funds to expedite environmental review processes, a dispute resolution process for disagreements, state authorization for certain project classifications, and state pilot programs for federal compliance. Section 4(f) allows for the use of public parks and wildlife refuges if impacts are minimal. SAFETEA allows for the use of publicly owned parks, wildlife refuges, and historic sites with minimal impacts, requiring concurrence from relevant authorities. DOT must issue regulations clarifying factors and standards within one year. The National Historic Preservation Act requires DOT to issue regulations clarifying factors for determining if alternatives are \"prudent and feasible\" under Section 4(f) requirements. SAFETEA specifies that the Interstate System cannot be considered a \"historic site\" under Section 4(f) provisions. The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 directed the Secretary of DOT to establish the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement (CMAQ) program to reduce emissions from highway travel and assist states in complying with National Ambient Air Quality Standards. The CMAQ program aims to reduce emissions from highway travel to help states comply with air quality standards. It funds projects like transportation control measures, auto emission inspections, alternative fuel vehicles, traffic improvements, and pedestrian/bicycle facilities. Funding is based on a state's population and pollution reduction needs. The CMAQ program, established by ISTEA, allocates funds based on a state's population and pollution reduction needs. States with nonattainment areas for ozone or CO receive a minimum apportionment. TEA-21 expanded the program to include projects targeting particulate matter but did not change the apportionment formula for ozone and CO. SAFETEA expanded CMAQ funding eligibility to include projects targeting particulate matter, with a total funding of $8.6 billion for FY2005-FY2009. This amendment also adjusted the apportionment formula under 23 U.S.C. \u00a7104(b)(2) and \u00a7149(b), ensuring states with maintenance or nonattainment areas for only PM receive guaranteed minimum funding. SAFETEA expands CMAQ funding eligibility to include projects like advanced truck stop electrification systems, transportation systems management improvements, emergency communications equipment, and diesel retrofits with funding priority. States receiving minimum apportionment can use CMAQ funds for eligible projects. SAFETEA expands CMAQ funding eligibility to include various projects, such as advanced truck stop electrification systems, transportation systems management improvements, emergency communications equipment, and diesel retrofits. States receiving minimum apportionment can utilize CMAQ funds for eligible projects, with requirements outlined in the legislation. DOT is directed to evaluate a sample of CMAQ projects in collaboration with EPA to assess their impact on air quality and congestion levels, maintaining a database for project impacts. No direct funding is provided for the evaluation or the database. Under the Clean Air Act, areas not meeting air quality standards must develop State Implementation Plans. As of May 2005, 124 areas with 159 million people were subject to SIP requirements. Section 176 prohibits federal funding for projects in these areas. Section 176 of the Clean Air Act prohibits federal funding for projects in areas not meeting air quality standards. Projects must conform to State Implementation Plans to avoid causing new violations or delaying attainment of standards. Transportation Improvement Programs must demonstrate conformity with each revision. The Transportation Improvement Program (TIP) must show conformity with air quality standards each time it is revised to receive federal funds for highway and transit projects. Recent court decisions and increased emissions from SUVs and light trucks have made demonstrating conformity more challenging. Recent court decisions and increased emissions from vehicles have made it more difficult to demonstrate conformity with air quality standards. The implementation of stricter air quality standards will lead to more areas being subject to conformity requirements, potentially resulting in the suspension of highway and transit funds for metropolitan areas unless emissions are reduced. Only a few metropolitan areas have had to change transportation plans in the past six years, according to a 2003 Government Accountability Office survey. The Clean Air Act provides no authority for waivers of conformity, and only a limited grace period of one year is allowed following an area's designation as nonattainment. Only 5 metropolitan areas had to change transportation plans in the past six years to resolve conformity lapses, but one-third of local transportation planners expect difficulty demonstrating conformity in the future. The Clean Air Act does not allow waivers of conformity and only permits a one-year grace period after an area is designated as nonattainment. Funding for projects in lapsed areas is limited to safety-related or existing transit facility replacement and repair. New projects that could reduce emissions, like new transit lines, are not allowed. Concerns include a mismatch between SIP, TIP, and long-range transportation planning cycles, with calls for less frequent but better-coordinated conformity demonstrations. The GAO recommended improvements in a 2003 report. The GAO recommended in 2003 to extend the time frame between required long-range transportation plan updates and amend the Clean Air Act to change conformity rules. P.L. 109-59 now requires conformity demonstrations every four years instead of every two years. P.L. 109-59 mandates less frequent conformity demonstrations, shortening the planning horizon to 10 years in many cases. Consultation with the local air pollution control agency and public comments are required to shorten the planning horizon. The law also includes a 12-month grace period after a failure to demonstrate conformity before a lapse is declared. The law mandates less frequent conformity demonstrations, shortening the planning horizon to 10 years in many cases. Consultation with the local air pollution control agency and public comments are required. A 12-month grace period is included after a failure to demonstrate conformity before a lapse is declared.
