    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Personal Health Investment Today Act\" or the \"PHIT Act.\" Congress finds that almost 20 percent of American children aged 2 to 19 are overweight or obese, leading to increased healthcare costs and higher prevalence of expensive illnesses. The World Health Organization found that a $1 investment in physical activity in the United States could reduce medical expenses by $3.20. Research shows that financial incentives could motivate 2 in 5 Americans to be more physically active. The US ranks last globally in preventing obesity-related deaths, and early engagement in physical activities can shape lifelong behaviors. The purpose of this Act is to promote health and prevent disease, particularly related to being overweight and obese, by encouraging healthier lifestyles, providing financial incentives for healthy behavior, and increasing participation in physical fitness activities. Certain amounts paid for physical activity, fitness, and exercise are treated as amounts paid for medical care. Certain amounts paid for physical activity, fitness, and exercise are treated as qualified sports and fitness expenses under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. This includes membership at a fitness facility. The term 'qualified sports and fitness expenses' includes payments for fitness facility membership, participation in physical exercise programs, and equipment for physical activity. There is an overall dollar limitation on these expenses. The aggregate amount for qualified sports and fitness expenses is limited to $1,000 per taxpayer ($2,000 for joint returns or heads of household). A fitness facility is defined as a facility that provides instruction in physical exercise programs. A fitness facility is a facility that provides instruction in physical exercise programs, excluding private clubs and facilities offering golf, hunting, sailing, or riding activities. A fitness facility must not offer golf, hunting, sailing, or riding facilities, and its health or fitness facility should not be incidental to its overall function. It must also comply with state and federal anti-discrimination laws. Videos, books, and similar materials are treated as described in the previous subparagraph. Amounts paid for sports and fitness equipment must be used exclusively for physical activities to be considered a qualified expense. Amounts paid for sports and fitness equipment must be used exclusively for physical activities, such as participation in fitness, exercise, sport, or other physical activity programs, with a limit of $250 for sports equipment. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after the enactment of this Act, with a limit of $250 for sports equipment and other components in physical activity programs."
