A novel differentially private estimator is proposed, allowing for confidential estimation without compromising privacy. This method can be extended to provide differentially private confidence intervals and test statistics. Additionally, extensions for differentially private estimation of competing risk cumulative incidence function are provided. Empirical evidence from nine real-life clinical datasets supports the effectiveness of the proposed method. Using nine real-life clinical datasets, a method for differentially private estimation of competing risk cumulative incidence function is proposed, ensuring strong privacy guarantees while maintaining good utility. An example scenario illustrates how published survival function estimates can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information to adversaries. The survival function is crucial for modeling time to events in various domains like economics, engineering, and healthcare. It can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, such as personal healthcare data, which is protected by law. In healthcare, personal healthcare information is highly sensitive and protected by law. Information leakage in this domain is a serious issue. The Kaplan-Meier's non-parametric method is widely used for estimating survival functions in clinical research. The Kaplan-Meier method is extensively used in clinical studies and by statistical agencies worldwide to report survival statistics. Currently, there is no model that offers formal privacy guarantees for survival function estimation using this method, except for a limited approach by Nguy\u00ean & Hui (2017) for regression modeling of discrete time to event data. The Kaplan-Meier method is commonly used in clinical studies for survival statistics. A limited approach by Nguy\u00ean & Hui (2017) uses regression modeling for discrete time to event data but cannot estimate survival function differentially privately. Generative models like differentially private GANs could be trained to generate synthetic data for this purpose, but they struggle with small sample sizes. We propose a differentially private method for estimating the survival function based on the Kaplan-Meier method, ensuring privacy while extending to confidence intervals and test statistics. Our method provides differentially private estimation of survival functions, confidence intervals, and test statistics without extra privacy cost. It also extends to competing risk cumulative incidence function estimation. Empirical evidence from nine clinical datasets shows good utility and strong privacy guarantees. The method is available as an R package for easy adoption. The method offers differential privacy for survival function estimation, confidence intervals, and test statistics. It also extends to competing risk cumulative incidence function estimation. The method is available as an R package for easy adoption. The survival function models time to event data, accounting for censored observations. The survival function estimates the probability of not experiencing an event before a certain time, considering censored observations. Various parametric methods can be used to estimate the survival function, such as exponential, Weibull, Gompertz, and log-normal distributions. In clinical literature, the Kaplan-Meier method is often used to estimate survival function without assuming how event probabilities change over time. The KM estimator considers distinct failure times and the number of failures at each time point, along with the individuals \"at risk\" before each failure. The Kaplan-Meier method estimates survival function using distinct failure times and number of failures at each time point, along with individuals \"at risk\" before each failure. The function changes only at failure times, creating a step function characteristic. Differential privacy ensures privacy in randomized algorithms. Differential privacy ensures privacy in randomized algorithms by preserving ( , \u03b4)-differential privacy. Smaller values of ( , \u03b4) provide stronger privacy guarantees. Differential privacy has interesting properties, including postprocessing as described in Theorem 1. Our proposal focuses on differentially private survival function estimation, emphasizing the immunity to post-processing as stated in Theorem 1. This concept is crucial in our approach, which involves using the Kaplan-Meier method for estimation while adhering to the principles of differential privacy. Our method for differentially private estimation of the survival function using the Kaplan-Meier's method ensures differential privacy. It allows for estimating various statistics in a differentially private manner without extra privacy budget. In Section 2.1, we introduce notations for time points, subjects at risk, and events. A dataset matrix M is created with event and at-risk data for each unique time point. Using L1 sensitivity, a noise matrix Z is drawn from Laplace distribution for privacy protection. Algorithm 1 presents a method for creating a differentially private version of a matrix M by adding noise from a Laplace distribution. The procedure is simple and requires minimal changes to the original estimation process. The procedure for creating a differentially private version of a matrix M is simple and requires minimal changes. The method is computationally cheap and can be easily implemented using any available software package. Formal privacy guarantees are provided, and the method can be extended for estimating other associated statistics differentially privately. The method for creating a differentially private version of a matrix M is easily extendable for estimating other associated statistics. The L 1 sensitivity of M is two, ensuring -differential privacy for Algorithm 1. Theorem 2 proves that Algorithm 1 is -differentially private by adding Laplace noise to ensure privacy of individual components. The approach can be easily extended to estimate other essential statistics. The approach discussed in the Appendix allows for easy extension to include other essential statistics like confidence intervals and test statistics for comparing survival function distributions. This is important when reporting survival function estimates and conducting group comparisons in clinical trials. Confidence intervals for survival function estimates are calculated in a \"point-wise\" fashion, at discrete time-points when an event is observed. The calculations required for obtaining these intervals are proven to be differentially private. The calculations for obtaining confidence intervals for survival function estimates are proven to be differentially private. Different types of confidence intervals are available, with a focus on Greenwood's linear-point-wise intervals. The formula for these intervals is adjusted to be differentially private using Algorithm 1. The confidence intervals for survival function estimates are made differentially private by replacing them with their respective counterparts from Algorithm 1. This ensures that the confidence intervals are also differentially private, without the need for additional access to sensitive data. Therefore, providing differentially private confidence intervals with survival function estimates does not incur any extra privacy cost. In essence, differentially private confidence intervals are obtained at no additional cost. Using Algorithm 6, hypothesis testing with the Logrank test is made differentially private, ensuring -differential privacy for the test statistic. The Logrank test statistic (Z) is made differentially private by replacing quantities with their differentially private counterparts, ensuring -differential privacy for the test statistic. The test statistic Z is made differentially private by post-processing, ensuring no additional privacy budget is spent. In certain scenarios, events like death can preclude the observation of the event of interest. Competing events, such as death, can prevent the observation of the event of interest, like progression to AIDS. Specialized estimates, like the competing risk cumulative incidence, are needed to account for these events in clinical data analysis. Using Algorithm 1, it is possible to extend differential privacy to competing risk scenarios. Using Algorithm 1, differential privacy can be extended to competing risk scenarios. The competing risk cumulative incidence is -differentially private, with associated quantities replaced by their private counterparts. The post-processing theorem ensures the privacy of the cumulative incidence statistics, including confidence intervals. The post-processing theorem ensures that statistics related to cumulative incidence, such as confidence intervals and hypothesis tests, are differentially private. The method also extends to the Nelson-Aalen estimate of cumulative hazard, providing a differentially private version. The method extends to the Nelson-Aalen estimate of cumulative hazard, providing a differentially private version. An empirical evaluation of the method on nine real-life clinical datasets is presented, with dataset details provided in Table 1. Further details are available in the Appendix due to space constraints. The method extends to producing differentially private estimates of the survival function, comparing it to the original non-private version. The evaluation on nine real-life datasets shows good utility and credibility for practical use. The evaluation on nine real-life datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of the differentially private survival function estimation. The results show that the privacy-preserving estimation closely matches the original function with minimal utility loss, although estimation quality decreases with higher privacy budget. The differentially private survival function estimation method provides good utility while protecting privacy. Smaller datasets show worse utility compared to larger datasets, as the estimation quality decreases with fewer events. The utility of differentially private estimation decreases in small datasets due to the need for large noise to protect privacy. However, for moderate to medium-sized datasets, the estimation provides good results even in high privacy settings. Median survival time and confidence intervals are important estimates reported with survival functions. The median survival time is defined as the time point when the survival function reaches 0.5. Confidence intervals for the survival function at that time point indicate the confidence intervals of the median survival. Results in Table 2 show that the method estimates the median with high precision, even in high privacy settings. In some cases, such as with Myeloid and Ovarian datasets, it is not possible to estimate the upper bounds on the confidence intervals due to high survival rates, marked as \"NA\". Precision increases with larger dataset sizes, showing an acceptable trade-off for individual-level privacy. In Table 2, the differentially private estimation performs similarly to the original \"non-noisy\" estimation, even in high privacy settings. The test statistic (Z) follows a \u03c72 distribution with one degree of freedom, and none of the differentially private estimates change the statistical significance threshold. Our proposed method for estimating competing risk cumulative incidence maintains statistical significance threshold at 0.05 level. Results show good utility in protecting privacy even at high privacy regime. Detailed results can be found in the Appendix. In the intersection of statistical modeling and differential privacy, various methods have been proposed for regression modeling. Nguy\u00ean & Hui (2017) developed a differentially private regression model for survival analysis, limited to multivariate regression models. Differentially private generative models like differentially private generative adversarial networks have also been explored. The first method for differentially private estimation of the survival function has been presented, showing its potential for extending to other statistics like confidence intervals and test statistics. Our proposed method can be extended to differentially private estimation of various statistics such as confidence intervals, test statistics, and competing risk cumulative incidence. Extensive empirical evaluation on nine real-life datasets demonstrates a good privacy-utility trade-off. The datasets used for evaluation include cancer data on survival in patients with advanced lung cancer and Gehan dataset from a trial of leukemia patients. Group Loprinzi et al. (1994) compared survival time in months between males and females. Gehan dataset (Cox, 2018) compared control and treatment groups in a trial with leukemia patients. Kidney dataset (McGilchrist & Aisbett, 1991) compared recurrence times to infection between males and females using portable dialysis equipment. Miller Jr (2011) compared time in months between maintenance chemotherapy given or not in subjects with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. The dataset includes information on survival time in months for subjects with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), acute myeloid leukemia, ovarian cancer, and Stanford Heart Transplant data. Time is converted into months, and groups compared include males and females, two treatment arms, different treatment groups, and the Stanford Heart Transplant data. The curr_chunk discusses datasets related to different treatment groups and age groups in various medical trials, including Stanford Heart Transplant data and a clinical trial for primary biliary cirrhosis. Time is converted into months for comparison. In a risk scenario, two datasets are used for analysis. The first dataset is from a clinical trial for primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) of the liver, with events such as liver transplant, censoring, and death. The second dataset includes subjects on a liver transplant waiting list from 1990-1999, with events like receiving a transplant, dying while waiting, or being censored. The results show that the differentially private extension performs well. The differentially private extension performs well in estimating the competing risk cumulative incidence function while providing strong privacy guarantees. The algorithm is proven to be -differentially private. The differentially private extension performs well in estimating competing risk cumulative incidence with strong privacy guarantees. The comparison of probability density functions at an arbitrary point shows accurate estimation. The differentially private extension provides accurate estimation of competing risk cumulative incidence with strong privacy guarantees, ensuring differential privacy in survival function estimation."
