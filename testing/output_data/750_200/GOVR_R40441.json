    "content": "The Navy scheduled 14 training exercises off the coast of southern California using mid-frequency active sonar to detect enemy submarines. Environmentalists claim the sonar harms whales, causing beach strandings. The Navy issued an environmental assessment concluding minimal harm to marine mammals. Petitioners, mostly environmental groups, sought relief against the exercises for violating environmental laws. Environmental groups sought relief against Navy training exercises using sonar off the coast of southern California, claiming harm to marine mammals. The district court initially granted an injunction, later modified to allow sonar use with mitigation measures. The Ninth Circuit upheld the modified injunction, citing a possibility of irreparable injury. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the modified injunction, stating plaintiffs showed a \"possibility\" of irreparable injury. The Supreme Court ruled that plaintiffs must show irreparable injury is \"likely\" for an injunction. The Court ruled that plaintiffs must show irreparable injury is \"likely\" for an injunction, and that the Navy's interest in realistic training outweighs potential harm to marine mammals. As a result, the preliminary injunction was vacated. The Court reversed the decision and vacated the preliminary injunction, citing the Navy's interest in realistic training outweighing potential harm to marine mammals. The Court did not address the merits of the lawsuit regarding violations of environmental laws. The case was accepted by the Supreme Court as a challenge to a preliminary injunction, emphasizing national security interests. The Supreme Court reversed the decision to vacate the preliminary injunction, emphasizing national security interests over potential harm to marine mammals. The Court did not address the merits of the lawsuit regarding environmental law violations. The Ninth Circuit's \"mere possibility\" test for injunctions was rejected, with the Supreme Court being known for overturning the environmentally friendly circuit. The Ninth Circuit, known for its environmentally friendly decisions, had its ruling reversed by the Supreme Court. The Forest Service regulations under the ARA limited public input for projects covered by NEPA categorical exclusions. In 2003, the Forest Service designated salvage timber sales of 250 acres or less as categorical exclusions under NEPA. A timber sale of 238 acres post-fire forest was approved without appeal due to these regulations. The district court invalidated the regulations, leading to a nationwide injunction. The district court invalidated regulations allowing salvage timber sales without appeal, leading to a nationwide injunction. The Ninth Circuit found plaintiffs had standing due to procedural rights deprivation and reduced recreational enjoyment of national forests. The court also ruled the appeal prohibition claims were ripe as they had been applied to block an administrative appeal by Earth Island Institute. The Ninth Circuit found conflicts with certain regulations. The Ninth Circuit found that certain Forest Service regulations conflicted with the plain language of the ARA, affirming the district court's decision and upholding a nationwide injunction against the enforcement of the regulations. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to review the case, focusing on whether the regulations were a proper subject of judicial review and other related questions. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to review whether certain Forest Service regulations were a proper subject of judicial review, the standing of environmental groups, the ripeness of the challenge after the timber sale was withdrawn, and the Ninth Circuit's affirmation of a nationwide injunction. The case was argued before the Supreme Court on October 8, 2008. The Ninth Circuit is being questioned for affirming a nationwide injunction issued by the district court. The case, argued before the Supreme Court on October 8, 2008, has not been decided yet. Environmental groups use site-specific challenges for program-wide reform, making the decision's outcome significant. A defeat for these groups could increase the burden on public interest groups seeking to invalidate government programs. The Supreme Court may rule to increase the burden on public interest groups challenging government programs, requiring multiple lawsuits instead of one. This is suggested by the conservative justices' restrictive view of the courts' role. The case involves power plants and industrial operations withdrawing water from waterways, causing harm to aquatic organisms. The Clean Water Act (CWA) section 316(b) addresses the issue of cooling water intake structures harming aquatic organisms. In 2004, the EPA issued a rule for existing power plants, allowing cost-benefit analysis to determine the best technology available for minimizing environmental impact. The EPA issued a rule for existing power plants, allowing cost-benefit analysis to determine the best technology available for minimizing environmental impact. In Riverkeeper Inc. v. United States, the Second Circuit invalidated the use of cost-benefit analysis under section 316(b), stating that facilities must adopt the best technology available without cost-benefit analysis. EPA may consider cost in other ways. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on April 14, 2008 to determine if CWA section 316(b) allows EPA to compare costs with benefits in selecting the best technology for minimizing environmental impact. EPA can consider cost in two other ways: to assess industry's capability and to conduct cost effectiveness analysis. The Supreme Court is considering whether CWA section 316(b) allows EPA to compare costs with benefits in selecting the best technology for minimizing environmental impact. There has been a shift towards greater acceptance of cost-benefit analysis in recent years. This case will test the justices' views on this issue. The Supreme Court is considering whether CWA section 316(b) allows EPA to compare costs with benefits in selecting the best technology for minimizing environmental impact. There has been a shift towards greater acceptance of cost-benefit analysis in recent years. This case will test whether the conservative justices on the Supreme Court will continue this shift, with industry hoping for a decision that could legitimize cost-benefit analysis in other areas of the CWA and federal pollution control statutes. Justice Breyer's views on government regulation and cost considerations are also under scrutiny. The case involves Coeur Alaska proposing to revive a gold mine in Alaska's Tongass National Forest and dispose of wastewater in a nearby lake. Justice Breyer's views on government regulation and cost considerations are also being scrutinized. The company plans to dispose of wastewater from a gold mine in Alaska by piping it to a nearby lake, which would kill aquatic life and raise the lake bottom by 50 feet. The Corps of Engineers issued a permit under the Clean Water Act, leading to a legal case in the Ninth Circuit. In Southeast Alaska Conservation Council v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Ninth Circuit addressed conflicting CWA regulations regarding Coeur Alaska's proposed discharge from a gold mine. The 404 permit was issued, allowing the discharge to change the bottom elevation of waters, but EPA's new source performance standard prohibits such discharges from this type of ore processing. The Ninth Circuit addressed conflicting CWA regulations regarding Coeur Alaska's proposed discharge from a gold mine. The court concluded that the CWA's plain language requires the Section 306 performance standard to apply through an NPDES permit, without any implied exemption from the performance standards under Section 404. EPA's new source performance standard specifically prohibits discharges from Coeur Alaska's type of ore processing into waters of the United States. The court ruled that a proposed discharge meeting the definition of \"fill material\" does not exempt it from performance standards under Section 404 of the CWA. The Corps should not have issued a 404 permit in this case, contrary to the district court's ruling. The Supreme Court is reviewing whether the Ninth Circuit erred in reallocating the permitting authority of the Corps of Engineers. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on June 27, 2008, to review the Ninth Circuit's decision on reallocating permitting authority from the Corps of Engineers to the EPA under the Clean Water Act. The case was argued on Jan. 12, 2009. The consequences of a potential reversal could be significant, as it may impact the EPA's NPDES program. The EPA and the State of California sued to recover cleanup costs under CERCLA for toxic contamination at an agricultural chemical facility. EPA's NPDES program may be impacted by a potential reversal of permitting authority from the Corps of Engineers to the EPA. The EPA and the State of California sued for cleanup costs under CERCLA for toxic contamination at an agricultural chemical facility. Liability was assigned to the company that operated the facility, two railroads, and Shell Oil Co. for arranging disposal of hazardous substances. The district court found the railroads liable as owners of the site and Shell liable as an \"arranger.\" In United States v. Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway Co., the Ninth Circuit addressed the liability of the railroads and Shell for cleanup costs. The court found the railroads liable for 9% and Shell liable for 6% of total cleanup costs, ruling that the harm could be apportioned due to contamination occurring before the railroads' parcel became part of the facility. The court found the railroads liable for 9% and Shell liable for 6% of cleanup costs, ruling that the harm could be apportioned due to contamination occurring before the railroads' parcel became part of the facility. The court also addressed whether Shell was liable as an \"arranger,\" stating that the term is not limited to \"direct\" arranger liability. The court found Shell liable for 6% of cleanup costs, ruling that the term \"arranger\" is not limited to direct liability. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to determine if the Ninth Circuit erred in reversing the district court's decision. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on October 1, 2008 to address whether the Ninth Circuit erred in its apportionment of responsibility under CERCLA and in adopting a standard of review that conflicts with common law principles and decisions of other circuits. Shell Oil's petition questions whether liability for \"arranging\" disposal of hazardous substances can be imposed on a manufacturer who sells a product to a purchaser who causes contamination. The Supreme Court is addressing whether liability can be imposed on a manufacturer for selling a product that causes contamination, and whether joint and several liability can be imposed on multiple parties under CERCLA. This case raises important Superfund Act issues that the Court has previously denied certiorari on. The Supreme Court is considering a significant Superfund case involving joint and several liability under CERCLA. The case questions whether manufacturers can be held liable for contamination caused by their products. The Supreme Court is examining joint and several liability under CERCLA, which could impact the government's ability to recover cleanup costs. Burlington Northern's argument on reasonable basis for apportioning liability may affect the federal treasury's responsibility for cleanup costs. The Supreme Court is considering joint and several liability under CERCLA, which may affect the government's ability to recover cleanup costs. Industry is concerned about the liability of manufacturers in selling products that may lead to cleanup costs. The Navy sonar case is likely to generate headlines, but all cases accepted by the Supreme Court are important. The Supreme Court is considering cases with implications for joint and several liability under CERCLA, which could impact the government's ability to recover cleanup costs. Industry is worried about manufacturers' liability for products leading to cleanup costs. The Navy sonar case is expected to make headlines, but all cases accepted by the Supreme Court are significant. The environmental community is concerned about the direction the Roberts Court may take on environmental issues. The environmental side won in all five cases below, suggesting possible decisions going the other way in the Supreme Court. Four of the cases are from the Ninth Circuit, known for a high reversal rate in the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has voted against the environmental position in each of its 15 NEPA cases. The Supreme Court has consistently ruled against the environmental position in its NEPA cases. The current Court is less tolerant of regulation and more sympathetic to business concerns compared to previous decades. The increase in environmental cases this term may be due to random factors or a shift in the Court's certiorari-granting process. The increase in environmental cases this term may be due to random factors or a shift in the Court's certiorari-granting process. Some suggest conservative justices want to resolve environmental issues before potential new appointments by President Obama, while others believe skilled practitioners are increasing the likelihood of the Court accepting such cases. The Court continues to reject repeated petitions for certiorari in difficult cases, including issues related to the Endangered Species Act and the Clean Water Act. The Supreme Court has repeatedly rejected petitions for certiorari in cases involving the Clean Water Act, such as Rapanos v. United States, due to the lack of a clear majority rationale in the original decision causing confusion in lower courts. The Supreme Court's rejection of certiorari petitions in Clean Water Act cases like Rapanos v. United States has caused confusion in lower courts due to the lack of a clear majority rationale. This confusion would likely persist if the Court were to accept a post-Rapanos case now."
