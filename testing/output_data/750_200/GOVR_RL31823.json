    "content": "In January 2004, federal white-collar employees received a 1.5% annual pay adjustment and a 0.5% locality-based comparability payment under Executive Order 13322 by President George Bush. A larger pay adjustment of 4.1% for 2004 was included in the conference agreement for the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004 (H.R. 2673). H.R. 2989 provided a 4.1% pay adjustment to federal civilian employees, which was incorporated into H.R. 2673 as the first session of the 108th Congress was ending. In the first session of the 108th Congress, a 4.1% pay adjustment was provided to federal civilian employees through H.R. 2989, which was incorporated into H.R. 2673. The law, signed by President Bush on January 23, 2004, (P.L. 108-199), included an additional 2.1% pay adjustment. Executive Order 13332 issued on March 3, 2004, allocated the additional pay adjustment as an average 1.2% annual and 0.9% locality. The President issued Executive Order 13332 on March 3, 2004, providing an additional pay adjustment of 1.2% annual and 0.9% locality. OPM published revised salary tables for 2004 on March 4, 2004, available on their website. Federal white-collar employees receive annual pay adjustments and locality-based comparability payments under FEPCA. The Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act (FEPCA) of 1990 provides annual pay adjustments for federal white-collar employees, not based on cost-of-living measures. The adjustments were not fully implemented in some years, with reduced amounts provided in others. In January 2003, employees received a combined annual and locality pay adjustment of 4.1%. In January 2003, federal white-collar employees received a 4.1% combined annual and locality pay adjustment. In 2004, they also received a 4.1% adjustment. The report discusses the January 2004 annual adjustment and locality payments. The report discusses the January 2004 annual adjustment and locality payments for federal employees under various schedules. It does not cover salary adjustments for federal officials, judges, or Members of Congress. Annual adjustments for different positions are determined by agency heads and depend on Executive Schedule pay adjustments. Annual adjustments for contract appeals board members are based on the Employment Cost Index (ECI), which measures changes in private sector wages and salaries. The ECI shows that the annual across-the-board pay adjustment would be 2.7% in January 2004. The ECI indicates a 2.7% annual pay adjustment in January 2004, based on changes in private sector wages. FEPCA allows the President to propose an alternative plan in case of national emergency or economic conditions affecting welfare. President Bush issued an alternative plan for a 1.5% annual pay adjustment in January 2004, implemented through Executive Order 13322 on December 30, 2003. GS employees receive locality-based comparability payments, which may also extend to employees in certain positions. The Pay Agent determines pay cap levels for non-General Schedule employees receiving locality pay adjustments. OPM clarified limitations for blue-collar workers under the Federal Wage System in December 2001. For 2004, blue-collar pay adjustments are capped at the average percentage pay adjustment for federal white-collar employees. Blue-collar workers in Alaska, Hawaii, and other non-foreign areas will receive a pay adjustment no less than GS employees in the RUS pay area. Special rate employees receive the higher of special rate or locality payment, with law enforcement officers in Alaska and Hawaii receiving both special rates and locality pay. FEPCA established locality-based comparability payments to address pay disparities for federal employees in different areas. Law enforcement officers in Alaska and Hawaii receive special rates and locality pay. Employees in Alaska, Hawaii, and non-foreign areas receive a cost-of-living allowance instead of locality pay. The adjustments aim to equalize pay rates with non-federal workers in the same locality. The adjustment aims to equalize pay rates of federal workers with non-federal workers in the same locality. FEPCA allows the President to set an alternative level of locality-based comparability payments in case of a national emergency or serious economic conditions. A report must be submitted to Congress at least one month before the payments are due, explaining the reasons for the alternative payment level. President Bush issued an alternative plan on August 27, 2003, for a 0.5% locality pay adjustment in January 2004, implemented by Executive Order 13322 on December 30, 2003. Bureau of Labor Statistics conducts surveys to document non-federal pay rates in 32 pay areas nationwide. The surveys for federal pay rates in 32 pay areas nationwide are conducted under the National Compensation Survey program, approved by the Federal Salary Council and the Pay Agent. Survey results are submitted to OPM for comparison with non-federal pay rates. OPM compares federal and non-federal salaries by grade in each pay area to determine the average percentage pay gap. The target gap is adjusted to 5% annually to comply with FEPCA, which also mandates reducing the disparity between GS and non-federal salaries. The target gap between GS average salaries and non-federal average salaries is adjusted annually by OPM to comply with FEPCA. The goal is to close a certain percentage of this gap each year, starting with 20% in 1994 and increasing by 10% each year thereafter. However, the actual locality pay increases have been implemented at lower percentages, resulting in a slower reduction of the gap. The locality pay increase has been slowly reducing the gap between GS average salaries and non-federal average salaries. By January 2002, FEPCA specified that amounts payable could not be less than the full amount necessary to reduce the pay disparity to 5%. The locality pay increase has been narrowing the gap between GS average salaries and non-federal average salaries to 5%. Locality rates recommended by the Pay Agent to the President are based on pay gaps that are 22 months old by the adjustment date. NCS surveys were not used for determining some locality payments, with gaps determined using OCSP survey data. The NCS surveys are being phased in for the January 2004 locality payments. The March 2002 gaps were determined using OCSP survey data ranging from December 2000 to October 2001 for each pay area. Some pay areas had outdated data, with the largest pay areas having data from at least seven years ago. The Los Angeles data was from November 1995, while data for other pay areas ranged from January 1996 to November 1996. The \"Rest of the United States\" pay area data was aged to November 1996. The Federal Salary Council explained the methodology for determining pay gaps and aging BLS survey data to a common reference date of March 2002 before comparing it to GS pay data. The Federal Salary Council reported in March 2002 that the gap between GS average salaries and non-federal average salaries was 32.02%. To reduce this disparity to 5%, a 25.73% increase was recommended for 2004. Locality pay raises were suggested, ranging from 19.45% to 47.64% in different pay areas, with Washington, DC at 28.78%. The recommended locality pay raises for 2004 ranged from 19.45% to 47.64% in different pay areas, with Washington, DC at 28.78%. Comparing 2003 and 2004 locality payments showed increases from 11.90% to 25.23% in different areas. The nationwide average net pay increase would have been 15.15% in 2004. The council recommended that areas with pay gaps below the pay gap in RUS receive the same adjustment as RUS in the Washington, DC pay area. Areas with low publishability and pay gaps two-tenths of a percentage point or more below RUS for three surveys were to be dropped as surveyed discrete pay areas. The council recommended dropping areas with pay gaps below RUS in three surveys to redirect resources to new locations. They plan to reconsider dropping some areas in the future. The Council plans to review and potentially drop some pay areas to reallocate resources for increasing samples in other locations or adding new locality pay surveys. The basic criteria for determining pay areas were established in 1993 and remain unchanged. The Council will wait for new data before making any changes to locality pay area definitions. The Council plans to review and potentially drop some pay areas to reallocate resources for increasing samples in other locations or adding new locality pay surveys. The criteria for determining pay areas established in 1993 will remain unchanged until new data is reviewed. The council recommended an exception for Barnstable County, MA, which is seeking to become part of the Boston pay area due to its unique position as the only county on the eastern seaboard not in a separate locality pay area. The Council recommended including Barnstable County, MA in the Boston locality pay area in 2004 to address its unique position as the only county on the eastern seaboard not in a separate locality pay area. The Council recommended including Barnstable County, MA in the Boston locality pay area in 2004 to address its unique position as the only county on the eastern seaboard not in a separate locality pay area. Additionally, St. Mary's County, MD was recommended to be included in the Washington, DC-Baltimore, MD pay area for 2004. Santa Barbara County, CA has been included in the Los Angeles pay area since 1994, and New London, CT has been included in the Hartford, CT pay area since 1998. The council recommended that New London, CT, and Santa Barbara County, CA continue to be included in their respective pay areas for 2004, as their employment levels fell below the required threshold. New census data will soon impact locality pay area definitions. The council recommended including Monterey County, CA in the San Francisco pay area in 2004, as it meets the criteria. A major review of the locality pay program is planned for 2003 with new census data affecting locality pay area definitions in the future. Monterey County, CA was recommended to be included in the San Francisco pay area in 2004. Rhode Island, due to its small size, was designated as part of the Boston pay area in 2001 under the \"Full State\" criteria. Rhode Island is considered as a single county and meets the criteria for continued inclusion in the Boston pay area in 2004. The criteria for an installation in a pay area include having at least 1,000 GS employees, with duty stations within 10 miles of the boundary area, and a significant number of employees commuting. The majority of GS employees at Edwards Air Force Base must be within 10 miles of the survey boundary area. The base no longer meets employment criteria, but it was recommended to continue being included in the Los Angeles pay area in 2004. The council recommended improvements in the BLS National Compensation Survey program. The council recommended five improvements in the BLS National Compensation Survey program to the Pay Agent in 2001. In 2004, a progress report was provided, with the use of a three-factor evaluation system for federal grade levels in non-federal jobs surveyed. OPM developed a four-factor system, successfully tested by BLS. OPM has completed development of a four-factor evaluation system for surveys, successfully tested by BLS. BLS will phase the new approach into surveys in December 2003. BLS has designed an econometric model to estimate salaries for non-randomly selected jobs. OPM formed an interagency working group to match federal job classifications with the new Standard Occupational Classification System. OPM formed an interagency working group to develop a crosswalk between Federal job classifications and the new Standard Occupational Classification System. BLS utilized this crosswalk and March 2001 GS employment weights for data this year. Improvements are expected in the crosswalk, with OPM providing updated GS employment information annually. Grade supervisory occupations based on the highest level of work supervised, adjusting the grade level accordingly. BLS and Pay Agent staff have devised a new approach for grading based on the level of supervision. BLS and Pay Agent staff have designed a new approach for grading supervisory jobs based on the highest level of work supervised. Final tests of the new approach will be conducted in the fall, with implementation planned for December 2003. Criteria have been developed to identify and exclude jobs classified above GS-15 in government, with methods in place to exclude non-Federal jobs above this level. The council's report on 2004 locality payments recommended these changes. The council recommended excluding jobs above GS-15 from data delivered to the Pay Agent this year due to concerns about the reliability of NCS data. Further implementation of NCS data should be conditioned on BLS implementing improvements identified by the Council. Additional resources should be allocated to increase sample sizes in localities with significant pay gaps. The Council recommended allocating additional resources to BLS to increase sample sizes in localities with significant pay gaps, particularly where NCS data shows a gap more than 5 percentage points lower than OCSP data. Metropolitan areas for locality pay are determined using OMB definitions, which automatically change when OMB revises definitions. On April 22, 2003, OPM published regulations stating that locality pay areas no longer change automatically with metropolitan definitions revisions. OPM published final regulations on April 22, 2003, stating that locality pay areas no longer change automatically with revisions to metropolitan area definitions. OMB revised definitions for Metropolitan Statistical Areas on June 6, 2003, but OPM advised that it would not immediately impact the General Schedule locality pay program. OPM later modified the GS locality pay regulations to align with the former OMB statistical definitions. The Federal Salary Council and the President's Pay Agent reviewed new statistical area definitions in 2003, different from those used since the 1990s in the locality pay program. The concept of 'Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Areas' was considered. The Federal Salary Council and the President's Pay Agent reviewed new statistical area definitions in 2003, introducing 'Micropolitan Statistical Areas' and 'Combined Statistical Areas [CSAs]' in place of the previous 'Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Areas'. Changes include no longer using population density as a criterion for outlying counties and adjusting commuting threshold levels. The Federal Salary Council working group discussed the new OMB definitions and commuting patterns in two public meetings. The Federal Salary Council working group recommended considering new MSA definitions for the locality pay program, requesting further study before making any decisions. The report suggested using CSAs and MSAs for locality pay areas, excluding New England. The Federal Salary Council working group recommended adopting new MSA definitions for locality pay areas, excluding New England. This would result in 83 additional counties being added to existing metropolitan locality pay areas and 10 counties being excluded. The changes in MSAs are attributed to demographic shifts. The working group recommended adopting new MSA definitions for locality pay areas, including changes in pay area definitions and merging certain pay areas to save resources for surveying other areas. The working group recommended merging pay areas with pay gaps below RUS into RUS to save resources for surveying other areas. The council adopted the recommendations in its report to the Pay Agent, which tentatively approved them in its report to the President for the January 2005 pay adjustments. OPM will publish proposed changes on locality pay in the Federal Register in 2004 and seek public comments. An amendment to H.R. 2989 was agreed to by the House of Representatives in September. In September 2003, an amendment to the Transportation and Treasury Appropriations Bill was agreed to by the House of Representatives, stating that funds in the bill cannot be used to disestablish any pay locality. Representative Sam Farr withdrew a similar amendment during the bill's markup, but later testified before the Federal Salary Council on the issue. Representative Farr testified before the Federal Salary Council about the impact on federal employees in Monterey County if it was not continued as part of the San Francisco locality pay area. Senator Jack Reed's similar amendment was agreed to by the Senate, ensuring funds in the bill cannot be used to disestablish any pay locality. The amendment in the Transportation/Treasury appropriations bill prevents the removal of any area from coverage under a locality pay area. This amendment was incorporated into the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004. The agreement for H.R. 2673, as part of the Transportation/Treasury bill, prohibits the implementation of regulations for locality pay areas in FY2004 that are inconsistent with the Federal Salary Council's recommendations. This provision was enacted as Section 644 of P.L. 108-199 on January 23, 2004. The Pay Agent submitted its annual report on locality payments for 2004 to the President on December 5, 2002. The Pay Agent recommended against implementing locality pay increases in January 2004 due to the national emergency and economic slowdown. They suggested exploring alternative approaches to federal employee compensation. The Pay Agent expressed concerns about the process of implementing locality pay increases for Federal employees in January 2004, citing issues with a one-size-fits-all approach. They estimated the cost of reducing pay disparity to 5% at $8.830 billion. The report did not delve further into these concerns. The Pay Agent provided necessary information in January 2004 to reduce the pay disparity to 5% as required by FEPCA. Table 1 shows the council's and Pay Agent's recommended locality payments for January 2004. The Pay Agent did not adopt the council's recommendation to include Barnstable County, Massachusetts in the Boston locality pay area. They believe changes should be made after reviewing new commuting patterns data and metropolitan area definitions. The Pay Agent implemented recommended improvements in the BLS National Compensation Survey Program, focusing on random job selection and GS grades assignment. They look forward to reviewing the results of the NCS data next year. The Pay Agent implemented improvements in the BLS National Compensation Survey Program, with selected survey jobs with supervisory duties to be introduced in December 2003. They look forward to reviewing the NCS data next year and encouraged expedited completion of remaining improvements. Pay rates are calculated based on GS schedule and locality adjustments. President George W. Bush's FY2004 budget proposed a 2.0% federal civilian pay adjustment, but did not specify how it would be allocated between annual and locality adjustments required by FEPCA in January 2004. The statutory annual pay adjustment required in January 2004 is 2.7%. President George W. Bush issued an alternative plan on August 27, 2003, to change the annual pay adjustment and locality-based comparability payments required by FEPCA in January 2004. The plan allowed for adjustments to be submitted to Congress by specific deadlines. President George W. Bush issued an alternative plan on August 27, 2003, to change the annual pay adjustment and locality-based comparability payments required by FEPCA. The plan called for a 2.0% pay adjustment in January 2004, with 1.5% allocated for annual pay and 0.5% for locality pay, costing about $2 billion. The implementation of the plan, outlined in Executive Order 13322 issued on December 30, 2003, aimed to save about $11 billion compared to the original FEPCA requirements. The President's alternative plan, implemented on December 30, 2003, included a $500 million Human Capital Performance Fund to reward high-performing employees. This fund was authorized by Section 1129 of P.L. 108-136, the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2004. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended an appropriation of $2.5 million for the fund. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended an appropriation of $2.5 million for the Human Capital Performance Fund in H.R. 2989, as reported on July 30, 2003. Funding was contingent upon legislation authorizing the fund within OPM. No funds would be available until the OPM Director approves a performance pay plan for an agency. The Senate Committee on Appropriations did not recommend an appropriation for the Human Capital Performance Fund, stating that such initiatives should be budgeted and administered within individual agencies. OPMDirector must notify relevant subcommittees of jurisdiction and obtain prior approval before implementing a performance pay plan for an agency. Annual reports on approved plans and obligated amounts are required. The Senate Committee on Appropriations did not recommend funding for the Human Capital Performance Fund, suggesting that such initiatives should be managed within individual agencies. However, the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004 included an appropriation of $1 million for the fund, with funding contingent upon certain conditions. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004 included an appropriation of $1 million for the Human Capital Performance Fund, with funding contingent upon the enactment of legislation to establish the fund within OPM. The OPM Director must approve an agency's performance pay plan before funds can be transferred to federal agencies for the fund's purposes. This provision was enacted in P.L. 108-199 on January 23, 2004. The President's alternative plan for a pay raise above 2 percent could lead to unfunded costs for agencies, potentially resulting in hiring freezes. Federal employee union representatives expressed disappointment with the 2.0% pay adjustment, while the National Commission on the Public Service recommended changes to the General Schedule. The National Commission on the Public Service recommended abolishing the General Schedule classification system due to the resources needed to maintain it and the constant tinkering required for equal pay. They proposed a broad-band system with fewer pay grades and wider salary ranges, allowing managers to determine individual pay based on competence. The National Commission on the Public Service recommended consolidating the 15 pay grades into six to eight broad bands with wide salary ranges. Pay banding systems are being implemented at various agencies, allowing managers to set individual pay based on competence and performance. Other agencies may adopt different systems. Pay parity provisions are included in legislation to align salaries with federal bank examiners. Parity provisions in legislation allow the SEC to raise salaries for certain employees to levels comparable to federal bank examiners. New HRM systems for civilian employees in the Departments of Homeland Security and Defense are authorized in separate acts. Changes to pay setting systems at both agencies are expected to include broad pay bands. The federal white-collar pay adjustment is considered annually by Congress. Changes to pay setting systems at both agencies are expected to include broad pay bands. The federal white-collar pay adjustment is considered annually by Congress, with adjustments set by Congress in previous years. Senator Paul Sarbanes and Representative Steny Hoyer introduced concurrent resolutions in 2003 regarding pay adjustments. In 2003, Senator Paul Sarbanes and Representative Steny Hoyer introduced resolutions in Congress calling for parity in pay adjustments between military and civilian employees. These resolutions are nonbinding and do not require the President's signature. Members of Congress from the Washington, DC area wrote letters to President Bush and Representatives regarding this issue. In 2003, Members of Congress urged support for equal pay raises for federal civilian employees and the military. The FY2004 budget proposes a 4.1% pay increase for the military and 2.0% for civilian employees. The House of Representatives passed the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for FY2004. The House of Representatives passed the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for FY2004 (H.Con.Res. 95) with a 215 to 212 vote. The resolution included language advocating for equal pay raises for civilian employees and the military. The Senate version (S.Con.Res. 23) also supported this language. The Senate Committee on the Budget reported the Budget (S.Con.Res. 23) on March 14, 2003, which included language supporting equal pay raises for civilian employees and the military. The Concurrent Budget Resolution serves as a framework for Congress to consider spending legislation, with recommendations on federal pay adjustments typically included in appropriations bills. The Department of Transportation Appropriations bill has been combined with the Transportation, Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations bill for the 108th Congress. The Departments of Transportation and Treasury and Independent Agencies Appropriations Bill, 2004 (H.R. 2989), proposes a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees, including those in the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security. The bill does not specify how the increase should be divided between annual and locality pay adjustments. The House Subcommittee on Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies approved the bill on July 11, 2003. The House Subcommittee approved H.R. 2989 with a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees. The bill was later favorably reported to the House of Representatives with the pay adjustment included. H.R. 2989, with a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees, was reported to the House by the House Appropriations Committee. The bill passed the House on September 9, 2003, despite opposition from the Bush Administration. The Administration proposed a 2.0% pay raise for all civilian employees, with a Human Capital Performance Fund for high-performing federal employees. DOD has different recruiting and retention needs for each group, and recent civilian pay raises have exceeded inflation. The Administration proposed a 2.0% pay raise for all civilian employees, with a Human Capital Performance Fund for high-performing federal employees. DOD has different recruiting and retention needs for each group, recent civilian pay raises have exceeded inflation. The Administration is concerned about unfunded civilian pay increases costing DOD $660 million and Government-wide $2.1 billion. The Statement of Administration Policy on H.R. 2989 expresses disappointment that the bill does not fund the President's request for a $500 million Human Capital Performance Fund. The bill does not fund the President's request for a $500 million Human Capital Performance Fund. The 4.1% pay adjustment exceeds inflation, statutory base pay increase, and private-sector pay increase. However, it does not address Federal employee turnover issues. Federal employees are generally satisfied with their pay rate, and the quit rate is at an all-time low of 1.7% per year. The 'quit rate' among Federal employees is at an all-time low of 1.7% per year, well below the private sector average. Providing a 4.1% pay adjustment for civilian employees in certain departments may limit their flexibility in designing new personnel and pay systems. S. 1589, the Senate version of the Transportation/Treasury appropriations bill, includes the 4.1% pay adjustment. The Senate Committee on Appropriations approved a 4.1% pay adjustment for civilian employees in certain departments. The full committee passed the bill with a 29-0 vote and reported it to the Senate. Senator Richard Shelby introduced an amendment during the consideration of the Transportation and Treasury appropriations bill. Senator Richard Shelby introduced an amendment to the Transportation and Treasury appropriations bill on October 23, 2003, which included a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees in various departments. The Senate passed the amended bill with a 91 to 3 vote. The Senate passed H.R. 2989, amended, on a 91 to 3 vote on October 23, 2003. The Federal Salary Council recommended a 4.1% pay adjustment, allocated as a 2.7% annual pay adjustment and a 1.4% locality pay adjustment. This adjustment was incorporated into the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2004 included a 4.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees, effective from January 1, 2004. The pay adjustment for federal civilian employees, effective from January 1, 2004, was funded within appropriated levels and signed into law by President Bush on January 23, 2004. The Consolidated Appropriations Act provided an additional 2.1% pay adjustment. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2004 provided a 2.1% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees. President Bush's Executive Order 13332 allocated the additional amount as 1.2% annual and 0.9% locality. The cost of the 4.1% pay adjustment is approximately $4.1 billion. OPM issued revised salary tables for 2004 on its website the next day. The Federal Salary Council and Pay Agent recommendations for the January 2005 pay adjustments are also discussed. The Federal Salary Council and Pay Agent recommendations for the January 2005 pay adjustments are discussed in CRS Report RL32355, Federal White-Collar Pay: FY2005 Salary Adjustments. Congress could examine ways to amend FEPCA to reduce the disparity between non-federal and federal salaries to 5%. FEPCA aims to reduce the pay gap between non-federal and federal salaries to 5%, but as of 2004, the average gap is 25.73%. The Federal Salary Council and the Pay Agent report a pay disparity of 25.73% between non-federal and federal salaries in 2004. Concerns have been raised about the flawed methodology for setting federal pay adjustments since FEPCA's enactment in 1993. Despite criticisms, no changes have been proposed. Despite concerns about the flawed methodology for setting federal pay adjustments, no proposals were made to change FEPCA. The Bureau of Labor Statistics surveys were not approved for use in determining locality payments for 2000-2003, leading to the aging of previous survey data for this purpose. In P.L. 106-554, Congress directed the President's Pay Agent to prepare a report on the situation. In P.L. 106-554, Congress directed the President's Pay Agent to prepare a report on methodological concerns regarding federal pay adjustments. The Pay Agent reported to Congress in May 2001 and highlighted the need for improvements to the survey methodology. The Office of Personnel Management issued a white paper in April 2002 discussing the review of current policies and the necessity for more flexibility in setting General Schedule pay. The Office of Personnel Management issued a white paper in April 2002 on compensation, highlighting the need for more flexibility in setting General Schedule pay. A November 2002 study by the Congressional Budget Office compared federal General Schedule employees' salaries with nonfederal employees in similar jobs, revealing that federal employees in certain occupations were paid less than their private sector counterparts. The Congressional Budget Office found that about 85 percent of federal employees were paid less than comparable jobs in private firms, with a pay gap of more than 20 percent. However, around 30 percent of federal employees in technical and clerical occupations had salaries higher than those in the private sector. Overall, technical and clerical jobs showed smaller pay differences, with about three-quarters of federal employees in these occupations having salaries within 10 percent of private sector levels. The Congressional Budget Office found that 85 percent of federal employees were paid less than private sector jobs, with a pay gap of over 20 percent. However, 30 percent of federal employees in technical and clerical roles had salaries higher than private sector counterparts. The CBO noted concerns about the federal pay system, stating that it does not allow for variation in pay raises by occupation. This could result in employees in professional and administrative roles receiving smaller pay raises than needed to match private sector salaries, while those in technical and clerical roles may receive higher pay raises than necessary. Even if fully implemented, the current federal pay system fails to provide comparable pay to nonfederal jobs. Granting the same percentage raise to all workers results in above-market salaries for some and below-market salaries for others. Jobs with the greatest pay disadvantage for federal workers are increasing in the workforce, with professional and administrative roles growing from 41% to 56% from 1985 to 2000. Federal employment in professional and administrative occupations increased from 41% to 56% of total federal civilian employment from 1985 to 2000. The cost of fully implementing FEPCA is a concern, with estimated locality-based comparability payments of $8.830 billion in January 2004. The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) and the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU) advocate for pay parity between federal civilian employees and the uniformed military. The AFGE and NTEU endorse pay parity between federal civilian employees and the military, criticizing the President's proposal as inadequate and disregarding FEPCA. AFGE questions the methodology used to determine federal pay comparability with the private sector. The methodological problems with FEPCA implementation have been a recurring issue, with concerns now extending to the Employment Cost Index component. Bush has been trying to eliminate the locality component of federal pay for the past two years. The Pay Agent recommended pay increases for January 2004, but due to the national emergency and economic slowdown, they advised against allowing locality pay increases to take effect. The Pay Agent recommended pay increases for January 2004, but due to the national emergency and economic slowdown, U.S. President Bush decided against allowing locality pay increases to take effect in January 2004. Executive Order 13322 provided a 1.5% annual pay adjustment and a 0.5% locality-based comparability payment, while Executive Order 13332 provided an additional 2.1% pay adjustment. Executive Order 13332, published in the Federal Register on March 8, 2004, includes a 2.1% pay adjustment with a 1.2% annual adjustment and 0.9% locality-based comparability payment. The pay rates for 2004 are calculated by increasing the basic General Schedule (GS) by the annual adjustment percentage and then adding the locality payment. The resulting pay rates are compared with 2003 rates to determine the net increase in pay for 2004. Salary tables for 2004 can be found on the OPM website. MSA stands for Metropolitan Statistical Area and CMSA stands for Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area. The net increase in pay for 2004 is calculated by adjusting the basic General Schedule (GS) with a 2.1% pay adjustment, including a 1.2% annual adjustment and 0.9% locality-based comparability payment. Salary tables for 2004 can be found on the OPM website, with MSA referring to Metropolitan Statistical Area and CMSA to Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area."
