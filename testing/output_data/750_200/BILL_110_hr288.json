    "content": "The \"Notch Baby Act of 2007\" establishes a new guaranteed minimum primary insurance amount for those eligible during a transitional period. Section 215(a) of the Social Security Act is amended to include provisions for individuals eligible for old-age insurance benefits between 1978 and 1989. The primary insurance amount is calculated by adding the individual's amount with any applicable transitional increase amount. The primary insurance amount for individuals eligible for old-age insurance benefits is calculated by adding the individual's amount with any applicable transitional increase amount, which is determined based on the excess under former law and the applicable percentage in relation to the year of eligibility. The applicable percentage for individuals becoming eligible for benefits in different years is as follows: 1979 or 1980 - 60 percent, 1981 or 1982 - 35 percent, 1983 or 1984 - 30 percent, 1985 or 1986 - 25 percent, 1987 or 1988 - 10 percent. In 1985 or 1986, the applicable former law primary insurance amount exceeds the individual's primary insurance amount by 25 percent. The term 'applicable former law primary insurance amount' refers to the individual's primary insurance amount calculated under specific conditions outlined in the law. This calculation excludes certain provisions and modifications that would otherwise apply. The individual's primary insurance amount is determined by specific conditions outlined in the law, excluding certain provisions and modifications. Subsection (b)(4) does not apply, and section 215(b) as in effect in December 1978 applies with certain limitations on computation base years. The primary insurance amount for an individual is determined based on specific conditions outlined in the law, excluding certain provisions and modifications. This paragraph applies only if it results in a higher primary insurance amount than computed under paragraph (4)(B) without this provision. The effective date and related rules are outlined in Section 3. The amendments made by this Act are effective as if they were part of the Social Security Amendments of 1977, with no benefit increases before January 2007. Individual entitled to benefits in December 2006 may have their benefits recomputed to reflect increases. The Commissioner of Social Security shall recompute monthly insurance benefits for individuals entitled to benefits in December 2006 under the Social Security Act, based on specific criteria. The Commissioner of Social Security will recalculate monthly insurance benefits for individuals entitled to benefits in December 2006, considering the amendments made by this Act."
