    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Water Advanced Technologies for Efficient Resource Use Act of 2015\". It includes a section on WaterSense. The WaterSense program established within the Environmental Protection Agency aims to promote water efficient products, buildings, and landscapes to reduce water use, strain on water infrastructure, conserve energy, and preserve water resources for future generations through voluntary labeling. The WaterSense program promotes water efficient products, buildings, and landscapes through voluntary labeling and public outreach to reduce water use and enhance product performance. The WaterSense program aims to enhance public awareness, establish performance standards for labeled products, and emphasize proper installation by certified professionals. WaterSense certification guidelines require installation, maintenance, and audits by certified professionals to ensure optimal performance and preserve the integrity of the label. Criteria are regularly reviewed and updated every four years, with data on production made available to the public. The WaterSense program aims to regularly provide summary data on labeled products, estimate water and energy savings, and gather public input before establishing or revising categories. The WaterSense program seeks input from the public and interested parties before making changes to categories, specifications, or criteria, providing notice of any revisions along with explanations and responses to comments. The WaterSense program seeks public input and feedback before making changes to categories, specifications, or criteria, providing explanations and responses to comments. Changes must be implemented with appropriate lead time before the effective date, considering manufacturing, marketing, training, and distribution processes. The WaterSense program seeks public input and feedback before making changes to categories, specifications, or criteria, providing explanations and responses to comments. Changes must be implemented with appropriate lead time before the effective date, considering manufacturing, marketing, training, and distribution processes for the specific product, building, and landscape, or service category addressed. It also encourages voluntary approaches like labeling waterless devices and promoting reuse, reclamation, and recycling technologies to improve water efficiency in various sectors. Authorization of Appropriations: $7,500,000 for fiscal year 2016, $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2017, $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2018, and $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2019 and beyond, adjusted for inflation, to support this section. Federal procurement of water efficient products. In this section, \"agency\" is defined as per section 7902(a) of title 5, US Code. \"WaterSense product or service\" refers to items rated for water efficiency under the WaterSense program. The \"WaterSense program\" is established by section 2 of this Act. \"FEMP designated product\" is a product designated under the Federal Energy Management Program of the Department of Energy. The term \"product\" refers to a product designated under the Federal Energy Management Program as highly efficient. It excludes water consuming products for combat missions and those already covered by Federal procurement regulations. Under section 553 of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act, agencies are required to procure WaterSense or FEMP designated products for water consumption. WaterSense plumbing products should be installed by certified plumbers or contractors. Certification guidelines do not exist for WaterSense products, but they should be installed, maintained, and audited by a WaterSense-certified irrigation professional for optimal performance. Agencies are required to procure WaterSense or FEMP designated products for water consumption, which should be installed by licensed plumbers or contractors. Exceptions to this requirement can be made if a product is found not to be cost-effective over its lifespan. The head of an agency must ensure that WaterSense or FEMP designated products are cost-effective over their lifespan or reasonably available. Procurement specifications for water-consuming products must be included in all agency procurements. The head of an agency must incorporate water-saving measures into procurement specifications for all water-consuming products and systems, including evaluation criteria for WaterSense and FEMP designated products. Additional measures for reducing agency water consumption, such as water reuse, should also be considered. The General Services Administration and the Defense Logistics Agency must include WaterSense products and FEMP designated products in federal catalogs. Only these water-efficient products should be supplied by the agencies. The General Services Administration and the Defense Logistics Agency are required to supply only WaterSense products or FEMP designated products, unless specified otherwise in writing. The Environmental Protection Agency will issue regulations within 180 days to implement the requirements for energy, water, and wastewater cost savings of products. SEC. 4. EARLY ADOPTER WATER EFFICIENT PRODUCTS INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. The section defines key terms like \"Administrator,\" \"eligible entity,\" and \"incentive program\" for a program that provides financial incentives for residential water efficiency products. Residential water efficient products and services are eligible for financial incentives through a program like WaterSense. Categories of water efficient products and services eligible for incentives include faucets, irrigation technologies, point-of-use water treatment devices, reuse technologies, toilets, and showerheads. Products must be certified by a third party to qualify as residential water efficient products. Third-party certification is required for a product to be considered a residential water efficient product. This involves testing by an accredited body, certification of meeting performance requirements, and authorization to use the WaterSense label. The term \"State\" refers to various states and territories of the United States. The \"WaterSense program\" is a program established by the Act. Entities eligible for allocation must meet certain requirements. Entities eligible for allocation under the WaterSense program must establish an incentive program for water-efficient products, submit an application, and provide satisfactory assurances to the Administrator. Entities eligible for WaterSense program allocation must establish a water-efficient product incentive program, submit required information to the Administrator, and assure funds will supplement existing resources. The Administrator determines allocation amounts based on population served and targeted population of the entity. Entities eligible for WaterSense program allocation must provide information on their population served, targeted population for incentive programs, effectiveness of existing programs, and any unused prior year's allocation. Entities eligible for WaterSense program allocation can use funds to cover 50% of incentive program costs and are encouraged to implement fixture recycling programs. Financial incentives can be issued to consumers meeting program requirements. The entity eligible for the WaterSense program allocation can issue financial incentives directly to consumers or delegate administration to other organizations. The incentive amount is determined based on various factors, including the allocation to the entity and available tax incentives for water-efficient products. The WaterSense program allows organizations to provide financial incentives to consumers for purchasing water-efficient products. The incentives are based on factors like tax incentives, consumer behavior change, and expenditures for product installation. Authorization of appropriations for the program includes $50 million for 2016, $100 million for 2017, $150 million for 2018, $100 million for 2019, and $50 million for 2020. SEC. 5. EARLY ADOPTER WATER EFFICIENT PRODUCTS INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. Amends the Internal Revenue Code to establish an incentive program for water-efficient products. The Water Advanced Technologies for Efficient Resource Use Act of 2015 excludes certain amounts from an individual's gross income. No deduction or credit is allowed for any expenditure equal to the excluded amount. The adjusted basis of property is reduced by the excluded amount provided for that property. The Water Advanced Technologies for Efficient Resource Use Act of 2015 excludes certain amounts from an individual's gross income and reduces the adjusted basis of property by the excluded amount. A conforming amendment is made to the table of sections for part III of subchapter B of chapter 1 of the Code. The Water Advanced Technologies for Efficient Resource Use Act of 2015 includes an early adopter water efficient products incentive program. The amendments made by this Act will apply to taxable years after its enactment."
