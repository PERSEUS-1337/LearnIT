    "content": "Countervailing duty laws aim to help domestic industries affected by subsidized imports in the U.S. market. Relief is provided through additional import duties equal to the estimated subsidy amount. Two conditions must be met for relief: the International Trade Commission must find material injury to the domestic industry, and the International Trade Administration must confirm the subsidized imports. The International Trade Administration (ITA) must find that the domestic industry is materially injured by subsidized imports. In a 2007 investigation on coated free sheet (CFS) paper from China, the ITA determined that subsidies could be identified in China despite previous beliefs about nonmarket economy countries. In 2007, the ITA found subsidies in China for coated free sheet paper despite previous beliefs about nonmarket economy countries. China-specific determination not applicable to other NME countries. ITA designates countries as nonmarket economies based on U.S. law. The ITA designates nonmarket economy (NME) countries based on factors like currency convertibility, wage rates, government control of production, and resource allocation. Other relevant factors may also be considered. The ITA designates NME countries based on factors like currency convertibility, wage rates, government control of production, and resource allocation. ITA-designated NME countries include Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, China, Georgia, Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam. The ITA made the determination not to apply CVD action to NME countries in 1983-1984. China, designated an NME country in 1983, is the United States' second largest trading partner with a significant trade deficit of $227 billion in 2009. There are concerns about the impact of Chinese imports on U.S. industries and workers, leading some in Congress to consider using trade remedy laws against Chinese products. Some in Congress support increased use of U.S. trade remedy laws against Chinese products due to concerns about China's alleged illegal subsidy programs. U.S. domestic producers have long claimed to be adversely impacted by China's subsidizing of industries, with limited recourse since the 1984 ITA ruling. China is the main target of U.S. antidumping actions, with over 80 duty orders in place as of August 12, 2010, and higher duty amounts for Chinese imports. The ITA has over 80 AD duty orders in place as of August 12, 2010, with higher duty amounts for Chinese imports. Concerns include China's undervalued currency affecting U.S. trade deficit and manufacturing sectors. The undervalued Chinese currency has contributed to the U.S. trade deficit and harmed U.S. production in sectors like apparel and furniture. Alleged currency manipulation by China has sparked congressional interest in countervailing actions against Chinese imports. The ITA determined China's NME classification in 1983 and reaffirmed it in 2006 during an investigation on lined paper. U.S. law states that a country remains an NME until specifically revoked. The ITA determined China as a nonmarket economy country in 1983 and reaffirmed it in 2006 during an investigation on lined paper. The NME designation for China may only be used for a limited time according to its WTO accession package. The United States and other WTO members can no longer use nonmarket economy methodology for price comparability in CVD or AD investigations after December 11, 2016. The US had two countervailing duty laws in force during the 1983-1984 investigations. During the 1983-1984 investigations, the United States had two countervailing duty laws in force. These laws allowed for the imposition of a countervailing duty equal to the amount of subsidization on dutiable products subsidized in their country of origin. One of the laws required a finding that the subsidized imports have caused or threatened to cause injury to a U.S. domestic industry. The earlier law, Section 303 of the Tariff Act of 1930, was a modified version of a countervailing law initially enacted by the Tariff Act of 1897. The countervailing duty law in force during the 1983-1984 investigations was a modified version of a law initially enacted in 1897. It applied to products from countries not \"under the Agreement,\" which included countries subject to the GATT Subsidies and Countervailing Code or with similar obligations to the US. Section 303 of the Tariff Act of 1930, repealed in January 1995, was part of these laws. Section 303 of the Tariff Act of 1930, repealed in January 1995, provided for countervailing duties without injury determination, while the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 added broader country applicability provisions. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 added comprehensive provisions to the Tariff Act of 1930, implementing the international Subsidies and Countervailing Code agreed upon in multilateral trade negotiations under the GATT. This legislation required the assessment of countervailing duties when a country or private entity provided a subsidy. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 added provisions to the Tariff Act of 1930, requiring countervailing duties when a country or private entity provided a subsidy. The URAA repealed certain sections and amended the countervailing duty law to address subsidies causing injury to US industries. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 amended the countervailing duty law to address subsidies causing injury to US industries. This included provisions for countervailing investigations of subsidized imports from countries not under the Subsidies Agreement. Investigations of carbon steel wire rod imports from Czechoslovakia and Poland were initiated in 1983. Duty investigations of carbon steel wire rod imports from Czechoslovakia and Poland were initiated in 1983 based on petitions alleging public benefits received by manufacturers in both countries. Allegations included bounties, grants, multiple exchange rate systems, and industry-specific trade conversion coefficients in Czechoslovakia. The investigations into carbon steel wire rod imports from Czechoslovakia and Poland in 1983 revealed public benefits received by manufacturers in both countries, including multiple exchange rate systems and industry-specific trade conversion coefficients. Czechoslovakia had a partial hard-currency retention program and tax exemptions for foreign trade earnings, while Poland provided price equalization payments for losses incurred due to foreign sales below domestic prices. The determinations on common issues were mostly identical between the two countries, with minor differences. The ITA found Czechoslovakia and Poland to be \"countries not under the Agreement\" and conducted countervailing procedures without determining injury. Both countries were considered nonmarket economy (NME) countries, but the question of whether the countervailing duty law applies to NME countries had not been resolved. The countervailing duty law's application to nonmarket economy countries was unresolved, but the ITA determined that these countries are not exempt from the law in two carbon steel wire rod cases. The ITA found that nonmarket economy countries are not exempt from the countervailing duty law, based on Section 303 which applies to any country. Despite initial interpretation differences, the ITA is inclined to review each case individually before excluding nonmarket economies from the law. The ITA, despite initial inclinations, is not excluding nonmarket economies from the countervailing duty law without further review. They are focusing on prices as key elements of subsidization, noting that in nonmarket economies, prices are set by central planners without regard to economic value, reflecting neither scarcity nor abundance. In nonmarket economies, prices are set by central planners without regard to economic value, reflecting neither scarcity nor abundance. The ITA analyzed alleged subsidization programs to determine if they would confer a subsidy in a market economy and if the conclusion would be different for a nonmarket economy. The ITA concluded that multiple exchange rates and currency retention were factors in the analysis. The ITA analyzed alleged subsidization programs to determine if they would confer a subsidy in a market economy and if the conclusion would be different for a nonmarket economy. The ITA concluded that multiple exchange rates, currency retention schemes, trade conversion coefficients, and price equalization payments do not confer a bounty or grant in market or nonmarket economies. The Polish adjustment coefficient program did not constitute a bounty or grant within the meaning of the law, and the agency had not received sufficient timely information on the Czechoslovak tax exemption program to make a determination. The ITA preliminarily determined that Congress did not exempt NME countries from the CVD law. The ITA concluded that alleged practices in Czechoslovakia and Poland did not provide bounties or grants under the CVD law. Congress did not exempt NME countries from the law, leading to continued investigations into the final phase focusing on the application of the CVD law to nonmarket economy countries. The ITA concluded that Congress never directly addressed the application of countervailing duty law to NME countries in the carbon steel wire rod cases. In 1979, the CVD law was restructured, focusing on unfair pricing legislation related to dumping by NME countries. The Trade Act of 1974 included provisions for injurious imports from \"State-controlled-economy\" or \"Communist\" countries, but did not address countervailing action. Congress did not directly address the application of countervailing duty law to NME countries in the carbon steel wire rod cases. The CVD law was restructured in 1979 to focus on unfair pricing legislation related to dumping by NME countries. Congress recognized the need for special remedial legislation for State-controlled-economy countries due to the ineffectiveness of traditional fair-trade remedies. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 restructured the CVD law to address unfair pricing related to dumping by NME countries. The legislation allowed for regulation of unfairly priced imports from NME countries under either antidumping or countervailing duty legislation. The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 restructured the CVD law to address unfair pricing related to dumping by NME countries. The legislation allowed for regulation of imports from NME countries under either antidumping or countervailing duty legislation. The ITA consulted with various sources concluding that it is difficult to identify and quantify subsidies in NMEs due to the lack of market reference points. The countervailing duty law requires measuring a resource transfer from the state to the producer, which is challenging in nonmarket economies. The ITA concluded that identifying and measuring resource transfers from the state to producers in nonmarket economies is challenging, making it difficult to determine subsidies. It was determined that NMEs like Czechoslovakia and Poland operate on nonmarket cost or pricing structures, hindering the reflection of merchandise value in sales. The ITA determined that Czechoslovakia and Poland were NMEs operating on nonmarket cost or pricing structures, leading to final negative countervailing duty determinations. Two U.S. chemical manufacturers filed petitions alleging subsidization of potassium chloride imported from the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union. The ITA rescinded two potassium chloride investigations and dismissed petitions filed on March 30, 1984, alleging subsidization of potash from the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union. This decision was made after determining that bounties or grants cannot be found in non-market economy countries. Since then, no new countervailing investigations have been initiated. The ITA dismissed petitions regarding subsidization of potash from non-market economy countries and has not initiated new countervailing investigations since then. However, a specialized exception was made for a countervailing duty investigation of Ceiling and Oscillating Fans Imported from China based on a petition filed in 1991. The petition in the Chinese fan CVD case claimed that the Chinese fan industry was a market-oriented industry with dependable self-provided data, based on the concept of market-oriented industry introduced by ITA in antidumping investigations of imports from NME countries. The petitioners in the Chinese fan CVD case claimed that the industry could be objectively subjected to a countervailing investigation. The ITA concluded in its preliminary investigation that the industry cannot be considered an MOI due to non-market-determined input prices but did not rescind the investigation. In the final phase, the ITA found that prices of significant inputs are not market-determined. The ITA concluded that the PC fans industry is not an MOI and cannot be subjected to countervailing duty law. The ITA issued a final negative determination in the case, leading to a challenge in the U.S. Court of International Trade. The court held that countervailing duty law applies to countries with nonmarket conditions. The U.S. Court of International Trade consolidated suits challenging countervailing duty law application to nonmarket economies. On July 30, 1985, the court reversed carbon steel wire rod cases, remanded them to ITA, and ordered potash cases investigations to resume. The court addressed ITA's grounds for nonapplicability of countervailing duty law. The U.S. Court of International Trade reversed carbon steel wire rod cases and ordered potash cases investigations to resume. The court addressed ITA's grounds for nonapplicability of countervailing duty law, including the view that subsidies cannot be conferred in a nonmarket economy. The U.S. Court of International Trade reversed carbon steel wire rod cases and ordered potash cases investigations to resume. The court disagreed with the ITA's interpretation of the countervailing duty law, stating that subsidies can exist in nonmarket economies. The court emphasized that the law applies to any country without exemptions. The U.S. Court of International Trade disagreed with the ITA's interpretation of the countervailing duty law, stating that subsidies can exist in nonmarket economies. The court emphasized that the law applies to any country without exemptions, including political entities with nonmarket economies. The U.S. Court of International Trade disagreed with the ITA's interpretation of the countervailing duty law, stating that subsidies can exist in nonmarket economies. The court emphasized that the law applies to any country without exemptions, including political entities with nonmarket economies. The CIT criticized the ITA's argument that NME countries were exempt from the CVD law, stating that the agency has the authority to investigate deviations regardless of the form of the economy. The U.S. Court of International Trade disagreed with the ITA's interpretation of the countervailing duty law, stating that subsidies can exist in nonmarket economies. The court emphasized that the law applies to any country without exemptions, including political entities with nonmarket economies. The CIT criticized the ITA's argument that NME countries were exempt from the CVD law, stating that the agency has the authority to investigate deviations regardless of the form of the economy. Additionally, the court pointed out that Congress' silence on the applicability of the CVD law to NME countries does not exclude them from its provisions, as other remedial measures like antidumping law are meant for different trade issues. The GATT Subsidies and Countervailing Code allows countries to choose between subsidy law and antidumping law for imports from state-controlled economies. The U.S. Court of International Trade disagreed with the ITA's interpretation of countervailing duty law, stating that subsidies can exist in nonmarket economies. The court emphasized that the law applies to any country without exemptions, including political entities with nonmarket economies. Additionally, the court pointed out that Congress' silence on the applicability of the CVD law to NME countries does not exclude them from its provisions. The GATT Subsidies and Countervailing Code allows countries to choose between subsidy law and antidumping law for imports from state-controlled economies. The U.S. Court of International Trade disagreed with the ITA's interpretation of countervailing duty law, stating that subsidies can exist in nonmarket economies. The court emphasized that the law applies to any country without exemptions, including political entities with nonmarket economies. The court implicitly challenged administrative actions that were contrary to law and attempted to amend countervailing law by administrative fiat. The U.S. government appealed the CIT decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which reviewed the legislative history and development of relevant trade remedy laws, concluding that the CVD statute had remained substantially unchanged. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reviewed the legislative history of countervailing duty laws and found that the statute had remained substantially unchanged since 1897. The court could not determine if the statute applied to nonmarket economies due to undefined terms in the law. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reviewed countervailing duty laws and found that Congress did not exclude nonmarket economies. The court had to determine if the statute would have applied to nonmarket economies in 1897. The court concluded that economic incentives provided by the Soviet Union and East Germany were relevant in the potash case. The appellate court ruled that the economic incentives provided by the Soviet Union and East Germany for their potash exports to the United States did not qualify as bounties or grants under the countervailing duty law. The court upheld the ITA's discretion in determining the existence of bounties or grants under the law. The Court of Appeals overturned the CIT's decision regarding the ITA's final CVD determinations in wire rod cases and potash cases, citing lack of jurisdiction due to untimely filing of the complaint. The U.S. Court of Appeals overturned the CIT's decision on the ITA's final CVD determinations in wire rod and potash cases due to lack of jurisdiction from untimely filing of the complaint. Congress reacted with H.R. 3 of the 100th Congress, proposing the application of countervailing duty law to nonmarket economy countries if subsidies can be identified and measured by the ITA. The proposed statute in H.R. 3 of the 100th Congress aimed to apply countervailing duty law to countries where subsidies can be identified and measured by the ITA. Procedural provisions included an injury determination requirement by the U.S. International Trade Commission. Companion bills S. 770 and H.R. 1687 were also introduced for the same purpose. In the 103rd and 104th Congresses, the application of countervailing duty law to non-market economy (NME) countries was addressed. Legislation expanded the definition of \"countervailable subsidy\" to NME countries and prescribed the use of a surrogate market-economy country method for determining subsidy amounts. In the 106th through 108th Congresses, bills were introduced to apply countervailing duty law to non-market economy (NME) countries for investigations of subsidies provided after the enactment of the respective act. In the 109th Congress, bills were introduced to apply countervailing duty law to subsidized imports from non-market economy (NME) countries for petitions filed after the enactment of the respective act. In the 109th Congress, bills were introduced to apply countervailing duty law to subsidized imports from non-market economy (NME) countries for petitions filed after the enactment of the respective act, such as the Overseas Subsidies Act of 2005 and H.R. 1216. Additional provisions were included in broader trade-remedial legislation introduced in July 2005. H.R. 3306 focused on trade issues with China and extended countervailing action to all NME countries. H.R. 1498 aimed to address foreign exchange-rate manipulation by China. Several bills in the 110th Congress aimed to apply countervailing duty law to NME countries, triggered by alleged foreign exchange-rate manipulation by China. In the 110th Congress, bills were introduced to apply countervailing duties to nonmarket economies like China. In the 111th Congress, bills like H.R. 496 and H.R. 499 sought to specifically apply countervailing duties to nonmarket economies. The bills introduced in the 111th Congress aim to apply countervailing duties to nonmarket economies without considering ownership, direct or indirect subsidy provision, or economic reforms. The administering authority is not required to consider the subsidy's effect in determining its existence. The bills also prevent the ITA from considering market factors. The bills introduced in the 111th Congress aim to apply countervailing duties to nonmarket economies without considering ownership, direct or indirect subsidy provision, or economic reforms. The administering authority is not required to consider the effect of the subsidy in determining its existence. The bills also prevent the ITA from considering market factors and assign individual rates to companies in NME countries. Additionally, they provide a China-specific alternate methodology for determining subsidy amounts. The bills in the 111th Congress propose using specific methodologies to determine subsidy amounts in nonmarket economy countries like China, taking into account the possibility that Chinese terms and conditions may not be applicable as benchmarks. Authorities may adjust terms and conditions prevailing in China or use those outside of China if necessary. The bills in the 111th Congress propose using specific methodologies to determine subsidy amounts in nonmarket economy countries like China. If China is deemed an NME country, authorities are directed to use terms and conditions prevailing outside of China to calculate the amount of subsidy. The bills also seek to amend current law to require a joint resolution of Congress to revoke a country's NME status. The bills in the 111th Congress propose using specific methodologies to determine subsidy amounts in nonmarket economy countries like China. The bills also seek to amend current law to provide that a country's NME status may be revoked only if a joint resolution of Congress approves such a determination made by the administering authority. The Bush Administration took steps to address China's alleged subsidies of exports, including initiating a CVD investigation and consultations in the WTO on China's subsidy regime. The ITA initiated a CVD investigation on a product from China and consultations were started in the WTO on China's subsidy regime. On November 27, 2006, the ITA announced a CVD investigation on CFS paper against China. The ITC preliminarily determined on December 15, 2006, that a U.S. domestic industry is materially injured by allegedly subsidized coated paper from China. The ITA initiated a CVD investigation on coated paper from China, with preliminary determinations of subsidy rates ranging from 10.9% to 20.35%. The final determination found countervailable subsidies provided to producers and exporters of coated free sheet paper from China. The ITA made a final determination that countervailable subsidies are being provided to producers and exporters of coated free sheet paper from China, with subsidy amounts ranging from 7.40% to 44.25%. Despite reaffirming China's status as a non-market economy country, the ITA noted that China's present-day economy is significantly different from Soviet-style economies. The ITA found that China's economy is different from Soviet-style economies, with market forces determining prices for over 90% of products. Government transfers cover losses, investment decisions are state-controlled, and access to foreign currency is restricted. Private ownership is limited to consumer goods. The ITA found that China's economy differs from Soviet-style economies, with market forces determining prices for over 90% of products. The Chinese government has shrunk the state's role in some areas while preserving it in others, but fundamental control over the economy has not been completely ceded to market forces. The ITA concluded that China's economy allows for determining benefits to Chinese producers. The ITC made a negative determination on injury in investigations on CFS paper due to factors like limited production capacity and lack of significant price effects from imports. Based on the lack of evidence of significant price effects from imports, moderate inventories of subject merchandise, and absence of negative effects on the domestic industry, it is concluded that the domestic CFSP industry is not threatened with material injury by imports from China and Indonesia. The domestic CFSP industry is not threatened by imports from China and Indonesia. The ITC issued a final negative CVD determination, leading to the termination of the investigation and refunding of duties. The ITA was able to measure subsidies in China, although no CV duties were imposed. A subsequent investigation in late July 2008 resulted in the first CVD order on products from an NME country since 1983. Countervailing duties have been placed on 13 products from China, with 8 investigations pending. China filed suit to prevent the ITA from continuing the CVD investigation, citing a court decision that the CVD law did not apply to NME countries. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that it did not have jurisdiction to hear a case regarding the application of countervailing duty law to non-market economy (NME) countries. China requested WTO dispute settlement consultations with the United States on preliminary antidumping and countervailing duty determinations on CFS paper. China requested WTO dispute settlement consultations with the United States on preliminary antidumping and countervailing duty determinations on CFS paper. The U.S. Trade Representative announced the move and requested public comments on October 10, 2007. China has been actively using AD investigations against products from the United States and other countries since joining the WTO. In 2009, China initiated its first CVD case, with ongoing investigations on U.S. products as of March 2010. On February 2, 2007, the USTR announced WTO dispute settlement consultations with China over alleged illegal subsidies. China agreed to terminate one subsidy program on March 9, 2007, following the U.S.'s formal request. The United States accused China of providing tax refunds and exemptions to Chinese businesses for purchasing domestically produced goods, which can distort trade conditions for U.S. manufacturers and inhibit exports to China. China agreed to terminate illegal subsidies under WTO rules by January 1, 2008, inhibiting U.S. exports and providing unfair advantages to Chinese exports. China signed MOUs with the U.S. and Mexico to eliminate prohibited subsidies, as reported in the 2010 National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers. China agreed to terminate illegal subsidies under WTO rules by January 1, 2008, inhibiting U.S. exports and providing unfair advantages to Chinese exports. The USTR reported in the 2010 National Trade Estimate Report that China had eliminated the subsidies as agreed. In December 2008, the United States requested consultations with China regarding certain measures offering grants, loans, and incentives to Chinese enterprises based on export performance criteria. A settlement agreement was reached in December 2009, confirming that China had eliminated all challenged export-contingent benefits. Despite the ITA's ability to identify subsidies in China, some remain. Despite the ITA's ability to identify subsidies in China, some in Congress intend to combat unfair trade practices that disadvantage American workers, farmers, and businesses. Congress may need to consider various issues related to applying trade remedies to China, including the impact on China's nonmarket economy status and NME designations of other countries. The ITA's decision to identify subsidies in China does not affect China's nonmarket economy status or NME designations of other countries. Congress may need to consider legislation to ensure CVD laws apply to other NME countries like Vietnam. Trade with other NME countries is not significant currently. Currently, trade with other nonmarket economy (NME) countries is not significant, and there are no outstanding trade disputes. There are no specific methodologies provided for identifying subsidies in NME countries, unlike the antidumping statute which does provide a methodology for determining normal value in NME countries. The methodology for determining normal value in NME countries includes using inputs and factors of production from a market economy country. Countervailing duties tend to be lower than antidumping duties, especially for imports from nonmarket economy countries. If China remains an NME and subsidies are found on targeted merchandise already subject to antidumping duties, there may be trade-offs. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) highlighted the uncertainty in calculating the total protection level for Chinese products due to the potential revision of antidumping duties to avoid double counting of export subsidies. This could result in lower combined rates than expected, creating uncertainty in targeting subsidies in China. A determination by ITA or legislation amending the statute targeting subsidies in China could unintentionally reduce overall protection. However, different remedies for price manipulation may allow some U.S. industries to obtain relief through CVD procedures."
