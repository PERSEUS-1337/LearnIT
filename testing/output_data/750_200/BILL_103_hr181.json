    "content": "The \"Notch Baby Act of 1993\" establishes a new guaranteed minimum primary insurance amount for those eligible during a transitional period. Section 215(a) of the Social Security Act is amended to include a new provision for computing the primary insurance amount for individuals described in paragraph (4)(B), with the addition of a transitional increase amount if applicable. The primary insurance amount under the Social Security Act is calculated for individuals described in paragraph (4)(B) by considering the amount and any transitional increase amount. The transitional increase amount is determined by multiplying the excess under former law by the applicable percentage based on the year of eligibility for old-age insurance benefits. The applicable percentage for eligibility for old-age insurance benefits varies by year, ranging from 60 percent in 1979 to 10 percent in 1983. In 1982, the percentage for eligibility for old-age insurance benefits was 25 percent, decreasing to 10 percent in 1983. The term 'excess under former law' refers to the difference between the applicable former law primary insurance amount and the individual's primary insurance amount calculated without certain provisions. The term 'applicable former law primary insurance amount' refers to the individual's primary insurance amount calculated under specific conditions in December 1978 or as provided by subsection (d), without certain adjustments. The individual's primary insurance amount is determined without certain adjustments under specific conditions in December 1978 or as provided by subsection (d). The primary insurance amount for an individual is calculated based on their wages and self-employment income, with adjustments made to ensure a higher amount. This calculation applies only if it results in a greater primary insurance amount than the standard calculation method. The effective date and related rules are outlined in Section 3. The amendments made by this Act are effective as if they were part of the Social Security Amendments of 1977, with no benefit increases before January 1994. Individual entitled to benefits in December 1987 may have their benefits recomputed. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will recompute the monthly insurance benefits for individuals entitled to benefits in December 1987 under the Social Security Act, based on specific criteria outlined in the Act. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will recalculate the primary insurance amount for individuals entitled to benefits in December 1987, considering the amendments made by this Act."
