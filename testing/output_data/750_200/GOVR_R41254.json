    "content": "The Department of Defense was funded by continuing resolutions until FY2011, allowing spending at FY2010 levels with restrictions on new programs. On April 15, 2011, an omnibus funding bill for the balance of FY2011 was signed, providing $659.9 billion for DOD activities. The omnibus funding bill for the balance of FY2011 (H.R. 1473; P.L. 112-10) provided $659.9 billion for all DOD activities except military construction, with a reduction of $18.2 billion from the President's request. Additionally, $17.8 billion was allocated for DOD's military construction budget, a reduction of $2.2 billion from the President's request. The bill also included $4.4 billion worth of reductions in DOD appropriations. The omnibus funding bill for FY2011 (H.R. 1473; P.L. 112-10) provided $659.9 billion for DOD activities, with a reduction of $18.2 billion from the President's request. It also allocated $17.8 billion for DOD's military construction budget, a decrease of $2.2 billion. The bill incorporated $4.4 billion in reductions to the President's request, including cuts to various spending categories like DOD funds from prior years, Operations and Maintenance, Procurement, Research and Development, civilian pay, and federally funded research and development corporations. The omnibus funding bill for FY2011 (H.R. 1473; P.L. 112-10) provided $659.9 billion for DOD activities, with a reduction of $18.2 billion from the President's request. Significant cuts were made to various spending categories, including $1.7 billion from the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, $473 million from a new ground combat vehicle for the Army, and $325 million from a new mid-air refueling tanker for the Air Force. The omnibus funding bill for FY2011 (H.R. 1473; P.L. 112-10) cut $864 billion from the President's DOD budget, including reductions for a new mid-air refueling tanker for the Air Force. However, the bill also added funds for various programs such as Navy strike fighters, National Guard equipment, medical research, Israeli missile defense systems, and the Military Career Advancement Account program. The FY2011 National Defense Authorization Act authorized funds for various defense-related activities, including Navy strike fighters, National Guard equipment, medical research, Israeli missile defense systems, and the Military Career Advancement Account program. The bill did not allocate funds for the development of an alternate engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The House version authorized $725.9 billion, while the Senate version authorized $725.7 billion. The Senate Armed Services Committee's version of the FY2011 National Defense Authorization Act authorized $725.7 billion, $240.7 million less than the Administration's request. The bill was set aside after the Senate rejected a motion to begin consideration due to opposition to repealing the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy. The Senate rejected a motion to invoke cloture on S. 3454, which included repealing the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy. A compromise version of the authorization bill (H.R. 6523) was signed into law on January 7, 2011 (P.L. 111-383), supporting the Administration's budget request. The authorization bill (H.R. 6523) signed into law on January 7, 2011 (P.L. 111-383) supported the Administration's budget request. Both House and Senate versions backed President Obama's decision not to fund the C-17 cargo plane production. The House bill authorized a 1.9% pay increase for military personnel, while the Senate bill authorized a 1.4% increase. Additionally, the House bill included $485 million for development not in the budget. The enacted FY2011 bill, H.R. 6523, authorized a 1.4% pay raise for military personnel and $485 million for the development of an alternate engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, despite previous attempts by the Bush and Obama Administrations to terminate the project. The FY2011 budget included $738.7 billion for national defense, with $733.3 billion in discretionary spending for military activities. Additionally, $5.3 billion was allocated for mandatory spending, mainly for military retirees. The FY2011 budget allocated $5.3 billion for mandatory spending, with the largest share for military retirees receiving concurrent receipt of their military pension and disability pension. The total Department of Defense request for FY2011 was $708.3 billion, including $159.3 billion for ongoing military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Additionally, $33 billion was requested for supplemental DOD appropriations for FY2010 war costs. The Administration requested $33 billion in supplemental DOD appropriations for FY2010 war costs to cover the deployment of additional troops to Afghanistan, bringing the total amount appropriated for FY2010 war costs to $162.6 billion. The request for war costs in FY2011 was $159.3 billion, $3 billion lower than FY2010. The Administration's FY2011 war budget request was $159.3 billion, $3 billion lower than FY2010. The emphasis shifted from Iraq to Afghanistan for the third year. An additional $655 million was requested for humanitarian relief in Haiti after the earthquake. The DOD requested an additional $655 million for humanitarian relief operations in Haiti after the devastating earthquake in 2010. This relief effort included deploying Navy ships, cargo flights, and military personnel. The DOD budget for FY2011 would see a 3.4% increase, with 1.8% real growth in purchasing power. The budget request for FY2011 includes a 3.4% increase in the DOD budget, with 1.8% real growth in purchasing power. The Administration also requested $719.2 billion for discretionary programs of security agencies, a 5.2% increase from FY2010. The FY2011 budget request includes a 3.4% increase in the DOD budget, with 1.8% real growth in purchasing power. The Administration also requested $719.2 billion for security agencies' discretionary programs, a 5.2% increase from FY2010. The FY2011 DOD budget request includes a 3.4% increase, continuing the upward trend in base budgets since FY1998. Adjusted for inflation, it would be the third largest budget since the end of the Korean War. The Administration projects annual increases exceeding inflation for the following four years. The Administration projects annual increases in the DOD base budget that fall short of the 2% real growth rate needed, as stated by Defense Secretary Robert Gates. Secretary Gates proposed reducing DOD's overhead costs by $10 billion annually to bridge the gap between sustaining the current force and future budgets. Secretary Gates proposed reducing DOD's overhead costs by $10 billion annually to sustain the current force, as real growth in the defense budget is unlikely. This would involve shifting funds to support combat forces while reducing spending on administrative and support activities. Secretary Gates proposed increasing real growth in combat force accounts by reducing spending on administrative and support activities, aiming to shift funds from \"tail\" to \"tooth\" within the budget. Secretary Gates proposed reallocating funds from administrative and support activities to combat units to achieve real growth in the budget. By shifting about $10 billion from support functions to combat units, a total real increase of about 3% in the \"tooth\"-related part of the FY2012 DOD budget request could be achieved. Secretary Gates announced initiatives to reduce the cost of DOD's headquarters and support bureaucracies, including a 10% reduction in funding for service support contractors, a decrease in the number of generals and admirals, and the elimination of certain agencies. These changes would result in a 3% increase in the budget for combat units in the FY2012 DOD budget request. Secretary Gates announced initiatives to reduce the cost of DOD's headquarters and support bureaucracies, including a 10% reduction in funding for service support contractors, a decrease in the number of generals and admirals, and the elimination of certain agencies. This included reducing DOD civilians by 150 over the next two years and eliminating the Joint Forces Command, the Business Transformation Agency, and the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Networks and Information Integration. Additionally, on September 14, 2010, Secretary Gates announced 23 more initiatives aimed at increasing efficiency in DOD contracts for goods and services, totaling about $400 billion of the department's annual spending. These initiatives included requiring weapons program managers to prioritize affordability targets alongside performance requirements. Initiatives to reduce DOD's costs included prioritizing affordability targets for weapons program managers, contracting revisions to reward efficiency, and changes to reduce service contract costs. Some Members of Congress argue that projected budget increases may not be enough due to rising personnel and operational costs. Representative Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon expressed concerns about the adequacy of the budget increases. Projected budget increases may be inadequate due to rising personnel and operational costs. Representative Howard P. \"Buck\" McKeon expressed concerns about the planned budgets potentially forcing DOD to scale back acquisition programs. Some Members of Congress object to exempting DOD from the budget freeze on discretionary spending. Some Members object to exempting DOD from the budget freeze on discretionary spending, calling for reductions in the DOD budget to avoid devastating cuts in federal programs. The FY2011 DOD base budget request amounts to 3.6% of the GDP, marking a leveling off of the DOD share of GDP since 9/11. The Administration did not propose significant changes to major weapons programs in its FY2011 request. The FY2011 DOD budget request did not propose significant changes to major weapons programs compared to the previous year. The budget sustains initiatives from the previous year and aligns with the strategy outlined in the Quadrennial Defense Review. The QDRs from 1997, 2001, 2005, and 2010 show a shift in DOD strategic thinking away from readiness emphasis. The 2010 QDR highlights the shift in DOD strategic thinking towards preparing U.S. forces for a variety of missions, moving away from Cold War-era conventional wars. It emphasizes the need to prioritize ongoing campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan, requiring a rebalancing of DOD's priorities in the FY2011 budget request. The 2010 QDR emphasizes DOD's shift towards preparing for various missions, prioritizing ongoing campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan. The department must rebalance priorities to support forces in current operations, focusing on counterinsurgency, stability, and counter-terrorism. Near-term initiatives include increased funding for helicopters, UAVs, intelligence capabilities, counter IED technologies, and AC-130 gunships. The 2010 QDR recommends acquiring helicopters, UAVs, improved intelligence capabilities, counter IED technologies, and AC-130 gunship aircraft. It also suggests converting one heavy Army brigade combat team into a Stryker brigade, with the possibility of converting more in the future as resources allow. The report assumes that no potential adversary in the next 10-20 years will directly challenge U.S. military capabilities. The 2010 QDR recommends acquiring helicopters, UAVs, improved intelligence capabilities, counter IED technologies, and AC-130 gunship aircraft. It challenges the notion that future adversaries will directly confront U.S. conventional military capabilities, instead suggesting they will use asymmetric tactics to exploit U.S. limitations. The 2010 QDR emphasizes the importance of military's ability to operate effectively in cyberspace, characterizing it as another domain of operations alongside air, sea, and space. It also highlights the need for DOD to strengthen its capabilities to actively defend its cyber-networks against various threats. The 2010 QDR emphasizes the importance of military's ability to operate effectively in cyberspace, characterizing it as another domain of operations alongside air, sea, and space. It calls for strengthening capabilities to defend cyber-networks and outlines specific steps to achieve this, including developing a comprehensive approach, increasing cyber expertise, centralizing command of cyber operations, and collaborating with other agencies for enhanced security. The 2010 QDR emphasizes the importance of U.S. forces being able to handle multiple missions of different types around the globe, in addition to winning two major regional wars simultaneously. This includes stabilizing countries, deterring aggressors, counter-insurgency missions, and supporting civil authorities. The 2010 QDR highlights the need for U.S. forces to handle various missions globally, including deterring aggressors, counter-insurgency operations, and supporting civil authorities. It focuses on preparing for asymmetric threats like \"anti-access, area-denial\" capabilities developed by potential adversaries like China and Iran. These capabilities could target U.S. bases and naval forces near shore. China and Iran could target U.S. forward bases and naval forces near shore, crucial for U.S. power projection capabilities. These capabilities are essential for U.S. alliances and stability efforts in various regions, but are costly. U.S. defense spending exceeds that of any other nation due to these power projection capabilities, which may be increasingly vulnerable to attack. U.S. defense spending exceeds that of any other nation due to power projection capabilities that may be vulnerable to attack, including ground bases, naval forces, and high-tech weapons like ballistic missiles with maneuverable warheads. The QDR recommends countering anti-access strategies with long-range strike weapons and submarines. This includes developing offensive electronic attack capabilities and possibly investing in missile defense. The FY2011 budget request includes funding for 1.43 million active duty personnel in the regular components, reflecting a 4.7% increase over FY2000 end-strength levels. This budget also includes initiatives launched by the Obama Administration in FY2010, particularly in acquisition. The FY2011 budget request includes funding for 1.43 million active duty personnel in the regular components, a 4.7% increase over FY2000 end-strength levels. This increase follows a reduction in active-duty manpower that began in FY1987 and accelerated during the 1990s. Since the start of combat operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, the end strength of the Army and Marine Corps rebounded to 562,400 and 202,100, respectively, meeting goals three years earlier than planned. In 2010, Congress authorized a temporary increase in the Army's active duty strength to 569,400, with a $1 billion budget for a 1.4% raise in basic pay effective January 1, 2011. This raise matches the private-sector average increase as required by law. The Basic Allowance for Housing, a non-taxable cash payment to service members, was set to increase by 4.2% in FY2011. Congress has typically approved military pay raises 0.5% higher than the Employment Cost Index increase to address past pay disparities. DOD officials argue that service members are currently better paid than 70% of private sector workers with similar experience and responsibilities. DOD officials argue that service members are currently better paid than 70% of private sector workers with similar experience and responsibilities. Military advocacy groups insist on a higher increase to close the pay gap between military personnel and civilians. The $340 million proposed for a 1.9% raise could be better spent on reenlistment bonuses and special pays for critical specialties. The FY2011 DOD funding bills provided a platform for legislative initiatives regarding President Obama's decision to revise a 1993 law. The FY2011 DOD funding bills allowed for legislative initiatives on President Obama's decision to change the policy on openly homosexual personnel in the military. Some Members of Congress argue that having openly homosexual individuals in combat units could affect cohesion and combat effectiveness. President Obama called for repealing the 1993 legislation and adopting a policy of nondiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Some legislators have introduced bills to repeal the law and replace it with a nondiscrimination policy. Critics argue that openly homosexual personnel could undermine unit cohesion and combat effectiveness, especially during deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan. President Obama called for repealing the 1993 legislation and adopting a policy of nondiscrimination against persons with a same-sex orientation. DOD launched a study on how such a change in law and policy would be implemented, with Secretary Gates opposing repeal pending completion of the study. On March 25, 2010, changes were announced in the department's procedures for enforcement of the current law regarding homosexual conduct. In a proposed amendment to the FY2011 Defense Authorization Act, Senators and a Representative suggested repealing the 1993 legislation banning openly homosexual individuals from military service, contingent upon completion of a DOD review and certification by top officials. The proposed amendment to the FY2011 Defense Authorization Act suggests repealing the ban on openly homosexual individuals in military service after completion of a DOD review and certification by top officials. Director Peter R. Orzag stated that the Administration supports the draft amendment to repeal the ban on openly homosexual individuals in the military, despite preferring that congressional action wait for the completion of the current DOD study. DOD press spokesman Geoff Morrell mentioned that Secretary Gates believes the DOD review should be finished before any legislation to repeal the 'don't ask, don't tell' law, but can accept the language in the proposed amendment. The 'don't ask, don't tell' law was ruled unconstitutional by Federal Judge Virginia A. Phillips on September 9, 2010. Despite Congress indicating that repealing the law is not possible, the Secretary of Defense can accept the language in the proposed amendment. On October 12, 2010, Judge Phillips enjoined the DOD from enforcing the law, but the Ninth Circuit temporarily stayed the injunction on October 19, 2010. Under Secretary of Defense Clifford Stanley issued a memorandum on October 21, 2010, limiting the authority to discharge to five senior DOD officials. On October 21, 2010, Under Secretary of Defense Clifford Stanley limited the authority to discharge service members for homosexual behavior to five senior DOD officials. The DOD health care system's FY2011 budget request included $50.7 billion, serving 9.5 million eligible beneficiaries through various medical facilities. The system's cost has more than doubled in the past 10 years and is projected to increase annually at a rate of 5-7%. The cost of the DOD's medical program has more than doubled in the past 10 years, reaching $19 billion in FY2001. It is projected to increase annually at a rate of 5-7% through FY2015, when it is expected to account for 10% of the planned DOD budget. Factors contributing to the rising costs include an increase in retirees using TRICARE, more frequent use of DOD medical services by eligible beneficiaries, and legislatively mandated increases. The DOD's medical program costs have more than doubled in the past decade, reaching $19 billion in FY2001. Factors contributing to rising costs include increased TRICARE usage by retirees, more frequent use of DOD medical services by eligible beneficiaries, and legislatively mandated increases in benefits. The Bush Administration proposed fee increases for TRICARE beneficiaries not eligible for Medicare, but Congress passed legislation to prohibit them each year. The Obama Administration's 2011 budget did not include any fee increase proposals. The Obama Administration's 2011 budget did not include any legislative proposals to increase TRICARE annual fees or copayments. Secretary Gates expressed a desire to work with Congress to control program costs while ensuring care for military personnel and retirees. The FY2011 request aimed to increase the total amount. The FY2011 budget request aimed to increase funding for development and procurement of weapons and equipment, with a shift towards production of major programs like the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Total funding would increase from $184.9 billion in FY2010 to $189.0 billion in FY2011, with procurement receiving 60% and R&D 40% of the budget. The FY2011 budget request focused on increasing funding for major programs like the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, with $11.2 billion allocated for R&D and procurement. No funds were included for additional C-17 wide-body cargo jets. The FY2011 budget request did not include funds for additional C-17 wide-body cargo jets or for the development of an alternate jet engine for the F-35. In 2009, Congress added funding for 10 C-17s and the alternate engine despite the Obama Administration's request to cut them. Some Members of Congress have questioned the Army's Brigade Combat Team Modernization program, which the Administration requested $3.2 billion for in FY2011. The Brigade Combat Team (BCT) Modernization program, with a requested budget of $3.2 billion in FY2011, aims to develop new ground combat equipment. A key element of the program is the controversial design of the proposed Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV). This program replaced the Future Combat System (FCS) program, which was intended to develop new combat equipment to replace current systems like the M-1 Abrams tank and M-2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicle. In 2009, efforts to develop 14 manned and unmanned systems under FCS were recommended for cancellation by Secretary of Defense Gates. The Future Combat System (FCS) program aimed to develop 14 manned and unmanned systems connected by a network. However, Secretary of Defense Gates recommended canceling the manned ground vehicle (MGV) component due to design flaws not reflecting lessons from Iraq and Afghanistan. The Army then launched the Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) program to replace the MGV by 2015-2017. The Army replaced the Future Combat System's manned ground vehicle (MGV) component with the Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) program, aiming to field a family of fighting vehicles by 2015-2017 based on mature technologies. Congress may question if the Army is rushing GCV development, risking another unsuccessful acquisition program. The Army replaced the Future Combat System's manned ground vehicle (MGV) component with the Ground Combat Vehicle (GCV) program. The Army restarted the GCV competition in November 2010 and incorporated other elements of the FCS program into the Army's Modernization program. The Army plans to \"spin out\" components to all 73 Army BCTs by 2025. The Army's Modernization program aims to distribute components to all 73 Army BCTs by 2025. The effectiveness of the FCS components for deployment has not been proven in field exercises. The Navy's FY2011 budget includes funding for nine new battle force ships, such as submarines, destroyers, LCSs, and amphibious assault ships. The Navy's shipbuilding plan includes 50 new battle force ships over five years, with half being LCSs or JHSVs. The 30-year plan aims for 276 ships but falls short of the 313-ship goal. The fleet is projected to grow from 284 ships in FY2011 to 315 ships in FY2020. The Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan projects a fleet that grows to 320 ships by FY2024, then drops below 313 ships by FY2027. The plan estimates a need for $15.9 billion per year in constant FY2010 dollars. The Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan estimates a need for $15.9 billion per year in constant FY2010 dollars, but a Congressional Budget Office report suggests it would actually require $19.0 billion per year. If funding remains at current levels, the Navy may not be able to afford all purchases in the 2011 plan. The Navy's 2011 plan includes discussions on shipbuilding issues, such as the development of next-generation ballistic missile submarines to replace the Ohio-class submarines. The Navy allocated funding for the SSBN(X) program in FY2010 and requested additional funding in FY2011 for research and development. The plan aims to procure the first SSBN(X) in FY2019. The Navy's FY2011 budget includes funding for the SSBN(X) program, with plans to procure the first submarine in FY2019. The estimated procurement cost for each SSBN(X) is $6 billion to $7 billion. Concerns have been raised about the program's impact on the Navy's long-term shipbuilding affordability. The Navy faces challenges in ensuring the affordability of its long-term shipbuilding program, particularly with the procurement of 12 SSBN(X) submarines from FY2019-FY2033. This could potentially lead to reductions in procurement rates for other types of Navy ships during those years. The Navy's 30-year shipbuilding plan acknowledges limitations in procuring other ship classes while the SSBN(X) is being procured. Options are being considered to reduce the cost of the SSBN(X) program or mitigate its impact on other Navy shipbuilding projects. Options for reducing the cost of the SSBN(X) program or its impact on other Navy shipbuilding programs include procuring fewer submarines, reducing the number of missiles carried, designing a smaller missile, stretching out the procurement schedule, using split funding, funding from a different DOD budget, or increasing the Navy's shipbuilding budget. The Navy's FY2011 budget proposed ending procurement of Zumwalt class destroyers and resuming procurement of Arleigh Burke class Aegis destroyers. Congress supported this proposal and the budget also called for procuring two DDG-51s in FY2011 and six more in FY2012-FY2015. Additionally, the Navy's FY2011 budget suggested terminating the planned CG(X) cruiser program as unaffordable. The Navy's FY2011 budget proposed ending procurement of Zumwalt class destroyers and resuming procurement of Arleigh Burke class Aegis destroyers. Congress supported this proposal and the budget also called for procuring two DDG-51s in FY2011 and six more in FY2012-FY2015. The Navy's FY2011 budget also suggested terminating the planned CG(X) cruiser program as unaffordable. Instead of procuring CG(X)s around FY2017, the Navy plans to build an improved version of the DDG-51, called the Flight III version, starting in FY2016. The Navy's proposed FY2011 budget requested $228.4 million for the Air and Missile Defense Radar (AMDR) to be carried by DDG-51s. The Aegis ballistic missile defense program aims to increase BMD-capable Navy Aegis ships from 20 to 38 by FY2015. Concerns arise over using Aegis-BMD ships to defend Europe. The Aegis BMD program aims to increase BMD-capable Navy Aegis ships from 20 to 38 by FY2015. Concerns are raised about the growing demands for BMD-capable Aegis ships and the strain it may put on the Navy's ability to provide ships for non-BMD missions. The program is mostly funded through MDA's budget, with additional funding from the Navy. The Aegis BMD program aims to increase BMD-capable Navy Aegis ships from 20 to 38 by FY2015, with concerns about strain on the Navy's ability to provide ships for non-BMD missions. The program is funded through MDA's budget, with additional funding from the Navy. FY2011 budget requests included $2,161.6 million for Aegis BMD and $457.0 million for BMD-related efforts. Congress faced decisions on approving the Navy's proposal for the Flight III DDG-51 design, funding requests for the Aegis BMD program, and providing additional direction to MDA or the Navy. The FY2011 budget requested $1.59 billion for the Aegis BMD program to fund two Littoral Combat Ships (LCS) designed for shallow water operations with interchangeable weapons modules. The Navy planned to purchase different versions of LCS from two industry teams. The Navy planned to purchase different versions of Littoral Combat Ships (LCS) from two industry teams, Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics. The Navy accelerated its timetable for choosing between the two designs, opting to select a single design for all LCSs procured in FY2010 and subsequent years. The winning contractor would build 10 LCSs over a five-year period at a rate of two ships per year. The Navy planned to purchase Littoral Combat Ships (LCS) from two industry teams, Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics. The winning contractor would build 10 LCSs over five years, with a second competition for up to five additional LCSs. Navy officials sought approval to buy 10 ships from each competing team. In early 2009, the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps collectively had an inventory of about 3,500 fighters. Concerns arise due to budgetary limits on replacing aging fighters, with projections of a shortfall of up to 800 aircraft by 2024. Congress plans to buy 10 ships from each competing industry team for acquisition strategy. The Air Force and Navy are facing fighter aircraft shortages, with projections of up to 800 aircraft shortfall by 2024. Congress is concerned about the affordability of modernizing the tactical aircraft force. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter is crucial to the Department of Defense's tactical aircraft modernization plans, aiming to acquire 2,443 JSFs at a cost of over $300 billion. Concerns arise as funding shortages may lead to a budget \"train wreck\" for tactical aircraft modernization. The F-35 program is the DOD's largest weapon procurement program with an estimated cost of over $300 billion. Allies are also purchasing additional F-35s, with the FY2011 budget requesting $11.3 billion for the program. Concerns exist about affordability due to constrained DOD resources. The F-35 program, the DOD's largest weapon procurement program, is facing concerns about affordability in the annual quantities planned by DOD due to constrained resources. As the production rate increases, the program will require over $10 billion per year in acquisition funding, posing budgetary challenges for DOD. The F-35 program is facing affordability concerns due to constrained resources, with the British government reducing their planned purchase from 138 to as few as 40 planes, excluding the vertical-takeoff version. The F-35 program is facing affordability concerns, with the British government reducing their planned purchase. Congress has rejected proposals to terminate the development of the General Electric/Rolls-Royce F136 engine as an alternative to the Pratt & Whitney F135 engine. Approximately $2.5 billion has been provided for the alternate engine program, with an estimated additional $2.9 billion needed to complete it by 2017. The DOD has estimated that the Joint Strike Fighter alternate engine program would require an additional $2.9 billion to complete the development of the F136 engine by 2017. Critics argue that terminating the F136 alternate engine was driven by immediate budget pressures rather than long-term considerations. Some argue that terminating the F136 engine was due to budget pressures rather than long-term considerations. They believe single-source engine contracts are more cost-effective in the long run. Cancelling the F136 engine raises concerns about operational risks and potential fleet grounding. The termination of the F136 engine raises concerns about operational risks, fleet grounding, impact on the defense industrial base, U.S. relations with allied countries, and cost control in a single-supplier environment. Continuing F136 development also raises issues for the F-35 acquisition program. Continuing F136 development raises concerns about impact on the F-35 acquisition program, potential reduction in F-35 numbers, outyear costs, and operational challenges of supporting two different engines in the field. The Administration's FY2011 defense budget requested funds for acquiring new mid-air refueling tankers to replace aging KC-135 tankers. The Department of Defense released a Request for Proposals for a program to build 179 new KC-X aerial refueling tankers for the Air Force, valued at $35 billion. Bidding closed on July 9, 2010, with three offerors submitting bids. The Department of Defense released a Request for Proposals for 179 new KC-X aerial refueling tankers for the Air Force, valued at $35 billion. Bidding closed on July 9, 2010, with three offerors submitting bids. EADS offered a KC-X design based on the Airbus A330 airliner, Boeing offered a design based on its 767 airliner, and a team of Antonov and U.S. Aerospace offered a variant of the An-124 freighter. The bid from Antonov and U.S. Aerospace was excluded for arriving after the deadline. The Department of Defense excluded the bid from Antonov and U.S. Aerospace for arriving late, and the GAO denied U.S. Aerospace's protest. DOD announced awarding the tanker contract to Boeing on February 24, 2011, and EADS decided not to challenge the decision on March 4. The KC-X acquisition program has drawn significant attention due to its value, job creation, and military importance. Previous attempts to acquire a new tanker have been contentious, shaping the context for the new KC-X competition. The history of previous attempts to acquire a new tanker has been contentious, shaping the context for the new KC-X competition. The George W. Bush Administration planned to deploy a modified version of the land-based BMD system in Poland and the Czech Republic, but the Obama Administration favored the Phased Adaptive Approach. The Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) involves deploying BMD-capable Aegis ships to defend Europe and the United States against potential ballistic missile attacks from Iran. The Administration has requested $2.27 billion in FY2011 for PAA programs, including development efforts unique to PAA and procurement of the Aegis ship-borne BMD system. The FY2011 budget includes $2.27 billion for the Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) programs, with $1.56 billion allocated for the Aegis ship-borne BMD system. The military construction budget for FY2011 is $18.7 billion, a 20% decrease from FY2010, mainly due to reduced spending on facilities for units relocating due to BRAC. The FY2011 budget includes $2.27 billion for the Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) programs, with $1.56 billion allocated for the Aegis ship-borne BMD system. Military construction budget for FY2011 is $18.7 billion, a 20% decrease from FY2010, mainly due to reduced spending on facilities for units relocating due to BRAC. Military families are moving to new sites as a result of BRAC, with construction funded in earlier budgets. Budget for military family housing dropped from $2.3 billion in FY2010 to $1.8 billion in FY2011 request, due to privatization of military family housing. Basic Allowance for Housing paid to personnel has increased over the past decade. The FY2011 DOD bills provided a vehicle for Members of Congress opposed to the Navy's plan to move a nuclear powered aircraft carrier from Norfolk, VA to Mayport, FL. The Department of Defense's final report on the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review endorses the Navy's desire to establish Mayport as a new homeport. The Department of Defense's final report on the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review supports the Navy's plan to establish Mayport, Florida as a second Atlantic Fleet carrier home port. This move would require the construction of new nuclear support facilities at the Mayport site and would shift economic activity from Norfolk to Mayport. The Department of Defense supports establishing Mayport, Florida as a second Atlantic Fleet carrier home port. This would involve shifting economic activity from Norfolk to Mayport and potentially homeporting an aircraft carrier there, with estimated costs totaling $589.7 million, including $46.3 million for dredging. Members of Congress from Florida have endorsed this proposal. The Navy is considering moving a CVN to Mayport, with estimated costs of $589.7 million, including $46.3 million for dredging. Some Members of Congress from Virginia are skeptical of the proposal, suggesting that funding could be better spent on other Navy priorities. The Administration's budget also includes $139 million for facilities on Guam. The Administration's budget includes $139 million for facilities on Guam, in the western Pacific, for use by 8,000 Marines and their families moving from Okinawa. The move is part of negotiations between the US, Japan, and DOD, with additional military personnel expected to relocate to Guam by 2014-2016. Guam, a mountainous island, will see these relocations completed soon. Guam is a mountainous island with a population of about 178,000. Estimates suggest a potential increase of up to 56,000 people due to military personnel relocation. Analysts question if Guam's infrastructure can support this surge. The Administration's budget supported the creation of the U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) to centralize command of DOD networks and coordinate their protection. The reorganization of cyber forces began in October 2008 under Secretary Gates' direction. Global Network Operations (JTF GNO) was placed under the operational control of the Joint Functional Component Command for Network Warfare (JFCC NW), responsible for offensive cyber operations. This integration marked a departure from the historical segregation of offensive and defensive cyber capabilities. In June 2009, Secretary Gates directed the establishment of U.S. Cyber Command under U.S. Strategic Command with responsibility for both offensive and defensive cyber operations. Gates directed the establishment of U.S. Cyber Command under U.S. Strategic Command, consolidating DOD cyber operations with offensive and defensive capabilities. The NSA director was nominated to lead the new command, sparking debates on militarization of cyberspace and privacy concerns. Centralized command aims to standardize DOD cyber practices. The Administration's FY2011 budget request for Air Force Operations and Maintenance included $139 million to stand up U.S. Cyber Command, an increase of approximately $105 million above the FY2010 budget. The new command will be responsible for defending DOD networks and providing support for civil authorities upon request. The FY2011 DOD budget request included efforts to \"rebalance\" roles of DOD and State Department in foreign assistance. Two programs previously funded by DOD were not included in the FY2011 NDAA legislation as they were requested to be funded in the State Department budget. This includes the \"Section 1207\" program for crisis reaction funding. In FY2012, the State Department will be responsible for funding reconstruction, security, and stabilization activities, including the Complex Crisis Fund and the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund. The DOD budget request for FY2011 includes funding for the Iraq Security Forces Fund for police training. Funding for the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund remains in place for training the Afghan National Police. The FY2011 budget request includes police support funding for the transition year. The Department of State aims to rebalance roles between DOD and State in security assistance, but Pentagon officials suggest DOD should maintain or expand its role. An interagency review is ongoing to determine the appropriate division of security assistance. The Administration is conducting an interagency review on security assistance authorities, with the Senate Armed Services Committee welcoming proposals for enhancing U.S. security assistance. Secretary of Defense Gates highlighted advising and mentoring foreign security forces as a key military mission. Robert M. Gates emphasized the importance of advising and mentoring foreign security forces as a key military mission, aligning with recommendations from the Quadrennial Defense Review Report. Admiral Mike Mullen also stressed the need for military power to not be the last resort for the state. In a March 3, 2010 speech, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Mike Mullen advocated for military power to be seen as a viable first option, alongside diplomacy and other national power instruments. Secretary Gates, Adm. Mullen, and the QDR report all emphasized the need to enhance civilian capabilities to aid foreign governments in conflict prevention and recovery, highlighting a new integrated approach between defense and diplomacy in international relations. The Administration's FY2011 DOD budget request includes funding for various security assistance programs, such as the \"Section 1206\" program and the Combating Terrorism Fellowship Program, reflecting a new integrated approach between defense and diplomacy in international relations. The DOD budget for FY2011 includes funding for the Combating Terrorism Fellowship Program, Defense Institution Reform Initiative, legal instruction program, and Stability Operations Fellowship Program. Secretary Gates emphasized the State Department's lead in national security. In his February speech, Secretary Gates criticized the outdated national security system and proposed a pooled fund for security assistance. Congress has previously rejected this idea. The House passed the FY2011 National Defense Authorization Act authorizing $725.9 billion. The House passed the FY2011 National Defense Authorization Act authorizing $725.9 billion, which is $2.7 million less than the Administration requested. The Senate's version of the bill would authorize $725.7 billion, a reduction of $240.7 million from the Administration's request. The Senate did not act on this version due to opposition to a provision repealing a 1993 law. The Senate did not act on S. 3454, a bill that would have repealed the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy for openly homosexual individuals in the military, after failing to invoke cloture on the motion to consider the bill. Instead, a compromise version of the authorization bill (H.R. 6523) was negotiated without the provision related to the policy. The Armed Services Committees negotiated a compromise version of the authorization bill (H.R. 6523) that dropped the provision related to the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy. The bill was cleared for the President on December 22, 2010, and signed on January 7, 2011 (P.L. 111-383). The bill authorized lump-sum totals for appropriations accounts in the DOD and Energy Department budgets, but did not include funding tables allocating those totals among specific programs. The defense authorization bill, H.R. 6523 (P.L. 111-383), authorized a total end-strength of 1.43 million members for the armed services, an increase of 7,400 from FY2010. It also included a 1.4% increase in military basic pay as requested by the Administration. The final version of the bill authorized a 1.4% increase in military basic pay for FY2010, as requested by the Administration. The House-passed bill proposed a 1.9% raise, which was estimated to add $380 million to military personnel costs for FY2011. The final bill did not include provisions for increasing monthly allowances for married personnel separated by deployment or for personnel at risk of hostile fire or imminent danger. The Senate Armed Services Committee directed the Government Accountability Office to assess the Department of Defense's use of cash incentives to recruit and retain highly qualified individuals in essential specialties. This includes reviewing the process for identifying specialties for incentives and assessing the efficiency of determining housing allowances for service members. Monthly payments for personnel at risk of hostile fire or imminent danger will increase from $225 to $260. The Senate committee directed the GAO to assess the efficiency of determining housing allowances for service members. The FY2011 defense authorization act did not include a provision to repeal the ban on openly homosexual persons in the military. On May 27, 2011, the House passed an amendment to repeal the ban on openly homosexual persons in the military, contingent on completion of a DOD review and certification by key military officials. The House passed an amendment to repeal the ban on openly homosexual persons in the military, contingent on completion of a DOD review and certification by key military officials. This provision, consistent with military standards, was included in the House bill as Section 536 and in the Senate bill as Section 591. Senator John McCain debated the motion to invoke cloture on the bill on September 21, 2010. The Senate voted on cloture for the bill, with Senator John McCain arguing it was premature without DOD's review on \"don't ask, don't tell.\" The cloture motion failed 56-43, and the final bill did not include a provision on abortion in military facilities. The Senate committee version aimed to repeal a law prohibiting military facilities from performing abortions, allowing DOD to provide abortions using private funds. The provision would have applied to all DOD facilities, but the final bill did not include this provision. The enacted version of the authorization bill did not include a House-passed provision for a pilot program allowing officers to pursue mid-career educational programs and assignments outside of their service to broaden experience and judgment. This would involve skipping or delaying promotion requirements and committing to a longer service period. The enacted version of the bill included provisions from a DOD commission on sexual assault in the military, establishing the director of DOD's Sexual Assault Response and Prevention office. The House-passed requirement for the director's rank was not included in the final version. Improved protocols for DOD are also mandated. The House-passed bill includes requirements for the job holder to be a flag or general officer or a civil servant of comparable rank. It also mandates improved protocols for medical care of military personnel and their dependents who are sexual assault victims, ensuring access to victim advocates. However, it does not guarantee confidentiality of victims' communications with advocates, legal assistance, or a hotline for reporting sexual assaults. The House bill mandates improved protocols for medical care of military personnel who are sexual assault victims but does not guarantee legal assistance or a hotline for reporting assaults. H.R. 6523 requires the Secretary of Defense to evaluate the feasibility of providing assistance from military legal counsel to victims. It authorizes most of the Administration's $50.7 billion budget request for DOD's health care program, without proposed TRICARE fee and pharmacy copayment increases. The House bill mandates improved protocols for medical care of military personnel who are sexual assault victims but does not guarantee legal assistance or a hotline for reporting assaults. H.R. 6523 authorizes most of the Administration's $50.7 billion budget request for DOD's health care program without proposed TRICARE fee and pharmacy copayment increases. The House-passed H.R. 5136, the Senate Armed Services Committee's S. 3454, and the final enacted version of the authorization bill (H.R. 6523) each contain provisions prohibiting any increase in TRICARE fees and pharmacy copayments. All three versions of the bill allow TRICARE beneficiaries to extend coverage to their dependent children up to age 26. TRICARE beneficiaries can now extend coverage to dependent children up to age 26, aligning with private health insurance programs under the Affordable Care Act. The bill did not include provisions for a unified medical command or a new Defense Health Agency. The enacted H.R. 6523 established a Defense Health Agency to oversee TRICARE and required proper documentation of officers' performance in response to a Fort Hood incident. The final version of the authorization bill did not include provisions from the House-passed H.R. 5136 related to incidents at Fort Hood and a recruiting station in Little Rock. One provision would have provided special compensation to victims of terrorist attacks targeting service members or DOD civilians affiliated with the U.S. military. The final version of the authorization bill did not include provisions related to incidents at Fort Hood and a recruiting station in Little Rock. It would have provided special compensation to victims of terrorist attacks targeting service members or DOD civilians affiliated with the U.S. military, including earmarking funds for implementing recommendations from a panel analyzing the Fort Hood incident. The bill generally supported the Administration's ballistic missile defense activities. The Senate committee supported the Administration's ballistic missile defense activities, including defense against ballistic missile attacks from Iran in Europe. Both bills authorized slightly more than $10.3 billion for missile defense, with H.R. 5136 adding $361.6 million and S. 3454 adding $349.1 million. H.R. 6523 specifically authorized $205 million for Israel's \"Iron Dome\" system to intercept short-range rockets and artillery shells. The FY2011 budget request included funding for Israel's \"Iron Dome\" system to intercept short-range rockets and artillery shells. H.R. 6523 authorized $205 million for this system, but did not allocate specific funding for other missile defense programs. Funding levels for these programs were outlined in H.R. 5136 and S. 3454. The FY2011 budget request included funding for Israel's \"Iron Dome\" system to intercept short-range rockets and artillery shells. H.R. 6523 authorized $205 million for this system, but did not allocate specific funding for other missile defense programs. Authorization for missile defense programs from H.R. 5136 and S. 3454 are detailed in Table A-2. The bill affirms that the New START treaty with Russia would not restrict U.S. missile defense programs, despite concerns from some Russian sources. The Administration requested $2.27 billion in FY2011 for programs related to the \"Phased Adaptive Approach\" for defending Europe against long-range ballistic missiles. The FY2011 budget requested $2.27 billion for the \"Phased Adaptive Approach\" (PAA) for European missile defense, with $712 million for PAA development and $1.56 billion for Aegis ship-borne BMD system. The final authorization bill requires a DOD report on PAA and imposes restrictions on deployment in Europe. The final authorization bill imposes restrictions on the deployment of the Phased Adaptive Approach (PAA) in Europe, similar to those applied to the Bush plan. It limits deployment until the technology is proven effective and host governments have ratified necessary agreements. Unlike the House-passed bill, H.R. 6523 allows some flexibility for the Secretary of Defense. The final version of the bill, H.R. 6523, includes restrictions on the deployment of the Phased Adaptive Approach in Europe, allowing the Secretary of Defense to waive provisions in the interest of national security. It also authorizes the establishment of a shared ballistic missile early warning system with the Czech Republic. The final version of S. 3454 endorsed statements on missile defense capabilities, including intercepting Iranian ICBMs, developing ground-based interceptors, and maintaining strategic stability with Russia. It did not include provisions from the House bill that would have restricted reductions. The final version of the authorization bill does not include provisions from the House bill that would have restricted reductions in U.S. nuclear weapons below the limits set by the New START Treaty. The final version of the authorization bill approved the $15.7 billion for Navy shipbuilding, including funding for specific programs such as two DDG-51 Aegis destroyers, two Virginia-class attack submarines, and two Littoral Combat Ships. The bill does not include provisions restricting reductions in U.S. nuclear weapons below the limits set by the New START Treaty. The final version of the authorization bill approved $15.7 billion for Navy shipbuilding, including funding for two DDG-51 Aegis destroyers, two Virginia-class attack submarines, two Littoral Combat Ships, and other vessels like an \"intratheater connector\" and an oceanographic research ship. Additional funding was allocated for the U.S.S. Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier, an LHA-class helicopter carrier, and the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt carrier refueling and overhaul. Incremental funding has become the norm in recent years. The authorization bill approved $15.7 billion for Navy shipbuilding, including funding for various vessels like destroyers, submarines, and combat ships. Incremental funding has become common for expensive ships, with provisions allowing for funding over multiple years. The U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt received its third increment of funding for refueling and overhaul. H.R. 6523 includes provisions for funding a helicopter carrier over two years and a report on the Navy's shipbuilding requirements impacted by using cruisers and destroyers with the Aegis anti-missile system for regional BMD deployments. The demand for Aegis missile-defense ships is expected to exceed supply for some time. The final version of the authorization bill did not include provisions to prevent a decline in the size of the fleet, such as blocking the retirement of two large helicopter carriers until replacements are in service and limiting the Navy from retiring more ships than commissioned until reaching the goal of 313 ships. The Senate committee directed assessments on the Navy's shipbuilding plans and their impact on the Marine Corps' amphibious operations. The Navy's plan to build new ships and retire existing ones could impact the Marine Corps' ability to conduct amphibious landings. While the ideal number of amphibious landing ships is 38, the Navy's plan for 33 ships is considered adequate. However, cost increases and construction delays may hinder reaching the reduced goal. The FY2011 defense authorization bill did not address the Navy's plan to replace its Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines. The FY2011 defense authorization bill did not address the Navy's plan to replace its Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines with new, expensive SSBN(X) submarines that could impact the Navy's shipbuilding budgets after 2016. The final bill approved only a lump-sum for SSBN(X) development in FY2011. The final version of the authorization bill approved a lump-sum authorization for Navy R&D without specifying funds for SSBN(X) development in FY2011. It also did not include a provision to limit Navy spending on the program. Funding for the C-17 cargo jet production was not authorized as requested by the Administration. The final version of the authorization bill did not authorize funds for the C-17 wide-body cargo jet production, despite previous objections from the Bush and Obama Administrations. The bill also addressed cost overruns in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program and included a provision for DOD to create a detailed progress assessment plan. The authorization bill addressed cost overruns in the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program by requiring DOD to create a detailed progress assessment plan. It did not include a House provision limiting F-35 procurement until cost and performance milestones were met. Both the House-passed and Senate committee-approved versions authorized $11 billion for F-35 development and 42 plane purchases, rejecting a request for an additional $205 million for one more F-35. The House-passed bill rejected a request for an additional F-35 ($205 million) for war costs, suggesting the Air Force could replace the lost aircraft by continuing to operate another fighter. The bill also included $485 million for an alternate jet engine for the F-35. The final bill did not include additional funds for the development of an alternate jet engine for the F-35, unlike the House-passed bill which allocated $485 million for this purpose. The Senate committee's bill did not provide extra funds for the second engine, and the enacted version of the bill did not take a specific stance on the issue. The Pentagon press conference on May 20, 2010, Secretary Gates reaffirmed his intention to recommend a veto on any defense bill funding the alternate F-35 engine. The House and Senate Armed Services Committees argue that the Navy's planned aircraft procurement budgets would lead to a decrease in carrier-borne fighters due to delays. The House and Senate Armed Services Committees are concerned about the Navy's aircraft procurement budgets leading to a drop in carrier-borne fighters due to F-35 program delays. To address the \"strike fighter gap,\" additional funding for F/A-18E/F model fighters was proposed in both the House-passed bill and Senate committee-reported bill. The enacted bill does not specify the number of planes authorized. The enacted bill includes provisions for addressing the projected strike fighter gap by extending the service life of F/A-18s or reducing the number of planes in certain squadrons. It also authorizes funding for the development of the KC-X mid-air refueling tanker, with EADS and Boeing competing for the contract. The House approved the bill with a vote of 410-8. The House adopted an amendment to H.R. 5136 requiring DOD to consider unfair competitive advantages in bids for the KC-X tanker, with EADS proposing an Airbus A-330 tanker to compete with Boeing's 767 bid. The House adopted an amendment to H.R. 5136 requiring DOD to consider unfair competitive advantages in bids for the KC-X tanker. The amendment was based on a finding by the World Trade Organization that France-based EADS had received government subsidies for its commercial airliners. DOD selected Boeing's tanker design, the KC-46A, and EADS decided not to challenge Boeing's selection. The House and Senate Armed Services Committee would deny authorization for part of the Army's $3.19 billion request for its Brigade Combat Team Modernization program, successor to the Future Combat Systems program terminated in 2009. The House and Senate Armed Services Committee denied authorization for part of the Army's $3.19 billion request for its Brigade Combat Team Modernization program, successor to the Future Combat Systems program terminated in 2009. The House bill cut an additional $347.4 million from the total BCT Modernization request, while the Senate committee cut the request by only $29.7 million beyond the N-LOS reduction. The enacted version of the authorization did not allocate a specific funding level to the projects comprising the BCT program. The House and Senate Armed Services Committee denied authorization for part of the Army's Brigade Combat Team Modernization program. The House bill cut $347.4 million from the total request, while the Senate committee cut $29.7 million. The authorization did not allocate specific funding to the projects. The House committee urged the Army to take a less technologically ambitious approach with the new combat vehicle program. The panel recommended considering upgrades to current combat vehicles to meet GCV requirements. The Army's FY2011 GCV funding was reduced to $461 million, with detailed analysis required before full spending. The authorization bill did not specify funding for individual programs like GCV, but the House Armed Services Committee stated that H.R. 6523 \"fully funds\" it. The House Armed Services Committee's press release on the enacted authorization bill stated that H.R. 6523 \"fully funds\" the Administration's adjusted request of $461 million. The bill did not include a House provision to prevent funds from being used for planning and designing structures at the Naval Station in Mayport, FL for a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. The House committee directed the GAO to assess the costs of homeporting a carrier in Mayport. The House Armed Services Committee directed the GAO to assess the costs of homeporting a carrier in Mayport and report on the cost and benefits of other options for using the Mayport naval facilities. H.R. 6523 authorized $176.0 billion for military construction on Guam, with a reduction in funds related to the planned redeployment of Marine Corps units from Okinawa. The final bill approved funds for improving access roads and wharves in Guam's harbor but denied funding for construction of a Marine base and facilities for Marine aviation squadrons. It also did not authorize $70.0 million for replacing Guam's military hospital but approved $50.3 million for Air Force projects and $19.0 million for a new National Guard Readiness Center. The final version of the bill did not include a House provision authorizing the Secretary of Defense to assist Guam with increased municipal costs. H.R. 6523 requires reports on military facilities needed for force redeployment and an assessment of civil infrastructure by the Secretary of the Interior. H.R. 6523 requires reports on military facilities needed for force redeployment and civil infrastructure assessments. It also prohibits the transfer of Guantanamo Bay detainees to U.S. territory. The final version of H.R. 6523 prohibits the transfer of Guantanamo Bay detainees to U.S. territory, except in cases where a court or military tribunal orders the transfer. It also restricts the use of funds to build or modify facilities for housing detainees elsewhere. The final version of H.R. 6523 prohibits transferring Guantanamo Bay detainees to U.S. territory unless ordered by a court or military tribunal. It also restricts funds for building or modifying facilities for detainee housing elsewhere. The bill requires the Secretary of Defense to report to Congress on costs, benefits, and risks of transferring detainees to alternative sites. The House-passed version of the authorization bill aimed to increase funding for the Section 1206 program to $500 million, extend its authorization through FY2012, and allocate $75 million for building counterterrorism forces in Yemen. The House-passed authorization bill aimed to increase funding for the Section 1206 program to $500 million and allocate $75 million for building counterterrorism forces in Yemen. The bill also included a provision for the Secretary of Defense to provide funds for the Yemen project if the Secretary of State could not issue the certification by July 31, 2011. The House Armed Services Committee recognized Yemen as a \"strategic partner\" in combating Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. The Senate committee-reported bill aimed to recognize Yemen as a \"strategic partner\" in combating Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. It proposed expanding the Section 1206 program to include support for police agencies, creating a separate authority for the Secretary of Defense to provide up to $75 million in assistance. The bill did not increase the $350 million cap on Section 1206 funding and cut the Administration's request to that level. The final version of the authorization bill allows the Secretary of Defense, with the Secretary of State's approval, to provide $75 million in assistance to the Yemen Ministry of the Interior for counterterrorism operations against al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. This additional funding was approved by the Senate committee and does not exceed the $350 million cap on Section 1206 funding. The enacted version of the authorization bill includes a provision authorizing the Secretary of Defense to use up to $150 million of Army funds to support the Task Force for Business and Stability Operations in Afghanistan. This aims to enhance stability and reduce violence in Afghanistan by linking military operations with economic elements of national power. The enacted version of H.R. 6523 authorizes the Secretary of Defense to use Army funds to support economic projects in Afghanistan, aiming to reduce violence and enhance stability through strategic business activities. The final version of bill 6523 includes provisions on cybersecurity, directing the Secretary of Defense to report on cyber warfare policy, develop tailored acquisition processes for cyberspace, continuously monitor DOD networks for security, and report on damages from cyber attacks to Congress annually. The final version of the authorization bill did not include a House provision for a National Office for Cyberspace with government-wide responsibility for coordinating information security programs. The House and Senate did not agree on a FY2011 budget resolution, leading to both committees operating under spending caps adopted through other procedures. The House and Senate did not agree on a FY2011 budget resolution. In the absence of a budget resolution, both committees operated under spending caps adopted through other procedures. The House adopted a one-year cap on discretionary spending, which the House Appropriations Committee used to set allocations for its subcommittees. The Defense Subcommittee received $523.9 billion, $7 billion less than the Administration's request for DOD base budget programs. The Senate Budget Committee approved a FY2011 budget resolution, but it was never considered by the Senate. The Senate Budget Committee approved a FY2011 budget resolution (S.Con.Res. 60), but it was not considered by the Senate. The Senate did not adopt an overall ceiling on FY2011 discretionary spending like the House did. The Senate Appropriations Committee set \"discretionary guidance\" for subcommittees, with the Defense Subcommittee receiving a ceiling of $522.8 billion, $8.1 billion less than the President's request. The House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee approved a FY2011 DOD Appropriations bill for consideration by the full Appropriations Committee. On July 27, 2010, the House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee approved a FY2011 DOD Appropriations bill with a total of $671.0 billion, including $513.3 billion for the base budget and $157.7 billion for war costs. The bill reduced $7.0 billion from the President's request for the base budget and $253 million for war costs. The text of the bill and detailed recommendations were not made public.

DOD was funded through mid-April 2011 by short-term continuing resolutions until the House passed a bill (H.R. 1) to fund federal agencies through the balance of FY2011. In 2011, the House passed bill H.R. 1 to fund federal agencies for the rest of FY2011, including a defense appropriations bill with $505.2 billion in discretionary budget authority. The Senate debated the bill but it was laid aside after failing to close debate. An alternative funding measure was also rejected. The Senate rejected an alternative funding measure by a vote of 42-58, which would have provided $503.1 billion for base budget programs. The President signed an omnibus funding bill for the balance of FY2011 (H.R. 1473; P.L. 112-10) on April 15, 2011, incorporating a detailed FY2011 DOD appropriations bill with a total of $502.4 billion. The bill, H.R. 1473, provided $502.4 billion for the base budget and $677.7 billion for all DOD funding, including military construction and war costs. This was a $20.1 billion reduction from the President's requested amount for FY2011 DOD appropriations. H.R. 1473 included $4.4 billion in reductions to the President's request for DOD appropriations, cutting funds from various categories such as Operations and Maintenance, Procurement, Research and Development, civilian pay, and federally funded research and development corporations. The defense appropriations bill, H.R. 1473, made cuts to various categories in the President's DOD budget request, including Research and Development, civilian pay, and federally funded research and development corporations. Despite the reductions, the bill also added funds in some instances, although fewer compared to previous years. Congressional earmarks in defense appropriations bills have decreased over the years, with 2,085 earmarks in FY2008, 2,084 in FY2009, and 1,758 in FY2010. The defense appropriations bill for FY2008, FY2009, and FY2010 included earmarks for various programs such as Navy strike fighters, National Guard equipment, medical research, and Israeli missile defense systems. Additionally, funds were allocated for innovative research and procurement projects. The House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee included funding for innovative research and procurement projects in its draft bill, but did not allocate funds for an alternate engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. H.R. 1473 funded a 1.4% military pay raise and included brief descriptions of budget changes without an explanatory statement. The House Rules Committee posted funding tables for the bill, which included a 1.4% military pay raise and added $162 million for the MyCAA tuition assistance program for military spouses. The Senate committee bill proposed adding $447.0 million to the Defense Health Program, with a net increase of $661.7 million for research and development. The Defense Health Program (DHP) requested $32.3 billion, with increases in research and development programs for breast cancer, psychological health, and prostate cancer. $425.0 million was cut from the deployment of THAAD missiles, while $205 million was added to accelerate other programs.

The bill includes funding to accelerate production of the Israeli Iron Dome system and provides details on missile defense funding in H.R. 1473. President Obama had requested Congress to approve funds for Iron Dome in FY2011. Additionally, the bill made minor reductions in Navy shipbuilding funding. The bill provided $15.4 billion for Navy shipbuilding out of the $15.7 billion requested, with reductions in some areas. It also reduced funding for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighters by $1.38 billion and cut $325.0 million for the development of a mid-air refueling tanker. The bill cut $325.0 million from the requested funds for developing a mid-air refueling tanker to replace aging KC-135 tankers. The delay in choosing a bidder made it unlikely for the winning firm to spend the budgeted amount in FY2011. The bill also denied $431.8 million for the Non-Line of Sight Missile development. For more details on aircraft funds, refer to Tables A-5 and A-9 in the Appendix. The bill cut funding for the Non-Line of Sight Missile and the Ground Combat Vehicle program, leading to cancellations and revisions in the Army's development plans."
