    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Missing Mercury in Manufacturing Monitoring and Mitigation Act\". Congress finds that mercury and mercury compounds are highly toxic to humans, ecosystems, and wildlife. Approximately 10 percent of women of childbearing age in the United States have mercury in their bloodstreams at levels that could harm their unborn babies. Additionally, around 630,000 children born annually in the United States are at risk of neurological issues due to mercury exposure in utero. The main source of mercury exposure in the US is through consuming mercury-contaminated fish. The ultimate solution to mercury pollution is necessary for long-term mitigation. Mercury pollution is a significant issue globally, with the main source being ingestion of mercury-contaminated fish. The long-term solution involves minimizing global mercury use and releases to reduce contamination levels in the environment. An estimated 24,000 to 30,000 tons of mercury are used at mercury cell chlor-alkali plants worldwide, contributing to the transboundary nature of mercury pollution. Mercury pollution is a transboundary issue affecting bodies of water globally, including industrial areas like the Great Lakes and remote areas like the Arctic Circle. In the United States, only 8 out of 30 chlorine plants use the outdated mercury cell process, with 5 plants yet to phase out mercury use. Only about 10% of chlorine and caustic soda in the US is produced using mercury. The chlor-alkali industry in the United States uses mercury in only 10% of chlorine and caustic soda production. Cost-effective alternatives are available for the remaining 90%. Other countries like Japan have already banned the mercury cell process due to contamination risks. Despite acknowledging the contamination risks and indirect release of mercury from products manufactured at mercury cell facilities, the chlor-alkali industry and the Environmental Protection Agency are unable to account for the disposition of mercury used or accurately estimate current mercury emissions. The United States must work aggressively to minimize mercury supply, demand, and releases domestically and internationally. Congress declares that the United States should develop policies to reduce mercury use and emissions, releases from the reservoir of mercury in circulation, and exposures to mercury, especially for women of childbearing age and young children. Additionally, Title I of the Toxic Substances Control Act is amended to address the use of mercury in chlorine and caustic soda manufacturing. Title I of the Toxic Substances Control Act is amended to address the use of mercury in chlorine and caustic soda manufacturing. The manufacture of chlorine or caustic soda using mercury cells is prohibited in the United States starting January 1, 2012. The manufacture of chlorine or caustic soda using mercury cells is prohibited in the United States. Owners of chlor-alkali facilities must report types and quantities of mercury-containing hazardous waste generated annually. The chlor-alkali facility must report the mercury content of wastes, how each waste was managed, volume of mercury released into air or water, and estimated volume of mercury released. The chlor-alkali facility must report the volume of mercury released from emissions or vaporization, accumulated in pipes and equipment, and found in products for sale. The chlor-alkali facility must report the volume of mercury released from emissions or vaporization, accumulated in pipes and equipment, and found in products for sale. The Administrator may allow combining the required report with other reports under the Solid Waste Disposal Act for avoiding duplication. For facilities ceasing operations after July 1, 2008, an inventory must be submitted within a year of cessation. After a chlor-alkali facility ceases operations, the Administrator will conduct a mercury inventory within a year, considering mercury purchased, remaining in equipment, and released into the environment. The Administrator will conduct a mercury inventory after the closure of a chlor-alkali facility, including the total mercury remaining in equipment, estimated mercury in waste generated, and aggregate mercury releases into the environment. The Administrator will obtain mercury purchase records and other necessary information from chlor-alkali facilities to determine the magnitude and nature of mercury releases into the environment. An advisory committee for mercury storage will be established. The establishment of a Mercury Storage Advisory Committee composed of 9 members appointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Senate majority leader. The Mercury Storage Advisory Committee will consist of 9 members appointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Senate majority leader, including a Chairperson, Vice-Chairperson, Administrator, Secretary of Defense, and a representative of State environmental agencies. The Mercury Storage Advisory Committee will consist of 9 members appointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Senate majority leader, including representatives from State environmental agencies, State attorneys general, the chlorine industry, the mercury waste treatment industry, and a nonprofit environmental organization. The Mercury Storage Advisory Committee will have 1 member from a nonprofit environmental organization. The Administrator will appoint members within 45 days of enactment, and the Committee must hold its initial meeting within 30 days of all members being appointed. The Committee will hold its initial meeting after all members are appointed. Meetings will be called by the Chairperson, and a majority of members will constitute a quorum. A report must be submitted to Congress within 1 year, detailing findings and recommendations on environmental, health, and safety requirements. The Committee will report to Congress on environmental, health, and safety requirements for preventing mercury release and worker exposure, estimated storage costs, and optimal characteristics of Federal facilities for a 40-year period. The report will include details on the optimal size and characteristics of Federal facilities needed to store elemental mercury, as well as the estimated quantity of mercury resulting from discontinuing mercury cells at chlor-alkali facilities in the United States. The report will also cover the estimated quantity of elemental mercury generated from recycling unwanted products and other wastes over a 40-year period, which may require storage to comply with export prohibitions. Additionally, any barriers preventing the private sector from storage will be addressed. The report will address barriers preventing the private sector from storing elemental mercury, advantages and disadvantages of consolidating storage from public and private sources, and the optimal storage plan. The Committee will address the optimal storage plan for excess mercury from public and private sources, as well as any additional research needed for long-term disposal options. Members of the Committee who are not federal employees will receive compensation. Members of the Committee who are not federal employees will be compensated at a rate equal to the annual rate of basic pay for level V of the Executive Schedule for each day engaged in Committee duties. Members of the Committee who are federal employees serve without additional compensation for their duties. They are allowed travel expenses at authorized rates. The Committee members, who are federal employees, receive travel expenses at authorized rates for their duties. The Administrator provides necessary funding and personnel for the Committee to perform its duties, and the Committee will terminate after 180 days. The Committee will terminate 180 days after submitting its report. The Administrator will establish regulations for the transfer and storage of mercury at closed chlor-alkali facilities by July 1, 2008. The regulations for the transfer and storage of mercury at closed chlor-alkali facilities must be implemented by July 1, 2008. Elemental mercury at closed facilities must be transferred to a storage facility by this date. A health assessment for operating chlor-alkali facilities must be completed by July 1, 2009. The Administrator will conduct a health assessment of employees at chlor-alkali facilities by July 1, 2009. Additionally, the Administrator may establish necessary regulations to carry out this section. The Toxic Substances Control Act is amended to include a new section after section 6. The Toxic Substances Control Act is amended to include a new section after section 6 regarding the use of mercury in chlorine and caustic soda manufacturing."
