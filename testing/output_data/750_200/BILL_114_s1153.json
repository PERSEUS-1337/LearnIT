    "content": "The Act titled \"Red River Private Property Protection Act\" disclaims the Secretary's interest in land south of the Red River's South Bank boundary line. Previous surveys by the Bureau of Land Management will not determine the current boundary line. The Secretary will commission a new survey to identify the South Bank boundary line along the affected area using the gradient boundary survey method. The survey must span the entire length of the area and be conducted by Licensed State Land Surveyors chosen by the Texas General Land Office. It must be completed within 2 years of the enactment of the Act and submitted for approval to the Texas General Land Office. State approval of the survey will satisfy the Act's requirements. SEC. 4. APPEAL.\n\nWithin 1 year of survey approval, private property owners can appeal public domain claims to an Administrative Law Judge.\n\nSEC. 5. RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PLAN.\n\nNo affected land can be treated as Federal until survey approval and no further appeals are possible.\n\nSEC. 6. CONSTRUCTION. SEC. 6. CONSTRUCTION. This Act does not change or affect the interest of States or sovereignty rights of federally recognized Indian tribes over lands north of the South Bank boundary line of the Red River. After completing the survey and ensuring no further appeals, the Secretary will offer identified Federal lands for competitive sale at fair market value. Sales are subject to existing tribal, State, and local rights. The sale of identified Federal lands is subject to existing tribal, State, and local rights.
