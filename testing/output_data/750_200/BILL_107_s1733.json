The Act \"Name Matching for Enforcement and Security Act of 2001\" mandates the development of a unified electronic data system for accessing relevant information from law enforcement and intelligence databases to determine visa issuance and alien admissibility to the United States. The unified electronic data system required by the \"Name Matching for Enforcement and Security Act of 2001\" must have the capacity to match names across different databases, be searchable on a linguistically sensitive basis, provide user support, and be developed in consultation with private sector firms. The unified electronic database required by the \"Name Matching for Enforcement and Security Act of 2001\" must match names across databases, be linguistically sensitive, provide user support, consult with private sector firms, utilize commercial platforms, and be continuously improved based on experience and technology advancements. The unified electronic database must be searchable using linguistically sensitive algorithms that account for variations in name formats and transliterations within a language. The unified electronic data system must incorporate advanced linguistic, mathematical, statistical, and anthropological research methods. Linguistically sensitive algorithms for at least 4 high-priority languages designated by key officials must be developed and implemented. Adequate user support must be provided in the system. The unified electronic data system must provide easily accessible information about names in different languages and a means for users to communicate with experts. Interim reports must be submitted every 6 months by key officials. The officials must submit reports every 6 months on their progress in implementing the requirements of the Act, including intelligence agencies completing a survey within 60 days of enactment. The Director of Central Intelligence must complete a survey and issue a report within a specified timeframe after the enactment of the Act. Additionally, guidelines must be issued and submitted within 120 days of the Act's enactment. The Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998 requires guidelines to be issued and appropriations authorized for the data system development. Consultation with various government officials is necessary for implementation. The Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization, Director of Central Intelligence, and other relevant agencies will collaborate on the development of a data system utilizing a technology standard established by the USA PATRIOT Act. Access to information in the system will be subject to certain conditions. The Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 establishes a data system for information access. Foreign Service officers and Federal agents can access the system for visa and alien admissibility purposes. Restrictions on access to intelligence information will be established by the Secretary of State, Attorney General, and Director of Central Intelligence. The Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 establishes a data system for information access, with procedures to restrict access to intelligence information in certain circumstances."
