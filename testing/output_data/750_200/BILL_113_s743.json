    "content": "The \"Marketplace Fairness Act of 2013\" authorizes the collection of sales and use taxes. The \"Marketplace Fairness Act of 2013\" allows Member States under the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement to require all sellers, except small sellers, to collect and remit sales taxes for remote sales sourced to that state. States can enforce this authority 180 days after the enactment of the Act, as long as changes to the Agreement comply with minimum simplification requirements. A State can exercise authority under the Act 180 days after publishing notice, but no earlier than 180 days after the Act's enactment. Non-Member States can also require sellers to collect and remit sales taxes for remote sales, excluding small sellers. The small seller exception allows States to collect sales taxes on remote sales if they meet minimum simplification requirements. States can start enforcing this authority at least 6 months after enacting legislation specifying the applicable taxes. The small seller exception allows States to collect sales taxes on remote sales by meeting minimum simplification requirements, specifying applicable taxes, and designating a single entity for tax administration. The requirements include a single entity in the State responsible for sales tax administration, audits, and return processing for remote sales, a single audit for all taxing jurisdictions, and a single sales and use tax return for remote sellers. The State may not require remote sellers to file sales and use tax returns more frequently than nonremote sellers or impose additional requirements on remote sellers. Local jurisdictions cannot mandate remote sellers to submit tax returns or collect sales taxes. The local jurisdiction may require a remote seller to submit a sales and use tax return, collect sales and use taxes, provide a uniform tax base, source all remote sales, and offer information on taxability of products and services. The state requires remote sellers to provide tax information, exemptions, rates, and software for calculating and filing sales and use taxes. The Act requires certified software providers to update their software to reflect rate changes and provide certification procedures. Remote sellers are relieved from liability for incorrect tax collection, remittance, or noncollection. Certified software providers are relieved from liability for incorrect tax collection if it is due to their error or omission. Remote sellers are also relieved from liability if the error is due to misleading information provided by them. Certified software providers and remote sellers are relieved from liability for incorrect tax collection if errors are due to misleading or inaccurate information provided. Certified software providers and remote sellers are given 90 days notice of a rate change by the State or any locality, allowing them to update their information and avoid liability for collecting taxes at the previous rate during this notice period. The State or locality must provide a 90-day notice of a rate change to certified software providers and remote sellers to avoid liability for collecting taxes at the previous rate during this period. A State can only require a remote seller to collect sales and use taxes if their total remote sales exceed $1,000,000 in the previous year, aggregating sales from related persons. The aggregation of sales from related persons can occur if they are related within the meaning of specific sections of the Internal Revenue Code or if ownership relationships were designed to avoid these rules. SEC. 3. LIMITATIONS. The Act does not subject sellers to various taxes other than sales and use taxes, does not affect tax application, and does not change state authority to impose taxes. It also does not create nexus or change nexus standards between a person and a state. Sellers can still choose their own certified software provider. The Act allows remote sellers to choose their own certified software provider. It does not affect licensing, regulatory requirements, or impose new taxes. It also does not change state authority over interstate commerce. The Act does not encourage new state taxes on products not previously taxed. It only applies to remote sales, not intrastate sales. States must comply with intrastate provisions of the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement. Section 2(a) must adhere to intrastate provisions of the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement. The Act does not affect the Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS AND SPECIAL RULES. In this Act, a \"certified software provider\" is defined as a person who provides software to remote sellers for tax compliance and is certified by a State. \"Locality\" and \"local\" refer to any political subdivision of a State. A \"Member State\" is defined as a state under the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement. In this Act, a \"Member State\" refers to a state under the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement, excluding associate members. The term \"person\" includes various legal entities and governments. A \"remote sale\" is defined as a sale conducted from a distance. A \"remote sale\" is a sale into a State where the seller is not required to pay, collect, or remit State or local sales and use taxes unless provided by this Act. A \"remote seller\" is a person that makes remote sales in the State. The location to which a remote sale is sourced refers to where the product or service is located. The location of a remote sale is where the product or service is received by the purchaser, based on delivery instructions provided. If no delivery location is specified, it is sourced to the customer's known address or obtained during the transaction. The location of a remote sale is determined by the delivery address provided by the customer. If no address is available, the sale is sourced to the seller's address. States must comply with the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement. The term \"Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement\" refers to a multi-state agreement adopted on November 12, 2002, and amended periodically. It applies to various territories and tribal organizations as defined by law. SEC. 5. SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Act is deemed unconstitutional, the rest of the Act remains unaffected. SEC. 6. PREEMPTION. This Act does not limit any powers of State or local jurisdictions unless specified otherwise. The Act was passed by the Senate on May 6, 2013, as attested by Nancy Erickson, Secretary."
