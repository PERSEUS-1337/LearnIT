Factors such as reduced teen sexual activity and increased use of contraceptives among sexually active teens have likely contributed to this decrease. Despite the decline in the teen birth rate, Congress remains concerned about the issue due to its social and economic costs. Disparities in teen birth rates persist among different racial and ethnic groups and across states. Congress supports programs aimed at preventing teen pregnancy. The curr_chunk discusses the distinction between teen birth rate and teen pregnancy rate, with the former referring to live births per 1,000 teen girls aged 15-19 and the latter including pregnancies encompassing live births, abortions, and fetal losses. Pregnancy data are estimates based on various reporting systems and surveys, while birth data account for nearly every birth in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Guttmacher Institute publish teen pregnancy rates based on estimates of miscarriages and abortions. The CDC tracks birth rates by age and other characteristics of birth mothers, with approximately 3.8 million births in the United States in 2018. The CDC tracks birth rates by age and other characteristics of birth mothers. In 2018, about 4.7% of the 3.8 million births in the United States were to teenagers aged 15 to 19. The U.S. teen birth rate peaked in 1957 at 96.3 and then declined significantly by 2018 to 17.4, a 72% drop. The teen birth rate in the United States saw a significant decline from 1991 to 2018, dropping by 72%. In 2018, only about 2% of teens aged 15 to 19 gave birth, marking a historical low. The greatest decline in the teen birth rate occurred between 2007 and 2018, with a 58% decrease. The CDC began tracking subgroup data for teens in 1960, showing higher birth rates for older teens compared to younger teens. In 2018, birth rates for teens aged 15-17 were 7.2 per 1,000, and for 18-19-year-olds, it was 32.3 per 1,000, the lowest on record. Repeat teen births declined by nearly 54% from 2004 to 2015. Hispanic youth had the highest prevalence of repeat teen births, followed by non-Hispanic black and white youth. In 2018, the highest prevalence of repeat teen births was among Hispanic, followed by non-Hispanic black and white youth. The largest declines in repeat births were among black teens, followed by Hispanic and white teens. Teen mothers have become less likely to be married, with the birth rate for unmarried teens aged 15 to 19 decreasing from 31.0 per 1,000 in 2010 to 16.0 per 1,000 in 2018. Despite an overall decline in the teen birth rate, rates for certain racial and ethnic groups remain relatively high. In 2018, teen birth rates varied by race and ethnicity, with Hispanic, non-Hispanic black, and non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native teens having more than double the rate of non-Hispanic white and non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander teens. The data spans from 1991 to 2018, showing fluctuations in teen birth rates among different racial and ethnic groups. In 2018, teen birth rates varied by race and ethnicity, with significant declines seen from 2007 to 2018. Rates fell by 55% for non-Hispanic white teens, 40% for non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native teens, 58% for non-Hispanic black teens, 73% for non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander teens, and 65% for Hispanic teens. Despite greater declines for non-Hispanic black and Hispanic teens, their birth rates remained higher than those of white teens. In 2018, teen birth rates varied by state and territory, with Massachusetts having the lowest rate (7.2) and Arkansas the highest (30.4). Eighteen states had rates below 15 per 1,000 teens aged 15 to 19. In 2018, teen birth rates varied by state and territory. Eighteen states had rates below 15 per 1,000 teens aged 15 to 19, with California, Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin having the lowest rates. The highest rates (25 or higher) were in Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, and West Virginia. The territories ranged from 19.3 in Puerto Rico to 34.4 in Guam. From 2007 to 2018, teen birth rates decreased in each state or territory by 19% to 67%. Teen birth rates in the U.S. have decreased from 2007 to 2018, with rates in rural areas remaining higher than in urban areas. The U.S. teen birth rate is higher than that of most other industrialized countries, such as the United Kingdom. Economic conditions and income inequality may contribute to the high teen birth rate in the U.S. The high teen birth rate in the United States compared to other industrial countries may be influenced by economic conditions and income inequality. Research suggests that contraceptive use among teens is higher in other developed countries. Multiple trends have contributed to the decline in U.S. teen pregnancy and birth rates, with improved contraceptive use being a key factor from the 1990s to 2007. Research indicates that improved contraceptive use, including an increase in condom use and the use of multiple methods, contributed to the decline in teen pregnancy rates from the 1990s to 2007. Additionally, decreased sexual activity among younger teens aged 15 to 17 also played a role. More recent declines in teen pregnancy risk have been attributed to the increasing use of contraceptives among sexually active teens from 2007 to 2014. The increasing use of contraceptives among sexually active teens from 2007 to 2014 has contributed to a decline in teen pregnancy rates. Factors such as expanded educational and labor market opportunities for women and improvements in contraceptive technology have influenced behavioral changes in teens. The decline in teen birth rates may be driven by factors like expanded educational and labor market opportunities for women and improvements in contraceptive technology. Some attribute the decrease to the recession that began in 2007, suggesting that economic downturns make teenagers more careful. Despite this rationale, the teen birth rate continued to diminish after the recession. Social media may also play a role in the decline. The decline in teen birth rates continued after the recession, possibly influenced by factors like social media and increased internet use for sex education. The MTV show 16 and Pregnant was linked to faster declines in teen childbearing rates, suggesting a change in behavior towards increased contraceptive use. Teen pregnancy prevention programs, including federally funded initiatives, may have also contributed to the decrease. Teen birth rates declined even after the peak of the MTV show 16 and Pregnant. Observers suggest that teen pregnancy prevention programs, including federally funded initiatives, may have played a role in this decline. Teen pregnancy has significant costs for families and society, with teenage parents facing lower education levels and higher poverty rates. Teen parents are more likely to live in poverty than their peers, with many teen mothers dropping out of high school due to pregnancy. A majority of teen mothers living on their own are below the poverty level, and a significant percentage receive public benefits within the first year of their child's birth. Lower education levels limit economic self-sufficiency for teen parents, while poverty and lack of education can also increase the risk of teenage pregnancy. These outcomes may be influenced by underlying differences between those who become teen parents. Less education can increase the likelihood of teens becoming pregnant. Teen mothers often come from disadvantaged backgrounds, with parents who have lower levels of education. Teen sexual activity can also lead to STIs, which can result in long-term health issues. Adolescents aged 15 to 19 have high rates of STIs. Teen childbearing can lead to long-term health issues and negative outcomes for offspring. Children of teenage mothers are more likely to have chronic medical conditions, use public health care, have lower school readiness scores, perform poorly in school, give birth during their teen years (females), and be incarcerated (males). Additionally, adolescents aged 15 to 19 have high rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), which can have societal impacts. Teen childbearing can have long-term health issues and negative outcomes for offspring, including chronic medical conditions, lower school readiness, and increased likelihood of giving birth during their teen years (females) and being incarcerated (males). A study estimated cost savings of $4.4 billion from 1991 to 2015 due to decreased teen fertility rates, with savings to public programs like Medicaid for labor and delivery expenses. The analysis estimated total savings of $4.4 billion from 1991 to 2015, considering cost savings to Medicaid for labor and delivery, postpartum care, and infant care. Further research on decreased teenage pregnancy could provide insights into impacts on teen parents, their children, and society."
