The Act aims to create a grant program to establish and improve State-administered notification systems for finding missing seniors with Alzheimer's and dementia-related illnesses, promote best practices for Silver Alert systems, and raise awareness about the need for coordination. The Act aims to establish and enhance Silver Alert systems, increase awareness, and promote coordination among families, caregivers, communities, and law enforcement to locate missing individuals quickly and safely reunite them with their families. SEC. 3. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS. According to findings by the National Institute on Aging, up to 5,000,000 people in the US may have Alzheimer's disease, with 1 in 8 individuals over 65 affected. Risk increases with age, and even younger people can be impacted. The aging population in the United States is leading to an increase in Alzheimer's disease cases, with 1 in 8 individuals over 65 affected. Every 71 seconds, another person develops the disease, and the Alzheimer's Association estimates that over 60% of patients will wander away from their care facilities. Alzheimer's disease and dementia can cause individuals to wander away from their homes or care facilities. Some states have established notification systems to help locate missing seniors with these illnesses. Some states have established Silver Alert systems to notify law enforcement about missing seniors with dementia, increasing the chances of locating them. Other states have faced challenges in implementing such systems due to budget constraints. Silver Alert systems should have definitive criteria for issuing alerts to prevent frequent notifications and not be based solely on the age of the missing individual. Alerts should only be used for individuals who are incapable of making decisions. The Silver Alert system should only be used for individuals who are incapable of making personal care decisions or managing their own affairs. Alerts should be initiated by someone who has recent contact with the missing individual and is a legal guardian, close family member, resident of the same household, or caregiver. The Silver Alert system should protect the privacy and dignity of individuals with respect to whom alerts are issued, and encourage training for locating missing individuals with Alzheimer's disease. The Federal Government can assist in locating missing individuals with Alzheimer's disease and other dementia-related illnesses, determining if someone has a dementia-related illness, and improving communication with them. Coordination between State and local entities is essential for effective programs like the Missing Alzheimer's Disease Patient Alert Program. The Federal Government can help prevent injuries and loss of life among individuals with Alzheimer's disease and other dementia-related illnesses by assisting States with the costs of implementing Silver Alert systems. The Silver Alert System Grant Program is established to assist States in implementing Silver Alert systems for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and other dementia-related illnesses. The Attorney General can award grants to States to establish or improve Silver Alert systems for individuals with Alzheimer's and dementia. Grants are for a one-year period and must be at least $100,000. Regulations must be established within one year. The Attorney General shall prescribe regulations for States to receive grants of at least $100,000. Authorization of $5,600,000 for fiscal years 2009 through 2013. SEC. 5. ANNUAL REPORT ON SILVER ALERT SYSTEMS. The Attorney General must provide an annual report to Congress on Silver Alert systems, listing states with such systems and detailing the number of alerts issued, individuals located successfully, and the average time taken to locate them. The annual report on Silver Alert systems to Congress includes details on the average time taken to locate individuals, the issuing agency, dissemination process, system costs, criteria for issuing alerts, and the crossing of state lines by missing individuals. The annual report on Silver Alert systems to Congress includes information on issuing alerts, crossing state lines, protecting privacy and dignity, improving communication, and any other relevant details determined by the Attorney General. The Silver Alert system is a State-administered notification system to locate missing individuals with Alzheimer's disease and other dementia-related illnesses. The term \"State\" refers to various regions within the United States and its territories."
