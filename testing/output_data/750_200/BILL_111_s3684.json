    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Cavernous Angioma CARE Center Act of 2010\". It includes findings related to the Act. Cavernous angioma, also known as cerebral cavernous malformations, affects around 1,500,000 individuals in the US. It is a blood vessel disease characterized by vascular lesions in the brain and spinal cord, often detected through specialized imaging techniques. Many individuals may not realize they have the disease until serious symptoms appear. Individuals with cavernous angioma may experience neurological deficits, seizures, stroke, or sudden death. Limited research on the disease means that the only treatment option is brain and spinal surgery, which may not be suitable for some patients. New Mexico has the highest population density of individuals with cavernous angioma due to a specific disease-causing mutation. Some patients are not eligible for brain surgery, and there is a shortage of physicians familiar with the condition, making timely diagnosis and appropriate care challenging. New Mexico has the highest population density of cavernous angioma in the world, affecting tens of thousands of individuals. Other states with high rates include Texas, Arizona, and Colorado. Senate Resolution 148, 111th Congress, highlights the critical need for increased research, awareness, and education about cerebral cavernous malformations. The National Institutes of Health supports research at institutes of higher education to better understand biomedical systems and translate discoveries into clinical applications. This aims to address the public health threat of cavernous angioma in New Mexico and the United States. To address the public health threat of cavernous angioma, a Cavernous Angioma Clinical Care, Advocacy, Research, and Education Center is needed in New Mexico and the US. This center will provide a model medical system, facilitate research for a cure, and improve medical care nationwide, leveraging the expertise at the University of New Mexico. A Cavernous Angioma Clinical Care, Advocacy, Research, and Education Center is proposed to be established at the University of New Mexico to address the public health threat of cavernous angioma. A Cavernous Angioma Care Center is proposed to be established at the University of New Mexico under SEC. 409K of the Public Health Service Act. The Director of NIH will establish a Cavernous Angioma CARE Center of Excellence at the University of New Mexico to conduct research and provide support to medical schools and research institutions. The center will focus on new diagnostic, prevention, and treatment methods for individuals with cavernous angioma. The CARE Center established at the University of New Mexico will consist of cavernous angioma researchers, clinicians, and medical staff with expertise in various specialties such as headache, epilepsy, psychiatry, dermatology, and neuropsychology. The CARE Center at the University of New Mexico will include specialists such as a psychiatrist, neuropsychologist, dermatologist, nurse practitioner in neurology, nurse coordinator, research coordinator, clinical nurse, radiology specialist, clinical vascular fellow, and basic science postdoctoral fellow. The CARE Center at the University of New Mexico will have specialists including a radiology specialist, clinical vascular fellow, basic science postdoctoral fellow, and genetic counselor. They must be affiliated with a university medical center with an accredited medical school providing education in neurological disease and maintain a program for postdoctoral fellows in cavernous angioma research. The CARE Center at the University of New Mexico will maintain a program for postdoctoral fellows in cavernous angioma research, recruit new researchers and clinicians, establish a medical education program, and dedicate efforts to patient advocacy and outreach. The CARE Center at the University of New Mexico will focus on patient outreach and education through a multimedia public awareness campaign, distributing educational materials, providing education programs for school nurses, organizing educational conferences for patients and families, and developing electronic health teaching tools. The CARE Center at the University of New Mexico focuses on patient outreach and education through educational conferences, electronic health teaching tools, and collaboration with other research institutions. The CARE Center at the University of New Mexico aims to facilitate translational projects and collaborations for clinical trials. It also plans to establish an advisory board composed of individuals with expertise in cavernous angioma and relevant biomedical disciplines. The CARE Center at the University of New Mexico, headed by a Director with expertise in cavernous angioma patient care and research, aims to provide high-quality medical and surgical care for individuals with cavernous angioma. The center also plans to establish an advisory board with representatives from relevant biomedical disciplines. The Director of the CARE Center ensures community-, family-, and patient-centered care, promotes participation in research studies, and develops the center as a model and training facility for research facilities in the US. The CARE Center Director oversees patient-centered care, promotes research participation, and develops the center as a training facility for research facilities in the US. The advisory board must report on the center's activities biannually to the Secretary. The CARE Center Director oversees patient-centered care, promotes research participation, and develops the center as a training facility for research facilities in the US. The advisory board must report biannually to the Secretary on the progress, expenditures, and outcomes of the CARE Center. Authorization of $2,000,000 for fiscal year 2011 is provided for the establishment and operation of the Care Center."
