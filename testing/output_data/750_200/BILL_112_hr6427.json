    "content": "The Act titled \"Capitalizing Workforce Development Act of 2012\" establishes a Job Training Resources Grant Program. The \"Capitalizing Workforce Development Act of 2012\" establishes a Job Training Resources Grant Program under Section 403(a) of the Social Security Act. This program provides grants for the purchase, renovation, construction, or lease of real property for qualified self-sustaining job programs. A qualified self-sustaining job program offers job training and employment services to individuals with challenges, without relying on federal funds except for specific expenses. The paragraph does not require federal funds for programmatic or administrative expenses related to the services described. Applicants can still participate in other federal programs. Priority is given to applicants with successful experience in establishing qualified self-sustaining job programs. Eligible applicants must demonstrate successful experience in establishing self-sustaining job programs or have local organizations awarded grants under section 413(h)(3)(A) as members. Eligible applicants must be a national organization, State or political subdivision, or Indian tribe/tribal organization, with a mission to provide employment-related services to individuals with employment challenges. Grant conditions and requirements apply. Each grant under this program is conditioned upon the establishment of job placement performance goals for qualified self-sustaining job programs. The grantee must establish job placement performance goals for each qualified self-sustaining job program receiving grant funds, with performance assessment dates set by the Secretary. The Secretary will measure the achievement of job placement performance goals for self-sustaining job programs funded under this paragraph. The Secretary will also ensure the protection of the Federal Government's interest in real property purchased, renovated, constructed, or improved with these funds. The government will distribute funds to eligible applicants for self-sustaining job programs, and the Secretary will oversee the protection of the government's interest in real property purchased with these funds. The government will appropriate $200,000,000 for grants for self-sustaining job programs from 2013 to 2016. A penalty will be imposed for failing to meet job placement goals in these programs. If a recipient of funds for self-sustaining job programs fails to meet job placement goals, they must repay a proportional amount to the Treasury as a penalty. The Secretary will require repayment of funds to the Treasury in proportion to the degree of failure if job placement goals are not met for self-sustaining job programs. Repayment must be made over a 10-fiscal-year period without accruing interest, or with the Secretary's consent, the recipient may elect an alternative compliance method. The recipient of funds may choose to meet job placement goals instead of making payments. The Secretary can reduce grants to a State facing penalties for non-compliance. The Secretary has the authority to reduce grants to a State in lieu of required payments, and state penalty limitations do not apply in certain cases. The Secretary can reduce grants to a State instead of payments, and state penalty limitations may not apply in specific situations. Amendments are made to exclude certain cases from the state reasonable cause exception. [SEC. 3. OFFSET TO ENSURE PAYGO COMPLIANCE.]"
