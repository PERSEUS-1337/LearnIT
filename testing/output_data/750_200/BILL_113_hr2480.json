The Act may be cited as the Nurse and Health Care Worker Protection Act of 2013. Congress finds that in 2011, registered nurses and nursing assistants had high numbers of musculoskeletal disorders due to patient lifting, transferring, and repositioning injuries. The physical demands of nursing lead to high rates of chronic back pain and injuries, causing many nurses to leave the profession. This poses a significant risk to the health and welfare of healthcare workers. The physical demands of nursing cause chronic back pain and injuries, leading to high turnover rates among nurses. This poses a significant risk to the health of healthcare workers. Manual patient handling can result in health impairments for employees and compromise patient safety. Implementing mechanical lift programs can reduce injuries and improve patient care. Assistive patient handling technology has made manual patient handling outdated. The use of patient handling technology has reduced injuries among nursing staff and healthcare workers, leading to a decline in lost work days and staff turnover. Studies have shown positive results in facilities that have incorporated safe patient handling practices. The implementation of safe patient handling technology has led to a decrease in lost work days and staff turnover. Several States have adopted standards for injury prevention, demonstrating the success and feasibility of such programs. Establishing safety standards for healthcare workers is crucial in reducing musculoskeletal disorders. Injury prevention standards are crucial for protecting the health and safety of healthcare workers, addressing nursing shortages, and increasing patient safety. The Safe Patient Handling, Mobility, and Injury Prevention Standard is outlined in this section, which applies to facilities receiving Medicare and Medicaid funds. This standard aims to protect healthcare workers, address nursing shortages, and enhance patient safety. The Secretary of Labor must promulgate an interim final standard on safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention within 1 year of the enactment of this Act. This standard aims to prevent musculoskeletal disorders for direct-care registered nurses and other healthcare workers. The safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention standard will require the use of engineering controls to prevent injuries from manual patient handling by healthcare workers. It must be finalized within 2 years of the Act's enactment and include the use of mechanical technology where feasible. The safe patient handling standard mandates the use of mechanical technology or alternative controls to minimize injury risk to healthcare workers when manual patient handling is not feasible. It aligns with national safe patient handling standards and applies to all healthcare employers. The interprofessional national safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention standards require healthcare employers to develop and implement a program within 6 months. This program includes hazard identification, risk assessments, and control measures related to patient care duties and handling. Additionally, there is a requirement for technology and equipment purchase and management within 2 years. Within 2 years of the final standard, healthcare employers must purchase and provide safe patient handling equipment as determined by the Secretary. Health care workers, including registered nurses, must also be involved in the decision-making process. Healthcare employers must involve workers, including registered nurses, in developing and implementing safe patient handling programs. Employers must also establish a data tracking and review program to analyze the implementation of these programs. The safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention program should be implemented by healthcare employers, even in cases where technology or designated lift teams are not used. Employers must provide their findings and data for review upon request. The healthcare employer must consider incorporating safe patient handling technology into facility design and construction. They are also required to provide education and training to healthcare workers on safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention policies, technology, equipment, and devices on an annual basis. The healthcare employer must provide annual training to healthcare workers on safe patient handling, including identifying and controlling musculoskeletal hazards. Training should be interactive and hands-on, conducted by knowledgeable individuals. The healthcare employer must post a notice explaining safe patient handling, mobility, and injury prevention policies, including procedures to report patient handling-related injuries. The healthcare employer must conduct an annual evaluation of the safe patient handling program, including procedures, technology, equipment, and injury assessment. The healthcare employer must conduct an annual evaluation of injuries, safe patient handling technology, and devices developed, involving nurses and healthcare workers. Corrective action must be taken based on the evaluation. Employees have the right to refuse unsafe assignments. Health care workers can refuse duties if they believe it violates safety standards and may cause harm. They must communicate concerns to the employer and not be able to resolve the issue. The Secretary of Labor will conduct unscheduled inspections to ensure compliance with safe patient handling standards if health care workers report safety concerns to their employer and are unable to resolve them. The Safe Patient Handling, Mobility, and Injury Prevention Standard will apply to facilities receiving Medicare and Medicaid funds. The Safe Patient Handling, Mobility, and Injury Prevention Standard is being amended to include facilities receiving Medicare and Medicaid funds. The Safe Patient Handling, Mobility, and Injury Prevention Standard is being amended to include health care facilities one year after the final standard is issued. SEC. 4. NONPREEMPTION. Effect on Other Laws: This Act does not preempt state laws unless they conflict with this Act. It also does not diminish states' authority to enact laws providing equal or greater protections for employees. Rights of health care workers are retained under this Act. Rights of health care workers are preserved under this Act, without diminishing their rights under any other laws or collective bargaining agreements. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines key terms such as \"direct-care registered nurse,\" \"employee,\" and \"employment.\" The Act defines key terms related to healthcare workers, employees, and handling patient care actions. The Act defines terms related to healthcare workers and employers in patient care actions, focusing on musculoskeletal injury risks. The Act defines terms related to healthcare workers, including direct-care registered nurses, independent contractors, and lift teams with specialized training in safe patient handling."
