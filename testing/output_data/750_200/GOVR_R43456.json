    "content": "Airline passenger screening in the United States has undergone significant changes since the 9/11 attacks, with new technologies and policies implemented by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) under the Aviation Transportation and Security Act (ATSA). The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) was created after the 9/11 attacks to provide comprehensive security screening for airline passengers and property. Congress mandated TSA to implement trusted traveler programs and use available technologies to expedite screening, allowing focus on passengers needing more extensive checks. Subsequently, Congress directed TSA to check all airline passengers against security databases. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) was mandated by Congress to implement trusted traveler programs and use technology to expedite screening, focusing on passengers requiring more extensive checks. TSA was also directed to check all airline passengers against security databases. However, TSA has mainly relied on a uniform approach to screening passengers, which contrasts with its risk-based strategies for other aspects of aviation security. The TSA has primarily focused on technology to improve screening capabilities, including whole-body imagers and advanced X-ray equipment. However, constraints such as technology limitations and budgetary considerations have hindered a solely technology-driven approach to airport screening. TSA personnel face limited time and resources for passenger screening. Constraints on a technology-driven approach to airport screening, including limited resources and space limitations, have led to unpredictable wait times for passengers. Inflexible security methods may have negatively impacted public perceptions of TSA. The use of laptop computers for X-ray screening at airports can cause unpredictable wait times and deter travelers. Criticisms of TSA's inflexible security methods have led to negative public perceptions and calls for a more adaptable security system. TSA has shifted to risk-based screening in response to criticisms of uniform security measures. Controversy surrounds the focus of security efforts and how risk is assessed and mitigated. The dilemma of where to focus security efforts and how to assess and mitigate risks is highlighted by Frederick the Great's advice to prioritize the main point and not try to defend everything at once. Former Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff also emphasized the impossibility of achieving perfect security in a free and open society. \"In a free and open society, perfect security is impossible. Security can be configured to minimize risk by understanding the nature of security risks and identifying strategies to mitigate them. Risk in aviation security involves threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences.\" In aviation security, risk is a complex interaction of threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences. Probability values for individual threats and vulnerabilities are limited, so categorical techniques and scoring methods are used. A comprehensive risk-based strategy aims to mitigate all three elements of risk, including in passenger screening initiatives. The aviation security strategy focuses on mitigating risk by identifying threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences. Risk-based passenger screening aims to detect and manage threats by screening for weapons and explosives. Various security measures, such as reinforcing cockpit doors and deploying air marshals, are used to address vulnerabilities and mitigate consequences. The aviation security strategy focuses on mitigating risk by identifying threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences. Consequences are assessed for severity to determine risk valuation and assess costs and benefits of security strategies. Emergency management and response activities primarily mitigate consequences and are the responsibility of airports, airlines, and state and federal emergency management agencies. Defining the risk environment and specifying acceptable levels of risk are key challenges. The TSA's aviation security strategy focuses on identifying threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences to mitigate risk. Risk assessment for air cargo security involves extensive use of risk scoring, while passenger aviation relies on categorical processes for risk assessment. Emergency management and response activities are the responsibility of airports, airlines, and state and federal agencies. The TSA's aviation security strategy focuses on risk assessment for air cargo security through risk scoring and for passenger aviation through categorical processes. Behavioral indicators and biographical data are used to assign passengers to threat categories, but the validity of these methods is questioned. There is a lack of agreement on the specific risks a risk-based security strategy should target. The TSA's aviation security strategy focuses on risk assessment for air cargo security and passenger aviation. The validity of these methods is questioned, and there is a lack of agreement on specific risks to target. An example of this was the TSA's proposal in 2013 to allow passengers to carry small knives and sports equipment onboard aircraft, citing reduced threats and other security measures in place. The TSA's proposal to allow passengers to carry small knives and sports equipment onboard aircraft was met with criticism from various organizations. Despite the mitigation of hijacking risks through other measures, concerns about unruly passengers wielding weapons led to the proposal being abandoned. This decision marked a shift towards risk-based passenger screening over the TSA's previous approach. TSA abandoned proposal to allow small knives onboard due to concerns about unruly passengers. Risk-based passenger screening contrasts with previous prohibition approach. Hawley and Ron criticize focus on small items over big picture in security screening. Raphael Ron, an Israeli expert on aviation security and counterterrorism, criticizes the reliance on prohibited items lists and detection technology in airport security. He argues that this approach limits the system's ability to adapt to evolving threats, citing the example of box cutters used in the 9/11 attacks not being prohibited at the time. Ron believes that terrorists exploit detection technology's limitations and that it has never prevented a planned terrorist attack. Ron criticizes the reliance on prohibited items lists and detection technology in airport security, arguing that it limits the system's ability to adapt to evolving threats. He believes that terrorists exploit technology's limitations and that it has never prevented a planned terrorist attack. This approach might require TSA to be more proactive in assessing threats and vulnerabilities. Advocates of risk-based security point to Israel's successful use of demographic profiling, intelligence databases, and security interviews to identify high-risk passengers. These individuals undergo heightened screening measures and in-depth inquiries before boarding, leading to Israel's avoidance of major terrorist attacks for over 40 years. Israel has successfully avoided major terrorist attacks against its airlines and airports for over 40 years by using demographic profiling, intelligence databases, and security interviews to identify high-risk passengers. The effectiveness of these methods in deterring attacks is uncertain, but adopting a similar approach in the United States is seen as legally and practically challenging. Research suggests that a risk-based approach tailored to the U.S. aviation security framework would be more effective, politically feasible, socially acceptable, and legally defensible. A risk-based approach tailored to the U.S. aviation security framework would be more effective, politically feasible, socially acceptable, and legally defensible than the Israeli airport security model. This approach involves comprehensive, multi-layered security measures that interact with physical screening checkpoint measures. Risk-based programs interact with physical screening measures to focus resources on unknown and elevated risk passengers, informing security protocols and adjustments based on threats. These programs help identify passengers for closer observation and high-risk flights, potentially impacting the deployment of behavioral detection officers and air marshals. Details of how these components interact have not been publicly disclosed. Flights may be considered high-risk, with risk-based approaches to airline passenger screening dating back to the early 1970s. Before 100% screening of all passengers in 1973, the FAA used rudimentary passenger profiles to determine screening. In the late 1970s, as security measures like metal detectors and X-ray scanners became mandatory, risk-based profiling techniques were largely abandoned. FAA continued to utilize profiling tools for screening. In the late 1980s, FAA required airlines to ask passengers basic security questions to target elevated-risk checked baggage. The FAA required airlines in the late 1980s to ask basic security questions to target elevated-risk checked baggage. These questions aimed to raise passenger awareness of security threats posed by bombers trying to deceive individuals into carrying devices on aircraft. While criticized for being obvious and posed by agents with little security training, some countries and airlines still use similar questions for security screening. After the FAA required airlines to ask security questions in the late 1980s, the Computer-Assisted Passenger Pre-Screening (CAPPS) system was developed following the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. CAPPS, now overseen by TSA, uses flight reservation data to identify potential security threats. TSA eliminated the use of security questions in 2006. After the 9/11 attacks, TSA established requirements for trusted passengers based on flight reservation data to identify potential security threats. Indicators may include purchasing one-way tickets or paying with cash. The FAA, in coordination with the FBI, developed the \"no-fly\" list of known terrorists to be denied boarding, but only 12 names were on the list on 9/11, none of them the hijackers. After the 9/11 attacks, TSA established trusted traveler programs to expedite screening for passengers, focusing on potential security threats. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 directed TSA to use CAPPS or a successor system to evaluate all passengers before boarding. After the 9/11 attacks, TSA established trusted traveler programs to expedite screening for passengers, focusing on potential security threats. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 directed that CAPPS or any successor system be used to evaluate all passengers prior to boarding, emphasizing risk-based screening and recommendations from the Department of Transportation Airport Security Rapid Response Team. After the 9/11 attacks, TSA established trusted traveler programs for screening passengers. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 mandated the use of CAPPS or its successor, leading to the development of CAPPS II for enhanced passenger risk assessment and security measures. The TSA developed CAPPS II to screen passengers against terrorist watchlists, but controversy over privacy issues led to its cancellation in 2004. The 9/11 Commission recommended improving the \"no fly\" and \"automatic selectee\" lists for better passenger screening. The 9/11 Commission recommended in 2004 that TSA take over passenger watchlist screening from air carriers, as part of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 required TSA to take over passenger watchlist screening from air carriers and establish the Secure Flight program, which utilized the Terrorist Screening Database. TSA was prohibited from using algorithms to assign risk scores or commercial data for assessing passenger risk. The program was implemented for domestic flights in 2009 and international flights in 2010. The Secure Flight program, implemented in 2009 for domestic flights and 2010 for international flights, screens passenger biographic information against terrorist watchlists, including the TSDB. The TSDB contains fewer than 400,000 names, with about 50,000 identities on the \"no fly\" or \"selectee\" lists. The Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE) has grown to include about 875,000 names, serving as a principal data source for foreign terrorist identities in the TSDB. The expansion of TIDE was due to increased reliance after the failed bombing attempt on Northwest Flight 253 in 2009. The TSDB has also expanded. The TSDB has expanded to include over 500,000 identities since 2012, with a focus on improving watchlist practices after the failed bombing attempt on Northwest Flight 253 in 2009. Secure Flight compares passenger data against watchlists to determine access. Secure Flight compares passenger data from airline passenger name records against various watchlists, including the \"no fly\" and \"selectee\" lists, as well as the full TSDB. It also checks against a list provided by the CDC for public health concerns. If no potential match is found, records are destroyed within seven days. Secure Flight compares passenger data against watchlists, including \"no fly\" and \"selectee\" lists, as well as the TSDB and a CDC list for public health concerns. Records are destroyed within seven days if no match is found. Potential matches are retained for 7 years, confirmed matches for up to 99 years. Known traveler lists are kept until updated, benefiting from experience with APIS. The Advance Passenger Information System (APIS) administered by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) collects passenger manifest data from airlines for international flights to the United States. CBP cross-checks the data against law enforcement, customs, and immigration databases and terrorist watchlists using the Automated Targeting System-Passenger (ATS-P) for risk assessments on travelers. The Automated Targeting System-Passenger (ATS-P) is used by CBP to assess inbound international travelers for potential risks, comparing passenger data against terrorist and law enforcement databases to identify threats. The system, originally designed for cargo screening in the 1990s, does not use a risk scoring method but looks for red flags such as stolen passports. The Automated Targeting System (ATS) is used by CBP to identify potential matches to terrorist identities and wanted criminals, as well as red flags like suspected use of lost or stolen passports. Data in the ATS may be retained for up to 15 years, with passenger name record data depersonalized within six months. Passports from Visa Waiver Program countries must be electronically screened. The data from travelers is transferred to a dormant database for up to 10 years. Travelers with passports from Visa Waiver Program countries must submit biographical information through the Electronic System for Travel Authorization before boarding a U.S.-bound flight. This information is checked against various databases for potential threats. Secure Flight uses risk-based analysis with data from government agencies and airlines. The Secure Flight program employs risk-based analysis using data from government agencies and airlines to identify potential threats. The TSA's Screening Passengers by Observational Techniques (SPOT) program, which began testing in 2003, aims to detect threats by observing passenger behavior at airports. Despite deploying almost 3,000 Behavior Detection Officers (BDOs) at 176 airports by FY2012, costing around $200 million annually, questions persist regarding the program's scientific validity and operational effectiveness. TSA defends its behavior detection and analysis program amidst ongoing controversy. The TSA's SPOT program is based on scientifically validated behaviors to identify potential threats in airport passengers. It utilizes law enforcement techniques like criminal profiling and behavioral observation. TSA claims these techniques have been used in various security contexts for many years. The SPOT program utilizes behavior analysis techniques that have been used in law enforcement, customs, defense, and security for years. However, SPOT differs from law enforcement behavior analysis tools by focusing on large groups of individuals and interpreting non-verbal cues. The TSA SPOT program focuses on non-verbal cues for behavior detection, using observation techniques and a formal scoring system to rate suspicion. Law enforcement agencies use similar techniques but in combination with other interrogation methods. The TSA SPOT program utilizes non-verbal cues for behavior detection by behavior detection officers, who can observe an average passenger in less than 30 seconds. Despite TSA's claims of effectiveness, the Government Accountability Office reported concerns about the program's ability to identify specific threats to aviation. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported concerns about the TSA SPOT program's effectiveness in identifying specific threats to aviation. On multiple occasions, known terrorists passed through checkpoints where Behavior Detection Officers (BDOs) were stationed. GAO could not confirm any arrests of terrorists or individuals planning terrorist activities through the SPOT program. TSA responded by conducting validation studies with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate and the American Institutes. TSA conducted validation studies with DHS and American Institutes to improve behavior detection techniques, which were found to be nine times more effective than random selection. The agency has not publicly released the study for independent analysis but has taken steps to address GAO recommendations for program improvement. TSA has also collaborated with international partners for operational exchange. Despite positive validation study results, doubts persist about behavior detection techniques in the SPOT program. GAO and DHS Inspector General question the validity and utility of TSA's methods. TSA has partnered with international counterparts to exchange information and improve the program. The GAO concluded that the evidence did not support the validity and utility of behavior detection techniques used by TSA. Concerns were raised about the metrics used to evaluate the program, as they do not directly relate to TSA's mission to deter, detect, and prevent terrorism. Developing suitable metrics to evaluate the impact of the SPOT program on mission objectives has been challenging due to the low occurrence of terrorist acts. The effectiveness of the SPOT program in aviation security is questioned due to low occurrence of terrorist acts. GAO and DHS audits found discrepancies in metrics and training of Behavior Detection Officers, raising concerns about the program's impact on mission objectives. The Inspector General's audits revealed significant lapses in records-keeping and training for Behavior Detection Officers in the SPOT program, raising concerns about the program's effectiveness in aviation security. TSA did not consistently offer refresher training for officers, leading to questions about the quality and consistency of training. The effectiveness of the SPOT program for passenger screening has been questioned due to lapses in training and evaluation of BDO instructors. Despite concerns raised by GAO and the DHS Office of Inspector General, Congress has not taken specific action to revamp or eliminate the program. TSA's Pre-Check program, aimed at expediting processing for low-risk passengers, has received positive feedback since its full implementation in 2012. The program, available at no cost to select frequent flyers and paid members of trusted traveler programs, has been gradually expanding in scope and availability. The Pre-Check program, available at no cost to select frequent flyers and trusted traveler program members, resembles the former Registered Traveler program. It was implemented under a public-private partnership model with multiple vendors providing biographical and biometric data collection and storage. The Registered Traveler program, launched in 2007 at 19 airports, involved biographical and biometric data collection for expedited screening. Background checks were initially conducted but later eliminated in 2008 as they were deemed unnecessary for determining threats. In 2008, TSA eliminated background checks and program fees for the Registered Traveler program, stating they were not essential for threat determination. The program was discontinued. Under Pre-Check, TSA now conducts extensive biographic-based background checks, contrary to their previous stance. Approved individuals receive a known traveler number for flight reservations, without a biometric credential. Pre-Check issues a known traveler number for expedited screening, but random physical screenings may still occur. TSA's reliance on boarding passes for authentication raises concerns about document and traveler identification verification. TSA's authentication concerns stem from limited ability to authenticate boarding passes and traveler identification documents, with delays in deploying Credential Authentication Technology/Boarding Pass Scanning Systems. Without proper authentication, access to Pre-Check screening lanes may not be restricted to cleared individuals at all airports. In 2013, TSA introduced a system for the public to apply for the Pre-Check program. In 2013, TSA introduced a system for the public to apply for the Pre-Check program, requiring biographic and biometric data submission for security threat assessments using law enforcement and intelligence databases. TSA conducts security threat assessments of individuals using law enforcement, immigration, and intelligence databases, including FBI criminal history records checks. Pre-Check applications are accepted from U.S. citizens, nationals, and legal permanent residents. Applicants may be deemed ineligible if convicted of certain crimes within specified time periods. TSA may also reject applicants with extensive criminal convictions, foreign or domestic. TSA conducts security threat assessments for Pre-Check applicants using various databases. Applicants with certain criminal convictions may be rejected. A non-refundable fee of $85 is required, and approved travelers receive a Known Traveler Number valid for five years. Rejected applicants can appeal within 30 days. To apply for Pre-Check, individuals must provide certified records to appeal a rejection within 30 days. The $85 fee is non-refundable, so applicants with concerns about disqualification based on criminal record or eligibility may choose not to apply. TSA opened the first Pre-Check enrollment center in December 2013. TSA opened the first Pre-Check enrollment center for the general public in December 2013 at the Indianapolis, IN, airport. There will eventually be 300 enrollment centers nationwide with an online application process. Applicants can pre-enroll online but must visit a physical site for identification and fingerprinting. Frequent travelers are generally satisfied with Pre-Check, with a 2012 survey showing 54% approval. The Pre-Check program has been well-received by frequent travelers, with a 2012 survey showing high satisfaction rates. However, the rapid expansion of the program may lead to longer wait times in Pre-Check lanes. The Pre-Check program aims to expedite screening for half of all airline passengers by the end of FY2015. As the program grows, wait times in Pre-Check lanes may increase, but non-participating travelers could benefit from shorter wait times as more people join. Non-participating travelers may also be randomly selected for Pre-Check lanes through Secure Flight assessments or managed inclusion. Managed inclusion is a TSA initiative for real-time threat assessments of passengers, allowing low-risk individuals to be randomly selected for expedited screening using Pre-Check lanes. Canine teams and behavioral detection officers perform initial screening, and if no elevated risk is detected, passengers may be included in the expedited process. Upon stepping on a mat in front of the travel document checker's kiosk, a passenger triggers a directional arrow indicating whether to proceed to regular screening lanes or a Pre-Check expedited lane, based on random selection. Military servicemembers, including active duty, reservists, and National Guard members, are also allowed to use Pre-Check lanes. Military servicemembers, including active duty, reservists, and National Guard members, are allowed to use Pre-Check screening lanes for official and personal travel. Family members under 12 can also use Pre-Check lanes when traveling with cleared military personnel. Civilian employees of the Department of Defense and the Coast Guard will be allowed to participate in expedited screening starting in mid-April 2014. Civilian employees of the Department of Defense and the Coast Guard will be allowed to participate in expedited screening without enrolling in Pre-Check or a CBP trusted traveler program. Pre-Check lanes are also used for uniformed airline crewmembers, including pilots and flight attendants, who undergo TSA-managed criminal history checks for eligibility. Airline crews undergo TSA-managed background checks for expedited screening, including fingerprint-based criminal history record checks and security threat assessments. The Known Crew Member database verifies crew credentials for eligibility. Background screening for airline crews is equivalent to Pre-Check applicants, and may be more extensive for military personnel and civilian employees with defense secret clearances. The background investigation for military personnel and civilian employees with defense secret clearances is extensive, despite recent criticism. TSA views these individuals as lower risk compared to the general population. The credentialing process for military, defense personnel, and airline crews ensures secure identity verification for expedited screening. The TSA uses random selection for certain military servicemembers, defense personnel, and airline crews for standard screening, adding an unpredictable element to security. Risk-based screening programs collect biographic and biometric data, along with intelligence sources. The TSA's risk-based screening programs collect and retain various forms of biographic, biometric, and identifying data on individuals, including data from intelligence sources. Each program has its own data collection and retention rules. TSA aims to delete data no longer needed, but records of individuals matching terrorist or criminal databases are kept for extended periods. Data of traveling individuals matching terrorist or criminal databases are retained for extended periods, while other records are destroyed shortly after travel. Voluntarily submitted data, like Pre-Check applications, is kept unless updated. TSA uses commercial databases for validation but does not share information with consumer reporting agencies. The Department of Homeland Security collects personal data for risk assessments and identity validation, sharing it among DHS agencies for counterterrorism and security purposes. Data may also be shared with intelligence, law enforcement, and judicial agencies at various levels for investigations and oversight. The Privacy Act of 1974 and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 require data protection and appeals procedures for individuals identified as security threats based on records in the TSDB. The Privacy Act of 1974 and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 mandate data protection and appeals procedures for individuals labeled as security threats in the TSDB. The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 established the DHS Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (DHS TRIP) to correct erroneous information and provide a fair process for individuals wrongly identified as threats. The DHS TRIP program was established to address situations where individuals claim to have been wrongly identified, allowing them to file complaints online or by mail. Filers receive a control number to track the status of their inquiry, and if a misidentification is found, the traveler may be delayed. The DHS TRIP program allows individuals to file complaints if they believe they have been wrongly identified. They receive a control number to track their inquiry status. If a misidentification is found, steps are provided to resolve the issue, such as presenting a DHS response letter during check-in. Passengers can appeal DHS decisions, but TSA decisions under the Secure Flight program are mostly exempt from judicial review. TSA decisions under the Secure Flight program are largely exempt from judicial review. In January 2013, TSA sought information to expand expedited screening by using third-party prescreening of passengers based on non-governmental data elements to assess aviation security risks. The TSA is considering using third-party data services to identify individuals who have passed a risk assessment for the Secure Flight program. Concerns have been raised about privacy and data accuracy in using commercial databases for passenger risk assessments. The TSA is considering using third-party data services for passenger risk assessments, raising concerns about privacy and data accuracy. Non-federal government and private databases may already be used for passenger prescreening, including CBP's ATS and other programs like Secure Flight and Pre-Check applications. The TSA is exploring the use of third-party data for passenger risk assessments, including CBP's ATS, Secure Flight, Pre-Check applications, and TSA's Transportation Security Enforcement Records System. Congress had previously restricted the use of commercial data in airline passenger prescreening. Congress previously restricted the use of commercial data in airline passenger prescreening, including prohibiting the use of non-governmental sources for assessing passenger risk. Congressional oversight and potential legislative action may be necessary as TSA's risk-based approaches evolve. TSA's risk-based approaches to passenger prescreening are evolving, raising concerns about the use of commercial data and behavioral profiling techniques. Congressional oversight is crucial to review TSA's risk-based screening programs for effectiveness, efficiency, and data security and privacy safeguards. The TSA's risk-based approach to airline passenger screening is being reviewed for effectiveness, efficiency, and data security. Experts suggest that risk-based screening should be part of a comprehensive security strategy. The TSA's risk-based approach to airline passenger screening, including programs like Pre-Check, should fit within a comprehensive security strategy. It is important to assess how well this approach can adapt to new threats and technologies. The evolution of screening processes, including the Pre-Check program, is adaptive and evolving. Details on terrorist watchlists and behavioral profiling techniques are not publicly disclosed. Changes made in response to security threats have not been publicly acknowledged. Information on the evolution of behavioral detection methods by TSA remains undisclosed. The evolution and adaptation of TSA's behavioral detection methods and risk-based strategies have not been publicly disclosed. Congressional oversight may be interested in how these strategies have adapted to changing threat landscapes and new technologies. Identifying suitable metrics to assess the effectiveness of TSA's risk-based strategies has been challenging due to necessary secrecy. Identifying suitable metrics for assessing the effectiveness of TSA's risk-based strategies has been challenging due to necessary secrecy and limited encounters with individuals tied to terrorism. TSA's choice of metrics for behavioral detection programs has been questioned, while efficiency metrics are emphasized for programs like Pre-Check over security effectiveness metrics. TSA has focused on efficiency metrics rather than security effectiveness metrics, leading to concerns about false alarms and misallocation of screening resources. The limited number of terrorist encounters raises questions about the prevalence of false positives in threat detection efforts. High false alarm rates in aviation passenger pre-screening can have significant consequences by misdirecting limited screening resources and causing complications for individuals mistakenly targeted as threats. Efforts to reduce false alarms have focused on thorough, accurate, and up-to-date information in terrorist databases, as well as implementing a redress process for falsely targeted individuals. The effectiveness of steps to reduce false alarm rates in aviation passenger pre-screening has not been publicly disclosed. Assessing anticipated efficiency gains from risk-based screening initiatives is crucial for oversight of TSA operations and appropriations. TSA expects savings of $120 million and staffing reductions of over 1,500 full-time positions in FY2015. Congressional oversight may examine if these gains can be achieved without compromising security. The TSA expects savings of $120 million and staffing reductions of more than 1,500 full-time positions in FY2015. Congressional oversight may examine efficiency gains without compromising security. Privacy and data protections are of interest to Congress, with DHS implementing practices to protect personal data. The implementation of privacy protections and data security measures is a concern as TSA moves forward with a risk-based approach to passenger screening. The TSA's implementation of privacy protections and data security measures is a concern as they move forward with a risk-based approach to passenger screening. Questions persist about the integration of various programs and elements, adaptation to changes in the threat landscape, resource availability, and effectiveness assessment metrics. The TSA's risk-based approach to passenger screening raises concerns about privacy protections, data security, resource availability, and effectiveness assessment metrics. Despite elaborate security measures post-9/11, the potential for a large-scale attack remains. Despite post-9/11 security measures, the potential for a large-scale aviation attack remains. Balancing privacy with effective risk-based security strategies will continue to be a key issue in aviation security policy and potential congressional oversight."
