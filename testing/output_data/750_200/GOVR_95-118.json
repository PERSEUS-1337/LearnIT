    "content": "The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) was established by ERISA to protect pensions of participants in private sector defined benefit plans. PBGC insures single-employer and multiemployer pension plans, but not defined contribution plans like 401(k)s. In FY2018, PBGC insured 25,000 DB pension plans covering 37 million people, with 1.4 million people receiving benefits. PBGC is the trustee of 4,919 single-employer plans and provided financial assistance to 78 multiemployer pensions. PBGC pays a maximum benefit to plan participants in single-employer and multiemployer plans. PBGC provided financial assistance to 78 multiemployer pensions, with most workers receiving their full pension benefits. Among participants in terminated multiemployer plans likely needing future assistance, 49% have benefits below the PBGC maximum guarantee, while 51% have benefits exceeding it. PBGC, a government-owned corporation, is overseen by a three-member board of directors chaired by the Secretary of Labor, with the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Treasury also serving on the board. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) is overseen by a three-member board of directors chaired by the Secretary of Labor, with the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the Treasury also serving on the board. The Director of PBGC is appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. Additionally, there is a seven-member Advisory Committee appointed by the President for staggered three-year terms to advise PBGC on various issues. The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21; P.L. 112-141) made changes to the governance structures of PBGC, including setting the term of the PBGC Director. The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21; P.L. 112-141) changed PBGC governance structures, including the Director's term set at five years, Board of Directors meeting frequency, and the establishment of a Participant and Plan Sponsor Advocate. PBGC is self-supporting and does not receive general revenue appropriations. PBGC is self-supporting and does not receive general revenue appropriations. The main source of revenue for PBGC is premiums set by Congress and paid by private-sector employers sponsoring DB pension plans, along with assets from terminated plans, investment income, and recoveries from companies ending underfunded pension plans. Members of Congress have been hesitant to provide financial assistance to PBGC, as ERISA states that the United States is not liable for any obligations incurred by the corporation. The PBGC's main revenue sources are premiums paid by private-sector employers sponsoring DB pension plans, assets from terminated plans, investment income, and recoveries from companies ending underfunded pension plans. Premiums include flat-rate per-participant premiums for single-employer and multiemployer plans, additional premiums for underfunded single-employer plans, and per-participant premiums for terminated plans for three years. The PBGC collects premiums from private-sector employers with DB pension plans, including flat-rate and variable-rate premiums for single-employer plans. Terminated plans pay a per-participant premium for three years after termination. Premiums for 2019 include $80 per participant for the flat-rate premium and an additional $43 for each $1,000 of unfunded vested benefits for underfunded plans. The PBGC collects premiums from private-sector employers with DB pension plans, including flat-rate and variable-rate premiums for single-employer plans. Single-employer termination premium is $1,250 per participant per year for three years following plan termination. Multiemployer flat-rate premium is $29 per participant in 2019. PBGC covers only DB plans that meet qualification requirements of Section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code. The PBGC collects premiums from private-sector employers with DB pension plans, covering plans that meet Section 401 qualification requirements of the Internal Revenue Code. DC plans like 401(k) and 403(b) are not insured. Meeting IRC Section 401 requirements allows tax benefits for qualified pension plans, with employer contributions as tax-deductible expenses. Participant income from the plan is taxed as ordinary income. Pension plans must meet specific requirements under the IRC to be qualified, with earnings taxed as ordinary income. Plans excluded from PBGC insurance include governmental, church, and fraternal society plans funded by member contributions. Plans excluded from PBGC insurance include governmental, church, and fraternal society plans funded by member contributions. PBGC's insurance programs operate differently for single-employer and multiemployer plans, with separate reserve funds for each program. PBGC becomes the trustee of terminated, underfunded single-employer DB pension plans in the single-employer program. In the single-employer program, PBGC becomes the trustee of terminated, underfunded DB pension plans. Assets are placed in a trust fund operated by PBGC, and participants receive benefits from PBGC. In the multiemployer program, PBGC provides loans to insolvent plans unable to pay participant benefits. Employers can terminate single-employer plans in standard or distress terminations, notifying participants and PBGC accordingly. An employer can terminate a single-employer pension plan voluntarily in standard or distress termination. PBGC may also involuntarily terminate an underfunded plan if the sponsor cannot fund its obligations. If a company ends its pension plan voluntarily with sufficient assets to cover liabilities, PBGC does not pay benefits to participants but confirms termination requirements are met. Benefit liabilities include all earned benefits for participants, vested and nonvested. Benefit liabilities for termination include all benefits earned by plan participants, including vested and nonvested benefits, early retirement supplements, and subsidies. Assets cover liabilities, and the plan purchases annuity contracts or provides benefits directly to participants. The plan covers benefit payments by purchasing annuity contracts or providing lump-sum distributions. Excess assets can be recovered through an asset reversion, subject to an excise tax. The tax rate is 20% if a replacement plan is established, otherwise 50%. When an underfunded plan terminates in distress or involuntary termination, PBGC takes control of assets and liabilities, making payments for benefit liabilities from plan assets and employer recoveries. Guaranteed benefits are paid from PBGC's funds. If assets in a plan are insufficient to cover benefit liabilities, an employer may not terminate the plan unless meeting specific criteria for a \"distress\" termination, such as filing for bankruptcy or similar insolvency proceedings. The criteria for a \"distress\" termination of a pension plan include liquidation in bankruptcy, reorganization in bankruptcy or similar state proceedings, approval by the bankruptcy court, determination by PBGC for debt payment or to avoid pension cost burdens. The criteria for a \"distress\" termination of a pension plan include liquidation in bankruptcy, reorganization in bankruptcy, approval by the bankruptcy court, or determination by PBGC for debt payment or to avoid pension cost burdens. Termination may be necessary for the employer to pay debts on time or to avoid excessive pension costs due to a workforce decline. These requirements were established by SEPPAA, modified by P.L. 100-203 and RPA, to ensure underfunded plan liabilities remain the employer's responsibility unless strict financial need standards are met. PBGC may terminate a plan involuntarily if it does not meet minimum funding standards, cannot pay benefits, has a substantial owner who received over $10,000, or if PBGC expects unreasonable losses. PBGC may terminate a plan involuntarily if it does not meet minimum funding standards, cannot pay benefits, has a substantial owner who received over $10,000, or if PBGC expects unreasonable losses. Additionally, PBGC must terminate a plan if it is unable to pay benefits currently due, and a federal court may order termination to protect participants' interests or avoid financial deterioration. Table 2 shows the number of terminations by single-employer DB pension plans since 1974. Since 1974, PBGC has become the trustee of 4,769 single-employer DB pension plans due to terminations. Most terminations are standard, but following distress or involuntary termination, the plan sponsor and their controlled group are liable to PBGC for the plan's shortfall. The plan sponsor and their controlled group are jointly liable to PBGC for the plan's shortfall, which is the plan's liabilities minus its assets at termination. The liability is payable in cash or securities, and failure to pay may result in a lien on the sponsor's property. When a plan undergoes a distress termination, PBGC may place a lien on the property of the contributing employer's controlled group. However, if the plan sponsor is in bankruptcy, PBGC cannot create a lien. In such cases, PBGC has limited ability to recover assets as it is treated like other creditors. The benefits PBGC pays upon plan termination depend on guaranteed benefit limits, plan assets, and recoveries from the employer. PBGC guarantees retirement benefits up to statutory limits based on the terminated plan's assets and recoveries from the employer. Guaranteed benefits include vested retirement benefits and certain death, survivor, or disability benefits. Only monthly installment retirement benefits are guaranteed. The PBGC guarantees retirement benefits in monthly installments, with guarantees for early retirement benefits and contingent benefits triggered before plan termination. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 phased in PBGC guarantees over five years for certain benefits. ERISA sets a maximum on benefits for participants in single-employer pension plans. The PBGC guarantees retirement benefits in monthly installments, with guarantees for early retirement benefits and contingent benefits triggered before plan termination. ERISA sets a maximum on benefits for participants in single-employer pension plans, with a maximum pension guarantee of $67,295 a year for workers aged 65 in plans that terminate in 2019. This amount is adjusted annually and may decrease based on the participant's age or the form of benefit payment. The PBGC guarantees retirement benefits in monthly installments, with a maximum pension guarantee of $67,295 a year for workers aged 65 in plans that terminate in 2019. Benefits may vary based on age and form of payment, with reductions for early retirement before age 65. The PBGC guarantees retirement benefits with a maximum pension guarantee of $67,295 a year for workers aged 65 in plans that terminate in 2019. Benefits may vary based on age and form of payment, with reductions for early retirement before age 65. The reduction in the maximum guarantee for benefits paid before age 65 is 7% for each of the first 5 years, 4% for the next 5 years, and 2% for the following 10 years. Only \"basic benefits\" are guaranteed, including benefits starting at normal retirement age, certain early retirement and disability benefits. The PBGC guarantees retirement benefits with a maximum pension guarantee of $67,295 a year for workers aged 65 in plans that terminate in 2019. Basic benefits include benefits starting at normal retirement age, certain early retirement and disability benefits, and benefits for survivors. Vested benefits are insured, with an average monthly benefit of $606 for retirees in FY2015. Over 80% of PBGC recipients in single-employer plans received their full benefits, with an average reduction of 28% for those whose benefits were reduced. Terminated plan assets are allocated to pay benefits based on a priority schedule. Assets of a terminated plan are allocated to pay benefits according to a priority schedule established by statute. Some nonguaranteed benefits are payable before certain guaranteed benefits. Participants who have been receiving pension payments for more than three years have priority over guaranteed benefits of participants not yet receiving payments. PBGC also pays participants a portion of their unfunded, nonguaranteed benefits based on a ratio of assets recovered from the employer to the amount of PBGC's claim on employer assets. In the case of multiemployer plans, PBGC insures plan. In the case of multiemployer plans, PBGC insures plan insolvency, rather than plan termination. A plan is insolvent when its available resources are not sufficient to pay the plan benefits for the plan year in question. If it appears that available resources will not be sufficient to pay benefits due in the next plan year, the plan is considered insolvent. The PBGC provides additional resources as loans to multiemployer plans that are insolvent and unable to pay benefits. These loans are rarely repaid, and if the plan recovers, it must repay the loans on reasonable terms. Only one multiemployer plan has repaid any financial assistance from PBGC. The PBGC guarantees benefits to multiemployer plans with a different guarantee ceiling. Benefits are determined by multiplying a flat dollar rate by years of service. The benefit guarantee limit for participants is tied to a formula based on years of service and benefit rate. For a participant with 30 years of service, the guaranteed limit is $12,870, not adjusted for increases in the national wage index. The PBGC guarantees benefits to multiemployer plans based on a formula tied to years of service and benefit rate. In 2015, PBGC estimated that 79% of participants in plans receiving financial assistance received their full benefit, while only 49% would in plans needing assistance in the future. Ongoing plans have almost double the average benefit compared to terminated plans. The PBGC guarantees benefits to multiemployer plans based on a formula tied to years of service and benefit rate. In 2015, 79% of participants in plans receiving financial assistance received their full benefit, while only 49% would in plans needing assistance in the future. The average benefit in ongoing plans is almost twice as large as in terminated plans, indicating a higher likelihood of benefit reductions for participants in plans receiving PBGC financial assistance. PBGC's net financial position at the end of FY2018 was -$51.4 billion, with assets at $112.3 billion and liabilities at $163.7 billion. PBGC's liabilities were $163.7 billion, with a net financial position of -$51.4 billion. Its main assets include the trust fund and revolving funds, while its main liabilities consist of future benefit payments and financial assistance to insolvent plans. PBGC's net financial position has been in deficit since FY2002, mainly due to costly plan terminations in industries like steel and airlines. By FY2018, the single-employer program showed a surplus for the first time since FY2001, partly due to increased employer premiums. The PBGC had a deficit of $23.3 billion. The single-employer program showed a surplus in FY2018 for the first time since FY2001. The multiemployer program had deficits since FY2002 and is projected to become insolvent in FY2025. Both programs are on the GAO's list of high-risk government programs. Approximately 825,000 participants received monthly payments from PBGC in FY2015. Approximately 825,000 participants received monthly payments from PBGC in FY2015, with an average monthly payment of $536. Among retiree payees, the average monthly benefit was $606, and among beneficiary payees, it was $307. Around 40,000 participants received a lump-sum payment in FY2015, with an average amount of $2,054. PBGC's single-employer program showed a surplus in FY1996. In FY2018, PBGC's single-employer program displayed a surplus of $2.44 billion, attributed to factors like investment income and increased premium income. The surplus peaked at $9.7 billion in FY2000, aided by strong equity market performance in the late 1990s. In FY2018, PBGC's single-employer program had a surplus of $2.44 billion, driven by factors like investment income and increased premium income. Table 6 shows data on plans receiving financial assistance, with 78 plans receiving assistance in FY2018. Approximately 62,300 participants received assistance in FY2018, with 27,800 expected to receive benefits in the future. Figure 2 illustrates the financial assistance trend. The deficit in the multiemployer insurance program increased significantly from $8.3 billion in FY2013 to $65.1 billion in FY2017, before decreasing to $53.8 billion in FY2018. This rise was due to the likelihood of insolvency in several distressed pension plans. PBGC's budget relies on premium and interest income, benefit outlays, and cash flows. The PBGC faces insolvency of large multiemployer pension plans in financial distress. Its budget relies on premium income, interest income, benefit outlays, trust fund assets, and revolving funds. When PBGC becomes trustee of a pension plan, assets are transferred to PBGC nonbudgetary. The PBGC becomes trustee of terminated pension plans, transferring assets to a nonbudgetary trust fund managed by private-sector money managers. The trust fund's investment policy allocates 30% to equities and 70% to fixed income, totaling $70.2 billion in investments by FY2018. The PBGC's trust fund assets are allocated with 30% in equities and 70% in fixed income, totaling $70.2 billion by FY2018. Three out of seven authorized revolving funds are used by PBGC, funded by premiums and trust fund transfers to pay benefits, invested exclusively in U.S. Treasury securities. The PBGC's revolving funds, totaling $33.2 billion at the end of FY2018, are on-budget accounts invested in U.S. Treasury securities. These funds pay for participants' benefits through PBGC benefit payments, administrative expenses, premiums, and reimbursements from the trust fund. In FY2018, PBGC's revolving funds of $33.2 billion are invested in U.S. Treasury securities and cover participants' benefits, administrative expenses, premiums, and trust fund reimbursements. Recent premium increases have been criticized for potentially offsetting federal spending, not improving PBGC's financial condition, and discouraging employers from maintaining DB pension plans. PBGC's FY2017 Projections Report forecasts a shrinking deficit for the single-employer program and stability for the multiemployer program over the next decade. PBGC's report projected a $26 billion surplus for the single-employer program in 10 years, with the program likely to emerge from deficit by FY2018. However, the multiemployer program is expected to run out of money by FY2025, with a 90% chance of insolvency before the end of FY2025 and a 99% chance by 2026 due to the likely insolvency of large pension plans. The PBGC's FY2018 Annual Report projected a $53.8 billion exposure for the multiemployer program, indicating a high likelihood of insolvency for several large pension plans by 2026. Premium levels may not be sufficient to provide ongoing financial assistance, potentially exhausting PBGC's ability to guarantee benefits. Once resources are depleted, insolvent plans may need to reduce benefits to sustainable levels through premium collections. The Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 allows insolvent plans to reduce benefits to sustainable levels through premium collections, improving PBGC's financial condition by reducing the need for future financial assistance. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 created a new committee to address concerns about the solvency of multiemployer pension plans, which could potentially improve PBGC's financial condition by reducing the need for future financial assistance. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 established a Joint Select Committee on Solvency of Multiemployer Pension Plans to improve the financial stability of these plans and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. The committee was supposed to provide recommendations by November 30, 2018, but did not meet the deadline. Historical data on premium levels for single-employer and multiemployer programs is provided in tables A-1 and A-2."
