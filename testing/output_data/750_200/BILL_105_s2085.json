    "content": "The Act titled \"Fairness for Small Business and Employees Act of 1998\" is also known as the \"Truth in Employment\" Act. It includes findings related to employment practices. Congress finds that trust and civility in labor-management relationships are crucial for a productive workplace and economy. The practice of \"salting\" with union organizers infiltrating workplaces has become a form of harassment that threatens the balance of collective bargaining rights. Union organizers are increasingly seeking employment. Union organizers are increasingly seeking employment with nonunion employers to organize employees or cause economic harm, threatening the balance of collective bargaining rights. Employers should expect job applicants to be primarily interested in utilizing their skills. Employers should expect job applicants to be primarily interested in utilizing their skills to further the goals of the business. SEC. 102. PURPOSES.\n\nThe purposes of this title are to preserve the balance of rights between employers, employees, and labor organizations, protect workers' rights to organize, and prevent pressure on employers to hire disruptive individuals. The National Labor Relations Act is amended to clarify that employers are not required to hire individuals who seek employment primarily to further another employment or agency status. This does not affect the rights of bona fide employee applicants under the Act. The National Labor Relations Act ensures the rights of bona fide employee applicants to form labor organizations, bargain collectively, and engage in concerted activities for mutual aid or protection. TITLE II--FAIR HEARING\n\nSEC. 201. FINDINGS. The findings in Section 201 highlight the need for case-by-case analysis in determining bargaining units and criticize blanket rules that limit factors considered in such determinations. The purpose of this title is to ensure that the National Labor Relations Board conducts a hearing process and specific analysis to determine the appropriateness of a single location bargaining unit. Section 9(c) of the National Labor Relations Act is amended to include a provision for a hearing to determine the appropriateness of a bargaining unit that includes employees from multiple facilities of a single employer. The Board will consider factors like functional integration and centralized control in making this determination. The National Labor Relations Act is amended to include a provision for a hearing to determine the appropriateness of a bargaining unit, considering factors like functional integration, centralized control, common skills, functions, working conditions, employee interchange, geographical separation, local autonomy, number of employees, and bargaining history. TITLE III--ATTORNEYS FEES\n\nSEC. 301. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE. Congress finds that small businesses and labor organizations lack expertise and resources when facing actions by the National Labor Relations Board. The Equal Access to Justice Act has not effectively leveled the playing field for these entities in their dealings with the Board, which has greater expertise and resources. The National Labor Relations Board has greater expertise and resources compared to small businesses and labor organizations. To ensure that these entities are not deterred from seeking review or defending against actions by the Board due to expenses, a standard is needed to award fees and costs to certain small entities when they prevail. The National Labor Relations Board has more resources and expertise than small businesses and labor organizations. To address the disparity, fees and costs should be awarded to small entities when they prevail against the Board, making it more accountable for its enforcement actions. The National Labor Relations Act is amended to include a new section allowing for the award of attorneys' fees and costs to small entities who prevail against the National Labor Relations Board, holding the Board more accountable for its enforcement actions. The National Labor Relations Act is amended to allow small entities with fewer than 100 employees and a net worth of not more than $1,400,000 to be awarded fees and expenses as a prevailing party in adversary adjudications conducted by the Board, regardless of the Board's justification. The National Labor Relations Act is amended to allow small entities with fewer than 100 employees and a net worth of not more than $1,400,000 to be awarded fees and expenses as a prevailing party in adversary adjudications conducted by the Board, without considering the Board's justification. Small entities with fewer than 100 employees and a net worth of not more than $1,400,000 can be awarded fees and expenses as a prevailing party in civil actions brought against the Board, without considering the justification of the United States. Appeals regarding fee determinations will also not consider the justification of the United States. Small entities with fewer than 100 employees and a net worth of not more than $1,400,000 can be awarded fees and expenses as a prevailing party in civil actions brought against the Board, without considering the justification of the United States. Appeals regarding fee determinations will also not consider the justification of the United States. SEC. 303 of the National Labor Relations Act applies to agency and court proceedings initiated after the enactment of the Act."
