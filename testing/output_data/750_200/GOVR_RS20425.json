Major companies like EchoStar and DirecTV offer satellite TV services through their DBS systems. Rainbow DBS, a subsidiary of Cablevision, also provides satellite channels through Voom. The 1999 law, SHVIA, allows satellite companies to rebroadcast local network signals in the same market area, in addition to distant network signals for consumers outside the \"Grade B contour\" of broadcast network affiliate stations. Rainbow DBS, a subsidiary of Cablevision, offers satellite channels through Voom. Historical information on SHVA and the issues Congress faced in revising it can be found in CRS Report 98-942. The 1999 law, SHVIA, allows satellite companies to rebroadcast local and distant network signals, with the distinction between the two being important. Local signals are received within a network affiliate's local area, while distant signals are from elsewhere in the country. This law permits satellite companies to rebroadcast local network signals back into the same local market area, but they are not required to do so. The SHVA law distinguishes between local and distant network signals for satellite TV. Consumers living outside the Grade B contour can receive distant network signals, while those inside cannot. Some satellite companies have transmitted distant signals to consumers inside Grade B contours, leading to legal challenges. Some satellite companies transmitted distant network signals to consumers inside Grade B contours, leading to court challenges. Over 2 million consumers reportedly had distant network signals terminated by their satellite companies based on a Miami judge's decision in 1998. EchoStar appealed the decision to the Supreme Court in 2002, but the case was declined. Congress \"grandfathered\" consumers illegally receiving distant network signals in 1999 law, as long as they could not receive a Grade A signal. New subscribers must follow the original rules to receive distant network signals. The SHVIA law allowed consumers to receive distant network signals illegally if they could not receive a Grade A signal. New subscribers must meet Grade B signal criteria established by the FCC in 1999. The FCC confirmed the use of Grade B standards for SHVIA compliance. Consumers disputing their signal quality can refer to predictive models for verification. The FCC allows consumers to seek a waiver to receive distant network signals via satellite if they are not receiving a Grade A or Grade B signal. Consumers apply to their satellite company for the waiver, which is then forwarded to the local network affiliate. The affiliate has 30 days to decide on granting the waiver. If approved, the consumer can receive distant network signals from the satellite company. If a waiver is granted, consumers may receive distant network signals from the satellite company. If denied, consumers can request a signal intensity test, with costs covered by the \"loser\" (either the satellite company or affiliate). Exceptions apply for recreational vehicles. Exceptions were made for recreational vehicles, commercial trucks, and consumers using large \"C-band\" satellite dishes. These consumers may receive distant network signals until December 31, 2004 if they do not receive a Grade B signal from the local affiliate, have a satellite dish on an RV or commercial truck, or if they choose an alternative payment method for costs. SHVIA allows DBS companies to offer \"local-into-local\" service for consumers using \"C-band\" dishes, who can receive distant network signals indefinitely if they were receiving them before October 31, 1999. SHVIA permits DBS companies to offer \"local-into-local\" service for consumers in designated market areas. The law does not require DBS companies to provide this service, but under the \"must carry\" provision, they must provide all local broadcast stations in a market if they offer any local station in that market. This does not mean they have to carry local broadcast programming nationwide. DBS companies must carry all local TV stations in a market that wish to be carried, with exceptions for duplicative programming and educational stations. The must carry provisions for DBS went into effect on January 1, 2002, and the DBS companies oppose this requirement. The must carry provisions for DBS went into effect on January 1, 2002. DBS companies oppose this requirement and have expanded local-into-local services in various markets. EchoStar offers local-into-local in 152 markets, DirecTV in 106 markets, with plans to add more as capacity allows. Many smaller communities in the US do not receive local signals via satellite due to the 210 designated market areas (DMAs) identified by Nielsen Media Research. EchoStar and DirecTV are expanding their local-into-local services in various markets. EchoStar offers local-into-local in 152 markets, while DirecTV offers it in 106 markets with plans to add more. The number of DMAs served does not necessarily indicate the percentage of the population able to receive local-into-local services. EchoStar reported that 83% of the population could receive its service when it passed the 100 DMA mark. DirecTV aims to provide local-into-local in at least 130 DMAs by the end of 2004, representing 92% of TV households. The LOCAL Act was passed in 2000 to ensure that small and rural areas without access to local-into-local services from EchoStar or DirecTV can still receive local television via other satellite options. The LOCAL Act was passed in 2000 to help small and rural areas receive local television via satellite or terrestrial technologies. Satellite carriers were given a compulsory copyright license for retransmitting distant network and superstation signals to ensure compensation to copyright owners. The 1999 law extended the compulsory license for distant network signals for five years, and the 108th Congress is considering further extension and changes to pricing. Satellite companies have a royalty-free permanent compulsory copyright license for retransmitting local signals. Cable also has a permanent compulsory copyright license. The SHVIA provisions gave satellite companies a royalty-free permanent compulsory copyright license for retransmitting local signals and allowed them to offer local-into-local television service. It also made must-carry requirements effective for satellites on January 1, 2002, and applied syndicated exclusivity, sports blackout, and network nonduplication to satellite retransmission of nationally distributed superstations. The SHVIA provisions allowed satellite companies to retransmit local signals and offer local-into-local television service. It applied syndicated exclusivity, sports blackout, and network nonduplication to satellite retransmission of nationally distributed superstations. Subscribers affected by the 1998 court decision were grandfathered in until December 31, 2004, allowing them to continue receiving distant network signals. Grade B signal intensity standard was retained for receiving distant network signals. Subscribers unable to receive a Grade B signal, as well as recreational vehicles and commercial trucks, were also included. The SHVIA provisions allowed satellite companies to retransmit local signals and offer local-into-local television service. It applied syndicated exclusivity, sports blackout, and network nonduplication to satellite retransmission of nationally distributed superstations. Subscribers affected by the 1998 court decision were grandfathered in until December 31, 2004, allowing them to continue receiving distant network signals. The new legislation allows subscribers unable to receive a Grade B signal, recreational vehicles, and commercial trucks to receive no more than two distant network signals of each television network on a single day. Consumers can seek waivers from local affiliates to receive distant network signals if signal strength is in doubt, at no cost. C-band satellite customers can continue receiving distant network signals they were receiving as of October 31, 1999 indefinitely. The existing satellite copyright compulsory license for distant network and superstation signals is extended until December 31, 2004. The legislation extends the satellite copyright compulsory license for distant network and superstation signals until December 31, 2004. It also creates a new compulsory license for local network signals with no sunset date. The copyright royalty payments for satellite companies are reduced by 45% for distant network signals and 30% for superstation signals. Cable subscribers no longer have to wait 90 days, and satellite companies can offer a national PBS feed until January 1, 2002. The legislation allows satellite companies to offer a national PBS feed until January 1, 2002, after which local PBS stations must be carried in markets with local-into-local service. A proposed loan guarantee program to benefit subscribers in small and rural markets was removed due to objections by Senator Gramm. Congress later passed the \"Launching Our Communities Access to Local Television Act\" (LOCAL) as Title X. The \"Launching Our Communities Access to Local Television Act\" (LOCAL) was passed by Congress as Title X of the FY2001 Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations Act. It created a board to select recipients of loan guarantees for up to $1.25 billion in loans to build systems for consumers to receive local television signals. The LOCAL Television Loan Guarantee Program, created by the \"Launching Our Communities Access to Local Television Act,\" provides loan guarantees of up to $1.25 billion for projects that ensure nationwide access to local television signals. The program considers serving \"nonserved\" or \"underserved\" areas and providing high-speed Internet access. It is technology neutral and has regulations issued in the December 23, 2003 Federal Register. The Board issued regulations for the LOCAL Television Loan Guarantee Program on December 23, 2003. An application period ended on April 21, 2004, with one incomplete application received. The Board voted to return the application and then opened another 60-day application period, which was later rescinded on July 6. The program is administered by the Rural Utilities Service and received $280 million in funding in the FY2002 Agriculture appropriations act. The Rural Utilities Service in the Department of Agriculture received $280 million in funding for the program from the FY2002 Agriculture appropriations act. The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act allocated an additional $80 million for the program. GAO criticized the slow progress of the program in its reports. The \"Northpoint Provision\" requires the FCC to test terrestrial systems for interference with DBS satellites in the 12.2-12.7 Gigahertz frequency band. Northpoint Technology seeks FCC license for a terrestrial wireless system offering TV programming and data services. Northpoint's Broadwave subsidiary is seeking an FCC license for a terrestrial wireless system offering TV programming and data services similar to DBS. The FCC chose MITRE Corporation to conduct interference tests in 2001, concluding that MVDDS systems would need mitigating techniques to coexist with satellites. DBS operators welcomed the report for highlighting potential interference issues, while Northpoint saw it as an opportunity to address these concerns. The FCC decided that MVDDS and DBS could co-exist, but dismissed applications by Northpoint and two other companies to provide MVDDS, opting to auction the frequencies instead. Northpoint objected to this decision and did not participate in the auction, which raised $118.7 million. The auction for frequencies in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band raised $118.7 million on January 27, 2004. Legislation proposed to eliminate the auction requirement for fixed terrestrial services, but it was not included in the final version of the bill."
