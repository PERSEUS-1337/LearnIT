    "content": "The changing structure of U.S. agriculture has raised concerns about reduced competition in various agricultural markets, including dairy. Two main issues in the dairy industry are consolidation and industry concentration. In response, the USDA and Department of Justice planned workshops to address competition issues in agriculture, with a specific workshop on the dairy industry scheduled for June 25, 2010 in Madison, WI. The report provides background on the U.S. dairy industry, discussing financial stress for dairy farmers, price movements, industry structure, and economic effects. The current industry structure in terms of consolidation and concentration at different market levels is discussed, along with the economic effects. U.S. antitrust law and recent antitrust activity in the dairy industry are outlined. Financial stress in the dairy industry in 2009 led to federal support programs, with over $1 billion spent by the government. Congress granted an additional $350 million in October 2009 in response to appeals from dairy farmers for more financial assistance. In response to financial stress in the dairy industry, the government provided over $1 billion in support through various programs. An additional $350 million was granted in October 2009 to assist dairy farmers. Despite this aid, the number of U.S. dairy farms decreased by 3% to 65,000 by the end of 2009. The decline in dairy cows led to a decrease in milk production, but an increase in foreign demand raised average farm milk prices to $15.10 per hundredweight in March 2010. The rebound in foreign demand for dairy products increased average farm milk prices to $15.10 per hundredweight in March 2010 from $11.80 per hundredweight a year earlier. Despite the improvement, dairy farmers still face financial concerns due to lost farm equity and high feed prices. The industry and Members of Congress are exploring options to manage fluctuations in milk prices and income for dairy farmers. The U.S. dairy industry has evolved over the last 100 years, leading to a national market. Financial stress has prompted the Obama Administration and Congress to address consolidation issues. For more on dairy policy options, refer to CRS Report R41141. The dairy industry in the U.S. has transitioned from local markets to a national market, driven by advancements in milk marketing and government intervention. In the mid-1850s, milk was mainly consumed locally, but as urban areas grew, producers formed cooperative associations to supply processed products. In the early 1900s, dairy farmers formed cooperative associations to negotiate with milk buyers and market their milk collectively. The Capper-Volstead Act of 1922 provided limited antitrust liability exemption to farmer cooperatives. By 1925, handlers were paying farmers based on classified pricing for fluid-grade milk, which is still used today. In 1925, handlers started paying farmers based on classified pricing for fluid-grade milk, reflecting higher transportation costs. The Great Depression led to a breakdown of this system, prompting the establishment of Federal milk marketing orders (FMMOs) to stabilize the market and ensure adequate milk supplies at reasonable prices. During World War II, demand for farm commodities, including milk, increased. In the late 1940s, the government supported milk prices through the Dairy Product Price Support Program. In 1985, the Dairy Export Incentives Program was added to national dairy policy. Advancements in milk marketing have transformed the U.S. dairy industry over the last century. Raw milk was transported by truck and rail to processing plants in the early 20th century. Various dairy programs, including the Dairy Product Price Support Program (DPPSP), Dairy Export Incentives Program (DEIP), and Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC), have been implemented to support the industry. For more information on dairy programs, refer to CRS Report R40205, Dairy Market and Policy Issues. Milk was transported by truck and rail to processing plants, with distances varying from local markets to large markets like New York, Boston, and Chicago. Home delivery of milk was common, but factors in the second half of the 20th century led to a transition to a national milk and dairy product market. In the second half of the 20th century, factors like improved roadways and faster trucks reduced milk transportation costs, leading to a national milk and dairy product market. Retail milk was mainly sold in stores in plastic or paper containers by the 1970s. Bulk milk is now transported long distances by truck to meet market demands, while dairy manufacturing plants ship products like cheese and yogurt to distribution centers. The dairy industry has evolved with improved transportation, allowing for national markets. Dairy products like cheese and yogurt are shipped to distribution centers across the country. A concern has been the relationship between farm and retail prices, with farm price declines not always reflected in retail prices, impacting the farm value share. In recent decades, factors like increased productivity and changes in food marketing have led to a decline in the farm share of the retail food dollar, causing concern among Congress about economic stress in the agricultural sector, especially for dairy farmers. The farm share of the retail food dollar for all farm products was 41% in 1950, but by 2006, it had decreased significantly. In 1950, the farm share of the retail food dollar for all farm products was 41%, decreasing to 18.5% in 2006. The farm share for milk and dairy products is around one-third of the retail dollar, higher than the all-food average due to lower processing levels in other food categories. The farm share of the retail price for milk and dairy products is higher than the all-food average, with a relatively flat trend between 2000 and 2008. The farm-share trend varied for different dairy products, with a slight uptrend for cheddar cheese. In 2008 and early 2009, there was a decline in the farm-value share of retail product values and an increase in the marketing margin. Between July 2008 and December 2008, the farm price of milk fell by $0.33 per gallon, while the retail milk price only fell by $0.28, resulting in an increased marketing margin. In January 2009, the difference between retail and farm milk prices reached a record-high of $2.43 per gallon. However, in 2009, retailers reduced prices due to lower costs, leading to a sharp decline in the price difference between farm and retail milk. In December, the price difference between farm and retail milk dropped to $1.69 per gallon, more than $0.25 below the recent five-year average margin. Retailers reduced prices due to lower costs for farm milk and other inputs, leading to a sharp decline in the price difference. Adjustments in retail prices from higher farm prices occur faster in food markets. Food markets typically have months-long price adjustments, even for perishables like milk. Retail prices react quickly to increases in farm prices but are slow to decrease when farm prices fall, a phenomenon known as \"sticky\" retail food prices. Consumer behavior, store preferences, and inventory management can also influence retail prices. Recent economic research suggests that retail prices may not fully adjust to downward farm price movements due to consumer behavior, store preferences, and inventory management. Competition effects of supermarket services can attract less price-sensitive consumers, leading to higher prices for products like milk in stores offering additional services. Consolidation in agriculture, including the dairy sector, has led to fewer but larger operations, resulting in lower costs and increased competitiveness. This trend can create a disconnect between farm and retail prices of agricultural products, leading consumers to potentially pay more for items like milk. Consolidation in the dairy sector has led to lower costs and increased competitiveness, resulting in fewer dairy farms needed to produce the same amount of milk. Firm size is a limiting factor for growth, with consolidation at the cooperative and processor level to offset market power of large retailers and serve them more efficiently. The dairy industry has seen increased concentration, with a small number of firms controlling most sales. This trend is due to higher dairy cow output and advancements in farm technology, leading to a significant decrease in the number of dairy farms over the years. Annual losses of dairy farm operations have slowed down to 2,000 to 5,000 farms per year in recent times. Annual losses of dairy farm operations have decreased over the years, with a current total of 65,000 operations in 2009. Despite a decline in the number of dairy farms, total milk production has increased due to higher productivity per cow. Domestic milk demand has grown slowly, while consumption of dairy products like cheese has risen. Dairy product exports have also seen an increase in recent years. Exports of dairy products have increased in recent years, reaching record levels in 2008. Farm numbers have shifted, with smaller farms declining while larger farms with 1,000 or more cows increasing by 20% due to lower production costs. Dairy farms with over 1,000 cows had significantly lower costs of production compared to smaller farms. In 2009, farms with 1,000 cows or more had lower production costs compared to smaller farms. These larger farms produced 47% of U.S. milk output, while smaller farms with fewer than 100 cows only accounted for 16% of the total. The share of milk produced by large farms increased from 35% in 2005 to 47% in 2009. An increase in the number of large farms has led to them producing a larger share of U.S. milk output, with scale economies from automation and modern facilities. Dairy farm structures vary by region, with western states having larger farms and Wisconsin having many small farms. The average farm size varies by state in the U.S., with western states like California having large farms with 850 cows per farm, while Wisconsin has smaller farms with an average of 88 cows. Operating costs for large dairy farms in the west have been affected by high feed costs, but overhead costs tend to be relatively low due to the large number of animals. Overhead costs are low on dairy farms where grain and hay are produced on-site, like in Wisconsin. Operating costs are lower when grain and feed prices rise. Farmer-owned dairy cooperatives manage milk distribution and surplus milk, benefiting those who use their services. Dairy cooperatives vary in size. The number of dairy cooperatives has been declining since the 1940s, with some solely arranging for the sale of members' milk while others manufacture products for direct sale. In 1940-1941, there were over 2,300 cooperatives, accounting for half of farm milk marketings. By 2007, the number had decreased to 155 as cooperatives merged for centralized management of milk supplies. The number of dairy cooperatives has significantly decreased over time, from over 2,300 in 1940 to 155 in 2007. Despite the decline, cooperatives now control 83% of farm milk marketings through consolidations and strategic alliances. In 2008, the 50 largest dairy cooperatives marketed 79% of the milk in the United States. The retail sector has driven consolidation in dairy cooperatives, with the top four firms accounting for 40% of U.S. milk production in 2008. The National Milk Producers Federation emphasizes the importance of the Capper-Volstead Act for farmers. The National Milk Producers Federation, the largest trade association representing milk producer cooperatives, highlights the significance of the Capper-Volstead Act in enabling farmers to collaborate and maintain their independence. Cooperatives have historically strengthened farmers' bargaining power with milk handlers and advocate for their members in federal milk marketing order changes. However, some producers argue that cooperatives may not always align with their interests. The dairy processing industry involves processing milk for consumption and manufacturing dairy products like butter and cheese. The dairy processing industry involves processing milk for consumption and manufacturing dairy products like butter and cheese. Factors affecting dairy processors and manufacturers include changes in demand, technological advancements, and changes in the retail sector. Dairy firms have decreased in number over time, with an increase in plant and firm size to reduce costs and meet high-volume demands. The number of dairy manufacturing plants in the United States has stabilized around 1,100 facilities, with the largest dairy processor/manufacturing companies operating 9 to 81 plants. Concentration trends in the dairy processing industry mirror those in other food processing sectors. In 2002, the four-firm concentration ratio was 35% for cheese processing and 43% for fluid milk processing, compared to a mean industry concentration ratio of 49% for selected food processing industries. Dairy processing is not highly concentrated nationally, but local markets can be more concentrated, raising concerns for farmers and policymakers. The level of concentration in dairy processing is not unusually high nationally, but local or regional markets can be more concentrated, which concerns some farmers and policymakers. Industry concentration in the fluid milk industry has increased recently, following a merger in 2001 between Suiza, Inc., and Dean Foods. However, the industry concentration for fluid milk processing is just below the average level for selected food manufacturing industries. For cheese manufacturing, the four-firm concentration ratio has ranged between 34% and 52% during 1972-2002, with no clear trend. The retail sector for food products has changed substantially in recent years, with price competition from nontraditional food retailers causing traditional supermarket chains to review pricing and product strategies. Changes in retail sector strategies and competitive pressures have resulted in consolidation in the U.S. grocery retailing industry, with the top four firms accounting for 17% of national sales in the early 1990s and increasing to 17% by 2005. The top four firms in the U.S. grocery retailing industry accounted for 17% of national sales in the early 1990s, increasing to 36% by 2005 due to acquisitions and mergers. Local-level concentration in the retail food sector is typically higher than at the national level, with four-firm concentration shares averaging 74% in specific market areas in 2003. Local-level concentration in the retail food sector is typically higher than at the national level, with four-firm concentration shares averaging 74% in specific market areas in 2003. This indicates fewer choices among food stores at the individual consumer level, which is more important for consumers compared to national concentration measures in the food retail sector. The retail food sector's local-level concentration is higher than at the national level, with fewer choices for consumers at the individual level. Retail consolidation has led to dairy processors increasing in size and market share to meet demands for lower costs. Concerns about concentration reducing competition and market power disadvantage some population segments. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that concentration in the processing and retail sectors of the agricultural industries may lead to market power, disadvantaging certain population segments. However, efficiency gains from cost savings can benefit consumers and farmers. The GAO found that concentration in the processing and retail sectors of the agricultural industries may lead to market power concerns in the future, potentially affecting commodity or food prices. The GAO report reviewed studies on dairy processing, finding that concentration had little impact on commodity prices. Efficiency gains were seen as beneficial, with market power effects offset by dairy cooperatives. The GAO report reviewed studies on dairy processing, finding that concentration had little impact on commodity prices. Market power effects were offset by dairy cooperatives. Evidence of noncompetitive behavior was found in regional retail milk markets, with experts predicting an increase in concentration. The GAO found evidence of market power among retailers in the Boston retail milk market, with experts predicting increased concentration leading to fewer outlets. Large retail firms may pressure food processors to consolidate, causing further concentration. Concerns include the impact on price transparency in dairy markets. The dairy industry's move towards more integration has raised concerns about how concentration affects price transparency in markets for dairy products and milk. Some policymakers and industry participants believe that fewer buyers and sellers lead to fewer transactions, weakening market \"discovery\" of prices. This shift to a more integrated market results in fewer trades of products on the cash or \"spot\" level. The dairy industry's move towards more integration has led to closer ties between market players, resulting in fewer trades on the spot market. The primary spot market for dairy is at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, where prices are determined for wholesale contracts nationwide. Some dairy producer groups criticize the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) as an inadequate pricing mechanism due to concerns about thin trading, lack of transparency, oversight, and market volatility. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) found in a 2007 study that the CME spot cheese market had few trades and lacked market conditions. The GAO found in a 2007 study that the CME spot cheese market is susceptible to manipulation due to a small number of trades and traders. However, industry participants are prepared to counteract any price manipulation by monitoring the market and trading when prices disconnect from supply and demand conditions. Some industry participants are ready to trade when prices disconnect from supply and demand conditions to prevent manipulation. The CFTC and CME monitor spot market activities for signs of manipulation. In 2008, dairy industry participants paid a penalty for attempting to manipulate milk futures prices through cheese purchases on the CME. In 2008, dairy industry participants agreed to pay a civil monetary penalty for attempting to manipulate milk futures prices through cheese purchases on the CME. The CME recently introduced new futures and options contracts for skimmed milk powder as a global dairy risk management tool. Producers and policymakers are interested in expanding USDA's mandatory price reporting system for dairy products to improve price transparency. In the 2008 farm bill, Congress authorized more frequent price reporting for dairy products, subject to appropriations. U.S. antitrust laws focus on competition in markets, prohibiting unlawful mergers and business practices. The Sherman Act and the Clayton Act are the two basic antitrust laws in the United States. The Sherman Act and the Clayton Act are the two basic antitrust laws in the United States, enforced by the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission. They prohibit activities that restrain trade and monopolization. The Sherman Act and Clayton Act are antitrust laws in the US. Violating them can lead to fines or imprisonment. The Clayton Act prohibits mergers that lessen competition. The Clayton Act aims to prevent activities that may restrain trade, particularly focusing on mergers that lessen competition. It also includes provisions for premerger notification to allow antitrust enforcement agencies to review potential mergers before they are finalized. The \"Merger Guidelines\" issued by DOJ and FTC are being updated to reflect current practices. The premerger remedies DOJ/FTC might seek with respect to a proposed merger that is not approved include filing legal action to stop the merger or conditioning federal approval on modifications to remove antitrust concerns. Negotiating changes is preferred over going to court due to cost, time, and risk. The Capper-Volstead Act provides limited antitrust exemption to farmer cooperatives for joint processing and marketing of agricultural products. This exemption aims to avoid costly and time-consuming court battles. In April 2009, Dean Foods, the largest fluid milk processor in the United States, purchased two plants owned by Foremost Farms, a cooperative in Wisconsin. The Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a civil antitrust suit against Dean Foods, alleging that the purchase violated the Clayton Act by eliminating a price competitor. The DOJ filed a lawsuit against Dean Foods for violating the Clayton Act by acquiring Foremost Farms, which will reduce competition in the milk market for schools and grocery chains in Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin. The elimination of competition between Dean and Foremost will negatively impact milk purchases. Foremost Farms had been losing fluid milk customers to other processors due to their inability to deliver milk to distant locations. The acquisition by Dean Foods, which now holds 57% of the market for processed milk in certain regions, was not reported to the Department of Justice beforehand. The lawsuit aims to force Dean Foods to sell the dairy processing plants acquired from Foremost Farms. Dean Foods believes the acquisition complied with antitrust laws. The acquisition by Dean Foods in northeastern Illinois, Wisconsin, and upper Michigan is under scrutiny for potential antitrust violations. Dean Foods claims the acquisition benefits dairy farmers and consumers by providing cost savings and competition in the region. The case highlights the impact of consolidation in the U.S. dairy industry, especially in markets with excess capacity like upper Wisconsin. A class action antitrust complaint was filed against major firms in the Northeast dairy market, including Dairy Farmers of America, Inc., Dairy Marketing Services, Dean Foods, and HP Hood, on behalf of Northeast dairy farmers in Vermont. The lawsuit alleges that major dairy firms in the Northeast, including Dairy Farmers of America, Dairy Marketing Services, Dean Foods, and HP Hood, conspired to control the supply of fluid milk, leading to lower prices for farmers. The competition in the milk marketing system has shifted, requiring dairy producers to affiliate with either DFA or DMS. The lawsuit alleges that dairy producers in the Northeast must now affiliate with either DFA or DMS due to exclusive supply agreements with Dean Foods and HP Hood. The defendants have been accused of using their market power to the detriment of independent producers and cooperatives in the region. DFA claims to have increased returns for dairy farmers through cost-saving efficiencies. The cooperative aims to increase returns for dairy farmers by improving efficiencies in field services, hauling, and administration. Litigation involving multiple class action lawsuits against Dean Foods, National Dairy Holdings, and DFA is ongoing, with observers noting that resolution may take years. The net effect of concentration on market power and efficiency gains is complex from an economic and legal perspective. The presence of market power and efficiency gains in the dairy industry is influenced by various factors such as product differentiation, market entry ease, and contract structures. Efficiency gains can come from technology changes and business practices. Economic events and government policies also impact commodity prices, making it challenging to determine the effects of concentration on the industry."
