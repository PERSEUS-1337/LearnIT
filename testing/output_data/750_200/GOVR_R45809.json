    "content": "Critical infrastructure (CI) encompasses machinery, facilities, and information crucial for governance, public health, and the economy. Adverse events can result from loss or disruption of CI systems, whether due to natural disasters or deliberate attacks. This report outlines four key areas of policy concern for Congress: defining and identifying CI, understanding and assessing CI risk, federal organization for CI, and the role of the private sector. Presidential Decision Directive 63 (PDD-63) on critical infrastructure protection, issued in 1998, was the first significant policy in this area. Presidential Decision Directive 63 (PDD-63) in 1998 was the first policy guidance for critical infrastructure protection, emphasizing national vulnerability to asymmetric attacks and the importance of critical infrastructure for national power. Presidential Decision Directive 63 (PDD-63) in 1998 defined critical infrastructure as essential systems for the economy and government, aiming to eliminate national vulnerability to cyber or physical attacks. Establishing consistent criteria for assessing critical assets has proven challenging due to varying perspectives and values. The criticality of infrastructure systems and assets is not only based on physical attributes but also on perspectives, values, and priorities. The complexity and interconnectedness of the U.S. and global economies make it difficult to identify critical assets. The U.S. electricity sub-sector alone has nearly 7,000 operational power plants, dependent on other infrastructure assets and supply chains. The statutory definition of critical infrastructure, established in the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, focuses on protecting these assets. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 defines critical infrastructure as vital systems and assets, physical or virtual, crucial for national security, economic security, public health, or safety. This policy has evolved from focusing solely on physical foundations to encompass a broader range of considerations. Critical infrastructure policy has evolved to include provision of essential services and customary conveniences to the public. The universe of threats to critical infrastructure has expanded, with the intelligence community focusing on asymmetric threats posed by state and non-state adversaries. Threats to critical infrastructure (CI) include asymmetric attacks by adversaries using physical or cyber means to disrupt systems and assets, or cause civilian casualties. Natural disasters and other non-terrorism related events have also become significant concerns in CI policy since 9/11. The definition of critical infrastructure in the USA PATRIOT Act remains relevant, but policymakers have shifted focus to address a broader range of threats. Since 9/11, CI policymakers have broadened the definition of critical infrastructure to include events with disruptive effects at all levels of society. The emphasis is on infrastructure as an enabler of prosperity, public safety, and civic life, as reflected in the National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) published by DHS in 2013. The National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP), issued by DHS in 2013, defines critical infrastructure as assets, systems, and networks essential to American society, considering various natural and manmade hazards at different levels. CI policy has evolved beyond national security to focus on societal resilience at the system level. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) designated U.S. election systems as critical infrastructure in January 2017, including physical locations and technology infrastructure. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) designated U.S. election systems, including physical locations and technology infrastructure, as critical infrastructure in January 2017. This designation is based on the essential role these facilities, systems, and assets play in supporting the nation's civic life. The federal government uses critical infrastructure (CI) sectors as an organizing framework for voluntary public-private partnerships with self-identified CI owner-operators. DHS has overall responsibility for coordination of partnership programs and activities, with other federal agencies assigned leading roles as Sector-Specific Agencies (SSAs). These sectors represent a broad array of national economic activity and social life. The expanding definitions of critical infrastructure sectors have policy implications for Congress. Each sector has formal coordination bodies with private sector stakeholders, state, local, tribal, and territorial governments involved. Industry and non-profit groups may also participate in sector-wide activities. As critical infrastructure sectors mature, new public and private sector communities of interest emerge with unique perspectives on criticality. There is no single, consistently applied definition of critical infrastructure, reflecting diverse interests and evolving perspectives. The identification and prioritization of critical systems and assets have evolved over nearly two decades, reflecting diverse interests and perspectives. The multiplicity of official definitions of critical infrastructure is not just a matter of semantics but reflects efforts to negotiate boundaries of responsibility, government programs, and public-private sector relationships. Critical infrastructure policy has two distinct orientations that overlap significantly. Critical infrastructure policy focuses on identifying, prioritizing, and protecting infrastructure assets based on their criticality in terms of potential system-level impacts on essential functions of society, the economy, or government. This approach overlaps with critical infrastructure resilience, which emphasizes the ability of infrastructure assets to withstand and recover from disruptions. Critical infrastructure resilience (CIR) focuses on investments in hazard mitigation and preparedness to ensure availability of critical infrastructure functions during emergencies. Legislation post-9/11 initially prioritized physical protection of critical assets, but policy practice now emphasizes broader resilience measures in the US and other developed countries. The focus on critical infrastructure security has shifted from physical asset protection to system resilience post-9/11. National policy reflects a hybrid approach combining elements of both critical infrastructure protection (CIP) and critical infrastructure resilience (CIR). This approach complicates defining criticality and identifying what is critical in different contexts. Legislation and government directives have increasingly emphasized resilience measures over asset protection since 2001. The report discusses critical infrastructure security policy, emphasizing the need for asset identification and prioritization to protect against threats. Despite the simple logic, complexities arise in practice, leading to ongoing national-level issues in this area. The report emphasizes the need for asset identification and prioritization to protect critical infrastructure. Inventory requirements are the first step in risk management strategies at national and enterprise levels. Defining criticality criteria remains a topic of debate, but list decisions help identify critical assets in practice. The National Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets, released in February 2003, directed the Department of Homeland Security to develop a uniform methodology for identifying critical facilities and build a comprehensive database. The National Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets in February 2003 directed the Department of Homeland Security to develop a uniform methodology for identifying critical facilities and build a comprehensive database. This led to the release of Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 in December 2003, which served as the basis of critical infrastructure policy development until superseded by PPD-21 in 2013. The Department of Homeland Security was tasked with identifying critical infrastructure and key assets to prevent deliberate attacks. However, a 2006 report found shortcomings in the national database of assets, which had grown rapidly from 160 to 77,069 assets. The Department of Homeland Security's National Asset Database grew rapidly from 160 key assets in 2003 to 77,069 assets in 2006. The database included a wide range of assets, from nuclear power plants to petting zoos and water parks. The IG report highlighted entries of \"unusual\" assets and inconsistencies in data collection procedures, such as San Francisco listing its light rail system as one asset while New York City listed subway stations individually. The National Asset Database was established as part of the 9-11 Commission Act in 2007, requiring a compilation of vital systems or assets and a classified list of prioritized critical infrastructure. This list includes assets that could cause national or regional catastrophic effects if disrupted or destroyed. The National Asset Database was established in 2007 as part of the 9-11 Commission Act to compile vital assets and a classified list of critical infrastructure. The list includes assets that could cause catastrophic effects if disrupted. A 2013 GAO report highlighted improvements in DHS processes for critical asset identification but raised concerns about reporting criteria and methodology. The 2013 GAO report noted improvements in DHS processes for critical asset identification but raised concerns about reporting criteria and methodology used by the National Critical Infrastructure Prioritization Program (NCIPP) established after 2009. Methodological adjustments were made to assess criticality based on potential adverse consequences. The report recommended that DHS commission an independent peer review of asset nomination vetting methods to ensure national security and economic security in critical infrastructure sectors like the U.S. financial system and election infrastructure. The report in 2017 recommended that DHS commission an independent peer review of asset nomination vetting methods for the NCIPP list to ensure national security. This list prioritizes assets, impacting government activities like risk assessments, regulatory administration, and emergency response coordination. The exact number of nominated assets is not publicly available. The 2013 GAO report found that despite the significant impact of the NCIPP list on government activities, some states were hesitant to participate in DHS data calls due to compliance burdens, technical limitations, and cost-benefit calculations. Some states lacked the expertise to assess likely consequences of failure or disruption accurately. The NCIPP list is not a complete national inventory of critical systems and assets. DHS failed to provide documentation for statutory reporting requirements. Persistent difficulties exist in ensuring the completeness, quality, and currency of centralized inventories of critical infrastructure assets. The CIR prioritizes adaptive use of critical capabilities for continuity of service during stress on infrastructure systems, expanding data collection to include all assets in a sector for emergency planning. The Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) database, managed by DHS, DOD, NGA, and USGS, compiles data from public and private partners to support law enforcement and emergency management with critical infrastructure information. The Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) database, managed by DHS, DOD, NGA, and USGS, provides essential data layers to support law enforcement and emergency management at all government levels. HIFLD includes critical assets for lifeline CI functions like energy, communications, transportation, and water systems, as well as non-critical asset categories that may become critical in the future. HIFLD includes critical assets for lifeline CI functions like energy, communications, transportation, and water systems. However, it also includes non-critical asset categories that may become critical in specific emergencies or CI policy decisions, such as truck driving schools, express shipping facilities, and cruise ship terminals. HHS used HIFLD during the 2017 hurricane season to locate day care centers in impacted areas, which may not be defined as critical under common statutory definitions of CI. The HIFLD partnership model provides infrastructure data for real-world use cases, enabling relevant agencies to address emergencies. Unlike the NCIPP list, it does not prioritize specific systems and assets. The HIFLD partnership model leverages infrastructure data for real-world use cases, informing preparedness and incident management activities of federal and SLTT agencies. Unlike the NCIPP list, it does not prioritize specific systems and assets for federal oversight, regulation, and administration. The robust development of HIFLD partnerships contrasts with declining state participation in NCIPP, but CIP-based approaches to inventory of critical infrastructure assets remain relevant. The 2017 National Defense Authorization Act requires DHS to identify critical utilities and national security assets at risk, including specific chemical manufacturing facilities under CFATS regulations for protection against cyber threats. The Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) regulations, authorized by Congress in 2007, require owner-operators to protect their facilities against cyber and physical threats. Congress may need to consider the impact of shifting towards system-level resilience on legacy programs like the NCIPP asset list. Policy changes by DHS could diminish the importance of NCIPP and asset-protection approaches to critical infrastructure risk management. Stakeholder participation in NCIPP comes with costs, so Congress may need to evaluate data call frequency, eliminate duplication, or provide additional funding. Stakeholder participation in NCIPP requires funding, prompting Congress to consider data call frequency, eliminating duplication, or providing additional appropriations. Updates to National Asset Database requirements may be necessary to align with emerging CISA programs and other congressional mandates. Identifying and prioritizing critical infrastructure systems and assets is crucial for understanding homeland security risks. The Security Grant Program is part of a national effort to assess homeland security risks, with Congress seeking authoritative assessments. Risk assessments inform planning, resource allocation, emergency preparedness, regulatory oversight, grant funding, and security measures for critical infrastructure. DHS defines risk as the potential for unwanted outcomes from incidents. DHS defines risk as the potential for unwanted outcomes from incidents, considering threat, vulnerability, and consequence. Threat is defined as a potential harm to life, information, operations, environment, or property, including human adversaries or natural hazards. Threat assessments include data on human adversaries or natural hazards. Threat estimates are based on information about threat actors, their motivations, capabilities, and observed targets. Information on timing, methods, and frequency of attacks may also be included. For natural hazards, likelihood and severity of events are estimated using past data and predictive modeling. Vulnerability is defined as a feature that makes an entity susceptible to harm. Vulnerability assessments provide information about characteristics of assets or systems that may leave them open to exploitation or damage from a threat or hazard, with recommendations for resilience measures. Consequence is defined as the effect of an event, incident, or situation. DHS defines consequence as the effect of an event, incident, or occurrence. Criticality assessments focus on potential consequences of adverse events that disrupt infrastructure systems. Various methods are used to assess criticality, including modeling methodologies developed by research centers and industry groups. Since 2007, DHS has utilized risk elements in planning, programs, and budget activities, defining risk as a function of threat, vulnerability, and consequence. Critics question the effectiveness of this approach, citing a lack of demonstrated capability. Critics challenge the DHS formula R=f(TVC) for risk assessment, citing difficulties in assigning probabilities to rare events and the interdependence of threat, vulnerability, and consequence. The complex interactions between these factors make applying the formula for resource allocation decisions problematic. DHS acknowledged the need for a more comprehensive risk assessment approach in 2018. In 2018, DHS recognized the need for a more comprehensive risk assessment approach for critical infrastructure (CI) to address resource allocation decisions. Legislative and executive branch initiatives in 2018-2019, such as the creation of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), aimed to establish a basis for significant changes in CI risk assessment. The creation of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) by DHS in 2018 aimed to elevate CI risk management as a policy focus. CISA established the National Risk Management Center (NRMC) to manage national CI risk with a cross-sector analysis approach. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) established the National Risk Management Center (NRMC) to prioritize CI risk management through cross-sector analysis. Congress may request information on CISA's efforts to institutionalize new risk management methods validated by external reviewers. Expertise from National Laboratories, university-based DHS Centers of Excellence, and industry research groups can support infrastructure risk assessment methodology. The Homeland Security Act guides the Secretary of Homeland Security in leveraging these resources. The Homeland Security Act guides the Secretary of Homeland Security in leveraging organizational resources for homeland security activities. Congress determines funding priorities and program guidance to support national critical infrastructure security goals. Federal organization addressing critical infrastructure issues has evolved in response to threats, with three distinct periods of development outlined. The development of federal organization addressing critical infrastructure issues has evolved through three distinct periods: initial policy development in the late 1990s, post-9/11 reorganization to counter terrorist threats, and the ongoing transition to an all-hazards resilience framework for infrastructure security. Federal attention to critical infrastructure policy increased in the 1990s due to concerns about potential malicious exploitation of technology and physical infrastructure interface. The Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection was established in 1996 by the Clinton Administration to address these issues. The Clinton Administration established the Commission on Critical Infrastructure Protection in 1996 to address emerging cyber threats and issued PDD-63 two years later, requiring the government to eliminate vulnerabilities in critical infrastructures within five years. The focus was on increasing interagency coordination to enhance security. The directives of PDD-63 aimed to improve interagency coordination by creating the National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection, and Counter-Terrorism. The coordinator's role was to lead an interagency group and an advisory group. The Gilmore Commission was formed in 1999 to evaluate terrorist threats and the implementation of PDD-63, submitting a report in 2000. The Gilmore Commission report in 2000 highlighted incomplete implementation of PDD-63, specifically noting that Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) were still in early stages. The National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection, and Counterterrorism had broad authorities but limited time for Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) efforts. The National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection, and Counterterrorism had limited time for Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) responsibilities and lacked program and budget authority. There was no overall national CIP strategy in place, and the National Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC) had not fully established its basic functions under FBI auspices. The 9/11 attacks had a significant impact on homeland security policy and critical infrastructure protection. The 9/11 attacks prompted urgent national concern for homeland security policy and critical infrastructure protection. Two legislative tracks emerged, one proposing to reestablish the Office of Homeland Security with additional budget authorities and oversight requirements. The second legislative track favored comprehensive consolidation of government counterterrorism functions under a single federal agency named the National Homeland Security Agency, following recommendations from the Hart-Rudman Commission. Key supporters in Congress backed this approach. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 was influenced by the recommendations of the Hart-Rudman Commission, aiming to consolidate homeland security functions for better coordination and executive authority. The Homeland Security Act of 2002, influenced by the Hart-Rudman Commission, transferred infrastructure security functions to DHS from various sectors. GAO designated the creation of DHS as high risk due to the challenges of incorporating nearly three dozen federal agencies into the new department. DHS incorporated nearly three dozen federal agencies into four major directorates, prioritizing homeland security missions, especially counterterrorism. This represented a change from previous infrastructure policy. The White House's approach to infrastructure policy changed post-9/11, with a focus on counterterrorism missions. The Office of Management and Budget emphasized the separate but related nature of Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) in a report to Congress. The report highlighted diverse infrastructure risks beyond terrorism, including equipment failure, human error, weather disasters, and criminal activity. The 2001 report highlighted various infrastructure risks beyond terrorism, such as equipment failure, human error, weather disasters, and criminal activity. CIP funding for counterterrorism was minimal, amounting to less than half a percent of the total $2.6 billion requested for the 2002 fiscal year. The 2003 OMB report to Congress showed a significant shift in budget priorities post-9/11 towards infrastructure programs directly impacting counterterrorism missions. The 2003 OMB report to Congress highlighted the significant budget changes post-9/11, with infrastructure programs now directly impacting counterterrorism efforts. The White House requested $12.1 billion for FY2004, a 450% increase from pre-9/11 levels, involving 28 federal entities outside of DHS. The 2003 OMB report to Congress showed a 450% increase in the White House's FY2004 budget request, totaling $12.1 billion. This included 28 federal entities outside of the newly-created DHS, with CIP now largely redefined as a counterterrorism mission. The creation of a new purpose-built department aimed to institutionalize CIP and other homeland security missions under unified leadership. The creation of a new purpose-built department aimed to institutionalize CIP and other homeland security missions under unified leadership, with more than half of the government's pre-9/11 homeland security funding transferred to a single agency. Despite significant changes, CIP remains a highly distributed enterprise competing for limited resources across the federal government. Counterterrorism remained a focal point for critical infrastructure security policy, but public perception of the terrorist threat had softened considerably by 2005, with only 6%-8% of Americans considering it the most important problem. After the 9/11 attacks, terrorism was a major concern for Americans, with 46% naming it as the most important problem. However, by the second half of 2005, this percentage dropped to 6%-8%. Despite periodic upticks due to high-profile incidents, terrorism was not listed as a category of public concern in early 2019 Gallup surveys. The failure of the levy system during Hurricane Katrina highlighted the vulnerability of critical systems to various hazards beyond terrorism. The vulnerability of critical systems and assets to diverse hazards beyond terrorism was highlighted by floods. The Critical Infrastructure Task Force argued in 2006 that government policies focused too much on protecting assets from terrorist attacks and not enough on improving resilience against various threats. Defensive posture was deemed \"brittle\" by the Task Force. The Critical Infrastructure Task Force in 2006 criticized government policies for focusing too much on protecting assets from terrorist attacks and not enough on improving resilience against various threats. They deemed the defensive posture as \"brittle.\" Subsequent policy documents, like the 2010 Quadrennial Homeland Security Review, made greater reference to resilience. The 2010 Quadrennial Homeland Security Review highlighted the diversity of missions and stakeholders in the expansive enterprise of homeland security. It emphasized the importance of preventing terrorist attacks while acknowledging the range of challenges faced, including natural disasters, cyberattacks, and transnational threats. The 2010 Quadrennial Homeland Security Review emphasized the diverse challenges faced in homeland security, including natural disasters, cyberattacks, transnational threats, and contagious diseases. It highlighted the decentralized nature of homeland security, with DHS playing a leadership role in managing risks to critical infrastructure and other missions. The 2013 NIPP, influenced by PPD-21, focuses on all-hazards critical infrastructure resilience rather than just protection against terrorist threats. It emphasizes the need for infrastructure to be secure, withstand, and recover from all hazards for national disaster preparedness. The 2014 QHSR expanded critical infrastructure security to include factors like aging and neglect of systems, making investment and maintenance homeland security concerns. DHS did not submit a QHSR to Congress in 2017 as required by law. The 2014 QHSR expanded critical infrastructure security to include aging systems, maintenance, and utility service provision as homeland security concerns. DHS did not submit a QHSR to Congress in 2017 as required by law, leading to a lack of current departmental-level strategic direction and priorities for infrastructure security and other homeland security goals. The boundaries of responsibility for critical infrastructure security and the definition of critical infrastructure are still being negotiated among various stakeholders. In 2002, Congress directed the transfer of Plum Island Animal Disease Center to DHS under the Homeland Security Act due to concerns of terrorist threats. However, in 2018, Congress authorized the transfer of the facility back to USDA as proposed by the White House in its FY2019 budget request. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-141) proposed by the White House in its FY2019 budget request, addresses critical infrastructure security in the federal government. It emphasizes an all-hazards approach and the distribution of responsibilities between homeland security and areas like commerce, trade, and public utilities regulation. The 2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act emphasizes an all-hazards approach to critical infrastructure security, distributing responsibilities between homeland security and areas such as commerce, trade, and public utilities regulation. The evolving definition of homeland security goes beyond counterterrorism roots, with a need for a more current top-level strategy or policy statement from DHS to Congress. The 2014 QHSR highlighted the need for a more current strategy to define Departmental goals related to critical infrastructure security and interagency partnerships. Congressional interest in homeland security strategy was shown by the Quadrennial Homeland Security Review Technical Corrections Act of 2019 (H.R. 1892). The Quadrennial Homeland Security Review Technical Corrections Act of 2019 (H.R. 1892) passed the House of Representatives unanimously and was referred to the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. The proposed act would require DHS to consult with advisory committees when developing its strategy and to link the strategy with budgeting and program management. Congress has periodically defined organizational relationships within DHS. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has evolved from a centralized directorate structure to a more federated one, emphasizing the operational role of its components. The National Protection and Programs Directorate became an agency within DHS in 2018. Congress may review the intra-Departmental organization and relationships within DHS for appropriate centralization. The 2018 CISA Act established the National Protection and Programs Directorate as an agency within DHS. Congress may consider the level of centralization or federation that best supports critical infrastructure security. Privately owned critical systems failing could put the public at risk, presenting policy challenges in managing CI risk within a complex ownership and regulatory environment. Policymakers generally support the federated partnership model for CI security, emphasizing voluntary collaboration between public and private sectors. The federated partnership model, based on voluntary collaboration between public and private sectors, guides investment in critical infrastructure security. CI owner-operators are responsible for assessing and mitigating risk at the enterprise level, while executive branch agencies manage risk at the national level. Infrastructure risk management involves incentives, information sharing, and voluntary security investments. The management of critical infrastructure security is a collaborative effort between the public and private sectors, relying on incentives, information sharing, and voluntary investments. Risks are shared collectively by the public and business community, with government and private-sector representatives determining necessary security investments. Enterprise-level investments in security and resilience are crucial for managing critical infrastructure risks at the societal level. The responsibility for upfront costs and regulatory oversight measures can be challenging to determine, with the federal government relying on the private sector to develop risk management strategies. The 2013 NIPP emphasizes the importance of government support in encouraging these efforts. The 2013 NIPP emphasizes the importance of government support in encouraging private sector to develop risk management strategies and mitigation investments for national resilience goals. In practice, government efforts to promote voluntary investments in infrastructure resilience through public-private partnerships have varied in effectiveness, especially for low-probability/high-consequence events. Incentives for industry participation include improved access to resources. Industry participation in risk management for low-probability/high-consequence events is incentivized by improved access to risk information, national-level risk analyses, and the opportunity to influence critical infrastructure policy. The Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002 facilitates information sharing between public and private sectors while ensuring confidentiality of shared industry information. The Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002 promotes industry participation in risk management by facilitating information sharing between public and private sectors while ensuring confidentiality. Public-private coordination councils provide a forum for policy discussions, as highlighted in a 2019 OECD report on information sharing partnerships. Public-private partnerships in advanced industrialized economies may not always provide enough incentive for investments to achieve resilience targets. Regulatory mandates are often used in critical infrastructure sectors where incidents can have catastrophic impacts, such as nuclear meltdowns or terrorist attacks. Collaborative approaches are favored for enhancing security in critical infrastructure. The academic survey highlights the importance of collaborative approaches in public-private partnerships for critical infrastructure security. Policymakers aim to limit government regulation in the CI security enterprise, as seen in PDD-63. The Homeland Security Act established DHS with broad responsibilities but narrow regulatory authority. The Homeland Security Act established DHS with broad responsibilities but narrow regulatory authority, with various agencies like TSA, Coast Guard, and CISA having specific regulatory oversight in areas such as oil and gas pipeline security, port security, and chemical facilities. The Chemical Facilities Anti-Terrorism Standards program aims to prevent terrorist exploitation of the chemical industry. Other agencies like the Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulate civilian nuclear facilities with safety and reporting requirements stemming from incidents like the Three Mile Island meltdown in 1979. These regulations are primarily focused on industrial safety and reliability. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission oversees facility protection against deliberate attacks, not DHS. Lessons from early experiences with NIPC led to separating regulation and partnership roles. DHS infrastructure security programs focus on enhancing voluntary participation. The DHS infrastructure security programs focus on enhancing voluntary collaboration with partners through information sharing, analysis, training, and coordination capabilities. Partnership structures are organized under the authority of PPD-21 and implemented through sector and cross-sector partnerships outlined in the 2013 NIPP. The 2013 NIPP introduced partnership structures for infrastructure protection efforts, emphasizing distributed responsibility among stakeholders. CISA administers federal-level partnerships with other DHS components and federal agencies. Each of the 16 CI sectors has its own GCC and SCC to facilitate interagency collaboration. The NIPP framework includes Government Coordinating Councils (GCCs) and Sector Coordinating Councils (SCCs) to facilitate coordination on infrastructure issues. GCCs consist of federal and SLTT agencies, led by Sector-Specific Agencies (SSAs) like DHS. Other SSAs include EPA, GSA, and various departments. The Sector-Specific Agencies (SSAs) collaborate with various departments to develop sector-specific infrastructure protection plans that consider unique sector characteristics and risks. These plans include analyses of sector interdependencies, stakeholders, and resilience goals. The Sector-Specific Agencies collaborate with private-sector trade associations and individual CI owner-operators to develop sector-specific resilience goals and measures of effectiveness. Sector Coordinating Councils (SCCs) are self-organized groups recognized by the government, with advisory roles and information-sharing functions between government and private-sector stakeholders. SCCs may also support Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) specific to their sector for facilitating information sharing. The Sector Coordinating Councils (SCCs) collaborate with private-sector stakeholders and support Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) specific to their sector for information sharing. ISACs maintain operations centers, deploy representatives to the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) and National Infrastructure Coordinating Center (NICC), and prepare informational products for their members. Data on private-sector participation in SCC activities across Critical Infrastructure sectors is not widely available. Private-sector participation in SCC activities across Critical Infrastructure sectors varies widely depending on sector characteristics. Four cross-sector councils represent key stakeholder groups with broad interests not specific to one sector. The State, Local, Territorial, and Tribal Government Coordinating Council (SLTTGCC) aims to enhance infrastructure resilience partnerships between jurisdictions and represent common governance-related interests in GCC and SCC deliberations. The Critical Infrastructure Cross-Sector Council coordinates cross-sector issues among private-sector CI. The Federal Senior Leadership Council (FSLC) is composed of senior officials from federal departments and agencies responsible for implementation of the NIPP. It exercises leadership over other cross-sector councils and forges policy consensus among federal agencies on CI risk management strategies. The Federal Senior Leadership Council (FSLC) leads other cross-sector councils, forges policy consensus on CI risk management strategies among federal agencies, coordinates with international partners, and organizes certain deliberations under the Critical Infrastructure Partnership Advisory Council (CIPAC). The Critical Infrastructure Partnership Advisory Council (CIPAC) was established in 2006 and has been renewed multiple times, most recently in 2018. CIPAC provides legal exemptions for NIPP coordinating councils and member organizations from certain FACA provisions to facilitate discussions on sensitive infrastructure security topics. It engages government and private-sector stakeholders to develop consensus policy advice for DHS and other relevant agencies. The Homeland Security Advisory Committee (HSAC) provides advice and recommendations to the Secretary of Homeland Security on homeland security matters. Members include leaders from various sectors appointed by the Secretary. Subcommittees may be established to focus on specific issues like cybersecurity. The National Infrastructure Advisory Council consists of industry leaders advising the President and SSAs. The National Infrastructure Advisory Council, comprised of senior industry leaders, advises the President and SSAs on critical infrastructure policy. It serves as an intermediary between coordination councils, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the President, facilitating consultation between public and private sector representatives at the highest levels of government. Established in 2001, its role includes monitoring critical infrastructure sector coordinating councils and promoting information sharing mechanisms. The National Infrastructure Advisory Council, established in 2001, monitors critical infrastructure sector coordinating councils and encourages private industry to improve risk management practices. The partnership structure is flat and includes various activities such as symposia, research collaborations, and emergency preparedness. Participation involves governmental and non-governmental stakeholders from multiple sectors. The partnership structure for critical infrastructure involves governmental and non-governmental stakeholders from various sectors. The National Infrastructure Coordinating Center (NICC) plays a key role in collecting, analyzing, and sharing real-time threat information within the partnership network. The National Infrastructure Coordinating Center (NICC) collects, analyzes, and shares threat information in real-time within the critical infrastructure partnership network. It is part of the DHS National Operations Center and is administered by CISA. The National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) monitors cybersecurity incidents and provides incident response, also administered by CISA. CISA administers the NICC and the NCCIC, which collect and share threat information in real-time and monitor cybersecurity incidents. The partnership system aims to increase trust between public and private sectors for greater industry investment in system-level resilience. Private sector participation in information-sharing initiatives is a key consideration. Private-sector participation in collaboration and information-sharing initiatives with federal departments and agencies is incentivizing effective investments in programs to reduce public risk. Legislative remedies may be necessary for broader and more effective investments in risk reduction across diverse critical infrastructure sectors. Rigorous empirical analyses on collaboration within the voluntary framework are limited. Private-sector collaboration within critical infrastructure sectors varies, with limited empirical analyses on the effectiveness of partnerships. A 2013 study found that only some sectors had strong engagement in CIP issues through NIPP partnership structures, particularly in sectors with specific threats. Private-sector risk mitigation investment is driven by cost-benefit analysis, with many CI owner-operators relying on their own assessments rather than government intervention. The study highlighted the importance of private-sector risk mitigation investment, with companies relying on their own cost-benefit analysis. Government support for covering externalized social costs after a terrorist attack was also discussed. GAO testimony to Congress in 2014 identified challenges in DHS partnership efforts, including barriers to information sharing, sharing assessment results, and evaluating partnership performance. GAO found that DHS lacked systematic data collection on industry participation in security surveys and vulnerability surveys, hindering program evaluation. Despite DHS agreeing to corrective measures, GAO had not verified their implementation progress. Overall, extensive partnership activity was observed. The GAO reported that DHS's progress in implementing recommended data gathering and analysis initiatives has not been verified. There is extensive partnership activity across multiple critical infrastructure sectors, but few measures to assess effectiveness in meeting resilience goals. Congress may explore DHS's progress in this area to better understand the effectiveness of industry information sharing and risk reduction investments. Reliable data from CISA and its predecessors has not been provided. CISA and its predecessors have not provided reliable data on the effectiveness of public-partnership programs in incentivizing bidirectional information sharing and private investments in national resilience. Congress may need to introduce reporting requirements to address this gap and enhance regulatory authorities. Congress may address gaps in program effectiveness by introducing reporting requirements and enhancing regulatory authorities of federal departments and agencies to meet national critical infrastructure resilience goals. An example is the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act of 2018 (FIRRMA), which expands the jurisdiction of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) to prevent foreign adversaries from exploiting the legitimate trade system to gain control of critical infrastructure assets. CISA plans to maintain sector-specific public-private partnerships for information sharing and policy coordination, with Congress overseeing regulatory authorities related to infrastructure security. Adjustments may be needed to align partnership efforts with the federal risk management approach. The text suggests considering adjustments or replacements to streamline partnership efforts in alignment with the federal risk management approach, focusing on inter-sectoral analysis and resilience over sector-specific asset protection."
