    "content": "The \"King Cove Road Land Exchange Act\" allows for a land exchange and the construction of a road corridor, deemed to be in the public interest by Congress. The Act defines \"Federal land\" as approximately 206 acres within the Refuge, including 131 acres in the Wilderness for road construction. \"Non-Federal land\" is also defined. The road construction project involves non-Federal land owned by the State of Alaska within the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge. The road corridor is designated by the Secretary of the Interior. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior, while the term \"State\" specifically means the State of Alaska. Additionally, \"Wilderness\" is defined as the Izembek Wilderness designated by the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. SEC. 4. LAND EXCHANGE REQUIRED. The State can convey non-Federal land to the Secretary in exchange for Federal land. The Federal land will be used for a road corridor and a single-lane gravel road. Valuation and appraisals will determine the exchange value of the lands. The value of Federal and non-Federal land for exchange must be equal as determined by appraisals conducted by selected appraisers. The Secretary and State will select an appraiser to conduct appraisals of Federal and non-Federal land in accordance with nationally recognized standards. Equalization of appraised values between Federal and non-Federal land in a land exchange may involve conveying additional non-Federal land or making a cash payment to the State. In a land exchange, the State can acquire Federal land by making a cash payment or using a combination of methods. If the final appraised value of non-Federal land exceeds that of Federal land, additional non-Federal land or a cash payment may be required for equalization. The State can adjust the acreage of non-Federal land to equalize the value in a land exchange. The Secretary has the authority to accept a payment exceeding 25% of the Federal land value. Upon completion of the exchange, administration will be carried out. The land exchange under this section must be completed within 180 days of enactment. The Wilderness boundary will be modified to exclude Federal land and include non-Federal land, which will be administered according to the Wilderness Act and other applicable laws. The land exchange must be completed within 180 days of enactment, following the Wilderness Act and other laws. The road corridor will follow the southern road alignment described in the final environmental impact statement. The road constructed in the corridor must meet specific requirements outlined in the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009. The exchange of Federal land and non-Federal land, along with the construction of a road under this Act, will not be considered a major Federal action under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969."
