    "content": "The report analyzes forest management provisions in the 115th Congress, comparing them with prior laws. Enacted through two legislative vehicles, the Stephen Sepp Wildfire Suppression Funding and Forest Management Activities Act and the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018, these laws address forest management from three general perspectives. The 2018 farm bill and the Stephen Sepp Wildfire Suppression Funding Act addressed forest management through federal land management, forest assistance programs, and forestry research. This report focuses on provisions related to managing forested federal land by the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management. The Forest Service (FS) and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) manage vast amounts of public lands. The report discusses laws like NEPA and HFRA that guide forest management activities and decision-making processes for these agencies. The report summarizes provisions in the 115th Congress affecting forest management activities and procedural requirements for the Forest Service (FS) and Bureau of Land Management (BLM). It covers project planning, wildland fire management, forest management programs, and miscellaneous issues, highlighting changes made and potential concerns for Congress. The report discusses relevant issues, changes made in the 115th Congress, and potential concerns for Congress related to forest management activities. It covers project planning, wildland fire management, forest management programs, and miscellaneous issues. The Appendix contains side-by-side tables comparing forest-related provisions in each law to prior law. The National Forest Service manages approximately 145 million acres of forests and woodlands, with a focus on protecting watersheds, providing timber, and allowing for recreation, grazing, energy development, and wildlife protection. Congress has authorized the sale of certain trees for timber production and added various uses for the national forests in the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act. The National Forest Service manages 145 million acres for various uses, including timber production, watershed protection, wildlife habitat, and recreation. The Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960 and the National Forest Management Act of 1976 guide resource management for multiple uses and sustained yield without maximizing profits. The National Forest Management Act of 1976 requires the Forest Service to prepare comprehensive land and resource management plans for each National Forest System unit, involving public input. These plans must comply with various laws such as NEPA, Endangered Species Act, and National Historic Preservation Act. Each forest plan outlines desired resource conditions. The Forest Service must prepare land management plans for each National Forest System unit, following laws like NEPA, Endangered Species Act, and National Historic Preservation Act. Forest plans outline resource conditions, while projects implement these plans on the ground, such as timber harvests, trail maintenance, and fuel reduction. Projects must align with the forest plan's resource objectives and follow FS procedures for compliance. BLM manages 246 million acres of public lands, including 38 million acres of woodlands and forests, under the principles of multiple use. Projects on these lands must align with forest plans' resource objectives and comply with applicable requirements like NEPA, ESA, and NHPA. Timing and scope of project review vary based on statutory authority and potential resource impacts. Approximately 38 million acres of public lands in the western United States are woodlands and forests managed under the principles of multiple use and sustained yield. The 2.6 million acres of Oregon and California Railroad (O&C) Lands and Coos Bay Wagon Road (CBWR) Lands in western Oregon are managed for permanent forest production, providing timber, protecting watersheds, offering recreational opportunities, and contributing to the economy. BLM is directed by FLPMA to manage forest production sustainably for various purposes, including timber provision, watershed protection, recreation, and economic stability. Activities must align with resource management plans and comply with laws like NEPA, ESA, and NHPA. BLM follows procedures to ensure compliance with laws like NEPA, ESA, and NHPA, which require federal agencies to assess environmental impacts before final decisions. Depending on the proposal's impact level, an environmental impact statement (EIS) or environmental assessment (EA) may be prepared. The agency may prepare an environmental assessment (EA) to determine if an EIS is needed or issue a finding of no significant impact (FONSI) through a Decision Notice. For actions requiring an EA or EIS, the agency evaluates impacts and alternatives, including a no-action alternative. The analysis in the EIS or EA/FONSI informs the agency's decision-making process. Categorical exclusions (CEs) are categories of actions with minimal environmental impact. Categorical exclusions (CEs) are actions with minimal environmental impact that do not require an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) or an Environmental Assessment (EA). These CEs are identified by the Forest Service (FS) and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) based on past experience and some are established by Congress. Individual agencies may determine additional documentation needed for a CE. In their agency-specific procedures, federal agencies identify actions that require further documentation for a Categorical Exclusion (CE). The Forest Service (FS) and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) distinguish between actions that need a decision memorandum and those that can be approved as a CE. Each agency lists actions that require an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), an Environmental Assessment (EA) resulting in a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI), or can be approved using a CE. Regulations also address resource conditions for excluded actions. The Forest Service (FS) and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) regulations identify resource conditions termed extraordinary circumstances that may require further analysis in an Environmental Assessment (EA) or Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) instead of a Categorical Exclusion (CE). These conditions include flood plains, municipal watersheds, endangered species habitats, wilderness areas, roadless areas, and archaeological sites. The NEPA process helps identify potential environmental impacts and other requirements for projects. It serves as an umbrella compliance process, triggering additional reviews under ESA and NHPA based on project impacts. The NEPA process identifies project impacts that may require additional environmental review under laws like ESA and NHPA. Compliance with NEPA can't be waived for certain actions, but other federal laws still apply. HFRA aims to streamline planning for fuel reduction and forest restoration projects on NFS and BLM lands to prevent catastrophic wildfires by managing biomass availability. Fuel reduction projects aim to reduce wildfire risk by modifying biomass availability through various methods. HFRA allows expedited planning for specific hazardous fuel reduction projects, covering up to 20 million acres of federal land. Relevant terms like At-Risk Community are defined under HFRA. Authorized Hazardous Fuels Reduction Projects (HFRA Projects) aim to reduce wildfire risk in At-Risk Communities through methods such as prescribed fire and mechanical methods. These projects cover up to 20 million acres of federal land. Reduction Projects (HFRA Projects) focus on reducing hazardous fuels through prescribed fire, wildland fire use, and mechanical methods. Fire Regimes and Condition Classes are terms used to assess historical fire patterns and prioritize fuel reduction projects. Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) refers to areas near at-risk communities. HFRA projects focus on reducing hazardous fuels in specific areas like the Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) and lands with threatened species habitat at risk of wildfire. HFRA projects focus on reducing hazardous fuels in specific areas like the Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) and lands with threatened species habitat at risk of wildfire. Projects must be consistent with the land and resource management plan in place for the area and exclude designated wilderness areas or areas prohibiting vegetation removal by law. Certain projects must focus on thinning, prescribed fire, or removing small-diameter trees to modify fire behavior. The HFRA directs Forest Service projects to focus on reducing hazardous fuels in specific areas, excluding designated wilderness areas. Projects must use thinning, prescribed fire, or tree removal to modify fire behavior and promote large or old-growth tree retention for fire resiliency. The HFRA also established an objection process for proposed projects, requiring objections to be filed within 30 days of the agency's publication of draft decision documents. The HFRA established an objection process for proposed projects, with objections limited to parties who submitted specific comments during the comment periods. Objections can only be on issues raised within those comments, and if no comments were received, no objections will be accepted. Judicial review in federal court is available if the objector is not satisfied after the administrative review process. After the objection process, judicial review in federal court is the next step. Only issues raised during public comment periods and pre-decisional reviews can be considered, unless new significant issues arise. Congress mandated the Forest Service to use the pre-decisional objection process for all projects, with some variations between HFRA and non-HFRA projects. The pre-decisional objection process applies to all Forest Service projects, with differences between HFRA and non-HFRA projects. The 2014 farm bill authorized the establishment of landscape-scale insect and disease treatment areas within the NFS, designated by the Chief of the Forest Service at the request of the state governor. Eligibility requires experiencing declining forest conditions. The 2014 farm bill authorized the establishment of landscape-scale insect and disease treatment areas within the NFS, designated by the Chief of the Forest Service at the request of the state governor. Eligibility requires declining forest health, risk of substantial tree mortality, or hazard trees threatening public safety. Approximately 74.5 million acres nationwide have been designated as I&D areas for priority projects to reduce insect or disease infestations. The 2014 farm bill authorized landscape-scale insect and disease treatment areas within the NFS, designated by the Chief of the Forest Service at the request of the state governor. Approximately 74.5 million acres nationwide have been designated as I&D areas for priority projects to reduce insect or disease infestations. FS may prioritize projects that reduce the risk or extent of infestations within the I&D areas, subject to HFRA regulations. These projects must be developed collaboratively and consider the best available science. Congress authorized the Forest Service to identify eligible National Forest System areas for designation as Insect and Disease (I&D) areas. Projects within the Wildland Urban Interface (WUI) require analysis of the proposed action and one action alternative, while projects outside the WUI must consider the no-action alternative as well. The Forest Service was authorized by Congress to designate eligible National Forest System areas as Insect and Disease (I&D) areas. Projects within the Wildland Urban Interface (WUI) require analysis of the proposed action and one action alternative, while projects outside the WUI must consider the no-action alternative as well. As of March 2019, the Forest Service has proposed 206 projects across 59 national forests and 18 states under these authorities, with 20 projects being evaluated using EA analysis procedures and three using an EIS. The Forest Service has proposed 206 projects across 59 national forests and 18 states under authorities for Insect and Disease (I&D) areas. Of these, 20 projects are being evaluated using EA analysis procedures, three using an EIS, and the remaining 183 projects are processed using a CE. The 2014 farm bill added a new Section 603 to HFRA, specifying certain projects to reduce insect or disease infestations as categorically excluded from NEPA requirements. The 2018 Farm Bill added hazardous fuels projects as a priority project category eligible for implementation through the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program (CFLRP) or by considering the best available science. Projects under this bill are exempt from the pre-decisional administrative review objections process. The 2018 Farm Bill added hazardous fuels projects as a priority category for implementation through CFLRP or by considering the best available science. Projects must maximize retention of old-growth and large trees, be developed collaboratively, and not exceed 3,000 acres. They must be located within designated I&D areas and may be in the WUI. New permanent roads are not allowed, and temporary roads must be decommissioned within three years. Maintenance and repairs of existing roads are permitted. The 2018 Farm Bill prioritized hazardous fuels projects for implementation through CFLRP or based on the best available science. Projects must retain old-growth and large trees, be collaborative, and not exceed 3,000 acres within designated I&D areas or the WUI. FS policy requires documenting decisions using the Farm Bill CE through a decision memorandum, considering extraordinary circumstances. The FY2018 omnibus and 2018 farm bill expanded HFRA authorities for FS and BLM planning and project implementation. The FY2018 omnibus and the 2018 farm bill expanded HFRA authorities for FS and BLM planning and project implementation, allowing for the inclusion of fuel breaks and fire breaks in authorized fuel reduction projects. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized procedures under HFRA for priority projects in I&D areas, including hazardous fuels reduction projects using the Farm Bill CE. The 2018 farm bill established new statutory CEs for projects in I&D areas, including wildfire resilience projects for FS and projects related to greater sage grouse or mule. The bill also included provisions affecting interagency consultation requirements under the ESA. The FY2018 omnibus and 2018 farm bill established new statutory CEs for projects in I&D areas, including wildfire resilience projects for FS and projects related to greater sage grouse or mule deer habitat. These CEs allow for larger projects to be planned and implemented, but the potential impact on forest management goals is uncertain. The statutory CEs and the 2014 Farm Bill CE allow for larger projects (up to 3,000 to 4,500 acres) to be planned and implemented by FS and BLM. Using a CE for environmental review can expedite project implementation, as shown by a 2014 GAO report that found CEs took 177 days to complete compared to 565 days for EAs in FY2012. In FY2012, a GAO report showed that CEs took 177 days to complete, while EAs took 565 days. FS used CEs less frequently and took longer to complete them compared to other agencies. Concerns exist about conducting large projects without detailed environmental reviews, but a Wildfire Resilience CE was established in FY2018. The Wildfire Resilience CE, established in FY2018, is similar to the Farm Bill CE and is for hazardous fuel reduction projects in designated areas on NFS lands. FS policy requires a decision memo to use the Farm Bill CE after assessing environmental impacts. Eligible projects must meet CFLRP requirements or prioritize retention of resources. Eligible projects for the Wildfire Resilience CE must comply with CFLRP eligibility requirements or prioritize retention of old-growth and large trees for resiliency. Projects cannot exceed 3,000 acres, establish new permanent roads, and must decommission temporary roads within three years. Maintenance and repairs of existing roads are allowed. The Wildfire Resilience CE allows for projects within I&D areas, prioritizing those in the WUI or Condition Class 2 or 3 fire regime groups. The Secretary must report annually on project use to congressional committees and GAO. Seven projects were proposed in FY2018. The Wildfire Resilience CE authorizes projects in designated areas, with location and purpose requirements similar to the 2014 Farm Bill CE. Seven projects were proposed in FY2018, with specific fire regime conditions and wildfire hazard potential criteria. The Wildfire Resilience CE prioritizes projects in areas with high wildfire hazard potential, specifically within the Wildland Urban Interface (WUI). It focuses on hazardous fuels reduction projects and follows Congress's directive to evaluate extraordinary circumstances on project sites. Unlike the Farm Bill CE, it does not address insect and disease infestation. The Wildfire Resilience CE focuses on projects in high wildfire hazard areas, particularly in the Wildland Urban Interface (WUI). Congress directed FS to assess extraordinary circumstances on project sites, which may require further analysis through an EA or EIS. The Farm Bill CE does not cover insect and disease infestation. Section 8611 of the 2018 farm bill mandates the establishment of a CE for specified projects on NFS and BLM lands. The 2018 farm bill mandates the establishment of a CE for specified projects on NFS and BLM lands to protect, restore, or improve greater sage-grouse and/or mule-deer habitat within one year of enactment. Projects must be consistent with the existing resource management plan and comply with DOI Secretarial Order 3336. The law mandates a CE for projects on NFS and BLM lands to protect sage-grouse and mule-deer habitat. Activities include removing nonnative vegetation, targeted grazing, and herbicide use. Projects must not occur in designated wilderness areas or include new permanent roads. Temporary roads must be decommissioned. Projects on NFS and BLM lands to protect sage-grouse and mule-deer habitat must adhere to restrictions on vegetation removal and road construction. Temporary roads must be decommissioned within three years, and projects cannot exceed 4,500 acres. Additionally, projects on NFS lands are limited to designated I&D areas. Agencies must consider extraordinary circumstances and landscape-scale habitat efficacy when determining the use of a CE. The agencies must consider the efficacy of landscape-scale habitat projects, potential population declines without vegetation management, and the need for habitat restoration. A 20-year monitoring plan is required before using the CE, which differs from other CEs in project purposes and requirements. The Endangered Species Act aims to conserve endangered species and their ecosystems. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) aims to conserve species at risk of extinction and their ecosystems. Administered by the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service, it allows for species to be listed as endangered or threatened, with corresponding prohibitions once listed. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) aims to conserve species at risk of extinction. Once listed, federal agencies must ensure their actions do not harm endangered or threatened species or their habitats through Section 7 consultation. The Endangered Species Act requires federal agencies to consult with FWS or NMFS if their actions may harm listed species. This consultation, known as Section 7, is not needed for actions mandated by statute. If no harm is found, a biological opinion is issued with conditions for the action to proceed. The BiOp outlines terms and conditions for federal actions to avoid harm to listed species or critical habitat. Consultations usually result in \"no jeopardy\" opinions or suggest alternatives to prevent harm. FY2018 omnibus made changes to Section 7 consultation requirements for land and resource management plans. The FY2018 omnibus enacted changes to Section 7 consultation requirements for land and resource management plans on NFS, O&C, and CBWR lands in Oregon. The law specifies that listing a species as threatened or endangered does not require consultation to update a forest plan unless it is older than 15 years and 5 years have passed since the listing. The FY2018 omnibus made changes to Section 7 consultation requirements for forest plans on NFS, O&C, and CBWR lands in Oregon. It states that updating a forest plan is not required if it is less than 15 years old and 5 years have passed since the species was listed as threatened or endangered. The changes are controversial as they override a Ninth Circuit Court decision regarding re-consultation on land management plans after critical habitat designation for the Canada lynx. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals required FS to conduct re-consultation on land management plans after critical habitat was designated for the Canada lynx. Proponents argue that not requiring Section 7 consultations for existing plans will provide flexibility, consistency, and fewer delays in implementation. Opponents argue against these provisions. The proposed change in the law would allow for adjustments to plans based on changes to listed species and critical habitat. Opponents argue that not allowing for consultation in such cases could harm species and their habitat. Proponents argue that projects under a plan still require consultation, making additional consultation redundant. The proposed change in the law would allow adjustments to plans based on listed species and critical habitat. Critics argue that plans address projects at a higher level and could impact the cumulative effect of all activities. The federal government's wildland fire management responsibilities include fuel reduction, prevention, detection, response, and recovery activities. Funding for wildfire suppression was changed in the FY2018 omnibus and 2018 farm bill. The FY2018 omnibus and 2018 farm bill made changes to wildfire funding, risk mapping, and reporting requirements. These laws also impacted FS and DOI's hazardous fuel reduction programs by reauthorizing procedures for priority projects and expanding authorized fuel reduction projects. Congress provides discretionary appropriations for wildland fire management to both FS and DOI through the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill. Funding for DOI is allocated to the Office of Wildland Fire and four agencies\u2014BLM, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the National Park Service, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Within FS's and DOI's Wildland Fire Management (WFM) account, funding is provided for priority projects in NFS areas designated as I&D areas and expanding the definition of authorized fuel reduction projects. Funding for wildland fire management is provided to the Forest Service (FS) and Department of the Interior (DOI) through appropriations. FS and DOI have the authority to transfer funds from other accounts to cover wildfire suppression costs if their allocated funds are depleted, a practice known as fire borrowing. Overall, appropriations for wildland fire management have increased significantly since the 1990s, with a notable portion of the increase attributed to rising suppression costs. Despite varying costs annually and difficulties in predicting them, FS and DOI often require more suppression funds than allocated, leading to fire borrowing and concerns about the impact on other agency programs. Funds for wildland fire management have increased significantly since the 1990s, with rising suppression costs leading to fire borrowing. Congress has enacted supplemental appropriations to address discrepancies in funding, with discussions in the 115th Congress about providing wildfire spending outside of budgetary constraints. In the FY2018 omnibus, the 115th Congress established a new mechanism for wildfire suppression funding outside of budget constraints, known as the wildfire funding fix. This was prompted by rising suppression costs and the need to address discrepancies in funding for wildland fire management. The FY2018 omnibus established a new mechanism for wildfire suppression funding outside of budget constraints, known as the wildfire funding fix. This involves enforcing spending limits through sequestration, with certain spending exempt from limits for emergency and disaster relief purposes. The FY2018 omnibus established a new adjustment to the nondefense discretionary spending limit for wildfire suppression operations, starting in FY2020 and continuing through FY2027. This adjustment includes funding for emergency wildland firefighting activities, emergency management, and repayment of necessary transfers. The FY2018 omnibus established a new adjustment to the nondefense discretionary spending limit for wildfire suppression operations, starting in FY2020 and continuing through FY2027. This adjustment includes funding for emergency wildland firefighting activities, emergency management, and repayment of necessary transfers. The adjustment would apply to appropriations provided above the 10-year average spending level for wildfire suppression operations as calculated for FY2015, with a cap starting at $2.25 billion in FY2020 and increasing to $2.95 billion in FY2027. The adjustment to the nondefense discretionary spending limit for wildfire suppression operations, starting in FY2020 and continuing through FY2027, is capped each fiscal year, starting at $2.25 billion in FY2020 and increasing by $0.1 billion to $2.95 billion in FY2027. Congress could appropriate up to an additional $2.25 billion in FY2020 for suppression operations, effectively outside of the discretionary spending limits established in the BCA for FY2020 and FY2021. The agencies could potentially receive up to $3.64 billion in FY2020 for wildfire suppression, with an additional $2.25 billion outside of discretionary limits. This funding surpasses the $2.16 billion average received annually over the past 5 years. The wildfire funding fix may alleviate budget process barriers. The wildfire funding fix potentially removes budget process barriers for providing additional wildfire suppression funds, with agencies receiving $2.16 billion annually on average. The BCA statutory limits for discretionary spending are in effect until FY2021, but if new limits are established for FY2022 through FY2027, the wildfire adjustment would still apply. Congress's decision on providing fire borrowing authority post-wildfire adjustment remains uncertain. The wildfire funding fix removes budget process barriers for additional wildfire suppression funds. Congress's decision on providing fire borrowing authority post-wildfire adjustment is uncertain. Section 103 of the FY2018 omnibus requires prompt submission of a request for supplemental appropriations if wildfire suppression funds are estimated to be exhausted within 30 days. This provision gives Congress notice of the likely need for additional funding. The wildfire funding fix raises concerns for Congress, such as accountability and oversight of suppression spending. The FY2015 baseline and annual adjustment limits are not tied to inflationary factors. The wildfire funding fix raises concerns about accountability and oversight of suppression spending, as the FY2015 baseline and annual adjustment limits are not linked to inflationary factors. However, the fix is only a temporary procedural change and does not address other concerns like improving cost forecasting or evaluating suppression methods. The Fire Modeling Institute developed a Wildfire Hazard Potential index to aid in strategic planning and fuel management decisions at a national scale. Approximately 226 million acres of land in the continental United States are classified at high or very high WHP. FS estimates that 226 million acres in the US are classified at high or very high Wildfire Hazard Potential (WHP). Of these, 53% are federal lands and 47% are state, tribal, other public, or private lands. High or very high WHP indicates a higher risk of extreme fire behavior under certain weather conditions. This data, when combined with spatial data, can help assess wildfire risk to resources and assets. The FY2018 omnibus directs FS to pair the Wildfire Hazard Potential (WHP) data with appropriate spatial data to approximate wildfire risk for resources and assets. Section 210 requires FS to develop web-based wildfire hazard severity maps for community use within two years, in consultation with federal and state partners, colleges, and universities. This is to inform risk management decisions for at-risk communities adjacent to NFS lands or affected by wildland fire. The FY2018 omnibus and the 2018 farm bill mandate FS and BLM to submit reports to Congress on wildland fire management. The reports must be submitted annually within 90 days after the fiscal year ends if the wildfire funding fix is used. The first report is due by December 30, 2021, if the wildfire adjustment is used in FY2020. The Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior are required to consult with the OMB Director in preparing the reports. The report, due by December 30, 2021, must document the use of the wildfire funding fix and overall wildland fire management spending. It should analyze fire size, costs, regional location, and other factors, as well as identify \"risk-based factors\" influencing suppression management. The Secretaries will prepare the report in consultation with the OMB Director and submit it to specific House and Senate Committees. The 2018 farm bill requires a report on wildland fire management spending, analyzing factors like fire size, costs, and regional location. It also includes an analysis of large fires, looking at cost drivers, effectiveness of fuel treatments, and investments in preparedness activities. The report is due by December 30, 2021, and will be submitted to specific House and Senate Committees. The 2018 farm bill mandates a report on wildfire, insect infestation, and disease prevention on federal land to be submitted to Congress. The report must detail the number of acres treated annually and is due within 180 days of the bill's enactment, with subsequent annual reports required. The farm bill requires an annual report on wildfire, insect infestation, and disease prevention on federal land. The report includes details on acres treated, fire risk levels, wildfire impact, federal response time, timber production, road and trail maintenance needs, and other measures for land maintenance and improvement. Forest restoration activities aim to enhance ecosystem resilience by establishing or reestablishing necessary composition, structure, and ecological processes. This includes thinning small-diameter trees to reduce tree density and improve resistance to disturbance events like wildfires or insect infestations. Forest restoration activities, such as thinning small-diameter trees to reduce density, are conducted to mitigate against insect or disease infestations and catastrophic wildfires. The authority for these projects comes from FLPMA for BLM and the Organic Administration Act for FS. The authority for forest restoration projects for the Forest Service (FS) and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is primarily derived from various acts such as the Organic Administration Act of 1897, Multiple Use Sustained Yield Act (MUSY), and Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974. Congress has also authorized specific forest restoration programs for FS and BLM. The 115th Congress established new forest restoration programs for FS and BLM, including watershed condition framework and water source protection. Existing programs like CFLRP, stewardship contracting authority, and good neighbor authority were also amended to allow partnerships with stakeholders for forest management and restoration activities. Forest restoration programs under the FS's \"Shared Stewardship\" approach involve collaborating with stakeholders to address land management concerns at a landscape-scale. These programs aim to accelerate forest restoration to mitigate insect infestations, reduce wildfire risks, and provide benefits to surrounding communities such as supporting local industries and creating new markets for restoration. Title IV of the Omnibus Public Lands Management Act of 2009 established the CFLRP to fund collaboratively developed restoration proposals for priority forest landscapes, providing benefits to surrounding communities and promoting collaboration among stakeholders. The CFLRP funds restoration proposals for priority forest landscapes, involving diverse stakeholders and meeting RAC requirements. Priority landscapes are over 50,000 acres of NFS lands needing restoration, accessible to wood-processing infrastructure, and may include other land types. Proposals must use best available science and include collaborative projects. The proposal area must be accessible by wood-processing infrastructure and incorporate the best available science. Projects should focus on maintaining or restoring old-growth stands and reducing hazardous fuels. No new permanent roads are allowed, and any temporary roads must be decommissioned. The Secretary of Agriculture can select and fund up to 10 proposals annually, with reporting requirements to specified congressional committees. The Forest Service has selected and funded 23 proposals since FY2010 to implement forest restoration goals. The law established a fund to cover up to 50% of project costs, with annual appropriations of up to $40 million. The law established a fund to cover up to 50% of project costs, with annual appropriations of up to $40 million through FY2019. Each selected proposal can receive up to $4 million per year for 10 years for project implementation. The program received $40 million annually from FY2014 to FY2019 and is seen as successful in achieving land management objectives and boosting local economies. The program, funded up to $40 million annually, is generally successful in achieving land management objectives and boosting local economies. However, some feel it falls short in fostering new markets for wood products and reducing treatment costs. Section 8629 of the 2018 farm bill reauthorized the program, allowing up to $80 million in annual appropriations through FY2023. The Secretary of Agriculture can issue a one-time waiver to extend funding for existing projects for up to 10 years. Some feel the program improves relationships with stakeholders and collaboration, but progress on complex issues is limited. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized the program with up to $80 million in annual appropriations through FY2023. The Secretary of Agriculture can extend funding for existing projects for up to 10 years, with the possibility of projects continuing beyond FY2019 if reauthorized. Congressional appropriation to the new authorization level could result in more projects being funded. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized the program with up to $80 million in annual appropriations through FY2023, allowing projects to continue beyond the initial time-frame. Congress could appropriate to the new authorization level, resulting in more projects being selected and funded. Good neighbor agreements (GNAs) allow states to do restoration work on NFS and BLM public lands, including treating trees and reducing hazardous fuels. Authorized restoration services on NFS and BLM public lands include treating insect- and disease-infested trees, reducing hazardous fuels, and activities to improve forest, rangeland, and watershed health. Prohibited treatments in designated wilderness areas, wilderness study areas, or areas where vegetation removal is prohibited. Excluded construction, repair, or restoration of paved roads. The 2014 farm bill authorization did not include construction, reconstruction, repair, or restoration of paved or permanent roads on federal lands. States may perform the work, but FS and BLM must comply with all applicable federal laws. Master Agreements outline the scope of the GNA, with Supplemental Project Agreements detailing specific terms. The GNA serves as an umbrella for SPAs, with FS executing 48 MAs in 33 states and 105 SPAs in 28 states. GNAs cover 82 national forests and focus on specific project types like timber production, wildlife, hazardous fuels management, and other activities. The good neighbor authority is generally seen as successful. The good neighbor authority (GNA) is perceived as successful in enhancing state-federal relationships and performing cross boundary restoration work. Some states have concerns about sustained future GNA work, but changes were made in the FY2018 omnibus and the 2018 farm bill to authorize GNA forest restoration activities. The 2018 farm bill expanded the good neighbor authority (GNA) to include Indian tribes and county governments. It also specified that state funds from timber sales under GNA should be used for additional projects until FY2023. The 2018 farm bill expanded the good neighbor authority (GNA) to tribes and county governments, allowing state funds from timber sales to be used for additional projects. This could lead to increased cross-boundary restoration work and leveraging of nonfederal resources, but may also increase administrative demands on FS or BLM. The good neighbor authority (GNA) allows FS and BLM to enter into multi-year stewardship contracts for project implementation, with revenue-sharing concerns and increased administrative demands. The Good Neighbor Authority (GNA) allows the Forest Service (FS) and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to enter into multi-year contracts for land management goals. This includes combining timber sale contracts with service contracts to offset costs. The Good Neighbor Authority (GNA) allows FS and BLM to enter into multi-year contracts for land management goals, combining timber sale contracts with service contracts to offset costs. Service activities include removing brush and trees, with the value of harvested timber used to trade for services. Land management goals include improving water quality, forest health, reducing fire hazards, increasing soil productivity, restoring watersheds, fish and wildlife habitats, and native plant species. Excess timber sale revenue can be deposited by FS and BLM. FS and BLM can deposit excess timber sale revenue in their Stewardship Contracting Fund, allowing them to use the funds for other stewardship projects without further appropriation. Contracts can be awarded based on best value, considering past performance and proposal quality. Preference can be given to contractors using wood products innovatively. Annual reports on stewardship contract development and accomplishments are required. Stewardship contracting allows FS and BLM to use excess timber sale revenue for other projects. Contracts can be awarded based on best value, with a preference for innovative wood product use. Stakeholders generally view stewardship contracting favorably, citing increased restoration goals and economic benefits. Some express concerns about market support and certainty. Some concerns regarding stewardship contracting include the need for more market support, potential incentives to remove ecologically important trees, distribution of receipts, upfront financial obligations, and slow implementation pace. The initial implementation of stewardship contracting faced challenges due to integrating different contract types and poor record-keeping. Despite improvements in contracting systems and increased contract offerings, a 2015 USDA OIG report highlighted issues with FS' contract administration and record-keeping for stewardship contracts. The OIG report identified issues with FS' contract administration and record-keeping for stewardship contracts. New guidance was issued in 2016 in response to the report findings. The FY2018 omnibus authorized FS and BLM to enter into 20-year stewardship contracts in specific fire regime areas. The FY2018 omnibus authorized FS and BLM to enter into 20-year stewardship contracts in specific fire regime areas, with a procurement preference for innovative forest product use. The law also allowed for cancellation ceilings and the use of excess revenues to cover liabilities from cancelled contracts. Congressional notification is required for FS or BLM. The law authorizes FS and BLM to enter 20-year stewardship contracts with cancellation ceilings. Congressional notification is required for contracts exceeding $25 million without proposed funding. Funds can be obligated in stages, and excess revenue can offset cancellation costs. The potential benefits of using 20-year stewardship contracts and procurement preference include resolving financial concerns and increasing market certainty for forest products industries. However, it is unclear if there are any drawbacks to the expanded time-frame. The protection of watersheds is an authorized activity of many FS programs, but OMB identified inadequacies in FS's watershed programs in a 2006 assessment report. The OMB identified inadequacies in FS's watershed programs in a 2006 assessment report, citing lack of water quality data and inconsistent national approach. FS committed to developing outcome-based performance measures, improving water quality data, and prioritizing watershed management on NFS lands. The Forest Service developed a Watershed Condition Framework to classify and prioritize watersheds for restoration action plans. However, a 2017 USDA OIG report found inadequacies in the management and implementation of the program, including lack of coordination and oversight at the national level. The 2017 USDA OIG report identified deficiencies in the Forest Service's management of the Watershed Condition Framework program, including inadequate coordination and oversight at the national level and shortcomings in record-keeping for monitoring project costs and performance. The 2018 farm bill codified the program, assigning specific responsibilities and priorities, authorizing the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a Watershed Condition Framework for National Forest System land. The 2018 farm bill authorized the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a Watershed Condition Framework (WCF) for National Forest System (NFS) land. The framework allows the Forest Service to evaluate and classify watershed conditions, identify priority watersheds for protection and restoration, and develop restoration action plans in coordination with nonfederal landowners and governments. The 2018 farm bill authorized the Secretary of Agriculture to establish a Watershed Condition Framework for National Forest System land. This framework allows the Forest Service to prioritize protection and restoration activities on key watersheds, including an emergency designation process for rehabilitation after significant wildfire impact. Water source protection is a key goal of many Forest Service programs. Water source protection is a key goal of many Forest Service programs, authorized by the 2018 farm bill. The Secretary of Agriculture can enter cooperative agreements for watershed restoration with various entities, sharing costs if in the public interest. Activities include improving resources on NFS lands within the watershed. The 2018 farm bill amended HFRA to establish a Water Source Protection program on NFS land, allowing FS to enter into partnerships to protect and restore NFS watersheds serving as sources of municipal water. Forest management activities are carried out as part of watershed protection projects. The 2018 farm bill amended HFRA to establish a Water Source Protection program on NFS land, allowing FS to enter into partnerships to protect and restore NFS watersheds serving as sources of municipal water. FS may develop a water source management plan for watershed protection and restoration projects, conducting forest management activities to protect water supplies and restore forest health. The law authorizes FS to conduct environmental analysis for plan development or project proposals, and accept various forms of assistance to implement the plan. The 2018 farm bill established a Water Source Protection program on NFS land, allowing FS to partner with others to protect and restore NFS watersheds for municipal water sources. Congress authorized $10 million annually for the Water Source Protection Fund through FY2023, with provisions for matching partner donations. Various provisions in the bill also address federal forest land management, including designating NFS lands as part of the National Wilderness Preservation System and other land-related activities. The 2018 farm bill designated new wilderness areas and expanded existing ones on NFS lands in Tennessee, including the establishment of the Upper Bald River Wilderness on Cherokee National Forest covering 9,038 acres. Additional acres were added to existing wilderness areas like Big Frog. The 2018 farm bill designated new wilderness areas and expanded existing ones on NFS lands in Tennessee, including additions to Big Frog, Big Laurel Branch, Joyce Kilmer-Slickrock Wilderness, Little Frog Mountain, and Sampson Mountain on the Cherokee National Forest. These areas are managed in accordance with the Wilderness Act, prohibiting most commercial activities and motorized access. The FY2018 omnibus and 2018 farm bill enacted provisions for FS and/or BLM acquisition changes. The FY2018 omnibus and 2018 farm bill introduced provisions for FS and/or BLM to acquire, exchange, or dispose of federal land, including establishing new programs for leasing isolated parcels and reauthorizing programs for selling or exchanging BLM lands for administrative purposes. Section 302 of the FY2018 omnibus reauthorized the Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act to sell BLM lands for disposal and acquire lands for administrative purposes. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized the Forest Service Facility Realignment and Enhancement program, allowing conveyance of administrative sites or undeveloped parcels of NFS land. Additionally, the 2018 farm bill modified the Small Tracts Act by expanding eligibility requirements. The 2018 farm bill expanded eligibility requirements for the Small Tracts Act program and authorized exchanges or sales for specific parcels and entities. The Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture can issue rights-of-way for BLM and NFS lands, allowing for specific use. Rights-of-way (ROW) are special use authorizations for BLM and NFS lands, allowing for specific use such as water infrastructure, transportation systems, electricity generation, communication systems, and roads. The BLM and NFS issue special use authorizations for rights-of-way on their lands for various purposes such as water infrastructure, transportation systems, electricity generation, communication systems, and roads. Fees are charged for processing applications and monitoring activities, including an annual land use rental fee. The BLM and NFS charge fees for processing and monitoring special use authorizations for rights-of-way on their lands. Rental fees are based on land value for linear ROWs and on the type of communication use for communication sites. The 115th Congress directed FS to update their process and fee schedule for communication sites and issued new regulations for activities within electricity ROWs. The 115th Congress directed FS and BLM to issue new regulations for activities within electricity ROWs and utility ROWs to address concerns about wildfire ignitions. Power line ignitions are a key concern due to weather conditions causing vegetation to come into contact with power lines, leading to larger fires. The 115th Congress directed FS and BLM to issue new regulations for activities within electricity ROWs and utility ROWs to address concerns about wildfire ignitions. Some believe weather conditions causing vegetation to contact power lines contribute to larger fires. Confusing administrative processes may hinder ROW permit-holders from conducting necessary maintenance activities to mitigate fire risk on federal lands within their ROWs. The Congress provisions aim to improve approval processes for ROW permit holders to implement vegetation management projects on federal lands. Some believe process improvements for ROW permit holders on federal lands could enhance land conditions, but concerns exist about balancing project expediting with accountability to federal laws. Provisions outline responsibilities for wildfire costs within ROWs and liability caps for permit holders, raising concerns about their breadth and implications. Some are concerned about the provisions limiting damages and liability for ROW permit holders on federal lands, fearing disproportionate costs for suppressing wildfires. Others argue that these provisions will encourage prompt agency action on maintenance requests and reflect that utilities should not bear full wildfire costs due to past agency actions contributing to increased fuel levels. The 2018 farm bill directed the Secretary of Agriculture to revise the process for issuing special use authorizations for communications on NFS lands within one year. The new process must be streamlined, uniform, and standardized across the NFS. The 2018 farm bill directed the Secretary of Agriculture to revise the process for issuing special use authorizations for communications on NFS lands. The law specified that the new process must be streamlined, uniform, and standardized, with lease terms of at least 15 years. Regulations must establish a fee structure based on processing costs, with fees deposited into a new Treasury account for managing communication sites. The 2018 farm bill directed the Secretary of Agriculture to revise the process for issuing special use authorizations for communications on NFS lands, with fees deposited into a new Treasury account for managing communication sites. Section 211 of the FY2018 omnibus amended FLPMA and established a new Section 512 for vegetation management and maintenance on federal land containing electric transmission facilities. The 2018 farm bill directed the Secretary of Agriculture to revise the process for issuing special use authorizations for communications on NFS lands. Section 211 of the FY2018 omnibus amended FLPMA and established a new Section 512 for vegetation management and maintenance on federal land containing electric transmission facilities. The law directed FS and BLM to issue guidance for planning and implementing vegetation management, facility inspections, and operation and maintenance activities within electric transmission and distribution ROWs. Owners are authorized to develop and submit plans for approval. The law directs eligible ROW permit holders to develop and submit plans for approval to conduct activities within their ROW. Owners may also conduct certain management activities without an approved plan in specific circumstances. FS and BLM are tasked with identifying NEPA categorical exclusions for these activities. Secretaries are required to propose regulations within one year of enactment. The law requires eligible ROW permit holders to submit plans for approval to conduct activities within their ROW. FS and BLM are responsible for identifying NEPA categorical exclusions for these activities. The law also encourages the development of training programs for vegetation management and the electrical transmission system. Additionally, the law specifies ROW permit holder liabilities related to vegetation management activities. The law prohibits strict liability for damages exceeding $500,000 for activities conducted by a ROW holder under certain conditions. FS and BLM must report on the impacts of liability clauses to Congress within four years. Section 8630 of the 2018 farm bill established a pilot program for utility ROW permit holders on NFS land until FY2023. The 2018 farm bill established a pilot program for utility right-of-way (ROW) permit holders on National Forest System (NFS) land until FY2023. The program allows permit holders to develop vegetation management plans for NFS lands within their ROWs and perform projects up to 75 feet from the ROW. Participants may also pay for and implement projects on specified NFS lands. Participants in the pilot program for utility right-of-way (ROW) permit holders on National Forest System (NFS) land can develop vegetation management plans and perform projects on specified NFS lands within and up to 75 feet from the ROW. They must follow FS and state regulations for fire prevention and vegetation removal activities. Participants are responsible for project costs, but the Secretary of Agriculture may provide funds. FS is required to submit a program status report to Congress every two years. The law allows utility ROW permit holders on NFS land to implement a pilot program for vegetation management. Participants must follow regulations for fire prevention and vegetation removal. FS must submit a program status report to Congress every two years. Participants are responsible for project costs, but FS may provide funds. If a wildfire is caused by a participant's operations, they must reimburse FS for suppression costs, with credits for providing resources. The cost of resources caused by operations in the ROW will be credited towards reimbursement costs, with a limit of $500,000 in certain cases. The electricity ROW provisions in the FY2018 omnibus differ from the ROW pilot program on NFS lands. The 2018 farm bill pilot program includes electricity, natural gas, and related infrastructure, with participant responsibilities limited. The 2018 farm bill program covers electricity, natural gas, and related infrastructure in ROWs. Participant responsibilities are limited to wildfire and vegetation management. Counties with NFS, O&C, and CBWR lands receive payments based on prior year revenue. SRS offers optional payments based on historic revenue, land acreage, and per capita income. The SRS payments were based on a formula considering historic revenue payments, land acreage, and per capita income. Payments were allocated among three categories for funding education, roads, projects on lands, and specified county programs like fire prevention and emergency services. Title III payments under Title II were designated for county programs such as fire prevention, county planning, and emergency services like search and rescue and firefighting. Resource Advisory Committees (RACs) were established to enhance collaborative relationships and provide advice to agencies, with specific membership requirements including representation from outdoor recreation, timber industry, environmental organizations, and local elected officials. The authorized payment level for Secure Rural Schools (SRS) was set at 95% of the previous year's payment level. SRS payments were extended multiple times until FY2016, with counties receiving lower revenue-sharing payments when SRS payments were not authorized. Counties received a revenue-sharing payment in FY2017 after the last authorized SRS payments in FY2016. The FY2018 omnibus reauthorized SRS payments for FY2017 and FY2018, with counties receiving a full SRS payment for FY2017 at 95% of the last authorized payment level. The FY2018 omnibus reauthorized SRS payments for FY2017 and FY2018 at 95% of the last authorized payment level. The reauthorization also expanded the uses for Title III funds and changed some payment allocation requirements. The 2018 farm bill made changes to the SRS statute despite its expiration. No additional payments are authorized after FY2018. The 2018 farm bill enacted changes to the SRS statute, establishing a process for modifying RAC membership requirements and a pilot program for appointing RAC members in Montana and Arizona. These changes were made in response to concerns about the prohibitive requirements for RACs. The Tribal Forest Protection Act authorized the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior to enter agreements for NFS and BLM lands. The Tribal Forest Protection Act allows the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior to collaborate with federally recognized Indian tribes for forest projects on tribal lands or adjacent NFS and BLM lands. Projects must address forest restoration or threats to tribal lands, evaluated based on \"best value basis\" and unique tribal circumstances. The Tribal Forest Protection Act allows collaboration between federal agencies and Indian tribes for forest projects on tribal lands or adjacent federal lands. Projects are evaluated based on \"best value basis\" and unique tribal circumstances, authorized under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. The 2018 farm bill authorized self-determination contracts with tribes for TFPA functions on NFS land, with the Secretary of Agriculture carrying out delegated responsibilities. Decision-making authority over NEPA and TFPA remains with the Secretary concerned. Congress may address related issues. The 2018 farm bill authorized self-determination contracts with tribes for TFPA functions on NFS land, with the Secretary of Agriculture carrying out delegated responsibilities. Congress may consider oversight of the agencies' implementation of the new laws and the implications of these changes for federal forest management, including addressing concerns with forest restoration on around 52-58 million acres of NFS lands at high fire risk or insect infestation. Around 52-58 million acres of NFS lands are at high fire risk or insect infestation and in need of restoration treatments. The Forest Service accomplishes 2-6 million acres of treatments annually, but it would take 9-29 years to eliminate the backlog. Hazardous fuels are accumulating faster than treatment rates, prompting a proposed increase in forest management projects and restoration treatments. The Forest Service (FS) aims to expand forest management projects and restoration treatments to address forest health concerns. Administrative process barriers, including decision-making processes related to the National Environmental Policy Act, hinder the implementation of projects at the necessary pace and scale. FS-specific issues with NEPA planning also contribute to these challenges. The Forest Service faces administrative barriers, including issues with NEPA planning, hindering project implementation. Stakeholders point to funding and training deficiencies as additional obstacles. Provisions by the 115th Congress aim to improve agency efficiencies in project planning and review processes. Congress aims to improve agency efficiencies by expanding procedures to expedite planning and review processes for projects like hazardous fuel reduction and forest restoration. Advocates believe that utilizing Healthy Forests Restoration Act authorities and NEPA Categorical Exclusions would speed up project implementation and help agencies reach their restoration goals. However, some argue that changes to decision-making processes, such as establishing CEs, are altering the legal framework for federal forest management. Some stakeholders argue that changes in decision-making processes, like establishing Categorical Exclusions (CEs), are altering the legal framework for federal forest management. This could make it harder for citizens to participate or challenge government decisions, potentially leading to environmental impacts that worsen forest health concerns. These issues have been ongoing for decades, with concerns raised about deteriorating forest health conditions and high fuel levels after wildfires in Yellowstone National Park in 1988. In 1994, the National Commission on Wildfire Disasters recommended increased investment in reducing hazardous fuels in high-risk ecosystems. A 1995 study suggested increasing hazardous fuel treatments to 3 million acres per year by 2005. In 1999, the GAO recommended developing a strategy to reduce fuels and mitigate wildfire risk. In 2006, the OIG raised concerns about forest health issues and wildfire risk. In 1999, GAO recommended FS develop a strategy to reduce fuels and mitigate wildfire risk. In 2006 OIG raised concerns with FS' hazardous fuels reduction program and recommended guidance and controls for projects. A 2016 OIG report found issues with FS prioritizing, tracking, and reporting on hazardous fuels reduction projects. Concerns about FS project implementation have been ongoing, with a significant percentage of fuel reduction decisions being appealed in various fiscal years. Academic studies have also examined FS NEPA implementation, indicating challenges with more complex projects. Several academic studies have examined FS NEPA implementation, suggesting that complex projects are more likely to be challenged. HFRA, passed in 2003, aimed to expedite hazardous fuels reduction projects, but the need for treatment in NFS areas continues to grow. FS is seeking ways to accelerate project implementation. The HFRA aimed to expedite hazardous fuels reduction projects, but the need for treatment in NFS areas continues to grow. FS is seeking ways to accelerate project implementation, with some suggesting the need for broader application of the HFRA approach. The FY2018 omnibus and 2018 farm bill included forest-related provisions, compared to prior laws, focusing on forest management. Non-forest related provisions were excluded for clarity."
