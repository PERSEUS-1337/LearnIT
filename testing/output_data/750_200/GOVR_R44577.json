    "content": "The House and Senate passed their respective National Defense Authorization Acts for Fiscal Year 2017, containing provisions affecting military personnel. A conference committee was convened to reconcile differences between the two versions. After the House and Senate passed their respective National Defense Authorization Acts for Fiscal Year 2017, a conference committee was convened to resolve differences. The President signed the final bill into law on December 23, 2016. This report highlights selected personnel-related issues of congressional and constituent interest, with contact information for CRS analysts provided. The report provides detailed background information and analysis of issues related to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016. Contact information for CRS analysts is included for each issue discussed. Some issues were previously addressed in the FY2016 NDAA and other reports. Authorized active duty end-strengths for FY2001 are also mentioned. Authorized active duty end-strengths for FY2001 were set for Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force. Congress increased Army and Marine Corps personnel in response to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but later reversed due to troop withdrawals and budget constraints. Air Force and Navy end-strengths have been declining since 2001. In 2011, U.S. forces drawdown in Afghanistan began in 2012 due to budget constraints. End-strengths for Air Force and Navy have been declining since 2001. FY2017 budget proposed lowering end-strengths for all services, with the House approving higher end-strengths than the Administration's request, notably for the Army. The House-proposed increase in end-strength for the Army, Marine Corps, and Air Force was notable, with a reduction for the Navy. The final bill set minimum end-strengths equal to authorized levels for FY2017. The overall authorized end-strength of the Selected Reserves has declined by about 6% over the past 15 years, with reductions in Navy Reserve strength being a significant factor. Authorized end-strengths for the Selected Reserve in FY2016 and FY2017 are shown in Figure 2. For FY2017, the Administration requested a reduction in authorized Selected Reserves end-strength for four reserve components and increases for two. The House bill proposed increasing the Army National Guard's end-strength to 350,000 and the Army Reserve's end-strength to 205,000. The House bill proposed increasing the Army National Guard's end-strength to 350,000 and the Army Reserve's end-strength to 205,000. This is in response to concerns about the overall cost of military personnel and the need to recruit and retain high-quality personnel for the all-volunteer military. The military pay raise is a topic of interest due to the need to recruit and retain high-quality personnel for the all-volunteer military. Section 1009 of Title 37 US Code provides for an annual increase in basic pay indexed to the Employment Cost Index. The increase for 2017 is set at 2.1% unless Congress or the President specifies otherwise. The President can specify an alternative pay adjustment under 37 U.S.C. \u00a71009(e) instead of the annual increase in basic pay indexed to the Employment Cost Index. In the past three years, the President set the pay raise below the ECI by invoking this authority. The FY2017 President's Budget requested a 1.6% military pay raise, lower than the statutory formula of 2.1%. The House bill aimed to enforce the statutory formula, resulting in a 2.1% pay raise for all servicemembers. The enacted bill specified a 2.1% pay raise for all servicemembers, effective January 1, 2017, waiving the automatic adjustment to basic pay. The pay raise process for servicemembers includes government-provided housing or a housing allowance called Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH), based on paygrade, geographic location, and other factors. The housing allowance for those in the United States is known as Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH), determined by paygrade, geographic location, and dependency status to provide suitable accommodation. BAH rates vary by location but ensure servicemembers of similar rank and family status can afford comparable housing regardless of duty location. The Senate bill proposed changes to how Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) is calculated, focusing on geographic location and paygrade rather than dependents. It would base BAH on actual housing expenditures up to a maximum amount for a given location/paygrade, altering how it is paid to servicemembers who share living arrangements. The Senate bill proposed changes to how Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) is calculated, focusing on geographic location and paygrade rather than dependents. It would base BAH on actual housing expenditures up to a maximum amount for a given location/paygrade, altering how it is paid to servicemembers who share living arrangements by reducing the allowance based on the number of people sharing the quarters. The new formula would apply to certain members of the Armed Forces starting on January 1, 2018. Members of the Armed Forces affected by the new provision starting January 1, 2018 include those who first receive basic pay on or after that date, certain reserve and retired personnel called to active duty, and servicemembers who lose eligibility for BAH after December 31, 2017. The Secretary of Defense would need to submit proposed regulations for this provision to Congress. The Senate provision requires the Secretary of Defense to submit proposed regulations for a new pay structure to Congress by March 31, 2017. The enacted bill mandates a report on transitioning to a single-salary pay system by March 1, 2017, eliminating Basic Allowance for Housing and Basic Allowance for Subsistence. The conference report aims to recruit and retain a high-quality All-Volunteer Force by eliminating Basic Allowance for Housing and Basic Allowance for Subsistence. The provision acknowledges the evolution of BAH over the past 20 years and its original purpose to provide a housing benefit for servicemembers in high-cost areas without government-provided quarters. The government is planning to transition to a salary system that aligns the payment of housing allowance with its use as compensation for military members and their families. The military is transitioning to a salary system to align housing allowance payment with compensation, as outlined in the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2016. The military retirement system underwent changes in the National Defense Authorization Act for FY2016, including reducing the retired pay multiplier, adding a 401k-type element, allowing for a partial lump-sum payment, and introducing continuation pay as a retention incentive. These changes will take effect on January 1, 2018, for new servicemembers and those with 12 years or less of service. The military retirement system changes, including a reduced pay multiplier and introduction of continuation pay as a retention incentive, have raised concerns about retaining certain occupational specialties. Active duty military and veterans closely monitor these changes. The military retirement system changes include authorization for continuation pay at 8 to 12 years of service in exchange for a 3-year commitment, providing flexibility for targeted retention incentives based on specific military specialties. The enacted bill includes changes to pay based on retention trends for specific military specialties, amending procedures for calculating continuation pay minimums for active and reserve component members. It ensures that reserve component members on active duty receive the same minimum pay as active duty members when accepting continuation pay. Additionally, there is a provision regarding default contributions to the TSP being to a Roth plan. The Senate bill proposed default contributions to the TSP should be to a Roth plan, which is beneficial for young, low-income individuals. However, this provision was not adopted. Another provision in the bill allows cadets, midshipmen, and reservists a 30-day election period. Section 631 of the Senate bill amends 10 U.S.C. \u00a71409 to allow cadets, midshipmen, and reservists a 30-day election period for the new retirement system following commissioning or transfer to active duty. The Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Protection Act (USFSPA) allows state courts to divide military retired pay in divorce cases and provides certain former spouses with military benefits. The law was enacted in 1982 and has been modified over the years. Contact CRS for more information. The USFSPA allows state courts to divide military retired pay in divorce cases. Up to 50% of a servicemember's disposable military retired pay may be divisible by the court. Proposed changes would use pay grade and years of service at the time of a divorce court order. The USFSPA allows state courts to divide military retired pay in divorce cases, with proposed changes to use pay grade and years of service at the time of a divorce court order. The enacted bill authorizes this change and includes cost-of-living adjustments in spousal payments, without affecting prior divorce settlements. A military retiree may have a portion of their monthly retired pay withheld to provide a survivor benefit to a surviving spouse or eligible recipients after their death, known as the Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP). The survivor's payment through SBP is usually 55% of the retired basic pay the member would have been eligible to receive. The Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) provides a survivor's payment of 55% of the retired basic pay to eligible recipients. Previously, servicemembers who died on active duty received 75% of their basic pay, while reservists who died during inactive-duty training received less based on their years of service. This discrepancy was addressed in the FY2017 NDAA. Surviving spouses may receive annuities from both DOD and VA. The FY2017 NDAA addressed the reduction of SBP payments for surviving spouses who receive DIC from VA. The SSIA offsets this reduction and was set to expire at the end of FY2017. Sections 642, 643, 646, and 648 of the enacted bill amend provisions in Title 10, United States Code related to SBP treatment. The enacted bill amends Title 10, United States Code to eliminate differential treatment under the SBP for reserve and active component members who die from an injury during inactive-duty training. It also allows DOD to withhold SBP payments from Combat Related Special Compensation when retired pay is insufficient to cover the premiums. Section 646 of the enacted bill extends authority to pay SSIA until May 31, 2018 and requires a report on affected individuals. Nearly 65,000 surviving spouses are estimated to receive SSIA in FY2018. Section 648 mandates an independent assessment of SBP by a federally funded research center and submission of a report with recommendations. The Secretary is required to conduct an independent assessment of the Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) through a federally funded research center and submit a report with recommendations to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees. The report will evaluate the effectiveness of the SBP for survivors of servicemembers, compare benefits with other government and private sector employees, and explore the feasibility of providing survivor benefits through alternative insurance products. TRICARE is a DOD-administered health benefits program covering active duty servicemembers, retirees, and their families. The Administration's FY2017 Budget proposed changes to health care enrollment fees. Feasibility of survivor benefits through alternative insurance products is being explored. The Administration's FY2017 Budget proposed changes to TRICARE health care enrollment fees, including replacing current options with TRICARE Select and TRICARE Preferred, introducing new enrollment fees, deductibles, co-payments, and catastrophic caps. Additionally, there were proposals for increased pharmacy co-pays for retirees and military family members. The Administration's FY2017 Budget proposed changes to TRICARE health care enrollment fees, including introducing TRICARE Select and TRICARE Preferred, new enrollment fees, deductibles, co-payments, and catastrophic caps. The proposal also included increased pharmacy co-pays for retirees and military family members, with grandfathering for Medicare-enrolled retirees already receiving TRICARE benefits. Additionally, the proposal aimed to reduce TRICARE for Life expenditures by funding it through the Medicare Eligible Retiree Health Care Fund. The MERHCF covers future medical treatment costs for Medicare eligible uniformed services retirees and dependents through TRICARE for Life. The FY2017 contribution per servicemember is $4,252 for active duty and $1,723 for reserve component members. CBO estimates show proposed TRICARE changes could save DOD billions and increase Medicare spending. The new TRICARE proposals would save $2.8 billion, with the TRICARE for Life enrollment fee saving $1.4 billion and the consolidation of TRICARE plans costing DOD $0.2 billion. The proposals would also increase Medicare spending by $0.4 billion. Section 701 of the enacted bill establishes a new TRICARE Select health plan option and modifies the existing TRICARE Prime plan for retirees joining TRICARE on or after January 1, 2018. The TRICARE proposals include enrollment fees, deductibles, catastrophic caps, and co-payments for retirees joining TRICARE on or after January 1, 2018. It establishes an enrollment period and open enrollment period for TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Select. Pre-authorization requirements for referrals under TRICARE Prime are limited to specific inpatient care. The Secretary of Defense must submit a report by June 1, 2017. The TRICARE proposals include enrollment fees, deductibles, catastrophic caps, and co-payments for retirees joining TRICARE on or after January 1, 2018. It establishes an enrollment period and open enrollment period for TRICARE Prime and TRICARE Select. The Secretary of Defense is required to submit an implementation plan by June 1, 2017, to meet specified access criteria to the armed services committee. In its FY2017 budget request, the Administration proposed changes to TRICARE health plans, including consolidating options, increasing pharmaceutical co-pays, and adding an enrollment fee for future TRICARE-for-Life enrollees. The House and Senate bills differed on how to consolidate TRICARE Standard and Extra plans. The enacted bill consolidates TRICARE Standard and Extra into a new TRICARE Preferred plan, while the Senate-passed bill consolidates them into a new TRICARE Choice plan. Section 701 of the bill specifies cost-sharing amounts for active-duty family members and retirees under TRICARE Select and TRICARE Prime options, with fixed dollar amounts annually indexed to retirement pay increases. Exceptions to cost-sharing amounts are provided for disability retirees, dependents, and survivors, with specific provisions for TRICARE for Life beneficiaries. Retirement pay increases and cost-sharing amounts for TRICARE beneficiaries will be adjusted. A new category for \"reserve and young adult\" beneficiaries will be created. Premiums for TRICARE Reserve Select and TRICARE Young Adult Program will remain the same, but new cost-sharing provisions will apply. Retired beneficiaries eligible for TRICARE before 2018 will face a $150 individual or $300 family annual enrollment fee after a report is submitted to the armed services committees. TRICARE beneficiaries eligible before 2018 will have a $150 individual or $300 family annual enrollment fee after a report is submitted to the armed services committees by February 1, 2020. The report will assess changes in health care coverage, appointment availability, network provider acceptance, and TRICARE Select beneficiary satisfaction. The report will assess changes in health care coverage, appointment availability, network provider acceptance, and TRICARE Select beneficiary satisfaction. The percent of network providers accepting new TRICARE patients and satisfaction of TRICARE Select beneficiaries will be evaluated. TRICARE Prime beneficiaries may need a waiver or pay 50% of the allowed charge if care is obtained without a required referral. TRICARE beneficiaries can access a pharmacy program through military pharmacies, TRICARE mail-order, or retail network pharmacies. Active duty servicemembers have no pharmacy co-payments at military pharmacies. Military pharmacies provide a 90-day supply of formulary medications for free. Military pharmacies offer a 90-day supply of formulary medications for free, but non-formulary drugs are not available. The 2016 NDAA allowed a one-time $3 increase in pharmacy co-pays and required maintenance drug prescriptions to be filled through mail order or military pharmacies. The Administration's FY2017 budget proposed increasing co-payments for maintenance drug prescriptions filled through mail order or military pharmacies to save $300 million in FY2017 and $2 billion over fiscal years 2017-2021. The House-passed bill did not include a provision for a pharmacy co-payment increase. The House-passed bill did not include a provision for a pharmacy co-payment increase, unlike previous legislation that had overridden statutory increases and substituted specific amounts. The House-passed bill did not include a provision for a pharmacy co-payment increase. Section 702 would authorize the Secretary of Defense to exclude drugs of little value and give preferential status to non-generic drugs on the TRICARE formulary. The Secretary of Defense could exclude drugs of little value and give preferential status to non-generic drugs on the TRICARE formulary, reducing DOD's pharmacy costs by $640 million over 2017-2021. This would also save $2.7 billion in health care spending for TRICARE for Life beneficiaries over 2017-2026. Implementing Section 702 would reduce pharmacy spending for TRICARE for Life beneficiaries by $2.7 billion over 2017-2026, with a decrease in accrual payments into the MERHCF by about $1.5 billion from 2018-2021. The Defense Health Agency (DHA) was established on October 1, 2013, as a joint combat support agency to ensure readiness of Armed Forces medical services. It manages shared services, the TRICARE program, and serves as the market manager for the National Capital Region enhanced Multi-Service Market. Contact: Don Jansen, x[phone number scrubbed]. The Defense Health Agency (DHA) currently manages shared services, the TRICARE program, and oversees military treatment facilities (MTFs). A single agency responsible for all MTFs would improve operational medical force readiness, beneficiaries' access to care, health outcomes, and lower costs. The conferees believe that restructuring the military health system to a streamlined management structure would improve decision-making, innovation, efficiency, and cost savings. A streamlined military health system management structure would eliminate redundancy, generate efficiency, and save money for the Department. Sections 702 and 703 of the conference bill combine provisions for true reform and improved care for beneficiaries. The Director of the Defense Health Agency will take responsibility for MTF administration, including budget and healthcare administration, starting October 1, 2018. The Defense Health Agency will be responsible for managing Military Treatment Facilities, including budget, IT, healthcare administration, and policy. Surgeons General of each service will advise the Secretary on MTF administration. Section 702 of the Defense Health Agency outlines the roles and responsibilities of the services' Surgeons General, who serve as advisors to the Secretary on health and medical matters. They are also responsible for recruiting, organizing, training, and equipping medical personnel. The Secretary is required to develop an implementation plan and submit reports to the armed services committees by specific dates. Additionally, the Government Accountability Office must submit a report as well. The provision in Section 703 of the enacted bill adds a new Section 1073d to Title 10 of the United States Code, requiring the Secretary of Defense to maintain medical facilities to support the medical readiness of the armed forces and medical personnel. Reports must be submitted to the committees by specific dates, with reviews by the Government Accountability Office. The provision in Section 703 of the enacted bill adds a new Section 1073d to Title 10 of the United States Code, requiring the Secretary of Defense to maintain medical facilities, including centers and hospitals, to support the medical readiness of the armed forces and medical personnel in areas where civilian health care facilities are unable to meet their needs. An exception is provided if a change in facilities or services hinders access to care through non-DOD providers. Current law requires active component enlistees to be a US national, lawful permanent resident, or from the Compact of Free Association. Reserve component enlistees must be citizens, lawful permanent residents, or have previous military service. These citizenship requirements can be waived under certain circumstances. The Senate bill aimed to align reserve component enlistment requirements with those of the active component, but this provision was not included in the conference bill. Military leave entitlement, accumulation, and use are governed by Chapter 40 of Title 10 United States Code. On January 28, 2016, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter announced new policies for maternity and parental leave under Chapter 40 of Title 10 United States Code. Maternity leave was extended from 6 to 12 weeks, and DOD sought legislative action to extend parental leave to 14 days. Contact: [author name scrubbed], x[phone number scrubbed]. The new policy announced by Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter extended maternity leave to 12 weeks and sought to increase parental leave to 14 days. Parental leave for servicemembers with a spouse giving birth was first authorized in 2009 and is currently 10 days, while adoption leave has been available since 2006 for up to 21 days. In dual-service married couples, only one servicemember can take adoption leave. Parental leave for servicemembers has been extended to 12 weeks for the primary caregiver in connection with the birth of a child, and 6 weeks for adoption. Secondary caregivers can receive up to 21 days of leave. The Secretary of Defense will define \"primary\" and \"secondary\" caregivers. The Secretary of Defense will define \"primary\" and \"secondary\" caregivers for parental leave benefits. Eligible individuals can receive up to 21 days of leave for the birth or adoption of a child, to be taken within a year of the event. This leave is in addition to any other earned leave and is available to active component members, reserve component members on active duty, or those subject to a recall or mobilization order exceeding 12 months. The final bill allows parental leave for servicemembers under active duty recall or mobilization orders exceeding 12 months. The Secretary of Defense can prescribe regulations for servicemembers to extend their service obligation or reduce existing leave when taking parental leave. Section 521 also prohibits additional leave for military servicemembers beyond what is authorized by statute. The conference report clarifies that military leave is established by law and cannot be created without congressional authority. Paid parental leave is supported for military servicemembers to enhance recruitment, retention, and support the well-being of military families. Armed Forces benefits are made more competitive with private sector benefits, and additional leave helps military families. Opponents of extending military maternity and parental leave fear it could harm military readiness. Congress has shown concern for improving the Defense Commissary system in recent years, authorizing $1.4 billion in funding for FY2016. In FY2016, Congress authorized $1.4 billion in commissary funding\u2014$100 million more than the President's budget request. The President's FY2017 budget proposed $1.2 billion for commissaries, a reduction of $200 million in subsidies for stateside commissaries from FY2016. Authorized patrons include active duty military members, Guard and Reserve component members, retired personnel and their families, 100% disabled veterans, Medal of Honor recipients, and DOD civilians stationed at U.S. installations overseas. The FY2016 NDAA required the Secretary of Defense to submit a report to the armed services committees with a plan to obtain budget neutrality for DeCA and the military exchange. The FY2016 NDAA required the Secretary of Defense to submit a report to achieve budget neutrality for DeCA and the military exchange system. The report released by DOD on June 7, 2016 stated that privatization would not replicate the benefits and savings provided by DeCA while maintaining budget neutrality. Critics argue that privatization poses too many uncertainties. Some critics argue that DOD's report on achieving budget neutrality for DeCA and the military exchange system lacks a clear plan. The assessment by the Comptroller General highlighted the absence of a strategy to achieve budget neutrality by October 2018. The DOD's report, published on November 9, 2016, lacks a clear plan to achieve budget neutrality for the commissary and exchange systems by October 2018. The report addressed three of the seven mandated benchmarks but did not define specific metrics for each benchmark and only partially discussed the other four mandated elements. The FY2016 NDAA required a report on the Commissary Surcharge, Non-appropriated Fund, and Privately-Financed Major Construction Program of the Department of Defense, which is pending. Sections 661 and 662 of the enacted bill allow DeCA to set prices for merchandise sold in commissaries. The enacted bill allows DeCA to set prices for merchandise in commissaries based on market conditions and customer demand, and authorize the use of the Military Star Card as a form of payment. These reforms aim to preserve benefits, ensure savings for patrons, provide value for taxpayers, and support morale, welfare, and recreational activities. The reforms for commissaries include regular congressional oversight, common business practices, and private sector initiatives like variable pricing and private label products to support morale, welfare, and recreational activities. DeCA is required to set prices to cover costs and is expected to offer private label goods with markup to offset expenses. The enacted bill requires DOD to develop a strategy for DeCA and military exchanges to reduce reliance on appropriated funds. DeCA can implement a variable pricing program for private label goods to offset operating costs, with estimated savings of less than $500,000 over the next decade. The bill allows DOD to convert the commissary agency to a non-appropriated fund entity if savings are maintained for six months. The Defense Secretary must ensure no DeCA employee incurs a loss in pay. DOD can also contract with grocery industry experts for assistance. The provision allows DOD to convert the commissary agency to a non-appropriated fund entity without causing a decrease in pay for employees. DOD can also contract with grocery industry experts for assistance in transforming the commissary system. The Military Star Card can be accepted as a form of payment at commissary stores. Selected Highlights of the FY2016 Defense Budget Debate and the National Defense Authorization Acts (H.R. 1735 and S. 1356), including discussions on military personnel issues and efforts to achieve budget neutrality for the Commissary and Exchange System. Additionally, audits and reports on fresh produce contracts for the U.S. Pacific Command Theater are available for review. In the past few decades, Congress has enacted legislation and appropriated funds for servicemember off-duty education, credentialing programs, and transition services to support servicemembers and veterans in translating military skills into post-service education and employment opportunities. Key programs include the Transition Assistance Program (TAP), Credentialing Opportunities Online (COOL), and DOD efforts for budget neutrality. Three key programs for servicemembers transitioning to post-service education and employment are the Transition Assistance Program (TAP), Credentialing Opportunities Online (COOL), and the DOD Skillbridge program. Section 561 of the final bill eliminates the requirement for third-party accreditation for credentialing programs, instead focusing on quality assurance benchmarks. Section 561 of the Senate version, which aimed to limit tuition assistance funds to education and training contributing to professional development, was not adopted. Sections 567 and 568 require DOD reports on transition initiatives for servicemembers to obtain maritime licenses, assess college credit for military skills, and evaluate the JTEST-AI program. Section 3590 sets deadlines for TWIC applications for separating military servicemembers. Section 564 of the final version requires DOD to provide information and application for transportation worker identity credentials (TWIC) to separating servicemembers as part of TAP. Sections 562 and 563 mandate DOD to provide notification about recoupment of separation payments and counseling on substance abuse during mandatory TAP training. Section 566 of the House bill, authorizing DOD to carry out a pilot program for job placement services for reserve component members, was not adopted. The House bill proposing a pilot program for job placement services for reserve component members was not adopted. General officers (Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps) or flag officers (Navy) hold the most important military positions. General and flag officers (GFOs) in the military hold key positions in the Department of Defense, including the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and combatant commanders. GFOs have ranks ranging from 1-star to 4-star, with limits on the total number in each grade set by statute. The total number of general and flag officers (GFOs) in each grade is limited by statute, with Congress periodically reviewing and revising their number, duties, and compensation. Section 910 of a House bill aimed to restrict the rank of service and functional component commanders under a combatant commander to no higher than lieutenant general or vice admiral, and required a reduction of 5 active duty generals and admirals. Section 910 of a House bill aims to restrict the rank of service and functional component commanders under a combatant commander to no higher than lieutenant general or vice admiral. It also requires a reduction of 5 active duty generals and admirals. Additionally, the Senate bill proposes reducing the number of authorized active and reserve GFOs by 25%, with a focus on higher-ranking GFOs. The Senate bill proposes reducing the number of authorized active and reserve General and Flag Officers (GFOs) by 25% effective December 31, 2017. The reductions would be weighted more heavily towards higher-ranking GFOs, with the maximum number of active component GFOs at the 3-star and 4-star level dropping from 206 to 111. Certain statutory grade requirements in various fields would also be eliminated, allowing the Department of Defense to set grades at different levels. The enacted bill requires the Secretary of Defense to reduce the total number of General and Flag Officers (GFOs) on active duty by 110 positions by December 31, 2022, amounting to an 11% reduction in authorized positions. However, since only 889 of the 962 authorized positions are currently filled, the reduction in GFO personnel will be smaller than the reduction in positions. The reduction in authorized General and Flag Officer positions will be smaller than the reduction in personnel. The Army will decrease from 231 to 220 positions, Navy from 162 to 151, Air Force from 198 to 187, Marine Corps from 61 to 62, and joint pool from 310 to 232. Additionally, 30 GFO positions will be temporarily allocated to the joint pool for contingency operations. The Secretary of Defense can adjust these reductions for national security, with notification to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees. The Secretary of Defense can adjust reductions in General and Flag Officer positions for national security, with notification to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees within 30 days. A comprehensive global manpower study is required to justify GFO positions and identify a 10% reduction, with results due by April 1, 2017. The Secretary of Defense can adjust reductions in General and Flag Officer positions for national security, with notification to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees within 30 days. A global manpower study is required to justify GFO positions and identify a 10% reduction, with results due by April 1, 2017. The study results are to be submitted to the House and Senate Armed Services Committees by April 1, 2017. Chapter 38 of Title 10 U.S.C. addresses the management of active duty officers trained in joint matters. There is debate over whether current qualification requirements produce officers with the right mix of service and joint experiences. Joint matters involve achieving unified action across military forces in various domains. The curr_chunk discusses the requirements for becoming a joint qualified officer, including completing specific joint professional military education. This is related to achieving unified action across military forces in various domains such as land, sea, air, space, and the information environment. To become a joint qualified officer, individuals must complete specific joint professional military education requirements and a full tour of duty in a joint assignment. Joint duty assignments are typically two years for general and flag officers and three years for other officers, with the option for the Secretary of Defense to waive this requirement. Both the House and Senate bills aimed to standardize the length of joint duty assignments at two years for all officers. The bills aimed to modify criteria for joint duty assignments, standardizing the length at two years for all officers. The definition of joint matters would have been expanded to include various duties such as intelligence, fires, movement, protection, and sustainment under unified command. The Secretary of Defense would have had the authority to designate other joint matters. The bills aimed to modify criteria for joint duty assignments, standardizing the length at two years for all officers. The definition of joint matters would have been expanded to include various duties such as intelligence, fires, movement, protection, and sustainment under unified command. The Secretary of Defense would have had the authority to designate other joint matters. The enacted bill adopted the Senate language amending 10 U.S.C. \u00a7664 with regard to joint duty assignments, and the House language amending the definition of \"joint duty assignment.\" The enacted bill modified criteria for joint duty assignments, standardizing the length at two years for all officers and expanding the definition of \"joint matters\" to include various duties.

The Military Selective Service Act (MSSA) mandates registration for most males aged 18-26 in the US with Selective Service, while women are not required to register. Failure to register can lead to criminal penalties and loss of certain benefits. Recent DOD policy changes have raised questions about the Selective Service registration exemption for women. Some argue that women should now be required to register, while others question the need for the registration requirement and other provisions of the MSSA. Some argue for women to register for Selective Service, while others question the need for the registration requirement. Section 591 of the Senate bill proposed expanding registration to women turning 18 after January 1, 2018, but this provision was not included in the final bill. Section 552 of the final bill mandates a review of the Selective Service System by the DOD. The final bill requires the DOD to review the Selective Service System and analyze potential manpower needs in emergencies. It also establishes the National Commission on Military, National, and Public Service to examine related questions over 36 months. The final bill establishes the National Commission on Military, National, and Public Service to examine related questions over 36 months and authorize $15 million in funding in FY2017. Background: In 2005, DOD issued its first department-wide sexual assault policies and procedures in response to congressional and media attention on the issues of sexual assault and harassment in the military. This was based on recommendations from the Joint Task Force for Sexual Assault Prevention and Response and requirements specified in the Ronald W.
