    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The state board is required to adopt basic instructional materials for kindergarten and grades 1 to 8, with at least five materials for each subject area. The state board must adopt five basic instructional materials for language arts, including spelling, reading, and English language development, for applicable grade levels. The state board may not adopt basic instructional materials in certain subject areas in the year following the adoption of materials for the same grade level. Procedures for submission of instructional materials must be established for compliance. The state board may adopt instructional materials in various subject areas once or twice every eight years. Curriculum frameworks are reviewed and adopted for each subject area, with consistent evaluation criteria for instructional materials. Resubmitted materials that were previously rejected must have substantive changes or face restrictions. If revisions to instructional material are submitted after the specified timeframe, a fee will be assessed on the publisher or manufacturer. The fee should not exceed the reasonable costs for the department to review the material. Instructional materials must be adopted or rejected within six months of submission, with a possible extension of up to three months if needed due to volume, complexity, or other circumstances beyond control. The review process for instructional materials involves committees with volunteer experts and teachers from various grade levels and subjects. Rules for adoption must be transparent and consistent for all formats of materials. The state board reviews and adopts basic instructional materials based on specific criteria to ensure consistency with the curriculum framework and compliance with state guidelines for social content. Instructional materials must comply with state board guidelines for social content, be factually accurate, reflect current research, and align with content standards for the subject area and grade level. Instructional materials must align with state board content standards for the subject area and grade level, and should not include unnecessary exposure to commercial brands or logos unless approved by the state board. In instructional materials, the use of commercial brand names, products, or logos is allowed if necessary for educational purposes or incidental to illustrations. To meet criteria established by the state board for the adoption of instructional materials, as required by California Constitution and Statutes of 1989, approval must be obtained at least 12 months before adoption. The state board may reject basic instructional materials and provide a written explanation based on established criteria. They may adopt fewer than five materials if less are submitted. If fewer than five basic instructional materials meet the criteria or fail to meet the state board's curriculum framework, the state board will conduct a review. The state board has the authority to adopt materials that are not basic instructional materials. The state board shall prescribe procedures for an open and flexible materials submission system to ensure that adopted materials meet the educational needs of diverse pupil populations, represent cultural pluralism, and provide a broad spectrum of knowledge and technology-based materials. The state board adopts instructional materials and provides a listing with unit costs for publishers and schools. The materials remain on the list until a new curriculum framework is adopted. The state board adopts instructional materials based on new curriculum frameworks. Lists of adopted materials are available by subject and grade level on the department's website. Information includes publisher details and logos for identification purposes. The state board may adopt regulations for exceptions, as determined by the board. The Superintendent will develop guidelines for implementation. A followup adoption is any adoption other than the primary one within an eight-year cycle. (a) A followup adoption is any adoption other than the primary one within an eight-year cycle. Before conducting a followup adoption, the department must post a notice on their website and notify publishers in that subject area. (c) The notice specifies that publishers or manufacturers participating in the followup adoption will be assessed a fee based on the number of programs and grade levels proposed. The fee offsets the cost of the process, with efforts made to keep it modest and avoid duplicating work from the primary adoption. The department requires publishers or manufacturers to declare intent to submit specific programs for followup adoption and specify grade levels. A fee is assessed, payable even if programs are withdrawn or grade levels reduced. The department requires publishers or manufacturers to declare intent to submit specific programs for followup adoption and specify grade levels. A fee is assessed, payable even if programs are withdrawn or grade levels reduced. The submission by a publisher or manufacturer will not be reviewed for adoption until the fee is paid in full. The Legislature intends for the fee for follow-up adoption participation to not be prohibitive for small publishers or manufacturers. The state board may reduce the fee upon request for small publishers or manufacturers meeting specific criteria. The revenue from fees for follow-up adoption will be budgeted for reimbursements and can cover adoption and instructional materials review costs. If there is little interest from publishers, the follow-up adoption may not be conducted. General fund revenue cannot be used for follow-up adoption costs. The section specifies that general fund revenue cannot be used for follow-up adoption costs. It will be in effect until January 1, 2024, unless a later statute extends or deletes that date."
