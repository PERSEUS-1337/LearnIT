    "content": "We investigate the suitability of self-attention models for character-level neural machine translation, testing a novel transformer variant that outperforms the standard model. Experiments on WMT and UN datasets show improved performance and faster convergence, with robust character-level alignments. Most existing NMT models operate on word or subword-level. Character-level models in Neural Machine Translation are more memory efficient and converge faster than word or subword-level models. They work directly on raw characters, leading to a more compact language representation and mitigating out-of-vocabulary problems. Multilingual training with character-level models can improve overall performance without increasing model complexity. Self-attention models have shown success in various tasks, including machine translation and representation learning. Multilingual training with character-level models can enhance performance without adding complexity. This study explores the suitability of self-attention models for character-level translation. In this study, the suitability of self-attention models for character-level translation is investigated. Two models are considered: the standard transformer and a novel variant called convtransformer, which uses convolution for interactions among nearby character representations. Evaluation is done on bilingual and multilingual translation to English using French, Spanish, and Chinese as input languages. Translation performance is compared on both close and distant input languages. The study compares translation performance of self-attention models on character-level translation using French, Spanish, and Chinese as input languages. The convtransformer model outperforms the standard transformer, requiring fewer parameters and producing more robust alignments. Fully character-level translation was previously addressed in a recurrent encoder-decoder model. The convtransformer model outperforms the standard transformer in character-level translation by converging faster and producing more robust alignments. Lee et al. (2017) proposed a recurrent encoder-decoder model for fully character-level translation, showing promising results on multilingual translation. Training on multiple source languages improved performance without architectural modifications. Lee et al. (2017) demonstrated successful multilingual translation using character-level models, showing performance improvements without architectural changes. Training on multiple source languages acted as a regularizer, even for distant languages like Russian or Chinese. Cherry et al. (2018) further compared different character and subword-level models. The transformer model, introduced by Vaswani et al. (2017), has achieved state-of-the-art performance in NLP tasks. It uses attention mechanisms instead of recurrence, with six stacked layers. Cherry et al. (2018) found that character-level models can outperform subword-level models due to their flexibility in processing sequences. The transformer model in NLP tasks uses self-attention instead of recurrence, with stacked encoder and decoder layers. Recent work has shown that attention can effectively model characters, prompting exploration of character-level bilingual and multilingual translation with the transformer architecture. The paper investigates the effectiveness of the convtransformer architecture for character-level interactions in the transformer model, using 1D convolutional layers in the encoder blocks. The convtransformer architecture incorporates three parallel 1D convolutional layers with different context window sizes to capture character interactions at various levels. Unlike previous methods that use max pooling to compress input character sequences, this approach maintains the input resolution in both transformer and convtransformer models. The convtransformer model incorporates max pooling for compressing input character sequences and includes a residual connection for flexibility. Experiments are conducted on two datasets: WMT15 DE\u2192EN and United Nations Parallel Corporus (UN). The study uses the United Nations Parallel Corporus (UN) dataset for experiments, sampling one million sentence pairs from FR, ES, and ZH languages for translation to English. BLEU scores on the UN dataset are evaluated for different input training languages. Table 2 shows BLEU scores on the UN dataset for various input training languages (FR, ES, ZH) evaluated on different test sets. The study combines bilingual datasets and ensures all languages share the same character vocabulary. The experiments are designed for a bilingual scenario. In experiments by Nikolov et al. (2018), different character-level architectures were compared using the WMT dataset. The study included bilingual and multilingual scenarios, testing language combinations with varying similarities in syntax and vocabulary. The BLEU performance of the models was evaluated on the UN test sets. In Table 1, BLEU performance comparison of character-level architectures trained on the WMT dataset is shown. Character-level training is slower than subword-level training, but the standard transformer trained at the character-level achieves strong performance, outperforming previous models. The convtransformer variant performs similarly to the standard transformer on longer sequence lengths, outperforming previous models. Multilingual experiments show that the convtransformer consistently outperforms the transformer on the UN dataset. The convtransformer outperforms the transformer on multilingual translation tasks, with up to 2.6 BLEU improvement. Training on similar input languages leads to improved performance for both languages. Distant-language training can still be effective, but models trained on distant languages perform worse than bilingual models. The convtransformer outperforms the transformer on multilingual translation tasks, with up to 2.6 BLEU improvement. Distant-language training seems helpful only when the input language is closer to the target translation language. The convtransformer is 30% slower to train but reaches comparable performance in less than half the number of epochs, leading to an overall training speedup compared to the transformer. Character alignments in multilingual models are analyzed through attention probabilities. The character alignments in multilingual models are analyzed through attention probabilities to understand their performance compared to bilingual models. The bilingual models are seen to have greater flexibility in learning high-quality alignments due to not being distracted by other input languages, while multilingual models may struggle with lower quality alignments due to architecture limitations or dissimilar languages. Multilingual models may struggle with lower quality alignments due to architecture limitations or dissimilar languages. Alignment matrices are quantified using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) by sampling random sentences from UN testing datasets and projecting them to a common vector space to infer correlation. The study analyzes alignment matrices from transformer and convtransformer models using CCA to project them to a common vector space and infer correlation. Results show strong positive correlation for bilingual models with similar languages, but a drop in correlation when introducing a distant source language during training. This aligns with BLEU results suggesting challenges in multilingual training with distant languages. The study found a drop in correlation for distant languages like FR, ES, and ZH compared to similar languages. The convtransformer showed more robustness than the transformer. Self-attention models performed well for character-level translation, especially with the convtransformer architecture. The study demonstrates that self-attention is effective for character-level translation, competing well with subword-level models with fewer parameters. Training on multiple input languages improves performance for similar languages but shows a drop in performance for distant languages. Future work will include analyzing additional languages from different language families. In future work, the analysis will extend to include more source and target languages from different language families, focusing on improving the training efficiency of character-level models. Example model outputs and alignments are provided for bilingual and multilingual models trained on UN datasets, testing on translation from FR to EN. The study focuses on models trained on UN datasets for translation from FR to EN. The convtransformer shows sharper weight distribution on matching characters and words compared to the transformer for bilingual translation. For multilingual translation of close languages, both models preserve word alignments, with convtransformer producing slightly less noisy alignments. For multilingual translation of distant languages, the character alignments are examined. For multilingual translation of distant languages, the convtransformer shows less noisy character alignments and better preserved word alignments compared to the transformer. The convtransformer shows better preserved word alignments for multilingual translation with three inputs, where two languages are close.
