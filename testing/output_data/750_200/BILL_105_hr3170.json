    "content": "Section 1 introduces a new section 1260 in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 regarding gains from constructive ownership transactions. The new section 1260 in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 addresses gains from constructive ownership transactions, treating such gains as short-term capital gain if they exceed the net underlying long-term capital gain. The capital gain rate applicable is determined based on the respective rates that would have been. The gain under section 1(h) is determined based on the rate applicable to the net underlying long-term capital gain. If gain is treated as short-term capital gain, interest will be imposed under section 6601 on the taxpayer's tax for that year. Interest may be imposed under section 6601 on underpayments of tax for prior taxable years resulting from including gain in gross income ratably during a constructive ownership transaction period. The amount payable is deductible from the taxpayer's interest deduction for the taxable year. The taxpayer's interest deduction for the taxable year may be reduced by interest imposed under section 6601 on underpayments of tax from including gain in gross income during a constructive ownership transaction period. Any increase in tax shall not affect the amount of certain credits or the tax imposed by section 55. The term 'financial position' is defined for this section. The term 'financial position' refers to any interest in stock, debt instrument, partnership interest, or investment trust interest. A 'position' includes futures or forward contracts, short sales, or options. Taxpayers are treated as having entered into a constructive ownership transaction if they or a related person hold a long position under a notional agreement. Taxpayers are considered to have a financial position if they or a related person hold a long position under a notional principal contract, enter into a forward or futures contract, or engage in other transactions related to the same or substantially identical property. The section outlines exceptions for constructive ownership transactions involving substantially identical property or positions with the same effect. It does not apply if all positions are marked to market under relevant regulations. \"A person is considered to hold a long position in a notional principal contract if they have the right to receive the investment yield on the property for a specified period and are obligated to provide credit for it.\" In a constructive ownership transaction, a person holds a long position in a notional principal contract if they have the right to receive the investment yield on the property for a specified period and are obligated to reimburse for any decline in the property's value. The terms \"forward contract\" and \"related person\" have specific meanings as defined by sections 1259(d)(1) and 1259(c)(4) respectively. The term 'net underlying long-term capital gain' in a constructive ownership transaction refers to the total net capital gain that would have occurred if the financial position had been acquired and sold on specific dates, considering only gains and losses from the deemed ownership. The net underlying long-term capital gain in a constructive ownership transaction is considered zero unless proven otherwise. Taxpayers can elect to apply a subsection that exempts them from certain rules and allows them to recognize gain or loss on open constructive ownership transactions. In a constructive ownership transaction, any gain or loss must be taken into account for the taxable year. Adjustments will be made for subsequent realized gains or losses. Any gain or loss from a constructive ownership transaction is treated as ordinary income or loss. Special rules apply for dispositions if gain or loss is recognized before the close of the taxable year. Any gain or loss from a constructive ownership transaction is treated as ordinary income or loss. An election can be made without the Secretary's consent and applies to the year made and subsequent years unless revoked. The Secretary will prescribe necessary regulations for this section. The Secretary shall prescribe regulations necessary to carry out the purposes of this section. The amendments made by this section apply to gain recognized after the enactment of this Act."
