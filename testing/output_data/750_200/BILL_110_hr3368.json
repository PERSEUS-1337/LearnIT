    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Pulmonary Hypertension Research and Education Act of 2007\". The Congress recognizes pulmonary hypertension as a serious and often fatal condition where blood pressure in the lungs rises to dangerous levels. This leads to thickening and constriction of arteries, causing the right side of the heart to pump harder and potentially fail. Federal investment in pulmonary hypertension research must be expanded to find a cure or effective treatment. Pulmonary hypertension is difficult to diagnose and often goes unnoticed in routine medical exams. New diagnostic standards have improved diagnosis rates. Collaboration among research centers must increase to find a cure or effective treatment. In advanced stages of pulmonary hypertension, patients have limited activity and symptoms even at rest, leading to significant disability. The disease can progress to complete bedriddenness. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute established the first pulmonary hypertension patient registry in 1981, following 194 patients over at least one year. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute established the first pulmonary hypertension patient registry in 1981, following 194 people with the illness over at least one year. Research studies are investigating immunologic and genetic factors in the cause and progression of pulmonary hypertension. Research is focused on the cause and progression of pulmonary hypertension, including factors that narrow blood vessels and promote cell growth and scar tissue formation in vessel walls. Treatments for pulmonary hypertension are advancing, with six FDA-approved medications available and more in trials, although not all are effective for every patient and all have significant side effects impacting quality of life. The number of physicians treating pulmonary hypertension and patients receiving treatment has significantly increased over the past decade, leading to a need for more education of medical professionals. Lung transplantation is often considered a last resort treatment for pulmonary hypertension due to significant negative side effects of other treatments. In 2006, there were 3,000 physicians treating pulmonary hypertension and 30,000 patients receiving treatment. The management of pulmonary hypertension has become more complex despite the availability of oral therapies. Education of medical professionals on pulmonary hypertension management is crucial for optimal patient care. Communication among researchers is crucial for future advancements in the fight against pulmonary hypertension, as highlighted during a landmark meeting in December 2006 hosted by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Over 500 individuals attended, emphasizing the importance of collaboration in managing this devastating disease. The Public Health Service Act is amended to include a new section on pulmonary hypertension research and training. The Director of the Institute will expand research on pulmonary hypertension and establish a Pulmonary Hypertension Clinical Research Network to conduct clinical trials for new treatment approaches. The Pulmonary Hypertension Clinical Research Network will conduct clinical trials for new treatment approaches and involve 15 clinical centers, an institute project scientist, a data and coordinating center, and a data and safety monitoring board. The Pulmonary Hypertension Clinical Research Network includes a steering committee, an independent protocol review committee, a data and coordinating center, and a data and safety monitoring board appointed by the Director. The Pulmonary Hypertension Clinical Research Network includes a steering committee responsible for determining specific clinical trials, establishing standards for subject selection, developing protocols, and analyzing trial results. One possible trial focus is combination therapies for pulmonary hypertension. Possible clinical trials for pulmonary hypertension include combination therapies, new drug therapy based on cellular defects not impacted by current treatment, use of endothelial progenitor cells for replacing abnormal pulmonary vascular cells, and discovery of treatment effects predictive of long-term outcomes. The Institute is responsible for managing and supporting the network, including monitoring trial recruitment and progress, and ensuring disclosure of conflicts of interest. The Institute manages and supports the network, overseeing trial recruitment, progress, conflict disclosure, and fiscal management with a grants management specialist. The institute grants management specialist assists the project scientist in fiscal management of the network. The Director appoints the Chair of the steering committee, members of the protocol review committee, and the data safety monitoring board. The Pulmonary Hypertension Preceptorship and Training Program is also mentioned. The Director appoints members to oversee the fiscal management of the network, including the Chair of the steering committee, protocol review committee, and data safety monitoring board. A grant program is established for a national Pulmonary Hypertension Preceptorship and Training Program to facilitate direct training. The program aims to train medical professionals in diagnosing and managing pulmonary hypertension, with regional training sites to support this goal. The program aims to establish regional training sites across the United States at academic health centers, hospitals, or private medical practices for training in pulmonary hypertension. Each site will have a designated contact person. The program establishes regional training sites for pulmonary hypertension training, each with a designated contact person. The Director specifies a percentage of grant funds for site contacts. Participant recruitment mechanisms are established by the nonprofit entity awarded the grant. The nonprofit entity will collaborate with regional training sites and the Institute to create program guidelines. Authorization of appropriations is provided for fiscal years 2009 through 2012. Increasing public awareness of pulmonary hypertension. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will develop and share information on pulmonary hypertension, including basic information, incidence, related diseases, importance of early diagnosis, and available treatments. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will disseminate information on pulmonary hypertension through a national non-profit entity with expertise in the field. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 2009 through 2012 for this purpose. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will disseminate information on pulmonary hypertension through a national non-profit entity with expertise in the field. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will develop and disseminate information on pulmonary hypertension to healthcare providers, including warning signs, early diagnosis, diagnostic criteria, and FDA-approved therapies. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will disseminate information on pulmonary hypertension to healthcare providers through a national non-profit entity with expertise in the disease. Authorization of appropriations is provided for fiscal years 2009 through 2012. The Government Accountability Office will conduct a study on Medicare and Medicaid coverage standards. The Comptroller General will conduct a study on Medicare and Medicaid coverage standards for individuals with pulmonary hypertension, including all FDA-approved therapies. The study will consider appropriate delivery settings for these services and a report will be submitted to Congress within six months of the Act's enactment. The Comptroller General will conduct a study on Medicare and Medicaid coverage standards for individuals with pulmonary hypertension, including all FDA-approved therapies, and appropriate delivery settings for these services. A report will be submitted to Congress within six months of the Act's enactment."
