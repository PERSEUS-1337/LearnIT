    "content": "Restoration of deduction for interest on educational loans. The amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 includes defining personal interest to now include interest on qualified educational loans. This change restores the deduction for interest on educational loans. The term 'qualified educational loan' refers to indebtedness provided through various programs, including Federal, State, or State-based guarantee programs, organizations exempt from tax under section 501(c)(3), or financial institutions. A qualified educational loan is incurred to pay educational expenses within a reasonable period before or after the loan is taken out. A qualified educational loan is incurred to pay educational expenses within a reasonable period before or after the indebtedness is incurred. The amount of interest taken into account for the taxable year is reduced based on the taxpayer's adjusted gross income. The taxpayer's adjusted gross income determines the phaseout range for the applicable dollar amount. For unmarried individuals, the applicable dollar amount is $40,000 with a phaseout range of $15,000. For joint returns, the applicable dollar amount varies. The phaseout range for the applicable dollar amount is $15,000 for unmarried individuals and $30,000 for joint returns with an applicable dollar amount of $60,000. For any other case, the applicable dollar amount is zero. The deduction is only allowable for the first 48 months of loan repayment status. The deduction for interest on student loans applies to the first 48 months of loan repayment for qualified educational expenses.
