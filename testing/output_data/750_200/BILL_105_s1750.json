Additional Certification regarding drug-producing and drug-transit countries is being amended to include cooperation with the United States or independent steps taken by the country to achieve compliance with goals. The curr_chunk states that a country must cooperate with the United States or take independent steps to comply with the goals of the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. However, if the country has not made sufficient progress towards meeting certain plans, programs, or timetables identified in the most recent report, it may not receive certification. The curr_chunk involves amendments to a section related to timetables and plans under the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. The curr_chunk involves amendments to subsections (B) and (C) of a section related to timetables and plans under the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances. The curr_chunk involves additional requirements relating to qualified certification under a specific section, including a high-level contact group in the event of a certification with respect to a country. In the event of a certification with respect to a country, a high-level contact group should be convened consisting of officials from the United States and their counterparts from the country, including the Attorney General, Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of State, and Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration. The high-level contact group for a country includes officials like the Attorney General, Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of State, Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Commissioner of Customs. Responsibilities include setting achievable benchmarks for plans and programs with inadequate progress. The high-level contact group sets achievable benchmarks to verify progress of a country's plan, program, or timetable. Each benchmark establishes specific, measurable goals for objective verification. The high-level contact group establishes specific, measurable goals and deadlines for each plan, program, or timetable, including objectives related to arrests, extradition, eradication of drug-related crops, and money-laundering. The high-level contact group sets specific goals and deadlines for each plan, including objectives on arrests, extradition, crop eradication, and money-laundering. A deadline of 60 days is set for completing activities after certification, and an annual benchmark report must be submitted by the President by September 1. The Attorney General must submit an annual report to Congress outlining the benchmarks set for each country, detailing the progress made in meeting those benchmarks. The President shall report to Congress on the progress made by each country in meeting established benchmarks, with a focus on countries with benchmarks set in a given year. In reporting progress on established benchmarks for countries, the President will prioritize the country's progress in making certifications for the following year. Congress suggests convening a high-level contact group for Mexico in 1998, with provisions applying as described in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, section 490, includes provisions for a contact group's activities and certification of Mexico in 1999."
