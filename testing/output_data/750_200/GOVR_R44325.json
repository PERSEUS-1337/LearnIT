    "content": "The level of pay for congressional staff is determined by the chair and ranking Member of Senate committees, who set job titles, pay rates, and resources for staff. Congressional pay data is of interest for assessing costs, setting pay levels, and comparing with other federal government systems. The pay levels for congressional staff are determined by Senate committees, with data collected from official Senate reports published semiannually. This information is not readily available from public sources. The pay levels for Senate committee staff are collected semiannually by LegiStorm, a private entity. This report provides annual data by fiscal year for 13 staff positions since FY2001. Position titles and years for data availability are listed in Table 1. In FY2001, pay data for 13 Senate committee staff positions were collected by LegiStorm. 302 job titles were initially identified, with 25 titles remaining after exclusions. Annual pay data for each position needed to be available from at least five committees to be included. Annual pay data for 13 Senate committee staff positions were collected by LegiStorm, with data needed from at least five committees for inclusion. Data was collected for staff holding the same job title in the same committee for the entire fiscal year, with payments tabulated from LegiStorm data. The LegiStorm data tabulates every payment made to staff for the fiscal year, including overtime, bonuses, and base salary. Pay data for House committee offices can be found in CRS Report R44322, while data for Senators' and Members' personal offices are available in CRS Report R44324 and CRS Report R44323. Data on staff pay levels for Senators' and Members of the House are available in CRS reports. The data may not fully represent all positions held by Senate committee staff due to the large number of titles held by one employee. The assignment of staff titles could impact the representativeness of the data provided. The Senate committee staff positions can be categorized into two groups based on the number of staff members hired. Pay data collected for positions with one staff member per committee are likely to be highly representative, while positions with two or more staff members may have less representative pay information. The pay data collected for Senate committee staff positions with two or more staff members may not be fully representative, as it is based on a sample rather than complete data. Factors such as education, work experience, and job duties are not taken into account in the pay data aggregation by job title. The aggregation of pay by job title in the Senate may not accurately reflect differences in job duties among staff with the same title. Congressional employing authorities have wide discretion in setting employment terms, leading to potential variations in duties and pay levels. An older edition of the Senate Handbook acknowledges the variability in job duties among individuals with the same title. Table 2 and Table 3 in the Senate report provide detailed data on Senate pay practices, including maximum payable rates for committee staff since 2001 and cumulative percentage changes in median pay for different positions. The report highlights the variability in job duties among individuals with the same job title in the Senate. Table 3 shows cumulative percentage changes in median pay for 13 positions, Members of Congress, and General Schedule salaries in Washington, DC. Tables 4-16 provide pay data for Senate committee staff positions, with graphic displays showing pay changes in nominal and constant 2016 dollars over 5, 10, and 15-year intervals from FY2015. Between FY2011 and FY2015, median pay changed in constant 2016 dollars, ranging from a 16.93% increase for professional staff members to a -16.48% decrease for staff assistants. The data also includes comparisons of pay changes for Members of Congress and federal civilian workers in Washington, DC, and surrounding areas at different intervals. Pay distributions for FY2015 are shown in $10,000 increments. Between FY2011 and FY2015, median pay changed for various staff positions, with increases for some and decreases for others. Comparisons were made to pay changes for Members of Congress and federal civilian workers in Washington, DC. Between FY2001 and FY2015, median pay for different staff positions showed varying changes, with some positions experiencing pay increases while others saw declines. Comparisons were made to pay changes for Members of Congress and General Schedule, DC, over the same period. Between FY2001 and FY2015, staff positions saw varying pay changes, with five positions increasing and two decreasing. Comparisons were made to pay changes for Members of Congress and General Schedule, DC, over the same period."
