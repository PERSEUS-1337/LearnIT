    "title": "AB 1303",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 65961 of the Government Code in California is amended. Upon approval of a tentative map for a residential subdivision, a city or county cannot impose additional conditions for building permits within five years of the final map recordation, except as specified. A city or county cannot impose additional conditions for building permits within five years of final map recordation for residential subdivisions. The city, county, or city and county cannot withhold building permits for failure to comply with previously approved conditions, except under certain circumstances. The local agency can impose conditions on building permits if necessary for health and safety reasons or to comply with state or federal law. They can also withhold permits if required by law. The local agency can impose conditions on building permits for health and safety reasons or to comply with state or federal law, including withholding permits if required. This section also applies to cities incorporating areas within their boundaries after January 1, 1985. When incorporating areas from a tentative or parcel map, conditions can be imposed as if there was no incorporation. For extended subdivision maps, the five-year period is reduced to three years. Section 66452.25 allows cities, counties, or city and counties to levy fees or conditions for tentative subdivision maps or parcel maps that are extended. Section 66452.25 of the Government Code allows for a 24-month extension of tentative maps, vesting tentative maps, or parcel maps approved within certain counties between January 1, 2002, and July 11, 2013. If a map was approved within a specified county, the expiration time can be extended by 24 months upon application filed at least 90 days before expiration, if consistent with zoning and general plan requirements. The tentative map can be extended for 24 months if it meets zoning and general plan requirements. If not, the extension can be denied or conditionally approved. An extension can also be automatically granted for 60 days before approval, conditional approval, or denial of the extension application. If the advisory agency denies a subdivider's extension application, the subdivider can appeal to the legislative body within 15 days. In a county, this section applies if the annual mean household income is less than 80% of the statewide annual mean income. The community revitalization plan requires the annual nonseasonal unemployment rate to be at least 2.75 percent higher than the statewide rate and the poverty rate to be at least 4 percent higher than the statewide median. The extension of expiration dates for development projects is provided in addition to any existing extensions. Legislative, administrative, or other approvals by state agencies related to a development project will be extended by 24 months if not expired before the effective date of the act. The provisions of Section 65961 regarding conditions for building permits for residential subdivisions are modified for tentative maps extended under this section. No reimbursement is required for this act as local agencies have the authority to levy charges to cover mandated services. This act is an urgency statute allowing cities and counties to preserve development applications set to expire due to economic conditions in the construction industry."
