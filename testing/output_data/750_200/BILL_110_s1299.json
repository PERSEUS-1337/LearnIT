The Borrower's Protection Act of 2007, also known as the Truth in Lending Act, defines key terms related to home mortgage loans, mortgage brokers, and mortgage originators. The Borrower's Protection Act of 2007, also known as the Truth in Lending Act, defines key terms related to home mortgage loans, mortgage brokers, and mortgage originators. A mortgage originator is defined as any creditor or person, including a mortgage broker, who engages in activities related to home mortgage loans for compensation. The Borrower's Protection Act of 2007, also known as the Truth in Lending Act, defines key terms related to home mortgage loans, mortgage brokers, and mortgage originators. A mortgage originator is any creditor or person involved in activities related to home mortgage loans for compensation. This includes negotiating home mortgage loans on behalf of borrowers or lenders, and the sale of existing home mortgage loans to institutional or non-institutional lenders. The term 'qualifying bond' refers to a bond equal to at least 1 percent of the aggregate value of all homes appraised by a real property appraiser in connection with a home mortgage loan in the previous calendar year. The qualifying bond, appraised by a real property appraiser in connection with a home mortgage loan in the previous calendar year, benefits homeowners with claims against the appraiser and creditors who acted in good faith. Assignees or subsequent transferees can also be beneficiaries of the bond. The term 'rate spread mortgage transaction' refers to a home mortgage loan with an annual percentage rate of interest that meets reporting requirements under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. Assignees or subsequent transferees can benefit from the bond if the originating creditor qualified for such treatment. The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act defines a rate spread loan as a mortgage loan with a specific annual percentage rate of interest. Mortgage brokers are required to have a fiduciary relationship with consumers and adhere to fiduciary requirements under State or Federal law. Mortgage originators must also act in good faith in addition to following existing laws. Mortgage originators must act with skill, care, and diligence, as well as in good faith and fair dealing in all transactions. Before facilitating any home mortgage loan, they must verify the borrower's ability to repay. Before facilitating any home mortgage loan, mortgage originators must verify the borrower's ability to pay the loan, including principal, interest, real estate taxes, and insurance fees. For variable mortgage rates, the borrower's ability to pay is based on the maximum monthly payment for the first 7 years of the loan term. The borrower's ability to pay a home mortgage loan is determined by the maximum monthly payment for the first 7 years of the loan term, based on the maximum interest rate allowable and assuming no default. Verification is required based on income documentation. The mortgage originator determines the borrower's ability to pay based on income and financial resources documentation, debt-to-income ratio, and residual income. The borrower's statement of income and financial resources alone is not sufficient verification for assessing the ability to pay under section 36.4337 of title 38 of the Code of Federal Regulations. In rate spread mortgage transactions, an escrow account is required for the obligor. In rate spread mortgage transactions, the obligor must make monthly payments into an escrow account for taxes, insurance, and flood insurance. Following the loan closing, the obligor will be required to make escrow payments on the property securing the loan in connection with another loan secured by the same property. Lender and broker liability is established when a mortgage broker sells a rate spread mortgage loan to a lender. Steering is prohibited in connection with a home mortgage loan. In connection with a home mortgage loan, a mortgage originator may not steer a consumer to unfavorable rates or terms. A mortgage originator must secure credit and loan terms for which the consumer qualifies. If unable to offer a favorable home loan, they must facilitate one from another creditor. The mortgage originator must disclose to the consumer if they cannot offer a beneficial home loan, and may facilitate a loan from another creditor if allowed by law. The mortgage originator is prohibited from mischaracterizing credit history, appraised property value, or failing to suggest suitable home loans for the consumer. The mortgage originator must not mischaracterize credit history or appraised property value, and should suggest suitable home loans for the consumer. The mortgage originator is allowed to provide consumers with general information on home mortgage loans, underwriting standards, and credit history improvement. Additionally, mortgage originators are prohibited from entering into home mortgage loans if they suspect the appraiser did not act in good faith during the appraisal process. The appraisal of the property securing the loan must be conducted in good faith and in accordance with all applicable standards. Any direct or indirect interest of the appraiser in the property or transaction must be disclosed. The appraiser must disclose any direct or indirect interest in the property or transaction. Prohibited influence by a mortgage originator is not allowed in any way regarding a home mortgage loan. No mortgage originator is allowed to influence an appraiser or select an appraiser based on expected values for a home mortgage loan. The mortgage originator must provide a copy of the appraisal report to the applicant for a home mortgage loan, regardless of the loan outcome. Defenses cannot be made based on using another person in the appraisal process. The Truth in Lending Act is amended to include provisions for mortgage originators under section 129A."
