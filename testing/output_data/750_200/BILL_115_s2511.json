    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Commercial Engagement Through Ocean Technology Act of 2018\" or the \"CENOTE Act of 2018\". The table of contents for this Act is provided. The \"Commercial Engagement Through Ocean Technology Act of 2018\" or the \"CENOTE Act of 2018\" includes definitions and provisions for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to assess, acquire, and report on unmanned maritime systems for their missions. SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines key terms such as \"Administration\" as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, \"Administrator\" as the Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere, and \"cooperative activities of the Administration\" as collaborative efforts with external entities. The term \"data specifications\" refers to the type, resolution, periodicity, and quality of data required by a program of the Administration. The term \"test or training range\" means an area designated for operating unmanned maritime systems and other types of systems. The term \"test or training range\" refers to an area designated for operating unmanned maritime systems and other systems for evaluating performance or training personnel. It may include specialized instrumentation for these operations. Unmanned maritime systems are remotely operated or autonomous vehicles designed to function without human presence. Examples include unmanned undersea vehicles. Unmanned maritime systems encompass various types of vehicles such as unmanned undersea vehicles, unmanned surface vehicles, autonomous underwater vehicles, autonomous surface vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles, and autonomous aerial vehicles used for maritime purposes. The Administrator shall coordinate the Administration's research, assessment, and acquisition of unmanned maritime systems to achieve the purposes of this Act. The Administrator will coordinate the Administration's research, assessment, and acquisition of unmanned maritime systems through the Unmanned Systems Executive Oversight Board (USEOB) to ensure requirements are met throughout the Administration. The Administrator will coordinate unmanned maritime systems through the Unmanned Systems Executive Oversight Board (USEOB), ensuring representation from specific offices within the Administration actively engaged with unmanned maritime systems. Coordination with the Navy is also required. The Administrator will coordinate with the Navy to leverage expertise in unmanned maritime systems development and align with strategic priorities. The Administrator will coordinate with the Navy to utilize Naval unmanned systems test ranges and formalize coordination through a memorandum of understanding. The Administration will partner with the Navy to procure unmanned maritime systems and access test or training ranges and related facilities as defined by the Secretary of the Navy. The Administrator will collaborate with the Navy to access test or training ranges and facilities for various purposes, including mapping, bathymetry, observations, and ocean exploration. The activities will be carried out at a co-located facility to gain efficiencies through collaboration and advance the development of unmanned maritime systems. The Administrator and the Secretary of the Navy collaborate to advance unmanned maritime systems development, including research, testing, modifications, and integration. They aim to accelerate the transition from concept to manufacturing and acquisition, utilizing the National Oceanographic Partnership Program for coordination with other federal agencies. The National Oceanographic Partnership Program, established for interagency coordination in advancing unmanned maritime systems, may coordinate with academic institutions for research, development, and training in unmanned maritime systems. The curr_chunk discusses training, commercialization, and access to facilities for unmanned maritime systems. It aims to support the development and certification of operational capacity under various environmental conditions. The curr_chunk focuses on promoting engagement with academic institutions and the private sector to enhance unmanned maritime systems. It emphasizes training operators, facilitating collaboration with relevant expertise, and promoting information sharing for mission-oriented systems. The curr_chunk focuses on coordinating with the private sector to commercialize unmanned maritime systems and assess commercially available options to support Navy missions. The Administration will regularly assess unmanned maritime systems for potential use in supporting National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration missions. The assessments will be science-based and conducted by key personnel within the Administration. The Administrator will assess unmanned maritime systems for potential use in supporting Administration missions through science-based assessments conducted by key personnel. This includes evaluating the suitability, feasibility, and cost-effectiveness of these systems to meet data specifications and determine their operational utility for required observations. The Assistant Administrator and the Director will convene the Unmanned Maritime Systems Ocean Technology Coordinating Committee and consult with various stakeholders to assess the reliability, feasibility, and cost-effectiveness of unmanned maritime systems for required observations. They will also engage in the acquisition of these systems. SEC. 5. ACQUISITION OF UNMANNED MARITIME SYSTEMS. The Administrator will coordinate the acquisition of unmanned maritime systems to meet data requirements identified by OAR and OMAO, approved by USEOB. A memorandum of agreement may be developed with the Secretary of the Navy for procurement participation. The memorandum of agreement allows participation in Navy procurements, acceptance of decommissioned unmanned maritime systems, sharing policies, and creating efficiency in acquisition. No modification to Federal procurement law. Reports on unmanned maritime systems and NOAA mission usage required. The Administrator must submit reports on the usage of unmanned maritime systems for the mission of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration every four years to Congress. Each report will include an inventory of current unmanned maritime systems used by NOAA programs. The curr_chunk provides an inventory of unmanned maritime systems used by Administration programs, data benefits, prioritized data requirements, and commercially available systems. The term \"appropriate committees of Congress\" is defined as specific Senate committees. SEC. 7. FUNDING AND ADDITIONAL AUTHORITIES. The Administrator will use existing funds for this Act and may enter into contracts and agreements. The Administrator has additional authorities to enter into contracts, agreements, and transactions with governments, accept donations and services, receive funds from other Federal departments, and utilize the National Oceanographic Partnership Program for funding and partnerships. The Administrator can accept funds, donations, and enter contracts with other Federal departments and agencies. They can also transfer funds to organizations under agreements and utilize resources from various entities, including government departments, agencies, and international organizations. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
