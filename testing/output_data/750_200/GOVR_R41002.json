    "content": "Increasing pressures on water supplies are leading to changes in operations at Corps facilities to meet municipal and industrial demands. Corps reallocations at Lake Lanier are at the center of a conflict involving Alabama, Florida, and Georgia. The agency is considering reallocating storage to M&I use at dams in various states, with more requests expected. Reallocation involves tradeoffs, as it shifts storage from current purposes like hydropower or navigation. The federal role in M&I water supply development is limited, with states and local entities playing a significant role. Congress acknowledged state primacy in developing M&I supplies in the Water Supply Act of 1958. The federal government primarily supports flood control, navigation, irrigation, and multipurpose dams, while states and local entities have a significant role in developing water supplies for domestic, municipal, and industrial purposes. Investments in flood control, navigation, irrigation, dams, and diversion facilities have been primarily supported by federal agencies like the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Reclamation and the Department of Defense's Army Corps of Engineers. Construction of large federal dams has slowed since the 1960s due to high costs, ecological and social impacts, and site availability. Since the 1960s, construction of large federal dams has decreased due to high costs, ecological and social impacts, and site availability. Reservoir planning now focuses on balancing objectives for existing reservoirs and managing for new goals. Congress authorizes the Corps to build dams and water infrastructure, operating them to meet authorized purposes and comply with federal laws. The Corps constructs dams and water infrastructure to meet authorized purposes and comply with federal laws. Approximately 91 Corps reservoirs have M&I storage as an authorized purpose. Congress has included additional requirements for all Corps facilities and given the Corps authority to provide additional benefits from its projects. The Corps has authority to provide benefits from its projects, including recreation, and limited authority to provide M&I water supply. The 1944 authority allows surplus water to be used temporarily for M&I purposes, but is not likely to play a significant role in permanent reallocation of water. The report focuses on the implementation of the 1958 Water Supply Act by the Corps, providing data on reservoirs with storage reallocated under this authority. The 1944 authority is not likely to play a significant role in permanent water reallocation for M&I purposes. For legal issues related to the 1958 WSA, refer to CRS Report R40714 by Cynthia Brougher. In the 1958 Water Supply Act, Congress granted the Corps authority for M&I water supply but limited decision-making without congressional approval. Modifications to reservoir projects for water supply require Congress approval. The 1958 Water Supply Act granted the Corps authority for M&I water supply but limited decision-making without congressional approval. Modifications requiring major changes must be approved by Congress. The Corps developed a manual for implementing this authority. The Corps developed a guidance manual (EM 1165-2-105) in response to the 1958 Water Supply Act, which granted authority for reallocating storage for water supply purposes. Reallocation of storage for domestic, municipal, or industrial water supply purposes is considered insignificant if it does not exceed 15% of total storage capacity or 50,000 acre feet in a modified project. The modified project's water supply usage is limited to 15% of total storage capacity or 50,000 acre feet, following the 1958 Water Supply Act. Recent legal actions regarding Corps operations at Lake Lanier have raised questions about storage reallocations. The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida addressed a key question in 2009 regarding the Corps' changes in Lake Lanier operations for water supply, agreeing with Florida, Alabama, and others that congressional approval was necessary. The U.S. District Court found that the Corps had reallocated over 21% of Lake Lanier's storage without congressional approval since the mid-1970s, leading to operational changes for water supply. This included shifting storage from hydropower to municipal and industrial (M&I) supply, with contracts made for withdrawals directly from the lake. The court determined that these actions exceeded the Corps' discretionary authority for reallocation. The court found that the Corps had reallocated storage space at Lake Lanier for M&I water supply, exceeding its discretionary authority. This has raised concerns about water reallocation at other Corps facilities with 135 reservoirs having M&I water storage. Some reservoirs rely on the 1958 WSA for M&I storage authority. The 1958 WSA is the basis for less than 640,000 AF of the Corps' M&I storage. The Corps has reallocated over 50,000 AF of storage space for M&I use at Lake Texoma, with multiple reallocations totaling 103,003 AF. Other Texoma reallocations have been made with specific congressional approval. The Corps reallocated 84,099 AF from hydropower to M&I use at Lake Texoma in 1985 without requiring significant structural modifications or congressional approval, as it did not significantly harm the lake's authorized purposes. This exceeded the agency's policy limit of 50,000 AF for reallocations without congressional approval. The Corps reallocated water supply at Cowanesque Lake without congressional approval, exceeding the agency's policy limit. This case involved a mix of project-specific reallocation direction from Congress and the Corps' discretionary authority under the 1958 WSA. The Corps reallocated water supply at Cowanesque Lake without congressional approval, exceeding the agency's policy limit under the 1958 WSA discretionary authority. The evaluation of potential effects on authorized purposes and operational changes is a general concern raised. The 2009 court order questioned the Corps' evaluations of reallocations at Lake Lanier and raised concerns about potential operational changes. The sufficiency of Corps reallocation analyses is not covered in this report. Lake Lanier and Lake Cumberland are not included in Table 1 due to unauthorized M&I uses and withdrawals. Enforcement action has not been taken to stop withdrawals at Lake Cumberland. The Corps' operation of Lake Lanier for M&I water supply has been controversial, with a 2009 court order raising concerns about potential disputes over reallocations at other Corps facilities. Unauthorized M&I withdrawals at Lake Cumberland have not been stopped, highlighting a lack of enforcement action. The extent of unauthorized withdrawals and operational actions supporting M&I uses at other Corps facilities remains largely unknown. The 2009 court order raised concerns about potential disputes over reallocations at other Corps facilities. Most reallocations at Corps facilities have occurred without national attention or litigation like Lake Lanier. Existing reallocations under the 1958 WSA generally met the Corps' criteria. The Corps' discretionary authority for reallocations at federal facilities is a policy issue of increasing relevance. Questions arise about how multiple reallocations in a basin should be handled, the agency's discretion in making agreements with stakeholders, and unauthorized operations. The Corps' discretionary authority for reallocations at federal facilities is a policy issue of increasing relevance. Questions arise about the agency's discretion in making agreements with stakeholders, financial arrangements, ongoing unauthorized withdrawals, and the transition process for reallocations to M&I uses. The federal government faces questions regarding charging for M&I storage space, crediting return flows, and its role in municipal water supply amidst broader water policy issues. These questions also raise concerns about the adequacy of current water infrastructure operations and institutions. The adequacy of current water infrastructure operations and institutions is questioned, with challenges in reflecting national interest and enacting changes due to differing opinions and multiple affected constituencies."
