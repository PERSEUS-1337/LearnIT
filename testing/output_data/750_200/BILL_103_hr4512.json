    "content": "The \"Welfare to Work Act of 1994\" may be cited as the short title. The Congress acknowledges the importance of the Act. The Congress recognizes the challenges faced by welfare recipients in finding entry-level jobs leading to permanent employment. It is acknowledged that even in a strong economy, there may not be enough entry-level positions for all recipients. The Congress believes that funds currently used for AFDC payments could be more beneficial if exchanged for work opportunities. Government workfare programs are seen as inadequate substitutes for meaningful employment. To maximize the economic value of AFDC payments, exchange them for work opportunities to help recipients gain valuable skills and secure permanent employment. Government workfare programs are not sufficient in breaking the cycle of welfare dependency. A one-year tax credit for businesses hiring AFDC recipients can support their pathway to gainful employment. To support AFDC recipients in gaining employment, businesses should receive a one-year tax credit for wages paid to employees leading to termination of AFDC eligibility. SEC. 3. REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR HIRING AFDC RECIPIENTS. An amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 introduces a refundable credit for businesses hiring AFDC recipients. A credit against the tax imposed for the taxable year is allowed for qualified first-year wages, with 50% of wages up to $6,000 and 25% of wages between $6,000 and $12,000. Qualified first-year wages are defined as wages for services rendered in the first year of employment. Qualified wages are wages attributable to services rendered during a 1-year period starting from the day the individual begins work for the employer. This period is reduced by any prior periods the individual worked for other employers where wages were considered as qualified first-year wages by those employers and exceeded 12 months in total. The term 'qualified wages' refers to wages paid to qualified former AFDC recipients by the employer during the taxable year. The term 'wages' is defined as per section 51(d), excluding paragraph (4) thereof. A qualified former AFDC recipient is defined as any individual meeting certain criteria. The term 'qualified former AFDC recipient' refers to an individual certified by a designated local agency as a family member receiving benefits under a State plan before employment with the employer. Their wages must make the family ineligible for benefits. The term 'qualified former AFDC recipient' refers to an individual certified by a designated local agency as a family member receiving benefits under a State plan before employment with the employer. Their wages must make the family ineligible for benefits. No credit is allowed for wages paid to a qualified former AFDC recipient who replaces an employee terminated without cause. Technical amendments are made to certain sections of the Code, including inserting references to section 35(a) and making changes to section 1324(b) of title 31, United States Code. Special rules and definitions similar to those in section 51 and section 52 apply for this section. The Code is amended to include references to section 35 and changes to section 1324(b) of title 31, United States Code. Amendments are also made to the table of sections for subpart C of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1. The amendments made by this section apply to individuals who start working for the employer after the enactment of this Act."
