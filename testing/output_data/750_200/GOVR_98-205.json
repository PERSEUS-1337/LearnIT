The House and Senate approved an omnibus appropriations bill for FY1999 (H.R. 4328) on October 21, providing $8.3 billion in additional defense-related funding. This includes allocations for Bosnia operations, military readiness, intelligence, missile defense, year 2000 fixes, storm damage repairs, purchasing fissile materials from Russia, antiterrorism activities, and defense counter-drug activities. The bill was signed into law (P.L. 105-277) on October 21. The annual defense appropriations bill (P.L. 105-277) signed into law on October 21 provides funds for military activities of the Department of Defense, including pay, benefits, operation, maintenance, weapons procurement, and research. It also includes funding for the Central Intelligence Agency retirement fund and intelligence community management. The annual defense appropriations bill provides funds for military activities of the Department of Defense, including pay, benefits, operation, maintenance, weapons procurement, and research. It also includes funding for the Central Intelligence Agency retirement fund and intelligence community management, as well as classified amounts for national foreign intelligence activities. The Administration's FY1999 budget included $270.6 billion for the national defense budget function, with $250.8 billion requested in the defense appropriations bill. The defense appropriations bill requests $250.8 billion for the defense budget function. Congress annually acts on a national defense authorization bill, which addresses defense programs in detail. Differences between the authorization and appropriations bills are minimal, with major defense policy debates mainly occurring during authorization bill action. This report tracks congressional action on both bills. Congress completed action on the annual defense authorization and appropriations bills on October 1. House and Senate 302(b) allocations were approved in May and June respectively. House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bob Livingston announced proposed initial 302(b) allocations on May 22, which determine funding for defense and other programs. The final Senate allocations for defense are slightly below the Administration's request, while military construction allocations are above. The final House allocations provide $250.499 billion in budget authority. The final House allocations for defense provide $250.499 billion in budget authority and $244.965 billion in outlays for the national security subcommittee. The House National Security Committee finished marking up its version of the FY1999 defense authorization bill, H.R. 3616, on May 6. The House and Senate completed marking up their versions of the FY1999 defense authorization bill, with the House approving it on May 21 and the Senate on June 25. Conferees reached agreement on the authorization bill on September 17, with the President signing it into law. The House and Senate approved the FY1999 defense authorization bill in May and June. The President signed the bill into law on October 17. The House passed the FY1999 national security appropriations bill in June, and the Senate completed its version around the same time. Senate defense appropriations bill: The Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee marked up its FY1999 defense appropriations bill on June 2, and the full committee ordered the bill, S. 2132, to be reported on June 4. The Senate passed H.R. 4103, as amended, on July 30. The FY1999 defense appropriations conference report was approved by the House on September 28, the Senate on September 29, and signed into law by the President on October 17. The FY1999 congressional budget resolution was approved by the Senate on April 2 (S.Con.Res. 86) and by the House on June 5 (H.Con.Res. 284). A conference agreement on the resolution was not completed. Additionally, supplemental defense appropriations for FY1998 were approved by the House and Senate on April 30 (H.R. 3579) for military operations in Bosnia and Southwest Asia. In FY1998, the House and Senate approved H.R. 3579 for supplemental funding for military operations in Bosnia and Southwest Asia, domestic and defense disaster relief. The bill, signed into law as P.L. 105-174, provides $2.7 billion for the Defense Department, including allocations for Bosnia, Southwest Asia, disaster relief, and other defense programs. In FY1998, supplemental funding of $2.7 billion was approved for military operations in Bosnia, Southwest Asia, and disaster relief. In FY1999, an omnibus appropriations bill (H.R. 4328) provided an additional $8.3 billion for defense-related funding, including allocations for Bosnia operations, military readiness, intelligence, missile defense, and year 2000 fixes. The FY1999 omnibus appropriations bill allocated funds for various defense-related purposes, including Bosnia operations, military readiness, intelligence, missile defense, year 2000 fixes, storm damage repairs, defense health program, purchasing fissile materials from Russia, defense antiterrorism activities, and defense counter-drug activities. These funds were designated as emergency appropriations, with additional rescissions made. The FY1999 omnibus appropriations bill allocated funds for defense-related purposes, including Bosnia operations, military readiness, intelligence, missile defense, year 2000 fixes, storm damage repairs, and defense health program. The bill also included rescissions of $67 million. The conference agreements on the defense authorization and appropriations bills resolved major issues, such as relations with China and satellite technology exports. The authorization bill included amendments to limit satellite and missile technology exports to China. The White House objected to some provisions, including a ban on satellite exports. China was a contentious issue in Senate debate. The conference agreed to drop the satellite export ban but included provisions to transfer technology export review from the Commerce Department. The conference agreement dropped the ban on satellite exports to China but included provisions transferring technology export review from Commerce to State Department. It also required advanced congressional notification for satellite sales to China and prohibited missile equipment exports unless certified not to harm US space launch industry or improve China's missile capabilities. Additionally, it included a measure to prohibit the transfer of port facilities near San Diego to COSCO. The conference agreement includes measures to prohibit the transfer of port facilities near San Diego to COSCO, a Chinese shipping company. It also contains a prohibition on DOD doing business with Chinese Army-owned companies and requires a report on the security situation. The appropriations conference agreement prohibits DOD from doing business with Chinese Army-owned companies and requires a report on the security situation in the Taiwan Strait. Neither the House nor the Senate authorization bills approved new rounds of military base closures. The Senate dropped a provision that would make it difficult for the Defense Department to realign military bases without a congressionally established base closure process. The conference agreement dropped a provision objected by DOD regarding base closure process. Social issues included gender separation in basic training, with the House and Senate bills differing on policies. The Senate rejected a proposal to align with the House language. The Senate rejected a Brownback amendment to incorporate the House language on gender separation in basic training. Instead, they endorsed a substitute by Senator Snowe allowing current integrated training practices to continue with additional steps to separate male and female sleeping quarters. The House-Senate authorization conference ultimately adopted the Senate language with a \"sense of the House\" statement urging separate training units. The House authorization bill included measures on social issues like exemplary behavior for commanders and maintaining the ban on abortions in military medical facilities. It also included a provision to prohibit the Department of Energy from buying tritium for nuclear weapons from commercial reactors. The House authorization bill included a provision to prohibit the Department of Energy from buying tritium for nuclear weapons from commercial reactors. The Senate-passed authorization bill allowed DOE to choose between buying tritium from commercial sources or building new facilities in South Carolina. The Congressional Budget Office estimated costs of $3 billion over forty years for commercial tritium and $10 billion for new facilities. The conference agreement allows DOE to make the choice but delays implementation for a year for Congress to review. The House authorization bill rejected an Administration request to eliminate floors on active duty end-strength levels. The Senate and both House and Senate versions of the appropriations bill agreed to the Administration's proposed reductions in end-strength. The authorization conference report also agrees to the Administration request. The House-passed authorization provided a 3.6% pay raise for military personnel. The House-passed authorization bill included a 3.6% pay raise for military personnel, which was initially requested at 3.1%. The Senate later approved an amendment to increase the pay raise to 3.6%, offset by a reduction in R&D funds. The authorization and appropriations conference agreements ultimately provided the 3.6% raise. Additionally, the Administration requested $1.9 billion for Bosnia. The House-passed authorization bill included a 3.6% pay raise for military personnel. The Senate approved the raise, and the authorization and appropriations conference agreements provided the 3.6% increase. The Administration requested $1.9 billion for Bosnia in emergency funding. The Senate included the funding in the defense appropriations bill, while the House did not initially. The Senate stipulated the funding as emergency appropriations, but the House did not address emergency funding. The House-passed authorization bill did not address emergency funding for Bosnia, but included a provision to cap spending at $1.9 billion. Both houses rejected measures to withdraw U.S. troops by a specific date, but the Senate encouraged establishing conditions for a drawdown of forces in Bosnia. The Administration objected to capping spending and the Senate included the funding as emergency appropriations in the defense appropriations bill. The bill included a provision for $1.9 billion in emergency funding for Bosnia, with the possibility of larger expenditures if certified necessary for national security. The FY1999 omnibus appropriations bill later provided emergency funding for Bosnia. Weapons issues were less contentious compared to previous years. The FY1999 omnibus appropriations bill included emergency funding for Bosnia and addressed weapons priorities. Contentious weapons issues were minimal, with the Administration objecting to additional C-130J aircraft funding. The conference agreements provided funds for 7 aircraft, exceeding the Administration's request. Funding for the THAAD system was reduced after a test failure in May. The funding for the Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system has been reduced by $294 million in the authorization conference agreement and $376 million in the appropriations conference agreement following a test failure in May. Additionally, funding for the Medium Extended-Range Air Defense System (MEADS) has been cut from $44 million to $24 million in the authorization conference agreement. The Administration's cooperative program with allies faces funding cuts, reducing MEADS funding from $44 million to $24 million. The Defense Department must find room for MEADS in future budget plans. Funding for the Airborne Laser program is reduced, while Space-Based Laser R&D receives increased funding. The Administration objects to the cuts but the Senate's authorization conference agreement follows through. The authorization and appropriations conference agreements provide funding for ABL and new aircraft carrier development. The Navy will use some of the money for progressive changes in current design. $110 million is provided in the authorization agreement and $105 million in the appropriations agreement out of the $190 million requested. The Senate also includes advance procurement funds for a new LHD-8 amphibious ship. The Senate authorization and appropriations bills allocated $105 million out of the $190 million requested. Funds were provided for a new LHD-8 amphibious ship, despite objections from some lawmakers. The House and Senate disagreed on the procurement of new F/A-18E/F aircraft, with the authorization and appropriations conferences ultimately funding 30 F-18s and one F-16. The Administration raised concerns about certain testing requirements for the F-22 aircraft. The authorization conference funded 30 F-18s and one F-16, despite objections from the Administration. Some cuts in Department of Energy weapons programs were made, resolving long-term weapons issues. The battle over B-2 bomber procurement seems to be over. The authorization conference funded 30 F-18s and one F-16, despite objections from the Administration. Some cuts in Department of Energy weapons programs were made, resolving long-term issues. The battle over B-2 bomber procurement appears to be over. Military health care for retirees was addressed in both House and Senate bills. The authorization conference approved pilot projects to test alternative approaches in the military health care system, including allowing military retirees to join the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan (FEHBP) and accessing TRICARE pharmacy benefits. This was part of a broader agenda that included budget constraints, results of the Quadrennial Defense Review, battles over social issues, and other matters. Key matters of discussion in this year's defense debate included military base closures, Bosnia funding, technology exports controls, efficiency measures, military readiness, long-term funding for defense modernization, personnel levels, National Guard and Reserve funding, major weapons programs, and social issues. The FY1999 defense budget was constrained by budget agreements, with key issues including Army National Guard combat units, major weapons programs, social issues like sexual harassment, and military health care policy. The FY1999 defense budget was constrained by the 1997 budget agreement, with Congress initially facing a \"zero-sum game\" in the defense debate. Despite this, Congress provided an additional $8.3 billion for defense programs as part of the omnibus. Congress added $8.3 billion for defense programs in the FY1999 budget, avoiding potential conflicts with the Administration by meeting halfway on ongoing congressional interests. Senior Administration officials tried to avoid conflicts by meeting Congress halfway on ongoing programs of interest. They fully funded national missile defense development, requested more money for National Guard and Reserve equipment, funded all defense health program costs, and moved funding for the next Nimitz-class aircraft carrier forward to FY2001. Contentious debates over defense budget priorities did not materialize in House and Senate actions on FY1999 defense bills. The House and Senate did not have a contentious debate over defense budget priorities in the FY1999 bills. Some money was allocated for unrequested weapons programs, with a significant amount going towards ballistic missile defense. The Quadrennial Defense Review and other reports influenced this year's congressional defense debate. The congressional defense debate for FY1999 was influenced by the outcome of the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) and two subsequent reports - the Defense Reform Initiative report and the National Defense Panel report. The QDR, released in May 1997, was a comprehensive reassessment of U.S. defense policy. The Defense Reform Initiative report, issued in November 1997, identified efficiency measures, while the National Defense Panel report, released in December 1997, focused on potential defense requirements for 2010-2020. These reports highlighted important ongoing themes for discussion in Congress. The QDR proposed a revised U.S. defense strategy, reaffirmed the need to prevail in two major theater wars, and addressed the challenges of smaller contingency operations. It also identified key elements of the \"revolution in military affairs\" and emphasized the importance of efficiency to save money for weapons modernization. The QDR and Defense Reform Initiative emphasized efficiency to save money for weapons modernization and endorsed military base closures. The National Defense Panel report supported the QDR's focus on shaping the international security environment but called for more emphasis on homeland defense and preparing for future threats. It suggested less focus on preparing for two major theater wars and more on future readiness, advocating for increased annual spending of $5 to $10 billion. The National Defense Panel recommended shifting focus from preparing for two major theater wars to preparing for future threats, advocating for increased annual spending of $5 to $10 billion on experimental force exercises and new technology. It also supported military base closures as a critical means of saving money for defense modernization programs, proposing two more closure rounds in 1999 and 2003, which were not pursued vigorously by the Defense Department. Secretary Cohen made congressional approval of two new base closure rounds in 2001 and 2005 a top priority. The Defense Department released a report reaffirming previous estimates of annual savings from past closure rounds, projecting similar savings for future rounds. The Defense Department projects annual savings of $2.8 billion from future base closure rounds, crucial for funding weapons programs. Resistance in Congress to more closures stems from objections to actions after the 1995 round. The 1995 Base Closure Commission recommended closing two Air Force aircraft depot maintenance facilities in California and Texas. The White House developed a plan to \"privatize in place\" at these sites, allowing private contractors to bid for contracts. The Administration argues that this has led to positive results with competition for contracts. However, many Members of Congress believe the plan politicized the base closure process. The Administration's plan to \"privatize in place\" at Air Force maintenance facilities has led to positive results with competition for contracts. However, many Members of Congress believe the plan politicized the base closure process, leading to disputes and complaints about privatization eroding support for further base closures. Secretary Cohen and other officials have been told that privatization in place has eroded support for further base closures. In response, Cohen suggested Congress could include a prohibition on privatization in future base closure legislation. He also urged Congress to approve more base closures to allow the Defense Department to prepare for them in the long-term defense plan. Congressional action did not agree to additional military base closures. Congressional action did not agree to additional military base closures in FY1999. SASC voted down a proposal for one more base closure round in 2001. Senator Inhofe's amendment made it harder for DOD to realign facilities without a congressionally established base closure process. Senator Inhofe predicted that Congress will approve another base closure round in 2001. The Inhofe amendment, which aimed to restrict DOD's ability to realign facilities without a congressionally established base closure process, was ultimately dropped by the authorization conference. Additionally, the Administration requested about $1.8 billion in supplemental appropriations for military contingency operations overseas, including extending the U.S. mission in Bosnia and operations in the Persian Gulf due to the confrontation with Iraq. The Administration requested $1.9 billion in supplemental funding for extending the U.S. mission in Bosnia through FY1999. Congress approved the funding in H.R. 3579 and ultimately provided the funding in the omnibus appropriations bill (H.R. 4328). The additional funding for Bosnia was designated as \"emergency\" appropriations. The Administration requested additional funding for Bosnia in the omnibus appropriations bill (H.R. 4328) to raise caps on defense discretionary spending without the need for offsets. Congress had previously insisted on including anticipated costs of military operations within regular defense appropriations measures. The Administration requested additional funding for Bosnia in the omnibus appropriations bill to raise caps on defense discretionary spending without the need for offsets. Congress had previously insisted on including anticipated costs of military operations within regular defense appropriations measures. In Bosnia, the Persian Gulf, and elsewhere, the FY1998 and FY1999 supplemental funding broke the precedent of funding within defense spending caps. The Administration argued that Bosnia costs were not assumed in defense plans at the time the 1997 budget agreement was reached. Congressional action included SASC approving $1.9 billion for Bosnia in FY1999 in addition to regular funding. In the defense authorization bill, SASC approved $1.9 billion for Bosnia in FY1999 as emergency appropriations. HNSC set a cap of $1.9 billion with an additional $100 million available for emergencies to protect U.S. troops. The full House rejected a motion to recommit the bill for further review. The House rejected a motion to cut off funds for operations in Bosnia without prior congressional approval. The Senate approved an amendment urging the President to reduce U.S. troop levels in Bosnia but rejected a proposal to cut off funds unless approved by Congress. The Senate approved an amendment to reduce U.S. troop levels in Bosnia but rejected a proposal to cut off funds without congressional approval. Senator Stevens proposed an amendment to provide $1.9 billion in emergency appropriations for defense. The House-passed appropriations bill included a provision to prohibit expenditures on offensive military action without advance congressional approval. The House-passed appropriations bill included a provision to prohibit expenditures on offensive military action without advance congressional approval. The Senate voted to table a similar amendment. The White House threatened a veto if the provision was included. The authorization conference agreement approved $1.9 billion in emergency funding for Bosnia, contingent on presidential certification for national security needs. The conference agreement allows expenditure of more than provided if certified for national security. No emergency funding for Bosnia in appropriations agreement. Skaggs amendment dropped. $1.9 billion emergency funding for Bosnia in FY1999 Omnibus bill. Congressional focus on China relations and technology exports controls. Allegations of Loral Space Corporation aiding China. Policy towards China and other nations, particularly regarding technology exports, became a major focus of congressional attention. The House approved amendments to restrict technology exports to China, including limitations on missile and satellite technology exports and licensing requirements for satellite exports. Congressional action also focused on trade sanctions legislation and export controls in response to nuclear tests by India and Pakistan. The House approved amendments limiting technology exports to China, including missile and satellite technology, licensing requirements for satellite exports, and transferring export review responsibility to the State Department. The White House objected to these measures, and there was also a provision to prohibit the transfer of facilities at Long Beach naval shipyard to a Chinese shipping company. The Senate rejected a motion to table four China-related amendments by Senator Hutchinson, leading to a delay in the debate on China policy. Senator Stevens postponed floor action on the defense appropriations bill due to concerns that contentious amendments on China or other issues could derail the bill. Ultimately, the transfer of facilities at Long Beach naval shipyard to a Chinese shipping company, COSCO, was a key point of contention in the Senate. Senator Stevens delayed floor action on the defense appropriations bill due to concerns about contentious amendments on China. Senator Hutchinson later proposed an amendment requiring the State Department to deny visas to foreign officials involved in forced abortions, sterilization, or genital mutilation, which passed unanimously. The authorization conference agreement included provisions regarding technology exports to China. The authorization conference agreement drops House language banning satellite exports to China but includes provisions transferring technology export review to the State Department, requiring advanced congressional notification for satellite sales, and prohibiting missile equipment exports unless certified not harmful to the U.S. space launch industry or China's missile capabilities. It also bans transferring port facilities to COSCO. The conference agreement includes provisions transferring technology export review to the State Department, requiring advanced congressional notification for satellite sales, and prohibiting missile equipment exports that could harm the U.S. spacelaunch industry or China's missile capabilities. It also bans transferring port facilities to COSCO and recommends efficiency measures such as staff reductions in the Office of the Secretary of Defense and military service headquarters. The Defense Department has made cuts in personnel in the Office of the Secretary of Defense and military service headquarters, as well as in civilian support functions. Congress has pressured for reductions in \"overhead\" activities but also imposed barriers on reducing civilian personnel levels. Key issues include whether the cuts are substantial and whether Congress will demand further reductions. Key issues this year include whether DOD cuts in OSD and headquarters personnel are real, if Congress will demand deeper cuts in overhead personnel, and how Congress will respond to privatization measures at local facilities. The House has pushed for significant reductions in acquisition personnel, while the Senate and Administration have tried to soften these measures. The House has also resisted proposals to open weapons maintenance and other activities to private competition. The House has resisted proposals to open weapons maintenance and other activities to private competition. In report language, HNSC urged the Defense Department not to waive cuts in acquisition personnel mandated in last year's defense authorization act. HNSC imposed an across-the-board cut of $500 million in funding for consultants as a reform measure, which the White House objected to. The White House objected to cuts in consulting funds and measures in the House-passed authorization bill that would restrict DOD's efficiency efforts. The authorization conference agreement includes withholding funds for the Office of the Secretary of Defense, reducing acquisition personnel, cutting consultant funds, and decreasing Assistant Secretary of Defense positions. Military readiness has been a key focus in congressional hearings. The authorization conference agreement reduces the number of Assistant Secretary of Defense positions from 10 to 9. Congressional hearings have focused on military readiness issues, including shortages in spare engines, lower Army recruitment standards, personnel skill gaps, and declining pilot retention rates in the Air Force and Navy, leading to concerns about a readiness crisis due to inadequate funding and the Clinton Administration's defense commitments. Some believe there is a readiness crisis due to insufficient defense funding and the Clinton Administration's extensive military commitments. Administration officials acknowledge some issues but deny an overall crisis, stating that early deploying units are fully ready while later deploying units may take longer to prepare. They argue that anecdotal evidence does not accurately reflect the force's state, with overall readiness reports showing high readiness levels. Overall, despite some problems like Air Force engine spares shortages and pilot retention issues, efforts are being made to address these issues. Congress approved higher pilot reenlistment bonuses, and steps are being taken to limit deployments. Officials in the military services are increasingly concerned about personnel recruitment and retention. The President met with senior military officers to address readiness problems and urged higher defense spending. The Joint Chiefs testified about the need for over $17 billion per year in additional defense spending. The Joint Chiefs testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee about the need for over $17 billion per year in additional defense spending. Congressional action included restructuring operation and maintenance funding for depot maintenance and real property maintenance, as well as mandating changes in readiness reporting. The Senate approved additional funds for readiness-related accounts in the defense appropriations bill. The Senate approved additional funds for readiness-related accounts in the defense appropriations bill, including requirements for reports on food stamp use by military families and improved readiness reporting. The authorization conference agreement also provides more money for recruiting, troop benefits, and flight duty pay. The authorization conference agreement in Bosnia requires improved readiness reporting, more money for recruiting and troop benefits, increased pay for flight duty, and quality of life measures like day care centers and housing. The FY1999 omnibus appropriations bill includes $1.3 billion for military readiness, but did not address changes in retirement benefits for personnel retention. Long-term funding for defense modernization is also a concern. The military readiness issue is closely tied to long-term weapons modernization programs. Funding for weapons procurement has been reallocated to operation and maintenance accounts due to high readiness-related funding priorities. The FY1999 budget shows a slight decline in procurement funding, mainly due to adjustments in weapons programs. The FY1999 budget for weapons procurement, totaling $48.7 billion, is close to planned levels despite a slight decline due to adjustments in weapons programs. The Administration aims to increase procurement funding to $60 billion by FY2001, but achieving this goal without raising overall defense spending goes against historical trends in the defense budget. The Administration aims to increase procurement funding to $60 billion by FY2001, but achieving this goal without raising overall defense spending goes against historical trends in the defense budget. Senior defense officials acknowledge the challenge and hope to reach the target through efficiency savings, but factors like weapons maintenance costs, quality of life requirements, contingency operation costs, and health care cost growth could hinder progress. The $60 billion procurement target set by the Administration is becoming harder to reach, with no substantial increases in modernization funding included in defense bills. The omnibus appropriations bill provides $1 billion for BMD programs but no other funds for weapons modernization. The QDR mandated reductions in military personnel end-strength levels, with cuts of 37,000 active duty personnel and 55,000 reserve positions by 2003. The QDR mandated a cut of 37,000 active duty personnel and 55,000 reserve positions by 2003, mainly from support activities for efficiency savings. Congress has shown resistance to the proposed cuts, citing strain on active duty forces due to contingency operations and shortages in certain skills within the Army. The Army has faced shortages in certain skills, relying on reservists for major conflicts. However, for smaller operations like in Bosnia, fully manned units are created by drawing personnel from other active duty units, leading to increased shortages elsewhere. Congress must agree to reduce or eliminate statutory floors to carry out QDR reductions, but some Members are hesitant. Congress must agree to reduce or eliminate statutory floors to carry out QDR reductions. The Administration requested a reduction in active duty end-strength, but some Members of Congress are hesitant. HNSC rejected the request to repeal statutory floors and reduced authorized end-strength by 11,000 fewer positions than requested. SASC approved the end-strength reductions and repeal of statutory floors. The SASC approved the requested end-strength reductions and repeal of statutory floors, with the House and Senate versions of the defense appropriations bill assuming the cuts in FY1999. The National Guard and reserve issues arose after a dispute between the active Army and the Army National Guard over the role of Guard combat units post-QDR. The Guard felt that active Army leaders did not give them an appropriate role in war plans. The active Army has not given Guard combat units, especially eight ARNG combat divisions, an appropriate role in war plans. Congress approved a measure requiring the appointment of Guard and Reserve officers as special advisors to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. The Defense Department has requested more money for Guard and reserve weapons procurement. The Army Chief of Staff is working to ease the dispute with ARNG leaders. Congress consistently adds money for Guard and reserve weapons programs to the budget. The Army Chief of Staff is meeting with ARNG leaders to resolve disputes over major weapons programs. Congress has consistently added substantial amounts for equipment earmarked for National Guard and Reserve forces, including missile defense programs. Major weapons programs, including missile defense, are a key focus in Congress this year. National Missile Defense (NMD) is for protecting the US against long-range missile attacks, while Theater Missile Defense (TMD) is for protecting deployed forces and allies from short or intermediate-range attacks. Funding for NMD programs has increased after the QDR, with less contention. However, major policy disputes remain unresolved, with the Administration deferring a decision on deploying NMD technology. The Administration is pursuing NMD technology development while delaying deployment. Congress advocates for early nationwide defense deployment due to perceived threats. Disputes over TMD systems like THAAD, Navy Theater-Wide, and MEADS continue. Key issues this year involve the Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, the Navy Theater-Wide program, and the Medium Extended Range Air Defense System (MEADS). THAAD and Navy Theater-Wide are long-range interceptor systems. The Administration has delayed THAAD development due to test failures and wants to delay Navy system procurement until after THAAD procurement. MEADS is a cooperative program with European allies for improved air/missile defense for forward deployed troops. Congressional action has sometimes delayed defense authorization and appropriations. Congressional action has sometimes delayed defense authorization and appropriations for the past two years. This year, the Senate Armed Services Committee reported S. 1873, \"The American Missile Protection Act of 1998,\" calling for deployment of a nationwide defense. However, the Senate failed to invoke cloture on the bill on May 13 and September 9. Congress has also acted on TMD programs earlier. The House approved additional funding for TMD programs in FY1998, including $147 million in H.R. 2786 and $179 million in H.R. 3579. The FY1999 authorization included more funding for Navy Area Defense and other TMD systems. The SASC bill added funding for Navy Theater Wide program but reduced THAAD slightly. The Senate approved an amendment to trim $253.9 million from the THAAD program due to test failures and delays in engineering development. The House also restructured the THAAD program by requiring DOD to select a second contractor to compete. The House approved a committee amendment to restructure the THAAD program, requiring a second contractor to compete with Lockheed-Martin and shifting $142.7 million from engineering development to technology development. SASC also cut MEADS funding and required DOD to study alternatives. SASC was critical of the Air Force Advanced Airborne Laser program and increased funding for Space-Based Laser R&D. The Senate appropriations bill reduced funding for the Air Force Advanced Airborne Laser (ABL) program by $97 million and added $94 million for Space-Based Laser R&D. Additionally, $57 million was cut from the ABL budget, $10 million was allocated to boost phase intercept technology in the TMD budget, and funding for the Navy Theater Wide TMD system was increased. The authorization conference decreased funding for THAAD by $294 million and MEADS by $19 million to $24 million. The House defense appropriations bill reduced funding for THAAD by $376 million, MEADS to $10 million, and the Airborne Laser by $25 million. The FY1999 omnibus appropriations bill included an additional $1 billion for missile defense. The B-2 bomber funding was also discussed. The FY1999 omnibus appropriations bill includes an extra $1 billion for missile defense, with no specific allocation mentioned. Congressional debates on funding for additional B-2 bombers have resulted in no new procurement in this year's defense bills. The latest B-2 study called for no more bombers to be produced due to cost. Congressional action shows no funding for more B-2 bombers, potentially marking the end of the B-2 battle. Three new fighter aircraft programs are in development: Navy F/A-18E/F, Air Force F-22, and Joint Strike Fighter. DOD has requested funding for F/A-18E/F, F-22 development, and JSF R&D in FY1999. The DOD requested FY1999 funding for F/A-18E/F, F-22 development, and JSF R&D. The QDR decided to continue all programs but with reductions. Some Members of Congress believe DOD cannot afford all three programs and one should be canceled. Congressional action reduced F/A-18E/F procurement from 30 to 27 aircraft. Congressional action: HNSC and HAC reduced F/A-18E/F procurement from 30 to 27 aircraft, with no changes in major tactical aircraft programs. SASC required the F-22 to complete 10% of planned flight tests before the next procurement round, reflecting concerns about concurrent testing and production. The Senate rejected a Bumpers amendment for 601 hours of flight testing before procurement. The authorization conference included funds for 30 F-18s and allowed a waiver for the F-22 flight test requirement. The appropriations conference approved 30 F-18s for procurement, with Congress adding funds to shipbuilding programs to avoid gaps in production. One major issue concerns the procurement of the CVN-77, the last planned Nimitz-class aircraft carrier. The procurement of the CVN-77, the last Nimitz-class aircraft carrier, has been a major issue carried over from last year. The Department of Defense has moved up planned procurement to FY2001, avoiding a big bill in FY1999 and FY2000. Newport News Shipbuilding's \"Smart Buy\" proposal aimed to save the Navy $600 million, but the new DOD plan will not save as much. The Navy's new DOD plan will not save as much as Newport News Shipbuilding's \"Smart Buy\" proposal, which aimed to save $600 million on the price of the ship. The development of the next generation DD-21 destroyer involves teaming arrangements between shipbuilders and combat system integrators for competition in combat. The Navy has reached agreements with shipbuilders and combat system integrators to form teams for competition in combat systems and design. Plans for a new-design aircraft carrier, known as the \"CVX,\" have been abandoned in favor of incremental improvements to the next three Nimitz-class carriers. Congressional approval has been granted for the Administration's shipbuilding program, including funding for a New Attack Submarine (NSSN). The House approved the Administration's shipbuilding program, including funding for a New Attack Submarine (NSSN), ending a debate on competition between shipbuilders. The Senate added $50 million for a new LHD-7 class amphibious ship, drawing attention due to being built in Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott's home state. The Navy has decided not to pursue a new design for the CVX carrier, leading to a debate on how funding for carrier R&D will be allocated. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a reduction in funding for CVX R&D and an increase for CVN-77. The Navy aims to protect funding for CVN upgrades. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended a $130 million reduction in CVX R&D funding and a $50 million increase for CVN-77. Additionally, they cut $35.7 million for CVX feasibility studies and allocated $5 million for a red team study. The House Appropriations bill reduced CVX funding by $100 million. The authorization conference agreement provides $110 million for CVX R&D, while the appropriations conference agreement provides $105 million. The conference agreement provides $110 million for CVX R&D, while the Administration did not request funding for additional F-16 aircraft in the FY1999 budget. Congress has supported low-level procurement to maintain production lines, encourage foreign sales, and meet Air Force requirements. Funding for JSTARS aircraft was also a concern, with a recommendation to reduce planned procurement from 19 to 13 assuming NATO would purchase 6 aircraft with alliance funds. NATO did not decide to make the purchase. The House authorization added $66 million for 2 F-16s and advance procurement funds for 2 additional JSTARS aircraft. It also included funds for National Guard and Reserve equipment, $300 million for defense-wide account, and additional amounts for specific weapons programs. Additionally, funds were provided for 8 C-130 cargo aircraft, exceeding DOD's request for just one. The House appropriations bill provided funds for 8 C-130 cargo aircraft of various types, $60 million for two F-16s, advance procurement money for JSTARS, $120 million for Guard and Reserve equipment, and $461 million for 8 C-130s. SASC provided $72 million for advance procurement or termination costs for JSTARS, funded 4 additional C-130s, and added $60 million for Guard and Reserve procurement. SAC funded 3 additional C-130s and provided $247 million for miscellaneous Guard and Reserve procurement. The authorization conference agreement provides funds for 7 C-130s, 1 F-16, and advance procurement for JSTARS. Rep. Obey proposed eliminating funds for 4 C-130s to restore F/A-18E/F procurement. He criticized the increase in C-130J funding, stating it came at the expense of more valuable programs. The authorization conference agreement provides funds for 7 C-130s, 1 F-16, and advance procurement for JSTARS. It also includes $60 million for Guard and Reserve equipment. The appropriations conference agreement follows suit on C-130s, provides $36 million for JSTARS advance procurement, and allocates $140 million for Guard and Reserve procurement. The National Defense Panel criticized planned procurement of weapons that may not be effective. The National Defense Panel recommended reducing or terminating \"legacy\" programs in favor of pursuing leap-ahead technologies for land forces, fighter aircraft, and ships. They criticized various military programs, including the Army M1A2 tank upgrade, Crusader artillery, Comanche helicopter, Navy and Air Force F/A-18E/F and F-22 programs, and Navy CVN-77 aircraft carrier. Some Members of Congress have raised similar concerns. Some Members of Congress have echoed concerns raised by the National Defense Panel about legacy military programs, including the Army's Crusader artillery program. The Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) approved measures for a Quadrennial Defense Review and criticized the Army's Crusader program, ordering a review in light of the Panel's arguments. The authorization conference agreement requires a report on the Crusader program and addresses issues such as sexual harassment and gender integration. The authorization conference agreement requires a report on the Crusader program, focusing on sexual harassment, gender-integrated training, and other social issues. Last year, the Administration and Congress appointed separate commissions to review gender-integrated training, with former Senator Nancy Kassebaum Baker leading the Administration's commission. The Administration-appointed commission, led by former Senator Nancy Kassebaum Baker, made recommendations to improve recruitment and training in the military. One key recommendation was to provide separate units and barracks for men and women during basic training, a policy followed by the Marine Corps. However, the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services disagreed with this recommendation for greater gender separation in training. The Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services disagreed with the Kassebaum Baker committee's recommendation for greater gender separation in training. Secretary of Defense Cohen left it to each service to decide on changes, with no policy alterations made yet. The congressionally-mandated commission is still investigating. The HNSC version of the authorization bill included a provision for separate units and barracks for men and women in basic training, but no floor action was taken to reverse this requirement. The House and Senate were in disagreement over gender-integrated training in basic training units and barracks. The HNSC included a provision for separate facilities, but the Senate approved a substitute allowing current practices to continue until the congressionally-mandated commission reports. The House and Senate were at odds over gender-integrated training. The authorization agreement allows current unit training practices to continue but requires separate sleeping quarters for men and women in basic training. Defense health care issues have also been under discussion. The Defense Department is evaluating the effectiveness of the Tricare managed care system for defense dependents and health care benefits for military retirees. Congress established a demonstration program for Medicare subvention to pay for care provided to eligible military retirees. Congressional actions are being taken to ensure continued health care for military retirees. The Department is evaluating Tricare for defense dependents and health care for military retirees. Congressional actions include establishing demonstration projects for alternative healthcare for retirees, testing access to FEHBP, and providing Tricare benefits as a supplement to Medicare. The defense appropriations bill includes earmarks for medical research and development, such as bone marrow transplants and cancer research, with $250 million allocated in the Senate version for these programs. The Senate version of the defense appropriations bill allocated $250 million for medical R&D earmarks, with the Defense Department determining priorities. The full committee ensured funding would not be reduced below FY1998 levels for breast cancer and prostate cancer research. The House bill included separate amounts for various medical earmarks. The appropriations conference agreement provided separate funds for medical programs, including breast cancer and prostate cancer research, following the Senate's approach. The House Appropriations Committee added $1.6 billion in emergency appropriations to help the Defense Department and the Treasury Department fix their computers for the Year 2000 computer problems. Rep. Obey criticized this emergency funding. The House Appropriations Committee approved emergency funding of $1.6 billion for the Defense Department and the Treasury Department to address the Year 2000 computer problem. Rep. Obey criticized this funding as an increase in the defense budget. However, the House Republican caucus decided not to provide emergency funding for the \"Y2K\" issue, leading to the removal of the $1.6 billion in emergency funding from the defense appropriations bill. The issue of emergency funding for Bosnia and Y2K was left to be addressed in a separate supplemental appropriations bill. The FY1999 omnibus appropriations bill provides $1.1 billion for the Defense Department for Y2K conversion and an additional $2.4 billion for other agencies. The defense authorization bill approves funding for Department of Energy weapons related activities as well as for Department of Defense activities. The defense appropriations bill does not provide funds for DOE, instead, all DOE funding is provided in the energy and water development appropriations bill. The House-passed authorization bill includes a measure to prohibit DOE from buying tritium for nuclear weapons from commercial reactors, leading to the need for new tritium production facilities in South Carolina. The cost is estimated at $3 billion over forty years to buy tritium from commercial sources and $10 billion to produce it in-house. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that buying tritium from commercial sources will cost $3 billion over 40 years, while producing it in new facilities will cost $10 billion. The Senate-passed bill allows the Department of Energy to choose the option it prefers, but implementation is delayed for a year for Congress to review. Senator Kyl has objected to this delay, urging DOE to pursue a new tritium source urgently. Senator Kyl has put a hold on the authorization conference report due to his objection to a provision regarding DOE's tritium source.
