The \"Alien Terrorist Removal Act of 1995\" defines 'special court' as described in subsection (c) and 'special removal hearing' as described in subsection (e). The provisions apply when the Attorney General certifies to the special court that an alien terrorist is present in the US for deportation. The Alien Terrorist Removal Act of 1995 establishes a special court with up to seven designated judges to hear cases involving the deportation of alien terrorists in the US. Removal proceedings may pose a national security risk if they disclose classified information. The Alien Terrorist Removal Act of 1995 establishes a special court with designated judges to hear deportation cases involving alien terrorists. The Chief Justice can designate the same judges as those under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. When the Attorney General applies for deportation, a single judge will consider the application in camera and ex parte. The court considers deportation applications for alien terrorists in camera and ex parte if there is probable cause to believe the alien poses a national security risk due to classified information disclosure in deportation proceedings. The special removal hearing for aliens involves a public hearing if probable cause is shown, allowing the alien to be present and have legal representation, even if unable to afford counsel. The alien in a special removal hearing has the right to be represented by counsel, with counsel appointed if unable to afford one. The alien can introduce evidence, cross-examine witnesses, and request subpoenas. The judge can allow the introduction of evidence in camera and ex parte. The judge can authorize the introduction of evidence in camera and ex parte if public disclosure poses a national security risk. The alien must be provided with a substitution for such evidence, either a statement admitting relevant facts or a summary. The judge can authorize the introduction of evidence in camera and ex parte if public disclosure poses a national security risk. The alien must be provided with a substitution for such evidence, either a statement admitting relevant facts or a summary, to ensure a fair defense. If disclosure of specific evidence poses a risk of harm, a substitution can be provided for the alien's defense in deportation proceedings. The determination of deportation can be made based on this substituted evidence if necessary. The judge will require deportation of the alien if the Attorney General proves, by clear and convincing evidence, that the alien is subject to deportation as described in section 241(a)(4)(B). The alien may appeal a deportation determination to the court of appeals for the Federal Circuit within twenty days. The Attorney General also has the right to appeal certain determinations to the court of appeals. The Attorney General may appeal a determination under subsections (d), (e), or (f) to the court of appeals for the Federal Circuit within twenty days. The entire record of the proceeding can be transmitted to the court of appeals under seal upon request. The court of appeals will consider the appeal in camera and ex parte."
