    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"United Nations Accountability Act of 2004\". Congress finds allegations of mismanagement, fraud, and corruption in the United Nations Oil-for-Food program, as identified in audits by the United Nations Office of Internal Oversight Services. The audits revealed mismanagement in contracts for independent inspection agents in Iraq. The United Nations contractor in Iraq did not fully perform its inspection duties, leading to overcharging, inadequate management of the contract, and unprofessional conduct. The United Nations Office of Iraq Programs engaged in unprofessional conduct and misreported figures for goods, leading to a need to strengthen contract management. Without a designated contract manager, there was no assurance that services provided were in line with the contract. The United Nations did not release OIOS audit reports to member states, denying the United States access to audits of the Oil-for-Food Program. This policy undermines member states' ability to fulfill their responsibilities in connection with UN programs. The United Nations policy of not disclosing OIOS audit reports to member states undermines their ability to fulfill responsibilities in connection with UN programs. SEC. 3. ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY MEASURES FOR THE UNITED NATIONS. Congress urges the President to ensure that all OIOS audit reports are promptly and fully shared with UN member states. Additionally, the Department of State must report on the financial disclosure requirements of UN officials within 180 days of this Act's enactment. Within 180 days of the Act's enactment, the Department of State must submit a report to congressional committees evaluating financial disclosure rules for United Nations officials and suggesting any necessary reforms. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. The curr_chunk defines the terms \"oil-for-food program\" and \"Office of Internal Oversight Services\" in relation to United Nations resolutions.
