    "content": "H.R. 3962, Affordable Health Care for America Act, passed by the House of Representatives on November 7, 2009, is based on H.R. 3200. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill would reduce federal deficits by $109. The amendment proposed on November 3 reflects the enactment of H.R. 3548, the Worker, Homeownership, and Business Assistance Act of 2009. CBO projects the bill would reduce federal deficits by $109 billion over the 10-year period of 2010-2019 and insure 96% of the non-elderly, legally present U.S. population by 2019. The total cost of the coverage provisions, including Exchange subsidies, federal Medicaid expenditures, and tax credits for small employers, would be $1.052 trillion over 10 years, with a net cost of $891 billion after accounting for penalties and other issues. The net cost of the coverage provisions in the Affordable Health Care for America Act would be $891 billion over 10 years, offset by savings from other spending changes and increased federal revenues. This report outlines key provisions affecting private health insurance in the Act. The Affordable Health Care for America Act would increase federal revenues by $574 billion over the period. Key provisions include reducing the number of uninsured, restructuring the private health insurance market, setting minimum health benefit standards, providing financial assistance, and requiring individuals to maintain health insurance. H.R. 3962 would mandate individuals to have health insurance and employers to provide insurance or pay a payroll assessment. Market reforms like modified community rating and guaranteed issue would be implemented. Both mandates would be tied to acceptable health insurance coverage meeting minimum standards under a qualified health benefits plan. Coverage could be obtained through the Exchange or new employer plans. The Exchange, established under a new federal agency, would offer private plans alongside a public option. Subsidies for premium costs and cost-sharing would be available for individuals with incomes below 400% of the federal poverty level, but only through the Exchange. Other coverage options include Medicare and Medicaid. The bill would establish subsidies for individuals below 400% of the federal poverty level through the Exchange. Plans in the individual market could be grandfathered with no changes, and a CO-OP program would encourage non-profit health insurance cooperatives. Dental or vision plans would not be affected. The bill proposes the creation of non-profit health insurance cooperatives in the Exchange, effective from 2013. Revenues would be raised by limiting employer deductions and modifying tax-advantaged accounts. Background information on the private insurance market is provided to understand the reform proposed by H.R. 3962. The report summarizes key provisions affecting private health insurance in Division A of H.R. 3962, passed by the House of Representatives on November 7, 2009. Most provisions would be effective starting in 2013, with an Appendix showing the timeline for implementing provisions before 2013. The private health insurance provisions in H.R. 3962 are interrelated and include alterations to the current system. H.R. 3962 includes provisions to change private health insurance markets, focusing on individuals buying coverage directly or through small employers. Insurers would be required to cover pre-existing conditions and not charge higher premiums. Adverse selection, where individuals enroll only when sick, can lead to increased premiums and uninsurance. If reform eliminates tools insurers use to guard against adverse selection, AHIP suggests individuals must be required to purchase coverage to prevent only the sick from enrolling. Some people currently go without health insurance due to unaffordable premiums. Some individuals forgo health insurance due to unaffordable premiums. Adequate premium subsidies may be necessary for the individual mandate to obtain health insurance. Premium subsidies without cost-sharing subsidies could result in individuals having insurance they cannot afford to use. Removing one provision from the bill could hinder the implementation of others. The private health insurance provisions in Division A of H.R. 3962 include individual and employer mandates, private health insurance market reforms, immediate reforms, Health Insurance Exchange with a public option, premium and cost-sharing subsidies, and the CO-OP Program. Removing any provision could impact the implementation of others. Immediate Reforms in the Health Insurance Exchange include offering a public health insurance option, premium and cost-sharing subsidies, the CO-OP Program, selected revenue provisions related to health insurance, and other provisions such as abortion, medical malpractice, and end-of-life care. Americans obtain health insurance through various methods, including employment-based coverage, private sector options, and publicly funded programs like Medicare or Medicaid. In 2008, 60% of the U.S. population had employment-based health insurance, with employers choosing to purchase insurance or self-fund health benefits for their employees. Approximately 46 million Americans were estimated to be uninsured in 2008, with individuals and employers obtaining health insurance through various methods in the private market, including the large group, small group, and nongroup markets. More than 95% of large employers had employment-based health insurance. Large employers are able to obtain lower premiums for health insurance packages compared to small employers and individuals in the nongroup market due to economies of scale and a larger risk pool. They offer subsidies towards health insurance, attracting both healthier and sicker workers to enter the pool, resulting in a larger and more predictable risk pool. States have experimented with creating a single site for individuals and small employers to compare insurance plans and pool risk. While past experiments like California's PacAdvantage failed, states like Massachusetts have developed more sustainable models. Private-sector companies also help individuals compare health insurance plans. Less than half of small employers offer health insurance due to cost concerns and limited ability to spread risk. Insurers view small firms as less stable than larger pools. Small employers struggle to provide health insurance due to cost concerns and limited risk-spreading ability. Insurers see small firms as less stable than larger pools, with factors like medical underwriting and lack of bargaining power affecting their ability to negotiate benefits and rates. Joining a larger pool, such as an Association or Exchange, could help small firms access better insurance options. Joining a larger pool, such as an Association or Exchange, could lower premiums for small firms with high-cost employees by allowing them to purchase insurance through a larger pool. State laws may allow individuals in the nongroup market to be rejected or face premiums based on health status, resulting in lower premiums for the healthy and higher premiums for the sick. Reforms affecting premium ratings could increase premiums for some and lower premiums for others based on age, health, and behaviors. Reforms may impact premiums for different individuals based on age, health, and behaviors. States regulate the private health insurance market, with federal regulations mostly affecting employer-sponsored health insurance. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) mandates guaranteed issue coverage for small groups. In the small group and individual markets, states require issuers to offer guaranteed issue coverage to small employers and self-employed individuals. Some states also mandate guaranteed issue policies for non-HIPAA eligible individuals in the individual market. Premium rating rules are imposed on insurance carriers in most states. Most states have premium rating rules for insurance carriers in small group and individual markets, ranging from pure community rating to adjusted community rating. Pure community rating means all enrollees pay the same premium regardless of health or age. Adjusted community rating allows pricing based on factors like age or gender. Only New Jersey and New York use pure community rating in nongroup markets, with New York also using it in the small group market. Adjusted community rating in the small group market allows pricing based on factors like age or gender, but prohibits pricing based on health factors. Rate bands limit premium variation based on health within a specified range set by the state. Federal law mandates that group health plans must restrict the period for excluding coverage of preexisting conditions. In January 2009, 21 states in the small group market had rules limiting exclusion of coverage for preexisting conditions, exceeding federal standards. By December 2008, 42 states in the individual market limited exclusion periods for certain enrollees. States impose over 2,000 benefit mandates, while federal law mandates restrictions on preexisting condition coverage exclusion. Some proponents argue for a publicly sponsored health insurance plan as part of insurance market reform, citing potential cost savings and increased competition. Some argue that a public health insurance plan could increase competition by offering lower premiums through lower provider payments. Opponents fear this could give the government an unfair advantage and drive private plans out of the market. Studies have looked at the performance of health insurance organizations based on their profit status. Health insurance provided by for-profit and non-profit organizations has been studied for performance differences. Research suggests that non-profit health maintenance organizations (HMOs) outperform for-profits in quality measures. Studies in 1999 and 2006 found that non-profits scored higher on key quality indicators. In a 2006 study of 272 health plans, researchers found that non-profit health insurance co-operatives, like Group Health Cooperative of Seattle and HealthPartners of Minnesota, performed well. By 2008, 47% of private health plan enrollment was in non-profit organizations. Congressional attention has focused on incentivizing the creation of new health insurance co-operatives. Some congressional attention has been focused on options to incentivize the creation of new health insurance co-operatives in the United States. Advocates argue that co-operatives invest earnings back into the plan or enrollees for lower premiums, cost-sharing, benefits, and wellness programs. Opponents claim co-operatives have not been successful nationwide and lack evidence of making health insurance more affordable. Several provisions of the bill would take effect before full implementation on January 1, 2013. Prior to full implementation on January 1, 2013, some provisions of the bill would take effect, including prohibiting postretirement reductions in retiree health benefits, allowing individuals to keep COBRA coverage until the Exchange is operational, and establishing a temporary national high-risk pool. The Secretary would establish a temporary national high-risk pool program to provide health benefits to eligible individuals from January 1, 2010, until the Health Insurance Exchange is established. Health insurance issuers must provide a rebate if their coverage has a medical loss ratio below a level specified by the Secretary. This provision applies to both the small or large group market and the individual market until plans are offered via the Exchange. The provision requires health insurance issuers to justify any premium increases to the Secretary and states before implementation. Individuals up to age 26 can stay on their parents' plans. The policy applies to both group and individual markets, with a sunset provision once plans are offered via the Exchange. The bill would reduce the look-back period for pre-existing conditions from 6 months to 30 days and shorten the exclusion period for certain benefits. It prohibits domestic violence from being considered a pre-existing condition and mandates coverage for a dependent child's congenital or developmental deformity. Lifetime limits on benefits would be prohibited, and guidance would be issued by the Secretary. The bill prohibits lifetime limits on benefits and mandates coverage for congenital or developmental deformities. It also includes a mandate for individuals to have health insurance with penalties for noncompliance. The Secretary would issue guidance on rescission limitations and establish a temporary reinsurance program for employment-based plans. H.R. 3962 mandates most individuals to have health insurance with penalties for noncompliance. Acceptable coverage includes qualified health benefits plans, Medicare, Medicaid, military coverage, veteran's health care, and services for members of Indian tribes. Individuals who do not maintain acceptable health insurance coverage may be required to pay an additional tax based on their income. Subsidies may be provided to help with premium and cost-sharing costs. H.R. 3962 would provide subsidies for individuals to help pay for premiums and cost-sharing. Some individuals would be exempt from the individual mandate, including nonresident aliens, individuals residing outside of the United States, and those with qualified religious exemptions. H.R. 3962 would require employers to offer individual and family coverage under a QHBP or pay into the Exchange, with exceptions. Employers include private-sector employers, churches, and government entities. Rules apply for offering health insurance, including options for employment-based coverage or Exchange plans for small businesses. Employers would need to offer coverage through a QHBP or contribute to the Exchange, with specific requirements for employer contributions. Grandfathered plans would have to meet essential benefits package standards after five years. Employees would be automatically enrolled by employers. Employers would automatically enroll part-time employees in the plan with the lowest premium, unless the employee opts out. Written notice of rights and obligations must be provided. Employers must show compliance with health participation requirements. Employers must demonstrate compliance with health participation requirements, including offering enrollment in a QHBP or current employment-based plan, providing monthly premiums for the lowest cost plan, and submitting employee information. Noncompliance could result in termination of an employer's health insurance election. Employers with aggregate wages over $750,000 not offering coverage would be subject to penalties. Employers with aggregate wages over $750,000 that do not offer health coverage may face an excise tax of 8% of average wages. Employees can choose to enroll in a plan through the Exchange instead of the employer's coverage. Starting in 2014, employers with wages above $750,000 may be assessed 8% of average wages for employees who decline qualifying coverage. Beginning in 2014, employers with aggregate wages above $750,000 may be assessed 8% of average wages for employees who decline qualifying coverage. This payroll assessment would not apply to employees covered as spouses or dependents in an Exchange plan. The employer's payroll assessment for these individuals would go into the Exchange but not towards the individual's premium. Full-time employees offered qualifying coverage by their employer would not be eligible for premium or cost-sharing credits. They would be responsible for 100% of the premium if they opt for Exchange coverage. Small businesses may be eligible for a 50% credit towards employee health coverage for up to two years, phased out as employee compensation and numbers increase. The proposed credit for small businesses would provide a 50% credit towards employee health coverage for up to two taxable years. The credit would phase out as average employee compensation increased from $20,000 to $40,000 and as the number of employees increased from 10 to 25. Adjustments for inflation would be applied, and the credit would not apply to highly compensated employees. The proposed small business credit for employee health coverage under H.R. 3962 would be part of the general business credit, not refundable, and only available to businesses with tax liability. Non-profit organizations would be ineligible. The bill also establishes new federal health insurance standards for qualified health benefits plans, including prohibiting coverage exclusions for pre-existing conditions. Provisions applicable to QHBPs, including the public health insurance option, would prohibit coverage exclusions for pre-existing health conditions and limitations based on health status or similar factors. The provision requires health coverage to be offered on a guaranteed issue and guaranteed renewal basis, ensuring acceptance of all applicants and renewal options. This applies to QHBPs and addresses affordability through rating rules. The provision in H.R. 3962 requires health coverage to be offered on a guaranteed issue and renewal basis, with premiums determined using adjusted community rating rules. Premiums can only vary based on age and premium rating area. Under H.R. 3962, premiums can vary based on age, premium rating area, and family enrollment. New non-discrimination and adequacy standards for insurers' networks of providers are imposed, along with existing mental health parity rules. Coverage must offer the option to keep qualified dependent children on the family's policy. H.R. 3962 would require QHBPs to cover specific benefits, prohibit cost-sharing on preventive services, limit annual out-of-pocket spending, and comply with network adequacy standards. It also mandates notification of any coverage changes to plan enrollees at least 90 days in advance. The QHBPs must cover specific benefits, prohibit cost-sharing on preventive services, limit annual out-of-pocket spending, comply with network adequacy standards, and meet essential benefits package standards. New individual policies after 2013 can only be offered as Exchange plans, while existing group plans must transition to QHBP standards by 2018. Existing nongroup insurance policies can be grandfathered if there are no changes to coverage terms or conditions, including benefits and cost-sharing. H.R. 3962 allows states to form Health Care Choice Compacts for selling individual health insurance across state lines, subject to guidelines developed by the NAIC. Coverage under the compact would be governed by the laws of one primary state while preserving the authority of secondary states. The Health Care Choice Compacts under H.R. 3962 would subject coverage sold in multiple states to the laws of one primary state while allowing secondary states to enforce specific rules. The Secretary would provide grants to states for regulating health insurance in secondary states, requiring Qualified Health Benefit Plans to cover essential benefits with the option for additional benefits. The essential benefits package under H.R. 3962 would cover specified items and services, prohibit cost-sharing on preventive services, limit annual out-of-pocket spending, and comply with network adequacy standards. It must be equivalent in benefits to the average employer health plan in 2013. The essential benefits package under H.R. 3962 includes hospital and clinic services, physician services, prescription drugs, mental health and substance use disorder services, preventive services with no cost-sharing, maternity care, pediatric care, and durable medical equipment. The essential benefits package under H.R. 3962 includes a range of services such as hospital and clinic services, physician services, prescription drugs, mental health and substance use disorder services, preventive services, maternity care, pediatric care, and durable medical equipment. The annual out-of-pocket limit in 2013 would be no more than $5,000 for an individual and $10,000 for a family, adjusted annually for inflation. Cost-sharing levels would be established using copayments, not coinsurance, and specified by the Health Benefits Advisory Committee and the HHS Secretary. The essential benefits package, determined by the Health Benefits Advisory Committee and HHS Secretary, covers 70% of health care claims. Plans in the Exchange can offer richer benefits as Enhanced, Premium, or Premium-Plus plans. Employer plans can have cost-sharing below levels set by the Secretary. The Health Benefits Advisory Committee (HBAC) would recommend cost-sharing levels for plans offered through the Health Insurance Exchange, consistent with actuarial values for different plan tiers. The Health Benefits Advisory Committee (HBAC) would develop cost-sharing structures consistent with actuarial values for different plan tiers in the Exchange. Recommendations would incorporate innovation in healthcare, reduce health disparities, and allow for public input. The Secretary must adopt the benefit standards as written or provide reasons for not doing so within 45 days of receiving HBAC's recommendations. H.R. 3962 would federalize private health insurance standards and create a Health Insurance Exchange to facilitate the purchase of Qualified Health Benefit Plans (QHBPs) by certain individuals and small businesses. The Secretary must adopt an initial set of benefit standards within 18 months either by adopting HBAC recommendations or proposing their own. The Health Insurance Exchange, similar to existing entities like the Massachusetts Connector and eHealthInsurance, would help individuals and small businesses purchase Qualified Health Benefit Plans. It would not be an insurer but provide access to insurers' plans, negotiate with plans, enforce requirements, and administer premium credits. The Health Insurance Exchange, similar to entities like the Massachusetts Connector and eHealthInsurance, would oversee plans, determine eligibility, and administer credits. Under H.R. 3962, it would be established under a new federal agency, funded by taxes and penalties. The Health Insurance Exchange would be funded by taxes on individuals without coverage, penalties for non-compliant employers, and payroll assessments. Only one Exchange per state would be allowed, with the option for a multi-state Exchange. State-based Exchanges would receive federal matching grants. The Health Insurance Exchange would be funded by taxes on individuals without coverage, penalties for non-compliant employers, and payroll assessments. State-based Exchanges would receive federal matching grants. State-based Exchanges could be approved if they met specified criteria, with the option for a multi-state Exchange. Beginning in 2013, new nongroup coverage could only be obtained through the Exchange. Beginning in 2013, new nongroup coverage could only be obtained through the Exchange. The public health insurance option and income-based premium and cost-sharing credits would be available through the Exchange. CBO estimated that by 2019, 30 million people would obtain Exchange coverage, with about 6 million enrolling in the public health insurance option. Individuals would be eligible for Exchange coverage. Individuals would be eligible for Exchange coverage unless they have group plan coverage through a full-time employer, Medicare, or Medicaid. Once enrolled in an Exchange plan, eligibility would generally end upon becoming eligible for Medicare Part A or Medicaid, among other circumstances determined by the Commissioner. Individuals eligible for Exchange coverage can enroll until they become eligible for Medicare Part A, Medicaid, or other circumstances determined by the Commissioner. An annual open-enrollment period in September to November lasting at least 30 days would be offered, with special enrollment periods for specific circumstances. Exchange-eligible employers can meet the employer mandate by offering and contributing to employees' enrollment through the Exchange. Employers can meet the employer mandate by enrolling employees through the Exchange. Employers with 25 or fewer employees were Exchange-eligible in 2013, 50 or fewer in 2014, and 100 or fewer in 2015. Larger employers could participate in the Exchange starting in 2015. In 2015, larger employers could participate in the Exchange, with plans meeting federal requirements and standardized cost-sharing options. Exchange-participating insurers must offer only one Basic plan in the service area, equivalent to minimum requirements. The Exchange-participating insurer must offer one Basic plan in the service area, meeting minimum requirements. They can also offer an Enhanced plan with lower cost-sharing and a Premium plan with even lower cost-sharing. The insurer must offer a Basic plan with minimum requirements in the service area. They can also offer an Enhanced plan with lower cost-sharing and a Premium plan with even lower cost-sharing. Additionally, they may offer a Premium-Plus plan with extra benefits like adult oral health and vision care, using cost-sharing levels specified by the Secretary for each benefit category in the essential benefits package. Plans can vary cost-sharing by up to 10%. The essential benefits package includes cost-sharing tiers (Basic, Enhanced, Premium) with a 10% variation allowed. States can require additional benefits for Exchange plans with reimbursement arrangements. H.R. 3962 establishes a public health insurance option through the Exchange for eligible individuals. The Secretary of HHS would establish a public health insurance option through the Exchange, offering Basic, Enhanced, Premium, and possibly Premium-Plus plans. Eligible individuals can enroll in the public option and may receive income-based premium and cost-sharing credits. The public option must meet all requirements for Exchange-participating plans, including benefits, provider networks, consumer protections, and cost-sharing. Geographically adjusted premiums would be set by the Secretary in compliance with established rules. The Secretary of HHS would establish a public health insurance option through the Exchange, offering Basic, Enhanced, Premium, and possibly Premium-Plus plans. Geographically adjusted premiums would be set to cover expected costs, including claims, administration, and a contingency margin. Limited start-up funding would be available, to be repaid within 10 years. The public option would be prohibited from receiving federal funds if insolvent. Payment rates for health care providers and services would be negotiated by the Secretary under H.R. 3962, subject to limits. The public option would set payment rates for health care providers and services, not lower than Medicare rates and not higher than average rates paid by other entities. Medicare-participating providers would also be providers for the public option, with physicians able to participate as preferred or non-preferred providers. Preferred physicians would be prohibited from balance-billing. The public option would allow providers to participate as preferred or non-preferred, with preferred physicians prohibited from balance-billing. Non-physician providers would also be prohibited from balance-billing. The Secretary could use innovative payment methods and implement successful payment and delivery system reforms under the public option. The Secretary would implement payment and delivery system reforms under the public option, allowed to enter no-risk contracts for administration. Administrative functions include payment determination, beneficiary education, provider services, and education. The Secretary would be required to enter into a memorandum of understanding with the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for the collection of costs associated with nonservice-connected care provided in VA facilities to public health insurance enrollees. Enrollment in the public option would be voluntary, allowing any employee, including Members of Congress, to choose health insurance through any Exchange plan. The bill would require individuals, including Members of Congress, to be responsible for 100% of the premium if they choose an Exchange plan over employer-sponsored insurance. It also includes a provision for the establishment of not-for-profit health insurance cooperatives in the Exchange, with an appropriation of $5 billion for fiscal years 2010 through 2014. The bill authorizes $5 billion for not-for-profit health insurance cooperatives in the Exchange from 2010 to 2014. Loans and grants are for start-up and solvency. Conditions include being a member-run organization offering insurance only to beneficiaries, not affiliated with previous insurers. The cooperative authorized by the bill offers coverage through the Health Insurance Exchange, with ethical standards to prevent insurance industry interference. It is not affiliated with previous insurers or sponsored by a state government, and is licensed to offer insurance in all states where it operates. The cooperative authorized by the bill offers coverage through the Health Insurance Exchange, with a strong consumer focus and governance by majority vote of its members. Profits are used to lower premiums, improve benefits, or enhance healthcare quality for members. The Commissioner would prioritize grants and loans for cooperatives that operate statewide, use integrated delivery systems, or have significant financial support from nongovernmental sources. Violations of the CO-OP program would result in repayment of loans or grants plus interest. Cooperatives could integrate across state lines, and some individuals may be eligible for premium credits. Individuals eligible for premium credits may also qualify for cost-sharing subsidies under H.R. 3962. These subsidies would help lower the cost-sharing required for health care, particularly for Basic plans sold through the Exchange in 2013 and 2014. Individuals eligible for premium credits under H.R. 3962 may also qualify for cost-sharing subsidies. These subsidies would lower the cost-sharing for health care, specifically for Basic plans sold through the Exchange in 2013 and 2014. Starting in 2015, eligible individuals could choose an Enhanced or Premium plan but would not receive cost-sharing credits. Individuals eligible for premium credits under H.R. 3962 must meet specific criteria, including not being enrolled in certain types of health coverage and having a modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) below 400% of the federal poverty level. The premium credit is based on these requirements. The premium credit under H.R. 3962 is based on specific criteria, including not being enrolled in certain health coverage and having a MAGI below 400% of the federal poverty level. The affordable premium amount is determined by income relative to the poverty level, with adjustments made by the Commissioner to maintain consistent government versus enrollee payment percentages in each income tier. For more details, refer to CRS Report R40878. The Commissioner adjusts premium percentages to maintain consistent government versus enrollee payment ratios in each income tier. The \"affordability premium credit\" is based on how much the enrollee's premium exceeds the affordable premium amount. Premium percentage limits are established based on family income. The Commissioner would set premium percentage limits based on family income, with increases on a linear sliding scale. Affordable premium credit would be calculated monthly, and assistance for cost-sharing would be available for those eligible for premium credits in 2013. The Commissioner would adjust cost-sharing amounts and out-of-pocket maximums under a Basic plan to align with specified percentages of covered benefits based on income tiers. The out-of-pocket limits in the table would be doubled for family coverage. The House bill includes provisions to adjust cost-sharing amounts and out-of-pocket limits for family coverage under a Basic plan. Additional amounts would be paid to insurers to cover reduced cost-sharing for credit-eligible individuals. Provisions in the bill aim to raise revenues for expanded health insurance coverage by limiting employer deductions and modifying tax-advantaged accounts for healthcare. The House bill includes provisions to adjust cost-sharing amounts and out-of-pocket limits for family coverage under a Basic plan. Provisions in the bill aim to raise revenues for expanded health insurance coverage by limiting employer deductions and modifying tax-advantaged accounts for healthcare. These provisions are directly related to current health insurance coverage and include limits on employer deductions and modifications to tax-advantaged accounts for health care spending. H.R. 3962 would require employers to coordinate the subsidy and the deduction for retiree prescription drug coverage. The provision in H.R. 3962 would reduce the deduction for retiree prescription drug coverage by the amount of federal subsidy received, raising $2.2 billion over 10 years. Various tax-advantaged accounts and deductions for health care spending would be affected by the revenue provisions in the bill. Health FSAs, HSAs, HRAs, and MSAs allow workers to exclude qualified medical expenses from income taxes. FSAs reimburse employees for health care expenses on a pre-tax basis. Employers can set limits on FSA contributions, with the average contribution being $1,350 in 2008. H.R. 3962 would limit annual FSA contributions to $2,500 per person starting in 2013, indexed to inflation. This provision is estimated to raise $13.3 billion over 10 years. HSAs are tax-advantaged accounts for unreimbursed medical expenses, available to individuals with qualifying high deductible health plans. Unlike FSAs, HSAs have specific eligibility criteria. H.R. 3962 increases the penalty on non-qualified distributions from Health Savings Accounts (HSAs) to 20% of the disbursed amount, raising $1.3 billion over 10 years. Unlike Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs), HSAs allow for rollover of funds and tax-free distributions for qualified medical expenses. H.R. 3962 increases penalty tax on non-qualified distributions from tax-advantaged accounts to 20%, raising $1.3 billion over 10 years. It also modifies the definition of qualified medical expenses, restricting coverage of over-the-counter medications without a physician's prescription. H.R. 3962 prohibits coverage of over-the-counter prescriptions in tax-advantaged accounts without a physician's prescription, increasing revenues by $5.0 billion over 10 years. State laws on abortion coverage and federal conscience protection laws would not be affected by the measure. H.R. 3962 prohibits discrimination against health care entities that do not provide or refer for abortions. It also restricts the recommendation and adoption of certain practices related to abortion. H.R. 3962 prohibits discrimination against health care entities for not providing or referring for abortions. It restricts the adoption of standards related to abortion in the essential benefits package, but allows coverage for abortions in certain cases where federal funds are permitted. The Stupak Amendment, added to H.R. 3962 by a vote of 240-194, imposes restrictions on using funds for abortions unless the woman's life is in danger, or in cases of rape or incest. The Stupak Amendment added to H.R. 3962 restricts the use of funds for abortions to cases where the woman's life is in danger, or in instances of rape or incest. It allows nonfederal entities to purchase separate coverage for elective abortions, but it must be paid for with funds not authorized by H.R. 3962. The Stupak Amendment in H.R. 3962 restricts the use of funds for abortions to cases of danger to the woman's life, rape, or incest. Nonfederal entities can purchase separate coverage for elective abortions, but it must be paid for with funds not authorized by H.R. 3962. Premiums for this coverage must be paid entirely with nonfederal funds, and administrative costs and services must be covered by premiums collected for that specific coverage. The Stupak Amendment in H.R. 3962 restricts abortion funding to cases of danger to the woman's life, rape, or incest. Nonfederal entities can purchase separate coverage for elective abortions using nonfederal funds. Exchange plans cannot discriminate against providers unwilling to offer abortion services. States can receive incentives for implementing alternative medical liability laws compliant with the bill. H.R. 3962 allows states to receive incentives for enacting alternative medical liability laws that meet specific requirements. The Secretary would assess the effectiveness of these laws based on their ability to improve the reliability of the medical liability system, promote the disclosure of healthcare errors, and ensure access to affordable healthcare. The state law incentivizes the improvement of the medical liability system by encouraging the disclosure of healthcare errors and ensuring access to affordable liability insurance. It may include an \"early offer\" system or a \"certificate of merit\" program, without limiting attorneys' fees or imposing caps on damages. An early offer system allows a defendant to offer periodic payments for the claimant's economic losses within 180 days of filing a claim. The state law incentivizes the improvement of the medical liability system through an \"early offer\" system for economic losses and a \"certificate of merit\" program for medical malpractice suits. If an early offer is declined, the claimant can proceed with a tort claim, but the standards of misconduct and proof are raised. The bill proposes a certificate of merit program for medical malpractice suits, requiring testimony from a medical expert to establish claim merit. States receiving incentive payments must use them to improve healthcare. The bill authorizes appropriation for incentive payments but does not provide funds. It clarifies that state laws on legal standards in malpractice cases will not be modified. QHBPs must disseminate related information. The Act would require QHBPs to provide information on end-of-life planning to individuals enrolling in Exchange-participating plans, including options for advance directives and physician's orders for life-sustaining treatment. However, QHBPs are prohibited from promoting suicide, assisted suicide, or the active hastening of death."
