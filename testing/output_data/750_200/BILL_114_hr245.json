    "content": "The text chunk is about the codification of effective dates for claims under the laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. The text chunk provides definitions related to claims for benefits under the laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, including the terms 'claimant', 'claim', and 'formal claim'. The text chunk defines 'formal claim' as a claim submitted on a prescribed application form by the Secretary, and 'informal claim' as a written communication indicating intent to apply for benefits in a format other than the prescribed form. A formal claim is a claim submitted on a prescribed form by the Secretary, while an informal claim is a written communication indicating intent to apply for benefits in a different format. A formal claim must indicate an intent to apply for benefits, identify the benefit sought, be made by an authorized representative, and may include relevant medical reports. The term 'reasonably raised claim' refers to evidence of entitlement to a benefit not explicitly mentioned in a claim but logically placed at issue upon a sympathetic reading of the claim and record. The table of sections in chapter 51 of the title is amended by replacing the item for section 5100 with a new item. Section 5101(a) of title 51 is amended to allow the Secretary to provide an application form for a formal claim upon receipt of an informal claim. Informal requests for claim increase or reopening will be treated the same as formal claims. An informal request for increase or reopening of a claim will be accepted and treated the same as a formal claim. The effective dates for filing an application for benefits have been clarified by the Secretary. The Secretary allows for a 180-day window to file an application for benefits, with the application considered filed on the date it is submitted. The Secretary allows for a 180-day window to file an application for benefits, with the application considered filed on the date it is submitted. Chapter 51 of the title is amended to address reasonably raised claims in the adjudication process. The amendments made by this Act regarding reasonably raised claims will be effective on the date of enactment and apply to claims submitted on or after that date."
