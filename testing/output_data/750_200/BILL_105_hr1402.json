    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Commission on Probabilistic Methods Act\". The Congress recognizes the wide applicability of probabilistic methods in improving process efficiency and reducing overdesign in government programs. Integration of these methods in business practices has saved billions for companies, but Federal use lags behind industry. Probabilistic methods offer better understanding of safety and environmental risks, leading to more business-friendly outcomes. Probabilistic methods can improve understanding of safety and environmental risks, leading to more business-friendly regulations and reduced overdesign costs. Integrating these methods in federally funded design efforts could enhance product specifications and decrease associated costs. Utilizing probabilistic methods in Department of Transportation programs could result in more reliable and cost-effective components of the transportation system. The use of probabilistic methods in transportation system design can lead to more reliable and cost-effective components, benefiting various federal agencies and reducing overdesign costs. The Administrator of the Research and Special Programs Administration of the Department of Transportation will establish the Commission on Probabilistic Methods to improve transportation system design. The Commission on Probabilistic Methods will identify, assess, and evaluate how probabilistic methods can enhance the Department of Transportation's programs and increase public safety. It will also establish guidelines for choosing appropriate probabilistic techniques. The Commission on Probabilistic Methods will recommend guidelines for quantifying uncertainties in Department of Transportation programs, identifying key technology areas, setting reliability levels for public safety, and expediting technology implementation. The Commission on Probabilistic Methods will recommend guidelines for creating required databases, expediting technology transfer, identifying legal and cultural barriers, and institutionalizing the use of probabilistic methods in Department of Transportation programs. The Commission on Probabilistic Methods will recommend guidelines for using probabilistic methods in Department of Transportation programs, institutionalizing values, and evaluating technology through pilot projects. SEC. 5. MEMBERSHIP. The Commission shall consist of 19 members, including a chairperson from an engineering society with experience in probabilistic methods, representatives from higher education, government, industry, labor, environmental community, public interest, and a representative from the Department of Defense appointed by the Secretary of Defense. The Commission consists of 19 members, including a chairperson with experience in probabilistic methods, representatives from various sectors appointed by different departments, and members appointed for life by the Administrator. Vacancies in the Commission will be filled as needed. The Commission consists of 19 members appointed for life, with vacancies filled in the same manner. Members serve without pay but receive travel expenses. A quorum is 10 members, and the initial meeting must occur within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Commission, comprised of 19 members appointed for life, must hold its initial meeting within 180 days of the Act's enactment.
