Congress acknowledges the historical lack of attention to women's health and recognizes obstetrician-gynecologists as crucial providers of primary and preventive care for women throughout their lifetime. Obstetrician-gynecologists play a vital role in providing primary and preventive care for women, managing their overall health beyond just the reproductive system. They refer patients to other physicians less frequently, saving time and costs. More than 20 states have taken steps to promote women's health care. While over 20 states have promoted access to obstetrician-gynecologists for women's health care, patients in some states or federally-governed health plans still face restrictions. SEC. 2.

Group health plans cannot deny women eligibility for coverage to avoid requirements, offer incentives to accept less coverage, or penalize providers for following the regulations. The group health plan must comply with notice requirements and can negotiate reimbursement levels with providers. More protective state laws regarding coverage are not preempted. The group health plan can negotiate reimbursement levels with providers for care provided, and more protective state laws regarding coverage are not preempted.
