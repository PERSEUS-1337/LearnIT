Section 13000 of the Education Code is amended to establish the California Civil Liberties Public Education Act, aimed at educating the public about the historical events of the exclusion, forced removal, and internment of Japanese Americans. The federal Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians (CWRIC) was created by Congress in 1980 to review Executive Order 9066's impact on American citizens and recommend remedies. The CWRIC issued reports in 1983 based on hearings with over 750 witnesses, including evacuees and government officials. The federal Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians (CWRIC) conducted hearings across the country, gathering information from over 750 witnesses, including evacuees, government officials, and historians. The CWRIC concluded that Executive Order 9066 was not justified by military necessity and the decisions that followed were based on race prejudice, war hysteria, and a failure of political leadership. Ignorance about Americans of Japanese descent led to a policy executed in fear and anger at Japan, resulting in a grave personal injustice. The policy of excluding, removing, and detaining Americans of Japanese descent during World War II was a result of widespread ignorance and fear towards Japan, leading to a grave personal injustice. President Ronald Reagan signed the federal Civil Liberties Act of 1988, declaring it a great day for America. Congress also declared their support for the act. The Congress acknowledges the grave injustice done to citizens and residents of Japanese ancestry during WWII, citing racial prejudice and wartime hysteria as main factors. This led to significant damages and losses in education and job training. The Congress apologizes on behalf of the Nation for the significant human suffering and violations of civil liberties and constitutional rights experienced by excluded individuals of Japanese ancestry, who suffered material and intangible damages during WWII.
