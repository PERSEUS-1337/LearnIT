    "content": "Neural networks struggle to generalize transformations beyond their training data, leading to difficulties in extrapolating accurately. A new technique called neuron editing aims to address this issue by learning how neurons encode edits. Neuron editing is a technique that learns how neurons encode edits for transformations in a latent space, allowing for complex data transformations with simpler distribution shifts. It has been showcased in image domain/style transfer and biological applications like removing batch artifacts. Our technique focuses on simplifying distribution shifts in neuron activations for various applications, including image domain/style transfer and biological studies like removing batch artifacts and predicting drug synergy. Experiments in biology often involve studying treatment effects on samples, such as cells and drug administration, with the assumption that effects generalize across contexts. The text proposes a neural network-based method for learning a general edit function corresponding to treatment in a biological setting. It suggests that mathematically modeling the effect and potential interactions with background information would provide a powerful tool to assess how the treatment would generalize beyond the measured samples. The text proposes a neural network-based method for learning a general edit function in a biological setting. It reframes the problem as learning an edit function between pre and post-treatment data versions that could be applied to other datasets. The text proposes learning an edit function, termed neuron editing, in the latent space of an autoencoder neural network with non-linear activations. The autoencoder is trained on the entire population of data to transform pre-treatment and post-treatment samples into abstract features for data reconstruction. The autoencoder's internal layers decompose data into abstract features for accurate reconstruction. Neuron editing extracts differences in activation distributions to generate post-treatment data synthetically, encoding complex edits in meaningful features. Neuron editing involves complex multivariate edits in the ambient space, focusing on the autoencoder to model distribution-to-distribution transformations in high-dimensional space. Neuron editing in high-dimensional space involves non-linear dimensionality reduction by autoencoders to simplify data distribution shifts and allow for context-dependent modeling in neural networks. Neuron editing in high-dimensional space involves computationally efficient distribution shifts and context-dependent modeling in neural networks. Some neurons show drastic changes post-treatment, while others encoding background context have less change but still influence output. Edited neurons interact with data-context-encoding neurons in complex ways, potentially improving treatment prediction. Neuron editing in a low-dimensional internal layer allows for editing on a denoised version of the data, avoiding editing noise and focusing on significant dimensions. This approach may be more predictive of treatment outcomes compared to assuming widespread generalization of results context-free. Neuron editing in the hidden layer of an autoencoder focuses on significant dimensions of the data, avoiding noise. The assumption is that internal neurons have semantic consistency across the data manifold. This is supported by the autoencoder learning a joint manifold of all given data, including pre-and post-treatment samples. Recent results show neural networks prefer learning patterns over memorizing inputs. Neuron editing in the hidden layer of an autoencoder focuses on significant dimensions of the data, avoiding noise. Recent results show that neural networks prefer learning patterns over memorizing inputs. Neuron editing extrapolates better than generative models, producing more complex variation by preserving existing data variation. Comparisons with generation-based approaches show the effectiveness of neuron editing. Neuron editing in hidden layers focuses on significant data dimensions, avoiding noise. Comparisons with generation-based approaches highlight its effectiveness over traditional GANs and CycleGANs. Neuron editing outperforms generative models by preserving existing data variation and producing more complex variations. The text discusses a regularized autoencoder that performs internal layer transformations during training, with the decoder undoing the transformation to reconstruct the input. It also introduces the neuron editing method and discusses the extrapolation problem in natural image domain transfer. Two biological applications of extrapolation are highlighted: correcting artificial variability introduced by measuring instruments (batch effects) and predicting the combined effects of multiple drug treatments (combinatorial drug effects). The text discusses using GANs to learn a transformation that aligns distributions between source and target sets, with the transformation being piecewise linear. However, GAN optimization does not produce transformations that behave comparably on both source and extrapolation sets. The text discusses using GANs to learn a transformation that aligns distributions between source and target sets, with the transformation being piecewise linear. Instead of learning this transformation directly, a transformation is defined in a learned space using an encoder/decoder pair to map data into an abstract neuron space with high-level features. The text introduces NeuronEdit, a piecewise linear transformation applied to activations from internal layers of a neural network for inputs from different sets. This transformation aligns distributions by modifying percentiles of activations independently for each neuron in the layer. NeuronEdit is a piecewise linear transformation that operates independently on each neuron in a neural network layer. It aligns distributions by modifying percentiles of activations based on the difference between source and target distributions. NeuronEdit is a piecewise linear transformation that aligns distributions by modifying percentiles of activations based on the difference between source and target distributions. The transformation is applied to neuron activations through the encoder and decoder without further training. The encoder computes internal layer activations, which are then cascaded through the decoder without additional training. This transforms the output, turning the autoencoder into a generative model. Training a GAN in this setup can exclusively utilize the data. Transforming an autoencoder into a generative model can be done exclusively on inference, without needing to be close to the identity. Neuron editing can model the intrinsic variation in X in an unsupervised manner, providing more information as X differs substantially from S. GANs are difficult to train due to oscillating optimization dynamics and uninterpretable losses. GANs are notoriously tricky to train, with adversarial discriminators suffering from oscillating optimization dynamics, uninterpretable losses, and mode collapse. Mode collapse occurs when the discriminator cannot distinguish between real and fake examples, leading to the generator producing similar outputs regardless of input variation. The discriminator struggles to detect differences in real and fake distributions, leading to the generator favoring ellipsoid output over natural variability. Neuron editing with an autoencoder avoids these issues by isolating variation in neuron activations for easier generation. Neuron editing with an autoencoder isolates variation in neuron activations for easier generation, similar to word2vec embeddings in natural language processing. This allows for meaningful transformations in a latent space, enabling extrapolation from one example to predict locations for another example. Neuron editing extends word2vec's vector arithmetic by transforming entire distributions instead of single points. It is compared to generating methods like regularized autoencoder, standard GAN, ResnetGAN, and CycleGAN. The regularized autoencoder penalizes differences in distributions using maximal mean discrepancy BID0 BID8. The regularized autoencoder penalized differences in distributions of the source and target using maximal mean discrepancy BID0 BID8. The image experiment utilized convolutional layers with specific filters and fully connected layers for other models. Training involved minibatches, the adam optimizer, and a learning rate of 0.001. A motivational experiment was conducted on the CelebA dataset to learn transformations on images. In a motivational experiment on the CelebA dataset, a generative model was trained to transform images of people with black hair to blond hair. However, the model could only apply the change to images similar to those in the training set, unable to generalize to new images. The GAN models trained on the CelebA dataset struggled to generalize the transformation of changing black hair to blond hair to new images, particularly failing to accurately recreate the input in areas other than hair color. The regular GAN model struggles to accurately recreate input transformations, especially in changing hair color, due to training difficulties and artifacts. Neuron editing in the internal layer of a neural network is preferred over other latent spaces like PCA for complex transformations like changing hair color. Neuron editing in a neural network's internal layer is effective for complex transformations like changing hair color. It can decompose abstract changes into simple linear shifts. Another application is batch correction to address differences in data caused by technical artifacts. Batch effects are a common issue in biological experimental data, leading to varying datasets when measuring the same sample multiple times. These effects can confound true differences between samples and hinder data combination or result in incorrect conclusions. Various models, including deep learning methods, aim to address batch effects. One approach involves repeatedly measuring a control set of cells with each sample to correct for variations. The issue of batch effects in biological experimental data can be addressed by repeatedly measuring a control set of cells with each sample to correct for variations. This approach involves choosing a source/target pair (Control1/Control2) and extrapolating to Sample1, allowing for comparison with raw Sample2 cells. This method can help remove variation induced by the measurement process, especially in complex data distributions. The dataset analyzed in this section is from a mass cytometry experiment measuring proteins in cells of two individuals infected with dengue virus. The data includes 35 dimensions with varying numbers of observations in Control1, Control2, Sample1, and Sample2. Technical artifacts and biological differences contribute to variation between the two samples. The dataset from a mass cytometry experiment shows variation between Control1 and Sample1 due to technical artifacts and biological differences. An artificial batch effect in Control1 affects the protein InfG levels, while the higher CCR6 levels in Sample1 are a true biological difference. GANs were not trained to generate cells with high CCR6, leading to their removal in the analysis. The GANs in the analysis remove variation in cells with high CCR6 levels, mapping most cells to the same low values of CCR6 and InfG. This results in a loss of information and misrepresentation of the data. The ResnetGAN does not address this issue due to the generation objective specifications. The ResnetGAN does not fix the issue of removing variation in cells with high CCR6 levels, as it only encourages output similar to the target distribution. The regularized autoencoder undoes transformations to its latent space, producing unchanged data. Neuron editing decomposes variability into controls and edits the sample accordingly. Neuron editing decomposes variability into controls, removes batch effects, and preserves real variation. It successfully transforms proteins InfG and CCR6 accurately across all dimensions. The results confirm the accuracy of neuron editing globally across all dimensions, as shown in a PCA embedding of the data space. The transformation from Control1 to Control2 mirrors that applied to Sample1, preserving intra-sample variation. The variation between controls corresponds accurately to the variation introduced by neuron editing in the sample. These assessments offer additional confirmation that the transformations reflect the editing process. The global assessments confirm the accuracy of neuron editing in reflecting transformations in the data space. Biological data from a combinatorial drug experiment on cells from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia is analyzed, with a focus on batch correction. In a combinatorial drug experiment on cells from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, neuron editing corrects batch effects in IFNg while preserving biological variation in CCR6 under different treatments. GANs attempt to remove all sources of variation but only partially succeed due to out-of-sample input. Autoencoder does not move the data. Measurements are from mass cytometry in 41 dimensions across four treatment groups. In a combinatorial drug experiment on cells from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, measurements from mass cytometry in 41 dimensions across four treatment groups show the effects of applying Dasatinib (Das) on cells treated with Bez-235 (Bez). Applying Das results in a decrease in p4EBP1 but no change in pSTATS. The effect of applying Das is a decrease in p4EBP1 without changing pSTATS. Neuron editing accurately models this change without introducing vertical shifts. The regularized autoencoder does not alter the output despite internal manipulations. GAN models do not accurately predict the real combination, introducing vertical shifts and losing original variability within-Bez dataset. Despite residual connections, the ResnetGAN model still struggles to replicate target data, as GANs fail to learn the appropriate transformation, introducing vertical shifts and losing original variability within-Bez dataset. Neuron editing better predicts transformation across all dimensions and preserves variation in real data, unlike GANs which generate data with less variance. Neuron editing better preserves variation in real data by applying treatment effects to the dataset, inspired by biological experimental settings. This approach addresses the problem of generating transformed data based on observed pre-and post-transformation versions of a subset of available data, relevant for clinical trials and generalizing treatment effects beyond the subset. Neuron editing utilizes autoencoder latent layers to apply treatment effects to data, mimicking transformations in internal layer encodings for realistic changes in image and biological data. The use of an internal layer allows for more realistic transformations of image data and predicts synergistic effects of drug treatments in biological data. Learning complex data transformations in a hidden layer enables interactions between edits and context information during decoding. Future work could involve training parallel encoders with the same decoder or training for conditional generation."
