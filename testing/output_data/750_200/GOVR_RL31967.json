    "content": "The statutory debt limit applies to federal debt held by the public and by the government's own accounts, including federal trust funds like Social Security and Medicare. Government surpluses or deficits determine changes in debt held by the public, while the on-budget fiscal balance does not directly affect debt held in government accounts. Since the late 1950s, the federal government has increased borrowing from the public in most years, except for FY1969 and FY1998-FY2001. Government debt held in accounts like the Social Security Trust Fund is influenced by legal requirements, government accounting practices, and financial flows. Federal budget deficits have led to increased issuance of debt. The federal government has increased borrowing from the public in most years, except for FY1969 and FY1998-FY2001. The accumulation of Social Security and other trust funds led to sustained growth in government-held debt subject to limit, requiring Congress to raise the debt limit periodically. Issues with the debt limit since 2011 are discussed in more detail in CRS Report R43389. Since 2011, Congress has had to raise the debt limit periodically due to issues with federal debt reaching its legal limit. The government's finances fluctuate throughout the year, impacting the level of debt, even with trust fund accounts experiencing deficits at times. The government's ability to borrow is crucial for managing fluctuations in federal revenues and outlays. If the U.S. Treasury were unable to borrow due to a debt limit, it would struggle to meet all of its legal obligations in a timely manner. The government may face challenges meeting legal obligations if unable to borrow due to a debt limit, impacting cash flow and investment of surpluses in federal trust funds. The Treasury faces challenges meeting legal obligations due to the debt limit, hindering its ability to borrow and pay debts on time. Delays in debt limit increases could have serious negative consequences for the Treasury market and increase borrowing costs, potentially leading to a default with global economic repercussions. Delaying payments on Treasury securities could lead to default and have serious repercussions for economies and financial markets worldwide. This could be avoided by delaying other federal payments, effectively borrowing from various entities. Interest penalties may be incurred for late payments under statutes like the Prompt Payment Act and the Internal Revenue Code. The U.S. Treasury facing difficulties in funding federal obligations could have severe consequences for the financial system and global economy. Concerns have been raised by credit ratings agencies and investment banks about the potential risks of default on Treasury securities. Treasury Secretaries have historically taken measures to address near-binding debt ceilings to avoid such scenarios. If the U.S. Treasury faces difficulties in funding federal obligations, it could have significant effects on global capital markets. Past Treasury Secretaries have used special strategies to manage cash and debt responsibilities during near-binding debt ceilings, such as suspending debt sales and withholding certain government trust fund receipts. The Treasury Secretary has the authority to use these strategies, including the Civil Service Retirement Fund and the Thrift Savings Fund, and can make those funds whole after the debt eases. The U.S. Treasury used special strategies during near-binding debt ceilings, such as suspending debt sales and selling off mortgage-backed securities to manage cash and debt responsibilities. The pace of MBS sales was targeted at $10 billion per month to minimize market disruptions. The U.S. Treasury eliminated its portfolio of mortgage-backed securities (MBSs) acquired in late 2008 by selling them at a pace of $10 billion per month to avoid market disruptions. However, proceeds from other asset sales may not be sufficient to manage debt operations effectively without an increase in the debt limit. Some suggest invoking the Fourteenth Amendment (Section 4) as a solution. The U.S. Treasury sold off its mortgage-backed securities to avoid market disruptions, but other asset sales may not be enough to manage debt operations without increasing the debt limit. Suggestions to use the Fourteenth Amendment to bypass debt ceiling constraints have been rejected by President Obama and legal analysts. Innovative strategies have been proposed to address the issue of managing federal debt near its statutory limit. The federal government must take extraordinary measures when the debt is near its limit, causing inconvenience and uncertainty. The debt limit allows Congress to control spending and imposes fiscal accountability. The debt limit imposes fiscal accountability on Congress and the President to control spending, reflecting a national devotion to thrift. Some experts argue that the debt limit is outdated due to other controls in the modern budget process. The modern congressional budget process established in 1974 has superseded the debt limit, which does little to alter spending and revenue policies determining the federal deficit size. The Obama Administration proposed allowing debt limit increases subject to congressional disapproval, providing a different leverage compared to the budget process. Committees on Appropriations handle discretionary spending, while authorizing committees make decisions on mandatory program spending. The Committees on Appropriations oversee discretionary spending, authorizing committees handle mandatory program spending decisions, and Committees on the Budget draft an overall budget framework. Measures involving the debt limit provide individual Members with a separate tool to influence fiscal policy. Congress has historically imposed restrictions on federal debt to assert its constitutional powers. Between World War I and World War II, Congress evolved statutory restrictions on federal debt into an aggregate limit that applied to nearly all outstanding debt. Before World War I, borrowing was often authorized for specific purposes, with Congress specifying details such as financial instruments, interest rates, and maturities. Between World War I and World War II, Congress established statutory restrictions on federal debt, evolving into an aggregate limit that applied to almost all outstanding debt. Congress specified details for borrowing purposes, including financial instruments, interest rates, and maturities. Treasury was granted discretion in some cases, with concerns raised about the impact on monetary policies. Proponents argued that federal borrowing would not disrupt monetary settlements, which became irrelevant after the establishment of the Federal Reserve System in 1913. The War Revenue Act of 1898 allowed the Treasury to issue certificates of indebtedness for short-term borrowing and cash management. The act granted the Treasury Secretary authority to have $100 million outstanding in certificates with maturities under a year, mainly sold to large investors, banks, and financial institutions. The War Revenue Act of 1898 allowed the Treasury to issue certificates of indebtedness for short-term borrowing, mainly sold to large investors, banks, and financial institutions. The act also permitted the Treasury to issue $400 million in longer-term notes and bonds for public subscription, giving smaller investors a chance to participate. The Second Liberty Bond Act of 1917, which helped finance World War I, expanded the Treasury Secretary's administrative leeway by dropping certain limits on bond maturity and redemption. The Second Liberty Bond Act of 1917, which financed the US entry into World War I, removed limits on bond maturity and redemption. It also utilized unused borrowing capacity from previous acts and retained separate limits for previous debt issues. Amendments to the act were made until 1982, shaping debt policy. The Second Liberty Bond Act of 1917 shaped debt policy by allowing amendments to be made until 1982. Congress provided Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon with more flexibility in the 1920s to replace expensive federal debt with cheaper new issues, including the issuance of notes. Treasury was allowed to issue notes and limited the amount outstanding, giving greater flexibility to roll over debt. Savings certificates were also introduced. In the 1930s, Congress implemented aggregate constraints on federal borrowing to give the Treasury more flexibility in managing debt. Treasury Secretary Mellon emphasized the importance of allowing the Treasury Department to have freedom in determining the type of securities for refinancing Liberty bonds. In the 1930s, Congress granted the U.S. Treasury greater flexibility in issuing bonds, allowing the Treasury Department to determine the type of securities without arbitrary limitations. Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau proposed replacing a limit on bond issuance with a more flexible limit on outstanding bonds, emphasizing the role of Treasury bonds in managing federal finances. Congress then established a $20 billion limit on shorter-term debt. In the 1930s, Congress granted the U.S. Treasury greater flexibility in issuing bonds, allowing the Treasury Department to determine the type of securities without arbitrary limitations. Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau proposed replacing a limit on bond issuance with a more flexible limit on outstanding bonds. Congress established a $20 billion limit on shorter-term debt and a $25 billion limit on outstanding bonds. President Franklin Roosevelt and Secretary Morgenthau asked Congress to eliminate separate limits on bonds and other types of debt. The law created the first aggregate limit of $45 billion. The law (P.L. 76-201) created the first aggregate limit of $45 billion covering nearly all public debt in the Senate after the House had disagreed, enabling the Treasury to manage federal debt more effectively by issuing debt instruments with maturities that reduce interest costs and minimize financial risks. The Treasury could issue debt instruments with maturities to reduce interest costs and minimize financial risks. In 1941, legislation increased the aggregate debt limit to $65 billion, folding the separate $4 billion limit for \"National Defense\" series securities. This greater independence of action was granted on the eve of the United States' entry into World War II, with the debt limit closer to total federal debt than after World War I. The federal debt limit was raised to $43 billion in 1919, significantly higher than the total federal debt of $25.5 billion. In 1939, the debt limit was set at $45 billion, only slightly above the total federal debt of $40.4 billion. During World War II, the debt ceiling was raised annually until it reached $300 billion in 1945. After the war, the limit was reduced to $275 billion and remained unchanged until 1954 due to the Korean War being financed on a pay-as-you-go basis. In 1954, the debt limit was temporarily increased after remaining at $275 billion since the Korean War. Congress declined further increases until 1957, citing the need for better financial management. The limit reached $300 billion in 1962, the level at the end of World War II. In March 1962, the debt limit reached $300 billion, its level at the end of World War II. Congress has enacted 78 measures altering the federal debt limit, with recent increases being significant, such as a $1.9 trillion increase in February 2010. During FY1998-FY2001, federal debt held by intergovernmental accounts grew by $855 billion while debt held by the public fell. Since FY1998-FY2001, federal debt held by intergovernmental accounts grew by $855 billion, while debt held by the public fell by almost $450 billion. However, since FY2001, debt held by the public has grown due to persistent budget deficits. Debt held in government accounts has also increased, mainly due to excess Social Security payroll taxes. Table 1 and Figure 1 illustrate the components of federal debt in current dollars and as percentages of GDP from FY1996 to FY2014. Administration projections are included. Federal debt has been steadily increasing since FY1996, with debt held by government accounts growing due to Social Security tax increases. Debt held by the public has also grown as a share of GDP, especially after deficits shrank from FY1998 through FY2001. Table 2 provides details on debt limit increases from 1993 to 2014. Debt held by the public increased as a share of GDP through the mid-1990s, but shrank after FY1992. Surpluses from FY1998 to FY2001, along with rapid GDP growth, reduced the debt. However, deficits reemerged in FY2002, leading to an increase in debt as a percentage of GDP. This accumulation of debt in government accounts added pressure on the debt limit in early 2002. In FY2002, deficits reemerged, increasing debt held by the public and adding pressure on the debt limit. Between FY1998-FY2001, total debt subject to limit increased by $405 billion. By the beginning of FY2002, debt subject to limit was $217 billion away from the $5,950 billion debt limit. From October 1, 2001, to the end of May 2002, debt subject to limit increased by $217 billion, split between debt held by government accounts and debt held by the public. In FY2002, the debt subject to limit increased by $217 billion, with $117 billion in debt held by government accounts and $100 billion in debt held by the public, nearing the $5,950 billion limit. The Administration requested Congress to raise the debt limit by $750 billion to $6,700 billion due to a deteriorating budget outlook and growing debt. The Administration repeatedly asked Congress to increase the debt limit as it approached $5,950 billion in FY2002. On April 4, 2002, the Treasury avoided reaching the limit by suspending reinvestment in the G-Fund of the federal employees' Thrift Savings Plan. This allowed the Treasury to issue new debt and meet obligations. By April 15, debt subject to limit was just $25 million below the limit. After tax revenues came in, the Treasury restored the G-Fund by repaying the debt. The Treasury avoided reaching the debt limit by suspending reinvestment in the G-Fund of the federal employees' Thrift Savings Plan. After tax revenues came in, the Treasury restored the G-Fund by repaying the debt, bringing the debt subject to limit back below the statutory limit. Treasury used its statutory authority to avoid default for the second time in 2002. The Treasury avoided default by using its statutory authority for the second time in 2002. They requested Congress to raise the debt limit due to financing problems. If not done, the government would exceed the debt ceiling by May 16, leading to a debt issuance suspension period. This would allow the Treasury to suspend or redeem investments in trust funds for operational flexibility. The Treasury's suspension period, starting no later than May 16 [2002], allows for the redemption of investments in trust funds to fund government operations. By replacing federal debt with non-interest-bearing instruments, the Treasury can issue new debt to meet obligations until at least June 28, 2002. If the debt limit is not increased by then, further actions will be necessary to avoid breaching the ceiling. The Treasury postponed a securities auction and warned of exhausting options to issue debt, risking default. Congress took steps to increase the debt limit in May and June 2002. The House passed a bill allowing a debt limit increase in the FY2002 supplemental appropriations bill, but the Senate omitted this language. Instead, the Senate passed a separate bill to raise the debt limit by $450 billion to $6,400 billion. The Senate passed a bill (S. 2578) to raise the debt limit by $450 billion to $6,400 billion, avoiding a default crisis. The House had previously passed the same increase by a single vote. The President signed the bill into law (P.L. 107-199) on June 28, 2002. In late February 2003, Kenneth Dam requested an increase in the debt limit as it was nearing the $6,400 billion mark. The Treasury repeatedly urged Congress to raise the limit to avoid financial issues. By February 20, 2003, measures were taken to manage debt holdings and prevent reaching the limit. The Treasury took actions to manage debt holdings in certain government accounts to avoid reaching the debt limit. These actions allowed for additional debt issuance to acquire cash needed for government commitments. The adoption of the FY2004 budget resolution triggered the \"Gephardt rule.\" The adoption of the FY2004 budget resolution triggered the \"Gephardt rule\" in the House, which raised the debt limit to accommodate approved spending levels. The Senate received the debt-limit legislation on April 11 but did not act until May 23, when the debt was $25 million below the existing limit of $6,400 billion. The Senate adopted legislation to raise the debt limit to $7,384 billion, signed by the President on May 27. In January 2004, CBO estimated reaching the debt limit the following summer. Treasury requested Congress to raise the limit in June 2004 to avoid financial disruptions. In August and September, Treasury warned of reaching the limit in October. On October 14, debt was close to the limit. In October, the Treasury warned that the debt limit would be reached soon, with debt close to $7,383,975 million. Secretary of the Treasury John Snow informed Congress that measures to avoid breaching the limit would be exhausted by mid-November, risking the government's ability to meet obligations. The Treasury warned in October that the debt limit would be reached soon, risking the government's ability to meet obligations by mid-November. Without an increase in the debt limit, the Treasury would be unable to meet all existing obligations, potentially undermining the U.S. government's reputation in capital markets and raising costs of federal borrowing. The House passed a budget resolution for FY2005 in spring 2004 but did not reach final agreement with the Senate, leading to no resolution to raise the debt limit being passed automatically under the Gephardt rule. The House passed a budget resolution for FY2005 in spring 2004 but did not reach final agreement with the Senate, leading to no resolution to raise the debt limit being passed automatically under the Gephardt rule. Consequently, no measure was available to send to the Senate. In September 2004, the House added an amendment to the FY2005 Transportation-Treasury appropriations in an effort to remove the Treasury's flexibility in financing the government as federal debt approached and reached the existing limit. The legislation cleared the House, but the Senate did not act on it. Senator Frist introduced legislation after the elections to address the debt limit issue. After the House passed a budget resolution for FY2005 in spring 2004, no agreement was reached with the Senate on raising the debt limit. Senator Frist introduced legislation to increase the debt limit by $800 billion, which was approved by the Senate and House in November 2004. The President signed the legislation into law, anticipating the new limit to be reached between August and December 2005. Treasury delayed a debt auction before the increase in the debt limit. In 2005, the debt limit increase was less dramatic than in previous years. Congress included reconciliation instructions in the FY2006 budget resolution, allowing the Treasury to reschedule a debt auction and cancel a \"debt limit suspension period.\" In 2005, reconciliation instructions in the FY2006 budget resolution directed committees to report bills raising the debt limit to $8,965 billion by September 30, 2005. However, no bills were reported. The adoption of the conference report triggered the Gephardt rule, leading to a House Joint Resolution (H.J.Res. 47) to raise the debt limit by $781 billion. The Gephardt rule was triggered by the adoption of the conference report, leading to a House Joint Resolution (H.J.Res. 47) to raise the debt limit by $781 billion to $8,965 billion. The resolution was automatically deemed passed by the House and sent to the Senate. Secretary of the Treasury Snow informed Congress in December 2005 that the debt limit would likely be reached in mid-February 2006. In December 2005, Secretary Snow informed Congress that the debt limit would be reached in mid-February 2006. He requested an increase in the debt limit and took measures to avoid reaching it until mid-March. The Treasury used actions like declaring a debt issuance suspension period. By March 13, the government was close to being unable to meet its obligations. In March 2006, the Senate passed a debt limit increase (P.L. 109-182) to $8,965 billion. In May 2007, Congress passed the FY2008 budget resolution. The House's Gephardt rule triggered the automatic engrossment of a joint resolution (H.J.Res. 43, 110th Congress) raising the debt limit. In July 2007, the Treasury requested Congress to raise the debt limit as it was projected to be reached in October 2007. The CBO Director later estimated it would be reached in late October or early November. Without an increase, the Treasury would take steps to avoid exceeding the limit. The Senate Finance Committee approved the House resolution (H.J.Res. 43). The Treasury planned to avoid exceeding the debt limit by taking legal steps. The Senate Finance Committee approved resolution H.J.Res. 43 on September 12, 2007, which was later passed by the Senate and signed by the President on September 29, 2007 (P.L. 110-91). Financial markets showed signs of turmoil in mid-2007, leading to a serious crisis in 2008 and a recession lasting until 2009. Federal actions were taken to stabilize the housing and financial markets during this economic slowdown. The economic slowdown in 2008 led to federal actions to stabilize housing and financial markets. Major financial institutions became reluctant to lend, prompting measures to unfreeze credit markets and boost consumption. This resulted in large deficits and increased federal spending, with the federal deficit peaking at 9.8% of GDP. The economic slowdown in 2008 led to federal actions to stabilize housing and financial markets, resulting in large deficits and increased federal spending. The federal deficit peaked at 9.8% of GDP, with deficits declining since FY2009. The economic recovery has been weak compared to other post-World War II recessions, impacting federal revenues from capital gains taxes, corporate taxes, and individual income taxes. Unemployment insurance and income support programs act as \"automatic stabilizers\" during economic recessions. Boosting the economy through deficit spending provides a fiscal stimulus if output levels are below potential, but can lead to inflation if output is near potential. Deficit spending also exacerbates long-term fiscal challenges. Unemployment insurance and income support programs increase federal spending during economic downturns. Accelerating inflation near potential output levels exacerbates long-term fiscal challenges. CBO estimated deficits in FY2008 and FY2009, with actual deficits exceeding projections. The federal debt limit was raised multiple times in response to economic conditions and government actions. House Concurrent Resolution on the Budget recommended policies to address these challenges. During the recession, the federal debt limit was raised multiple times in 2008 and 2009 due to increased spending levels recommended by budget resolutions. The total debt was projected to reach $10,278 billion in FY2009, requiring an increase in the statutory debt limit. In FY2009, the budget conference report passed the Senate and House, creating legislation to increase the debt limit to $10,615 billion. However, the Senate did not take up the legislation, so the debt limit remained at $9,815 billion. The House passed an amended version of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, increasing the debt limit to $10,615 billion. The Senate and President also approved the bill, which included provisions for mortgage guarantee agencies and the creation of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 increased the debt limit to $10,615 billion and created the Federal Housing Finance Agency. The act also provided a line of credit to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, with a potential cost to taxpayers estimated at over $100 billion. The Senate passed H.R. 3221 with a debt limit of $9,815 billion. Concerns arose about the Treasury Secretary's ability to support Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae without an increase in the debt limit. FHFA placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in conservatorship, giving full control to FHFA. The federal government acted to stabilize financial markets after deprivatizing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The U.S. Treasury proposed to Congress to authorize the Treasury Secretary to buy mortgage-related assets. The government proposed a plan to stabilize financial markets by allowing the Treasury Secretary to buy mortgage-related assets up to $700 billion. Representative Barney Frank's amendment to raise the debt limit was rejected by the House on September 29, 2008. The Treasury proposal aimed to raise the debt limit to $11,315 billion, which was eventually approved by the Senate and signed into law on October 3, 2008. Congress also considered an economic stimulus measure involving tax cuts and spending increases, leading to a higher deficit. Congress is considering another economic stimulus measure with tax cuts and spending increases that will increase the deficit. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 included a provision to raise the debt limit to $12,140 billion, which was passed by the House and Senate in February 2009. The ARRA agreement was passed by Congress in February 2009, increasing the debt limit to $12,104 billion. The budget resolution recommended policies leading to a debt limit of $13,233 billion in FY2010, triggering the Gephardt rule and producing a House Joint Resolution. In April 2009, the adoption of a conference report triggered the Gephardt rule, leading to a House Joint Resolution (H.J.Res. 45) raising the debt limit to $13,029 billion. In August 2009, Treasury Secretary Geithner warned Congress of reaching the debt limit in mid-October, but the Treasury later announced a possible delay until December. Treasury reduced its balance sheet by $185 billion. The Treasury announced a possible delay in reaching the federal debt limit until December by reducing its balance sheet by $185 billion. The Obama Administration considered scaling back the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) to lower federal debt subject to the statutory limit. Repayments of TARP funds by major financial institutions could also reduce the debt amount. The Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and other measures could lower federal debt subject to the statutory limit. Repayments of TARP funds by major financial institutions could also reduce the debt amount. The U.S. Treasury was scheduled to issue nonmarketable securities and make interest payments, which could have posed challenges without a debt limit increase. On December 31, interest payments totaling about $100 billion were made to federal trust funds, potentially challenging Treasury's debt management activities without a debt limit increase. House Members opted for a smaller debt limit increase to allow normal operations for two months. H.R. 4314 raised the debt limit to $12,394 billion, passing the House on a 218-214 vote. H.R. 4314 was introduced to raise the debt limit to $12,394 billion and passed by the House and Senate in December 2009. An amended version was passed by the Senate to raise the debt ceiling to $14,294 billion, along with an amendment for PAYGO restrictions. Some Members of Congress proposed a national commission to address federal debt and fiscal issues. Some Members of Congress proposed a national commission to address federal debt and fiscal issues, but an amendment to establish a \"Bipartisan Task Force for Responsible Fiscal Action\" failed to reach the required votes. President Obama then charged a National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform with identifying policies to improve the fiscal situation in the medium and long term. The Fiscal Commission issued a report on December 1, 2010, and the House approved H.J.Res. 45 on February 4, forwarding the measure to the President who signed it on February 12, 2010. The 2011 debt limit episode was resolved by the Budget Control Act of 2011. The 2011 debt limit episode was resolved by the Budget Control Act of 2011, reinstating caps on spending. Treasury Secretary Geithner announced measures to extend borrowing capacity until August 2, 2011. The U.S. Treasury confirmed on July 1, 2011, that its borrowing authority would be exhausted by August 2, 2011. Extraordinary measures used in the past may not provide as much time due to the large federal deficit. Cutting spending to slow the growth of federal debt was suggested as a solution. The U.S. Treasury announced on July 15, 2011, that it had suspended reinvestment in the Exchange Stabilization Fund, one of the last available extraordinary measures before its borrowing authority would be exhausted on August 2. The scale of required spending reductions to avoid an increase in the debt limit was significant, equaling total discretionary spending for the last five months of FY2011. The U.S. Treasury may have less headroom for cash management than previously anticipated, with funding federal operations becoming increasingly complicated without a debt limit increase. An independent analysis projects that cash inflows from August 3 onwards would be $174.4 billion, $134.3 billion less than projected outflows of $306.7 billion. Cash inflows from August 3 onwards are estimated to be $174.4 billion, $134.3 billion less than projected outflows of $306.7 billion. Treasury's debt limit projections have shifted since January 6, 2011. Higher individual income tax revenues and sales of mortgage-backed securities have helped increase headroom between federal debt and its limit. Estimates show that Treasury's debt limit projections have shifted, with sales of mortgage-backed securities providing additional headroom. The Treasury Secretary warned of a potential debt issuance suspension period starting on May 16 if Congress did not act beforehand. The Treasury Secretary warned of a potential debt issuance suspension period starting on May 16, 2011, unless Congress acted beforehand. Extraordinary measures, such as the draw-down of the Supplementary Financing Program (SFP) and suspension of new issues of State and Local Government Series (SLGS) Treasury securities, were taken to extend Treasury's borrowing capacity until early August 2011. The Treasury Secretary requested an increase in the debt limit as federal debt was projected to reach its statutory limit between March and May 2011. New issues of State and Local Government Series Treasury securities were suspended to provide additional headroom under the limit. The borrowing capacity was expected to be exhausted by July 8, 2011. The U.S. Treasury projected reaching its borrowing limit between April 15 and May 31, 2011. A bill to raise the debt limit to $16,700 billion was introduced on May 24 but was defeated in a House vote on May 31, 2011. The Cut, Cap, and Balance Act of 2011 was passed by the House on July 19, 2011, but was tabled by the Senate on July 22. The Budget Control Act of 2011 raised the federal debt limit to $16,700 billion and included a balanced budget amendment proposal. It was signed into law by President Obama on August 2, 2011, after approval by the House and Senate, eliminating the need for further debt limit increases until early 2013. The Budget Control Act of 2011 was approved by the House and Senate in August 2011, eliminating the need for further debt limit increases until early 2013. It included provisions for deficit reduction, discretionary spending caps, automatic spending reductions, and the establishment of a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction. The Budget Control Act of 2011 established a Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction and allowed for the President and Treasury Secretary to raise the debt ceiling. The debt limit was increased in two steps, first by $400 billion and then by $500 billion. In 2011, the debt limit was increased twice, first by $400 billion and then by $500 billion, following the President's certification. The second increase was subject to a joint resolution of disapproval, which was rejected by the Senate. The House passed a disapproval measure, but the Senate did not act on it. In late December 2011, the debt limit came close to its statutory limit, prompting the President to delay a $1.2 trillion increase that required a joint resolution of disapproval from Congress. This increase could also have been triggered by a balanced budget amendment or a debt limit increase of $1.5 trillion. The debt limit increase of $1.5 trillion could have been permitted through a balanced budget amendment or recommendations from the Super Committee. However, both options failed to reach the required thresholds in Congress. The debt limit increase of $1.2 trillion matched budget reductions planned through sequestration and related mechanisms over the FY2013-FY2021 period, as the Super Committee failed to agree on recommendations. This summarizes debt limit policy developments after 2011. The debt limit was increased by $1.2 trillion to match budget reductions planned through sequestration over the FY2013-FY2021 period. Treasury Secretary Geithner used extraordinary measures until mid-February to mid-March 2013. The House passed H.R. 325 to suspend the debt limit until May 19, 2013, and the Senate approved it on January 31, leading to it being signed into law on February 4 (P.L. 113-3). On May 19, 2013, the House passed a measure to suspend the debt limit, which was then signed into law on February 4. The U.S. Treasury reset the debt limit to $16,699 billion after the suspension lapsed on May 18, 2013. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew notified of the reset on May 20, 2013. In 2013, after the debt limit suspension expired, Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew declared a new debt issuance suspension period due to debt being close to the limit. He sent notices to Congress with updated forecasts, pushing back the expected exhaustion date of borrowing capacity. Strong revenue collections and special dividends from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac contributed to this delay. Due to stronger revenue collections and special dividends from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the debt limit exhaustion date was pushed back. Congress passed a resolution on October 17, 2013, suspending the debt limit until February 8, 2014, ending the government shutdown that began on October 1. After the debt limit suspension ended on February 7, 2014, Congress quickly addressed the issue by approving a measure to suspend the debt limit until March 15, 2015. The President signed the measure (P.L. 113-83) on February 15, 2014. After the debt limit suspension ended on February 7, 2014, Congress approved a measure to suspend the debt limit until March 15, 2015. The President signed the measure (P.L. 113-83) on February 15, 2014. The limit was reestablished at $18,113 billion on March 16, 2015. Treasury Secretary Lew invoked extraordinary measures to manage the debt until the end of October 2015. Treasury Secretary Lew utilized extraordinary measures to handle the debt limit until the end of October 2015. He mentioned that these measures would allow the Treasury to meet financial obligations for a brief period after October. By October 15, 2015, Secretary Lew projected that the extraordinary measures would be depleted by November 3, 2015, with a small cash reserve of less than $30 billion available. This was due to lower tax collections and higher trust fund investments impacting the Treasury's financial headroom. Treasury Secretary Lew used extraordinary measures to handle the debt limit until the end of October 2015. Lower tax collections and higher trust fund investments reduced Treasury's headroom more than expected. Projections initially suggested funds would last until November or early December 2015, but more recent estimates in September 2015 indicated mid-November. On October 26, 2015, a \"Bipartisan Budget Agreement\" was released, addressing fiscal issues including the debt limit. On October 26, 2015, a \"Bipartisan Budget Agreement\" was released, addressing fiscal issues including the debt limit. The agreement reset the debt limit on March 16, 2017, and increased statutory caps on discretionary spending for FY2016 and FY2017. The House concurred with Senate amendments on October 28, 2015. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (BBA 2015) was approved by the Senate and signed into law by the President on November 2, 2015. It aimed to address fiscal issues, reset the debt limit, and increase discretionary spending for FY2016 and FY2017. The federal government had previously run budget surpluses from FY1998 to FY2001, reducing its debt. The budget forecasts initially projected large surpluses, leading to a rapid reduction in public debt. However, the surpluses turned into deficits due to increased military and security spending post-9/11, rising nondefense outlays, tax reductions, and the financial crisis of 2007-2009. The financial crisis of 2007-2009 and subsequent recession led to large federal deficits, accelerating total debt growth and necessitating debt limit increases. Direct fiscal costs of a crisis are overshadowed by reduced tax revenues and increased social safety net benefits. The 2011 debt limit episode highlighted fiscal sustainability concerns, but fiscal issues have since become less prominent. Since the 2011 debt limit episode, federal deficits have decreased as the economy has recovered. The FY2015 deficit was 2.5% of GDP, down from 9.8% in FY2009. Despite slower growth in federal health program costs and net interest expenses, without policy changes, deficits will increase federal debt significantly in the next decade. CBO has been warning about the current trajectory of federal borrowing for years. The CBO has been warning for years about the unsustainable trajectory of federal borrowing, which could lead to slower economic growth in the long run. Without policy changes, deficits will significantly increase federal debt in the next decade, requiring Congress to raise the debt limit to meet financial obligations.

Debt held in government accounts rose by $2,566 billion, and debt held by the public increased by $9,813 billion. Debt measures experienced periodic reductions despite an overall increasing trend due to uneven federal receipts and outlays."
