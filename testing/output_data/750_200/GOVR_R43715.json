    "content": "Aviation war risk insurance covers hostile acts like terrorism, hijackings, and sabotage. Airlines need this insurance for aircraft loan agreements and to operate in certain countries. Airlines rely on private insurance markets for coverage. After 9/11, airlines faced a cancellation of third-party liability war risk coverage. After the 9/11 attacks, airlines faced cancellations of war risk coverage in the commercial market. The U.S. government expanded the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program to ensure U.S. carriers had coverage. Private insurers now offer war risk coverage, as the commercial market has stabilized. Private insurers now offer war risk coverage for airlines, with limited coverage available for third-party damage caused by war or terrorism. Airline insurance is a small percentage of total operating costs, with airlines paying approximately $2.3 billion for basic insurance in 2011. The total operating costs of airlines include approximately $2.3 billion for basic airline insurance in 2011, translating to about $60 per flight or $0.80 cents per passenger. Insurance prices vary based on factors like location, size, fleet age, safety record, and network spread. The private market for aviation risk insurance is deemed sufficient, but could be impacted by a major terrorist incident. Commercial insurers currently provide the majority of aviation insurance. The aviation insurance market is currently adequate, but could be affected by a major terrorist incident. Commercial insurers provide most of the world's airlines with war risk coverage. The market for aviation insurance outside of war risk has been soft in recent years, with ample availability and lower prices. However, a series of airliner losses in 2014, including the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight 370, may lead to increases in insurance premiums. The aviation insurance market is currently adequate but could be impacted by major terrorist incidents. Recent losses, such as the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight 370 and the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight 17, have raised concerns. Insurers predict a potential 50% increase in premiums and a tripling of war risk insurance costs. Insurers estimate a potential 50% increase in insurance premiums and a tripling of war risk insurance costs, the largest jump since 9/11. Some insurance company officials caution against premature speculation on price rises due to lack of renewal for major carriers in the war risk insurance market. The 2014 insurance losses may lead to higher premiums for all-risk policies. Uncertainty remains on how the commercial market will react, with concerns that private coverage could become prohibitively expensive or unavailable, which would have significant consequences for U.S. air. Since April 30, 2005, EU Regulation 785/2004 (as amended by Regulation 285/2010) requires all air carriers flying within the European Union to have insurance for aviation-specific liabilities, including war- and terrorism-related risks. This could impact U.S. air carriers flying to EU destinations. EU Regulation 785/2004 mandates non-EU air carriers overflying the EU to have insurance against third-party liability, including war risk insurance. This requirement applies even if their country of registration does not mandate such insurance. The regulation also lists key provisions for compliance. The federal government provided war risk insurance to the merchant fleet during World War I and World War II. Aviation war risk insurance was not available during these wars due to limited overseas commercial air operations. Prior to 1951, aviation war risk insurance had 48-hour cancellation clauses, causing concerns for operators in the Korean War airlift. In 1951, a law was passed to give the Secretary of Commerce authority to provide war risk insurance. The 1951 law amended the Civil Aeronautics Act to give the Secretary of Commerce authority to provide war risk insurance for U.S. and foreign-flag aircraft operating in the interest of national defense or economy. Coverage included aircraft, cargo, personal effects, and liabilities, with premium rates set by the Secretary of Commerce. The 1951 law amended the Civil Aeronautics Act to provide war risk insurance for aircraft in the interest of national defense or economy. Premium rates were set by the Secretary of Commerce, and a revolving fund was established within the Treasury to fund the insurance program. The federally provided war risk insurance could be underwritten by any authorized aviation insurance company. The war risk insurance program for aircraft was established in 1951, with premiums set by the Secretary of Commerce and funds disbursed by the Treasury. Claims disputes could be settled in federal court. The program continued under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 and was later delegated to the FAA under the Department of Transportation in 1966. The hijacking of an El Al Boeing 707 in 1968 is seen as the start of a new era in aviation security. The hijacking of an El Al Boeing 707 in Rome in 1968 marked the beginning of international terrorism. PFLP members hijacked multiple flights, including one to Damascus where they held Israeli passengers hostage. In 1970, PFLP hijackers attempted to commandeer four airliners, successfully hijacking three. The Dawson's Field hijackings in 1970 involved the attempted hijacking of four airliners, with three successfully taken to a remote landing strip in Jordan and destroyed. The fate of the Pan Am 747 hijacked during this event is significant for discussing insurance coverage for terrorist acts. In 1970, a Pan Am 747 was hijacked and flown to Beirut, Lebanon, then Cairo, Egypt, where it was destroyed by an explosive. The aircraft was insured under an \"all risk\" policy and war risk policies split between FAA and commercial insurers. Following the 1970 Pan Am 747 hijacking, the commercial insurance industry was shaken due to reservations about insuring the larger and more costly Boeing 747s. Concerns over terrorist hijackings led to federal action to maintain war risk insurance coverage, with the FAA expanding coverage after determining it was no longer available at reasonable rates from commercial insurers. Following the Dawson Field hijackings, the FAA expanded federal aviation war risk insurance coverage in response to the ongoing Middle East crisis. The government set the rate at 20 cents per $100 of insurance, offered on a limited basis under the existing Aviation War Risk Insurance Program as an emergency measure. This was done as a response to the hijackings, with the new insurance being priced higher than commercial insurance but lower than what the private market would have charged. The 1973 federal district court decision ruled that the Pan Am 747 destroyed by hijackers in Cairo was covered under the airline's standard \"all risk\" policy, not its war risk policies. The court defined \"act of war\" as an operation intended to gain a military advantage, upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals with a narrower definition specifying combatants must have significant attributes of sovereignty. The Court of Appeals narrowed the district court's definition of war, stating that combatants must have significant attributes of sovereignty. This ruling meant insurers offering \"all risk\" policies were liable for the claim on the destroyed aircraft. Prior to 9/11, aviation war risk insurance was primarily issued without premium under indemnification agreements with the Department of Defense. In the 1990s, over 99% of aviation war risk insurance issued by FAA was provided without premiums under indemnification agreements with the Department of Defense for DOD charter flights. Premium war risk insurance was only used when the President deemed travel to specific foreign locations necessary for U.S. operations. During the 1990s, FAA provided aviation war risk insurance without premiums for DOD charter flights. Premium war risk insurance was only used when the President deemed travel to specific foreign locations necessary for U.S. operations. In January 1991, air carriers began cancelling flights to the Middle East due to soaring commercial war risk insurance rates. Insurance premiums for flights to and from Israel increased twentyfold to $125,000 per flight due to soaring commercial war risk insurance rates in the Middle East. Trans World Airlines and Pan Am suspended flights to Israel and other high-risk destinations like Athens, Istanbul, and Karachi. Tower Air was the only U.S. carrier to continue operating flights from Israel. After Iraqi Scud missiles were fired into Israel, FAA reportedly would not insure Tower Air's flights from New York to Tel Aviv but did continue to insure outbound passenger flights from Tel Aviv to New York. In response to the 9/11 attacks, commercial insurers cancelled third-party liability war risk coverage for airlines. In response to the 9/11 attacks, commercial insurers cancelled third-party liability war risk coverage for airlines. Congress passed the Air Transportation Safety and System Stabilization Act of 2001, amending the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program to include acts of terrorism. The program was extended through various legislative acts, most recently in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program was extended through various legislative acts, most recently in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014. The program authority under that act expires on September 30, 2014. P.L. 107-296 expanded the scope of policies to include coverage for losses or injuries to aircraft hulls, passengers, and crew. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program, extended through legislative acts, includes coverage for aircraft hulls, passengers, and crew. FAA sets limits and rates to match commercial rates, ensuring total premium paid by air carriers does not exceed twice the premium paid to the Department of Transportation. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program sets limits on premiums paid by air carriers, capping rates at twice the premium paid to the Department of Transportation. Coverage begins with the first dollar of any covered loss incurred. In response to the 9/11 attacks, Congress passed the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 to address the expensive or unavailable terrorism damage coverage in the insurance market. Following the 9/11 attacks, insurance coverage for terrorism damage became expensive or unavailable. Congress then passed the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 (TRIA) to create a reinsurance program for terrorism losses in commercial property/casualty insurance. TRIA has been extended and is set to expire in December 2014. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program and TRIA program differences are discussed in Appendix B. As of January 2014, the FAA's Aviation War Risk Insurance Program provided coverage to 44 U.S. air carriers. As of January 2014, the FAA's Aviation War Risk Insurance Program provided coverage to 44 U.S. air carriers, with insurance coverage ranging from $100 million to $4 billion per carrier. The total maximum per occurrence coverage for all insured air carriers was $68 billion, with premiums paid collected in the Aviation Insurance Revolving Fund totaling $163 million in FY2013. The fund had a balance of approximately $2.2 billion as of July. Between April and August 2014, 17 U.S. air carriers switched from FAA war risk insurance to commercial coverage. Currently, the FAA insures 27 air carriers, covering about 4% of total RPMs flown by U.S. airlines. The coverage for these carriers ranges from $100 million to $3 billion per occurrence, with an average of $1.1 billion. The total maximum exposure for all premium insurance in force is $31 billion. The FAA has reduced its estimate of premiums collected for the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program, with a total maximum exposure of $31 billion. Premium collections for FY2015 are estimated to be $18 million, assuming Congress extends the program and no air carriers cancel their policies. The FAA estimates premiums collected for the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program to be $18 million for FY2015, covering hull insurance, liability insurance, and war risk liability without deductibles or coinsurance. The coverage reimburses 100% of losses for various risks beyond war or terrorist attacks. The curr_chunk discusses various forms of attack, including war, invasion, civil war, rebellion, nuclear detonation, strikes, riots, and acts for political or terrorist purposes. These events are excluded from coverage under the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program. The curr_chunk excludes coverage for malicious acts, sabotage, vandalism, confiscation by foreign governments, and government seizures of aircraft or spare parts. The policy excludes coverage for hijacking, unlawful seizure of aircraft, and discharge of weapons or explosives on covered aircraft. The policy excludes coverage for hijacking, unlawful seizure of aircraft, and discharge of weapons or explosives on covered aircraft. FAA bases premiums on risk assumed by the program, with a cap limiting premiums to no more than twice the carrier's previous third party policy premium. The program's administration requires a small number of people. The FAA Premium War Risk Insurance Program has paid over $10 million for losses related to claims from three specific incidents since the 9/11 attacks in 2001. These incidents were determined to be \"war risk occurrences\" by the Secretary of Transportation. In December 2009, there was an attempted bombing of Northwest Airlines Flight 253. In July 2012, an unattended SkyWest aircraft was seized by a fugitive who caused damage before taking his own life. Claims paid to date total $9.6 million. In April 2014, FAA paid $256,890 for repair of damage to a Boeing 767-223 aircraft caused by gunfire over Afghanistan in 2012. The Secretary of Transportation proposed reforming the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program to reduce its scope. The legislative proposal aims to reform the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program by permanently authorizing it with a reduced overall scope. It includes providing war risk coverage for airline losses involving NBCR weapons, offering full aviation war risk coverage for 90 days in case of a widespread cancellation by the private insurance market, and continuing to provide non-premium war risk insurance for carriers. The current proposal aims to reform the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program by providing coverage for airline losses involving NBCR weapons, offering full aviation war risk coverage for 90 days in case of market disruption, and continuing to provide non-premium war risk insurance for carriers. Previous proposals have also suggested collaboration with commercial insurers to establish a shared-risk model for aviation war risk coverage. The FAA proposed a plan for commercial insurers to take on 20% of the war risk insurance market annually from FY2015 to FY2018, reducing FAA's share to 20% by FY2018. Previous budgets suggested a $150 million deductible for hull and liability exposures. The airline industry has opposed changes, citing cost concerns. The airline industry opposes changes to the War Risk Insurance program, arguing it would be costly if offered by commercial insurers. Airlines for America (A4A) President Nicholas E. Calio stated that ending the program would harm the industry economically, recommending to maintain the status quo and extend the program for three years. A4A opposes changes to the War Risk Insurance program, recommending to maintain the status quo and extend the program for three years. The Secretary of Transportation's proposal in March 2014 argued against the extension due to budgetary concerns. The current Administration proposal aims to reduce budgetary costs, with a potential cost of over $1 billion over 10 years. Two approaches to achieve budgetary savings from government insurance programs are increasing funds coming in or reducing funds going out. This can be done by raising premiums, seeking higher returns on funds, or reducing assumed risks to lower eventual payouts. These approaches are not mutually exclusive. The FAA collected $165 million in premiums in FY2013. Raising the statutory cap could increase premiums and eliminate implicit subsidies. The increase would depend on the gap between current premiums and actuarial rates. Some airlines may face higher premiums if rates were to increase. The Aviation Insurance Revolving Fund, currently over $2 billion, is invested in U.S. Treasury securities. Returns on Treasury securities are near historical lows, with the fund receiving $26 million in interest in FY2015. The Aviation Insurance Revolving Fund, with over $2 billion, is invested in U.S. Treasury securities. Private insurers have historically earned more than Treasury securities, with total net investment income of $67.6 billion in 2013. If the fund had similar investments, it could have earned $91 million instead of $26 million in FY2013. Private insurers' investments are riskier than Treasury securities, as they do not cover the full amount of possible losses. Risk-sharing mechanisms like deductibles and co-insurance leave the insured bearing some risk, discouraging behavior that may increase the likelihood of a loss, known as \"moral hazard.\" The government has offered coverage with no deductibles or co-insurance since 2002, covering losses up to maximum limits based on each airline's coverage in 2002. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program also covers losses not typical of war risks, such as vandalism or labor disturbances. The Aviation War Risk Insurance Program covers losses not typical of war risks, such as vandalism or labor disturbances. Budgetary savings could be significant by placing more risk on airlines, with insurers sharing risks among multiple parties. Reinsurance is often used to spread risk among insurers for large risks. Reinsurance involves multiple insurers sharing the financial risk of future loss, tailored to achieve desired risk sharing among companies. Loss sharing can be based on a percentage of loss, a certain level of loss, or a combination of both. Insurers may enter into reinsurance agreements due to expertise or capacity in specific insurance operations. Insurers enter into reinsurance or other loss-sharing arrangements to leverage their expertise and capacity in specific insurance operations. Sharing the risk allows them to benefit from each other's strengths, such as one insurer's expertise in underwriting policies and another insurer's financial capital. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act created a program structure for such arrangements. A well-constructed loss-sharing arrangement, like the one under the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, allows insurers to benefit by sharing the risk based on the level of loss. The government covers 85% of losses once they reach 20% of an insurer's premiums, with the minimum losses required for government coverage increasing over time. The initial intent of the TRIA program was for the government's share of losses to decrease to zero relatively quickly. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) initially aimed for the government's share of losses to decrease to zero quickly, but it has since been reauthorized with a more gradual decrease. Improved international guidance on risk decisions for flights in conflict zones could stabilize private market war risk insurance. Interest in disseminating threat information and making informed decisions on civilian flights has increased since the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight 17 over Ukraine in 2014. Since the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight 17 in 2014, there is a growing interest in disseminating threat information and making informed decisions on civilian flights in conflict zones. Insurance underwriters are considering withdrawing coverage for flights in certain high-risk regions like the Middle East and Africa due to concerns about inconsistent risk assessment by airlines. Insurance underwriters are concerned about airlines' inconsistent risk assessment in conflict zones like the Middle East and Africa. Airlines often fly over conflict zones to save time and fuel costs, a practice that has been questioned after the Malaysia Airlines crash. In August 2014, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) formed a task force to collaborate on assessing conflict zone risks. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) formed a multinational task force to assess conflict zone risks to civilian aircraft. Countries do not always share information or take necessary precautions to mitigate risks. Countries often do not share information or take precautions to mitigate conflict risks to civil aviation. Restrictions on flights could impact travel and tourism. Aviation authorities like the FAA may issue warnings or restrictions on overseas flights. Disparate views on risk and precautions exist among regulators, airlines, and insurers. In July 2014, FAA restricted flights to and from Israel for about a day and a half. In July 2014, FAA issued restrictions on flights to and from Israel during an armed conflict with Gaza. Israeli authorities asked international airlines to resume flights, arguing that risks to civil aircraft had been mitigated. This highlights the reluctance of governments to disseminate warnings that may impact travel and tourism. The destruction of Malaysia Airlines flight 17 led some governments to be cautious in their guidance to airlines operating in conflict zones. Improved processes for assessing hazards and issuing warnings could reduce uncertainties in risk assessment for civil aviation. EU Regulation 785/2004 addresses key provisions for insurance in conflict zones. EU Regulation 785/2004 requires air carriers and aircraft operators to have insurance coverage for aviation-specific liability, including acts of war and terrorism. The minimum insurance coverage for passenger liability is 250,000 SDRs ($378,523) per passenger. The EU Regulation 785/2004 mandates a minimum insurance coverage of 250,000 SDRs ($378,523) per passenger for passenger liability in commercial aircraft operations. For non-commercial aircraft with a MTOM of 2,700 kg, the minimum insurance is 100,000 SDRs ($151,409) per passenger. Baggage liability requires 1,131 SDRs ($1,712) per passenger, and cargo liability needs 19 SDRs ($29) per kilogram in commercial operations. Third-party liability insurance is also outlined in Article 7. The EU Regulation 785/2004 mandates minimum insurance coverage for liability in commercial aircraft operations. The minimum coverage per accident depends on the MTOM of the aircraft, ranging from 750,000 SDRs ($1,135,568) to 700 million SDRs (nearly $1.06 billion). Sanctions for infringement of the regulation are effective, proportional, and dissuasive, including the withdrawal of operating licenses and refusal of landing rights for EU air carriers. The EU Regulation 785/2004 mandates minimum insurance coverage for liability in commercial aircraft operations, with sanctions for infringement being effective, proportional, and dissuasive. Sanctions may include withdrawal of operating licenses and refusal of landing rights for EU air carriers. The federal government provides insurance programs, such as the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program and the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program, created by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, provided federal coverage for losses from terrorist attacks after 9/11. It was similar to the Aviation War Risk Insurance Program, which is mandated by the EU Regulation 785/2004 for liability in commercial aircraft operations. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program, established by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, initially authorized a three-year program to cover losses from terrorist attacks. As the private sector was not ready to offer terrorism coverage by the end of 2005, the program was extended for two years in 2005 and then for seven years in 2007. With the 2014 expiration approaching, there are efforts to further extend the program, with support from the insurance industry and others. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program, established by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, has received support from the insurance industry for further extension. The TRIA program provides government reinsurance for private insurers offering terrorism coverage, reimbursing them for losses due to terrorism under certain conditions. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program (TRIA) offers government reinsurance for private insurers providing terrorism coverage, reimbursing them for losses under certain conditions. There are no upfront premiums for the government coverage, with any losses covered paid from the general fund. Post-event recoupment fees on commercial insurance policies may be applied to recover costs. TRIA coverage is limited compared to federal aviation war risk insurance, operating through private insurers with similar limits and deductibles. Each insurer must meet a substantial general deductible, and coverage only applies under specific circumstances. A minimum of $100 million in insured losses is required before federal funds flow under TRIA. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) coverage is more limited than aviation war risk insurance. A minimum of $100 million in insured losses must occur due to a terrorist act before federal funds flow under TRIA. Insurers must offer coverage under the same terms as other causes of loss, but can charge a separate premium for terrorism coverage with no specific limit. Insurers can offer coverage for losses from causes other than terrorism, with the possibility of charging a separate premium. State laws may limit terrorism premiums."
