    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Smartphone Theft Prevention Act\". Congress finds that mobile device theft costs consumers $30 billion annually, with 1 in 3 robberies involving mobile device theft. Efforts have been made by carriers, manufacturers, law enforcement, and the FCC to address this issue, but more action is needed. Consumers deserve the most secure technology to protect their information, as technological protections continue to advance for the economy. The wireless industry should collaborate with law enforcement to educate consumers about available security tools and how to keep their data, devices, and themselves safe. Engineering and security needs evolve rapidly, requiring proactive solutions from the mobile device industry, law enforcement, and consumer advocates. The mobile device industry, law enforcement, and consumer advocates should collaborate to develop solutions that protect consumers, drive innovation, and deter theft. SEC. 343. FUNCTION FOR STOLEN MOBILE DEVICES. Part I of title III of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended to include a provision for stolen mobile devices. In this section, the term 'account holder' for a mobile device refers to the person holding the account for commercial mobile service or data service, including authorized individuals. The term 'commercial mobile data service' is defined as per the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 defines 'commercial mobile service' and 'mobile device'. A provider of these services must offer a function on the device that can only be used by the account holder. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 requires providers of commercial mobile data service to offer a function on the mobile device that allows the account holder to remotely delete all their information and render the device inoperable on any network. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 mandates that providers of commercial mobile data service must enable the account holder to remotely render the device inoperable on any network, even if turned off or without the data storage medium, and prevent reactivation without proper authorization. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 requires providers of commercial mobile data service to allow the account holder to remotely disable a device, prevent unauthorized factory resets, and reverse any unauthorized actions upon device recovery. Additionally, device standards mandate that mobile devices sold or manufactured in the US must be configured to meet these requirements. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 mandates that providers of commercial mobile data service must enable remote device disabling and prevent unauthorized actions. Mobile devices sold in the US must meet these standards, allowing providers to exempt devices from certain requirements if functionally equivalent technology is available. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 requires providers of commercial mobile data service to enable remote device disabling and prevent unauthorized actions. The Commission may exempt manufacturers and importers from certain requirements if functionally equivalent technology is available on the device. The Commission may waive requirements for low-cost mobile devices if they have technology equivalent to remote device disabling and prevention of unauthorized actions as mandated by the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012. The Commission can waive requirements for low-cost mobile devices intended for voice-only service with limited data functions. Providers cannot charge fees for certain functions, and there are forfeiture penalties in place. The Commission can impose forfeiture penalties on individuals found to have violated specific subsections of the section, in addition to other penalties outlined in the Act. The section allows for additional penalties to be imposed on individuals who violate specific subsections of the Act. It also clarifies that manufacturers and providers of mobile services can take actions to protect consumers from mobile device theft. The term \"mobile device\" is defined in the Communications Act of 1934. The Communications Act of 1934, as amended, applies to mobile devices manufactured or imported into the United States after January 1, 2015. The FCC may grant compliance extensions for certain requirements under the Act. The FCC may grant exemptions from certain requirements under the Communications Act of 1934 for a temporary period if a person needs more time to comply."
