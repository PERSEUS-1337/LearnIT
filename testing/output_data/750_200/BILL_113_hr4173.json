The Brownfield Redevelopment and Economic Development Innovative Financing program requires a master plan meeting specific criteria and certification from the Environmental Protection Agency for the brownfield site. Loans must be used for redevelopment costs, including site acquisition. The project aims to redevelop brownfields for urban renewal, involving site acquisition, remediation, facility relocation, and site preparation. Local government or redevelopment agencies may address contamination issues in the process. The Program prohibits loan guarantees for entities responsible for contaminating brownfields to be redeveloped and limits them to one outstanding guaranteed loan. The principal amount of the loan is also regulated. The Program guarantees loans for redevelopment projects, with a minimum principal amount of $25,000,000 and a maximum of $150,000,000. The interest rate is negotiated between the lender and borrower. The loan term for redevelopment projects is negotiated between the lender and borrower, with a maturity period of 20-30 years. Repayment does not start until 10 years after the loan is issued. The loan term for brownfield redevelopment projects is 15 years, with repayment starting no later than 15 years after the loan is issued. The master plan must include a description of the project, activities schedule, budget, and demonstration of the redevelopment project. The brownfield redevelopment project must include a schedule of activities, budget, and demonstrate major redevelopment impact on the community, including non-Federal funds commitment, long-term job creation, and environmental remediation. The brownfield redevelopment project should include environmental remediation, economic impact on the community, affordable housing creation, reduced vehicle congestion and emissions, integration of green technology, and improvement in air quality. The selection criteria for the brownfield redevelopment project include evidence of non-Federal investment commitments, a remediation action plan approved by the EPA, and incorporation of complete streets planning and transit-oriented development. The Secretary will establish selection criteria for local governments, redevelopment agencies, and BRAC projects to receive loan guarantees under the Program, considering required information and giving preference to existing projects with Federal assistance. The full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to guarantee payments under this section, providing conclusive evidence of eligibility and incontestable validity. The Federal Government is protected from liability for environmental remediation under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980. The Federal Government is not liable for environmental remediation under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 as a result of loan guarantees. The Secretary will process loan guarantee requests using a similar approval process as section 108 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974. To qualify for a loan guarantee under section 108 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, applicants must show a viable repayment schedule and provide adequate collateral, which can include grants pledged under title I of the Act. The Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 allows applicants to provide collateral in forms other than grants for loan guarantees under section 108. Before final approval, the Secretary must notify relevant Congressional committees. Definitions for this section are provided.
