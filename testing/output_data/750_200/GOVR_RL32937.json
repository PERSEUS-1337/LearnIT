    "content": "The Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources have approved legislation to reauthorize and revise the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Block Grant, including changes to the Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program. S. 667 and H.R. 240 are the bills involved in this legislation. The CSE program, Part D of Title IV of the Social Security Act, was enacted in January 1975. It is administered by the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and funded by general revenues. All 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands operate CSE programs and are entitled to federal matching funds. Families receiving TANF benefits, foster care payments, or Medicaid coverage automatically qualify for CSE services free of charge. Child support enforcement (CSE) services are provided free of charge to families receiving TANF benefits, foster care payments, or Medicaid coverage. Families not automatically eligible must apply for CSE services and may be charged an application fee of up to $25. Child support collected for non-welfare families is disbursed to the family. Child support payments collected by CSE agencies increased from $1 billion in FY1978 to $21.2 billion in FY2003. Between FY1978 and FY2003, child support payments collected by CSE agencies increased significantly from $1 billion to $21.2 billion. The number of children with established paternity also rose by 1,274%, from 111,000 to 1.525 million. However, the program only collects 18% of child support obligations it is responsible for and payments for 50% of its caseload. Paternity was established for about 77% of the nearly 10.0 million children on the CSE caseload without legally identified fathers in FY2003. The CSE program handles approximately 50% of all child support cases. The CSE program handles 50% of child support cases and provides services like parent location, paternity establishment, support order establishment, modification, collection, distribution, and medical support enforcement. Collection methods include income withholding and intercept of tax payments. The CSE program handles various aspects of child support cases, including parent location, paternity establishment, support order establishment, modification, collection, distribution, and medical support enforcement. Collection methods involve income withholding, intercept of tax payments, and other enforcement measures such as liens against property and reporting to credit bureaus. Additionally, there are civil or criminal contempt-of-court procedures and criminal nonsupport laws in place. Legislation like P.L. 102-521 and P.L. 105-187 have established federal criminal offenses for noncustodial parents who repeatedly fail to financially support their children. The CSE program handles various aspects of child support cases, including parent location, paternity establishment, support order establishment, modification, collection, distribution, and medical support enforcement. Legislation like P.L. 104-193 established federal criminal offenses for noncustodial parents who repeatedly fail to financially support children residing with custodial parents in another state or flee across state lines to avoid supporting them. States are required to implement expedited procedures to secure assets for child support arrearages. P.L. 104-193 authorized states to withhold licenses and seize financial resources of noncustodial parents who owe past-due support. It also allowed the Secretary of State to deny, revoke, or restrict passports. P.L. 104-193 authorized states to enforce child support by seizing financial resources and withholding licenses of debtor noncustodial parents. It also empowered the Secretary of State to deny, revoke, or restrict passports. Additionally, states are reimbursed by the federal government for administering their Child Support Enforcement (CSE) programs and establishing paternity. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program refunds states for laboratory costs of establishing paternity and provides incentive payments to encourage effective programs. The program has evolved into a multifaceted system with a statutory limit of $446 million for incentive payments in FY2005. The Child Support Enforcement (CSE) program, with a budget of $446 million for FY2005, has evolved to focus on service delivery, promoting self-sufficiency, and securing financial support for children from noncustodial parents. Child support payments are now a significant income source for single-parent families, constituting an average of 17% of family income. Child support payments are crucial for single-parent families, constituting 17% of family income on average. Poor families receiving child support rely on it for about 30% of their income. Bills S. 667 and H.R. 240 aim to enhance the CSE program to increase economic independence for former welfare families and provide stable income for all single-parent families. The focus is on simplifying CSE rules and prioritizing family support. Both bills, S. 667 and H.R. 240, aim to simplify Child Support Enforcement (CSE) rules and strengthen family support. The Senate Finance Committee bill includes more CSE provisions compared to the House Subcommittee bill. For a detailed list of provisions, refer to Table 1 in the report. The CSE provisions in S.667 and H.R. 240 aim to simplify rules and strengthen family support. Families receiving TANF benefits must assign child support rights to the state, covering payments owed by the noncustodial parent. Assigned collections are not paid to families. The assignment of child support rights to the state for families receiving TANF benefits results in the state keeping child support collections as reimbursement. Nonwelfare families retain all collected child support. The date of assignment determines if arrearages are permanently assigned to the state. The assignment of child support rights to the state for TANF families depends on the assignment date. Pre-assistance and during-assistance arrearages are permanently assigned if entered before September 30, 1997. If entered after October 1, 1997, only arrearages during assistance are permanently assigned. Pre-assistance arrearages are temporarily assigned and revert to the family when they leave TANF, except if collected through the federal income tax refund offset program. The federal income tax refund offset program affects child support assignment for TANF families. S. 667 from the Senate Finance Committee would only assign child support that accrues during TANF benefits. H.R. 240 from the House Ways and Means Subcommittee does not change assignment rules. The House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources approved a bill that does not change child support assignment rules. Distribution rules determine the order in which child support collections are paid, with past-due child support being a priority. TANF families can retain current support and assigned arrearages up to the amount of TANF benefits received. The 1996 welfare law repealed the $50 required pass through and gave states the choice to decide how much of child support payments collected on behalf of TANF families to send the family. States also decide whether to treat child support payments as income to the family. States have discretion over their share of child support collections, but are required to pay the federal government its share. The 1996 welfare law gave states discretion over child support collections for TANF families, but required them to pay the federal government its share. As of August 2004, 18 states continued the $50 pass-through policy. Both bills aim to incentivize states to direct more child support to families. The 1996 welfare law allowed states to decide how to use child support collections for TANF families, but they had to reimburse the federal government. Currently, 18 states still follow the $50 pass-through policy. New bills propose federal incentives for states to prioritize giving child support to families rather than repaying welfare benefits. The bills differ in the amount of federal cost-sharing and whether to support existing policies or encourage new ones. Under S. 667, the federal government would share the costs of pass-through and disregard policies used by states, allowing states to pay up to $400 per month in child support to TANF families without reimbursing the federal government. The House bill, H.R. 240, aims to incentivize states to increase their child support pass-through and disregard policies by allowing them to pay more child support to TANF families without reimbursing the federal government. The House bill, H.R. 240, incentivizes states to increase child support pass-through payments to TANF families without reimbursing the federal government. The bill limits federal cost-sharing to $100 per month or $50 more than the state's previous share. States must disregard child support payments when determining TANF benefits for the federal government to share in the cost. The state must disregard child support payments for TANF families in determining benefits. Former TANF families receive child support collections before the state and federal government are reimbursed, following the \"family-first\" policy. The 1996 welfare reform law prioritized child support distribution to favor families once they leave TANF, with arrearages before and after TANF going to the family, and arrearages during TANF going to the state. The 1996 welfare reform law prioritized child support distribution to favor families once they leave TANF, with arrearages before and after TANF going to the family, and arrearages during TANF going to the state. S. 667 would simplify the CSE distribution process and give states the option to distribute the full amount of child support collected to former TANF families. S. 667 and H.R. 240 aim to simplify child support distribution processes and give states the option to distribute the full amount of child support collected to former TANF families. The federal government would share costs of paying child support arrearages to families under these bills. The federal government would share costs with states for paying child support arrearages accrued during TANF receipt and for passing through child support collected via federal income tax refund offset program. Both bills include provisions for lowering passport denial threshold, collecting child support from Social Security and veterans' benefits, and using federal income tax refund offset program for past-due child support. The curr_chunk discusses various measures to improve child support collection, including support from Social Security benefits, easing collection from veterans' benefits, using federal income tax refund offset program for past-due child support, comparing information of noncustodial parents with insurers, and establishing interstate child support cases. The curr_chunk discusses provisions in S. 667 to enhance child support collection, such as authorizing the seizure of noncustodial parents' financial assets and requiring medical support for children. The curr_chunk discusses bills that aim to improve child support collection by requiring medical support for children and notifying health care plan administrators. It also includes provisions for reviewing and adjusting child support orders for TANF families every three years. The curr_chunk discusses bills related to child support collection, including establishing funding levels for technical assistance and the Federal Parent Locator Service. It also includes a provision for a $25 annual fee for individuals receiving CSE services. S. 667 proposes increased funding for the CSE access and visitation program, adoption of a later version of UIFSA for interstate child support payments, and allows Texas to continue its CSE program without a federal waiver. Table 1 compares CSE provisions of S. 667 and H.R. 240 with current law. Comparison of CSE provisions in S. 667 and H.R. 240 with current law. Table 1 shows the differences in child support provisions between the bills."
