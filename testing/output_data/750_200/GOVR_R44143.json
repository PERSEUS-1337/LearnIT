    "content": "The Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause prohibits states from denying equal protection of the laws. The Supreme Court has extended equal protection principles to the federal government. Different levels of scrutiny are applied by courts when reviewing government actions that classify people. The Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause prohibits discrimination by states and the federal government. Courts apply different levels of scrutiny based on the classification involved, with strict scrutiny being the most demanding. Increased scrutiny raises the likelihood of a court finding the government's action unconstitutional. Strict scrutiny is the most demanding form of judicial review, applying to governmental classifications that are constitutionally suspect or interfere with fundamental rights. Courts consider historical discrimination, unchangeable minority characteristics, and inadequate political protection when determining suspect classifications. Generally, suspect classifications include those based on race, national origin, and alienage. When applying strict scrutiny to governmental action, reviewing courts consider if it is narrowly tailored to a compelling government interest. The government must prove the constitutional validity of its action under strict scrutiny, showing it cannot achieve its goals through less discriminatory means. Intermediate scrutiny is less stringent than strict scrutiny but more rigorous than rational basis review, applying to \"quasi-suspect\" classifications. Intermediate scrutiny, like strict scrutiny, subjects governmental action to stringent inspection, applying to \"quasi-suspect\" classifications such as gender or illegitimacy. Courts determine if the action is substantially related to an important government interest, with the government bearing the burden of proving its constitutional validity. Rational basis review is the least searching form of scrutiny, applying to classifications not subject to heightened levels of scrutiny. Rational basis review is the least searching form of judicial scrutiny, applying to classifications not subject to heightened levels of scrutiny. Governmental action must be rationally related to a legitimate government interest to survive this review. Courts consider the legitimacy of any possible governmental purpose behind the action, and it only needs to be a reasonable way of achieving a legitimate government purpose to pass rational basis review. The U.S. Constitution's due process guarantees are contained within the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. Rational basis review is deferential to the government, with parties challenging governmental actions bearing the burden of proving their invalidity. The U.S. Constitution's due process guarantees are found in the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, ensuring that the government cannot deprive individuals of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. The Fifth Amendment applies to federal government actions, while the Fourteenth Amendment applies to state actions. The Supreme Court has interpreted these guarantees to include both procedural and substantive requirements. Substantive due process protects fundamental rights against undue governmental infringement. The Supreme Court determines a right's fundamentality based on historical recognition and its importance to liberty and justice. Governmental actions infringing on fundamental rights are subject to strict scrutiny. The Supreme Court applies strict scrutiny to governmental actions infringing on fundamental rights, requiring them to be narrowly tailored to a compelling government interest. The government must show a substantial need for its action to further a compelling interest without encumbering fundamental rights more than necessary. Alternative actions that are less burdensome must also be considered. The Supreme Court applies strict scrutiny to governmental actions infringing on fundamental rights, requiring them to be narrowly tailored to a compelling government interest. In Obergefell, the Court considered whether states must issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples and recognize same-sex marriages legally formed in other states. The Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell v. Hodges required states to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples and recognize same-sex marriages formed in other states. The Court found state same-sex marriage bans unconstitutional, citing due process and equal protection principles. The majority decision was based on the fundamental right to marry, which the Court has long held as constitutionally protected. The Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell v. Hodges required states to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples and recognize same-sex marriages formed in other states. The Court based its decision on the fundamental right to marry, citing reasons such as individual autonomy, support for committed unions, and safeguarding children within marriages. The Supreme Court extended the fundamental right to marry to same-sex couples, citing reasons such as individual autonomy, support for committed unions, and safeguarding children within marriages. The Court acknowledged a departure from precedent in determining fundamental rights, stating that rights can also arise from a better understanding of constitutional imperatives. The Court departed from precedent by recognizing the right of same-sex couples to marry without applying strict scrutiny to state same-sex marriage bans. States argued for bans based on two primary interests. The Court recognized the right of same-sex couples to marry without applying strict scrutiny to state same-sex marriage bans. States argued for bans based on two primary interests, but the Court found these justifications invalid without applying typical levels of judicial review. The Court invalidated state same-sex marriage bans without applying traditional levels of judicial review, recognizing the fundamental right to marry for same-sex couples. The Court did not specify the level of scrutiny for classifications based on sexual orientation, causing dissent among some Justices in Obergefell. Some dissenting Justices in Obergefell believed the majority overstepped by deciding on same-sex marriage instead of leaving it to the democratic process. They criticized the majority for establishing a new fundamental right and not following Supreme Court precedent. Justices in Obergefell expressed concern about the majority creating a new fundamental right without relying on history and tradition. The dissenting Justices argued that fundamental rights should be rooted in tradition to prevent the Court from imposing its policy decisions. The decision on state same-sex marriage bans raised questions about its broader impact on gay individuals and the level of judicial scrutiny applicable to classifications. Obergefell raised questions about its impact on the rights of gay individuals outside of marriage, the level of judicial scrutiny for classifications based on sexual orientation, and the recognition of fundamental rights by the Court. The Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell primarily focused on same-sex marriage bans violating the fundamental right to marry, without addressing the broader impact on the rights of gay individuals outside of marriage or the level of scrutiny for classifications based on sexual orientation. The Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell did not address the broader implications for the rights of gay individuals outside of marriage or the level of scrutiny for classifications based on sexual orientation. Prior to Obergefell, federal appeals courts were divided on the level of scrutiny for classifications based on sexual orientation. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that such classifications warrant heightened scrutiny. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has held that classifications based on sexual orientation warrant heightened scrutiny, while the Second Circuit found them to be quasi-suspect. In contrast, the Sixth Circuit determined that governmental action based on sexual orientation is neither suspect nor quasi-suspect. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has ruled that governmental action based on sexual orientation is subject only to rational basis review, creating a circuit split with the Second and Ninth Circuits. This ambiguity leaves lower courts to determine the level of scrutiny for classifications based on sexual orientation in the future. The Sixth Circuit ruled that governmental action based on sexual orientation is subject to rational basis review, creating a split with other circuits. This leaves lower courts to decide the level of scrutiny for such classifications in the future. The Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell raised questions about extending the right to marry to polygamy, creating potential disparities in outcomes for laws based on sexual orientation depending on the court's scrutiny level. Chief Justice John Roberts expressed dissent on this issue. The Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell raised questions about extending the right to marry to polygamy, with Chief Justice John Roberts suggesting that the majority's opinion could lead to the legalization of plural marriages. However, the majority's opinion seems crafted to limit its reach to same-sex marriage, preventing the extension of the fundamental right to marry to plural marriages. The Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell extended the fundamental right to marry to same-sex couples based on four key reasons. While some argue that this rationale does not apply to plural marriages, others suggest that aspects of the Court's opinion could potentially support extending constitutional protections to plural marriages. The Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell extended the fundamental right to marry to same-sex couples. The majority departed from precedent by considering individual autonomy and looking beyond historical recognition, potentially expanding the number of rights deemed fundamental for substantive due process protections. The Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell extended the fundamental right to marry to same-sex couples, considering individual autonomy and expanding the number of rights deemed fundamental for substantive due process protections. The Court did not clarify the level of judicial review applied to state same-sex marriage bans, raising questions about the proper scrutiny for governmental actions infringing on fundamental rights. Increased scrutiny decreases likelihood of finding government action constitutional, creating ambiguity on permissible interference with fundamental rights."
