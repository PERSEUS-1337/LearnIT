    "content": "In 1992, the United States ratified the UNFCCC to reduce greenhouse gases, but carbon dioxide emissions have continued to increase despite various proposed actions. President George W. Bush rejected the Kyoto Protocol in 2001. Despite efforts to improve appliance efficiency and incentives for renewable energy sources, carbon dioxide emissions have continued to rise. President George W. Bush rejected the Kyoto Protocol in 2001, which aimed for legally binding commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The focus of U.S. climate change policy has shifted to voluntary initiatives to curb emissions growth, as outlined in the 2002 Climate Action Report. The 2002 Climate Action Report highlighted over 50 programs, with only six being regulatory. These programs aimed to achieve energy or environmental goals, resulting in a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Congressional proposals have been made to advance programs for reducing greenhouse gases. In the 109th Congress, congressional proposals have been introduced to advance programs for reducing greenhouse gases. These proposals focus on improving monitoring of emissions, enacting market-oriented reduction programs, and implementing energy and related programs. The report focuses on comparing two proposals from the Senate's debate on the Energy Policy Act of 2005, specifically the Climate Stewardship Act of 2005 introduced by Senators McCain and Lieberman. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 debate included the introduction of the Climate Stewardship Act by Senators McCain and Lieberman, focusing on reducing greenhouse gas emissions through market-based mechanisms and promoting innovation in carbon-intensive technologies. The bill S. 1151, similar to previous amendments, aims for economy-wide emission reductions through market-based strategies, international trading systems, and carbon sequestration programs. Residential and agricultural sectors are excluded from the reduction requirements. The bill S. 1151 permits participation in international trading systems and carbon sequestration programs for reducing greenhouse gases. It excludes residential and agricultural sources and entities emitting less than 10,000 metric tons annually. Senator Bingaman's draft amendment is based on the NCEP report, proposing a mandatory permit program for greenhouse gas reduction. The Climate and Economy Insurance Act of 2005 mandates an accelerated reduction in greenhouse gas intensity of the economy through an allowance trading program. Annual reduction in emissions per GDP is 2.4% from 2010-2019 and 2.8% thereafter. Total allowances are based on the decline in intensity and GDP growth. The draft amendment includes a cost-limiting safety valve allowing covered entities to pay DOE instead of reducing emissions at a set price. The main difference between proposals is their approach to controlling greenhouse gas emissions, with both covering the majority of U.S. emissions. The draft amendment aims to reduce greenhouse gas intensity, while S. 1151 would place an absolute cap on emissions from covered entities. Under S. 1151, overall U.S. emissions are expected to grow, while the draft amendment's total U.S. emissions would depend on economic growth and scheduled reductions in emissions intensity. The draft amendment aims to reduce greenhouse gas intensity, while S. 1151 would place an absolute cap on emissions from covered entities. The growth of total U.S. emissions would depend on economic growth and scheduled reductions in emissions intensity. A key difference is the establishment of a cost-limiting \"safety valve\" in the draft amendment, allowing covered entities to purchase extra tradeable allowances or make a payment to DOE at a set price. In contrast, S. 1151 does not limit the price per allowance that covered entities would pay. The draft amendment aims to reduce greenhouse gas intensity, while S. 1151 would place an absolute cap on emissions from covered entities. The two proposals differ in various ways, including the entities covered, primary responsibility for the program, generation of credits, and utilization of proceeds from the sale/auction of allowances. Emission reduction estimates under both options involve uncertainty, particularly for the draft amendment. The estimates provided in Table 2 for the draft amendment and S. 1151 should be considered approximate. In 2004, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) analyzed S. 1151 and estimated a 6.7% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2010. In contrast, CRS estimated a 2.5% reduction for the draft amendment. The draft amendment would result in a 2.5% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in 2010 compared to business-as-usual. Long-term reductions were not estimated due to uncertainty, but emissions would likely increase more slowly under both options. In the case of S. 1151, the percentage of greenhouse gases not covered would increase over time, reducing the initial emissions reduction achieved in 2010. The draft amendment would lead to a 2.5% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in 2010 compared to business-as-usual. However, emissions not covered by the bill would increase over time, potentially leading to a faster rise in emissions compared to S. 1151. The draft amendment could potentially lead to a faster rise in emissions compared to S. 1151. The projected emissions under the draft amendment show a 2.5% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in 2010 compared to business-as-usual. The estimates for emission reductions under the draft amendment are uncertain due to varying numbers of covered entities. The calculations are based on projected GDP and carbon intensity improvements, but do not consider carbon sequestration potential. This uncertainty is greater than that of S. 1151. The draft amendment's emission reductions are more uncertain than S. 1151 due to varying coverage estimates. Supporters suggest coverage around 85%, while EIA assumes 75%, impacting reduction levels and compliance costs. The draft amendment also has uncertainties regarding emission reductions. The draft amendment has uncertainties regarding emission reductions, with future baseline calculations based on projections of 2009 GDP growth and carbon intensity improvement, leading to greater uncertainty about quantity. The draft amendment has uncertainties regarding emission reductions, with future baseline calculations based on projections of 2009 GDP growth and carbon intensity improvement. The estimated annual GDP growth rate ranges from 2.5% to 3.6%, with a reference case assumption of 3.1%. The carbon intensity improvement projection is also uncertain, with estimates potentially off by 20% or more. The carbon intensity target for 2009 is in the range of 159MMTCE/M$GDP, but actual improvement could be less than projected. The draft amendment raises questions about coverage and uncertainties in achieving emission reductions. The carbon intensity target for 2009 is 159MMTCE/M$GDP, but actual improvement may be lower. There are potentially entities not covered under the amendment, and the safety valve adds to the uncertainty in reducing emissions. The safety valve in the draft amendment adds uncertainty to achieving emission reductions, with projections varying on when it would be triggered. The projected cost under S. 1151 is also more uncertain compared to the draft amendment. The projected cost under S. 1151 is uncertain due to future growth in greenhouse gas emissions by covered entities. Economic growth could lead to increased emissions that would need to be offset to maintain the cap, potentially resulting in higher costs. Conversely, if economic growth is less robust, fewer reductions would be required, leading to lower costs. The cost estimates of S. 1151 are uncertain and influenced by various factors. Previous studies suggest potential permit prices ranging from $9 to $15 per ton. These estimates vary based on assumptions about energy efficiency improvements, non-CO2 greenhouse gas reductions, carbon sequestration, international credits, and future natural gas supply. The cost estimates of S. 1151 are uncertain, with potential permit prices ranging from $9 to $15 per ton. The draft amendment's cost estimates are less sensitive and require fewer emission reductions than S. 1151. The draft amendment's cost estimates are less sensitive to factors and require fewer emission reductions than S. 1151. The amendment incorporates economic growth into its emissions limitation target, allowing for some increase in future emissions if projected economic growth exceeds the mandated improvement in greenhouse gas intensity. This results in lower costs due to fewer offsets required. The projected cost is influenced by the availability of cost-effective control measures such as energy efficiency improvements, carbon sequestration, and non-CO2 greenhouse gas reductions. The draft amendment's cost estimates are based on assumed availability of cost-effective control measures like energy efficiency improvements, carbon sequestration, and non-CO2 greenhouse gas reductions. It does not include international credits like S. 1151, which could introduce uncertainty or lower costs. The National Commission on Energy Policy set the permit price at $5 a ton in 2010 (2004$), with uncertainties in potential costs but a safety valve in place. The draft amendment sets a permit price at $5 a ton in 2010 (2004$) with a safety valve limiting the upside risk to $7 a ton (nominal 2010$). Converting to 2001 dollars, the projected permit price would be $4.8 - $5.9 a ton (2001$), narrowing the band of potential costs. The safety valve aims to bound costs of climate change control programs while considering reductions achieved. The safety valve in climate change control programs limits costs by setting a price cap, allowing the marketplace to determine emissions levels. This mechanism ensures cost control while considering achieved reductions. A tradeable permit system or carbon tax sets limits on emissions and costs, allowing the marketplace to determine actual reductions based on cost uncertainties and benefits. If confident in achieving a specific level of CO2 reduction, a tradeable permit program may be most appropriate as it efficiently handles the cost of reducing emissions by concentrating efforts where controls can be achieved at least cost. This system allows for reductions based on cost uncertainties and benefits, rather than controlling at a specific cost level. Including a safety valve in a CO2 reduction scheme can cap the marginal cost of control for emitters, providing a level of certainty in cost control. Emitters would spend money on controlling emissions up to the safety valve level, but the exact CO2 reduction achieved is less certain due to unknown marginal costs among emitters. The safety valve in a CO2 reduction scheme caps the marginal cost of control for emitters, providing cost certainty. However, the exact emissions reduction achieved is uncertain due to unknown marginal costs among emitters. The safety valve could be viewed as a contingent carbon tax, raising the policy question of prioritizing economic cost acceptance with uncertainty (safety valve) or achieving specific emission reduction efficiently without caps (tradeable permits). S. 1151 leans towards the latter approach. The draft amendment and S. 1151 propose market-based systems to limit greenhouse gas emissions, but differ in approach. S. 1151 sets an absolute cap on emissions for entities to trade under, while the draft amendment limits emissions intensity with a cost-limiting safety valve. The draft amendment and S. 1151 propose market-based systems to limit greenhouse gas emissions. S. 1151 sets an absolute cap on emissions for trading, while the draft amendment limits emissions intensity with a cost-limiting safety valve. Short-term U.S. emissions would likely be below business-as-usual levels under both proposals, with S. 1151 leading to larger and more certain reductions. The cost of the draft amendment is expected to be less and more predictable. However, total U.S. emissions are projected to continue increasing, albeit at a slower rate than currently forecasted."
