The Congress recognizes the need for uniform warnings on personal protective equipment for occupational use to prevent confusion among employers and employees, reduce workplace injuries and illnesses, and address inconsistencies in state requirements. Questions arise regarding the adequacy of warnings due to varying State regulations, prohibitions, and court decisions, creating challenges for interstate commerce in such equipment. The purpose of this Act is to enhance workplace safety by clarifying the proper use of personal protective equipment through uniform warnings. It also aims to preempt any conflicting state standards on the adequacy of these warnings. SEC. 5. UNIFORM WARNINGS FOR PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT FOR OCCUPATIONAL USE.

The standard for personal protective equipment includes warnings for employees, training on proper use, workplace application, and consequences of non-compliance. The standard becomes effective 6 months after publication in the Federal Register and exempts warnings for equipment placed in interstate commerce before the effective date unless communicated to the employer as required. The Secretary considers various factors and expert opinions when promulgating standards for equipment warnings, including manufacturer experience, means of communication, worker opinions, human factors experts, and input from organizations like the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health.
