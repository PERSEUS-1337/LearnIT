The Act \"Nigerian Democracy and Civil Society Empowerment Act of 1999\" highlights Congress's findings on the negative impact of successive military regimes in Nigeria, praising the current regime led by Gen. Abdusalami Abubakar for progress in liberalizing the political environment. The current government in Nigeria has released political prisoners, improved freedom of assembly, expression, and association, and set a timeline for transitioning to civilian rule. Previous military regimes allowed the country to become a hub for drug trafficking and criminal organizations, but the current government is cooperating with the United States to combat this. Sanctions have been imposed by the international community since 1993 in response to human rights violations and political issues. Despite progress in protecting freedoms, Nigeria still has decrees in force that suspend constitutional rights, allow indefinite detention without charge, and revoke civilian court jurisdiction. Limited sanctions imposed by the international community in response to human rights violations have been partially lifted due to recent political liberalization. Nigeria is a party to the ICCPR and the African Charter on Human Rights. Nigeria, as a party to international agreements, is obligated to conduct fair elections. The country has also played a significant role in peacekeeping efforts in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Despite progress, there are still concerns about human rights violations in Nigeria. Despite progress in Nigeria, recent events in the Niger Delta raise concerns about the potential success of the transition process and the possibility of the military resorting to repressive methods. Congress declares that the United States should encourage reforms to ensure rule of law and respect for human rights in Nigeria. States should support reforms for rule of law, human rights, and a transition to civilian government in Nigeria. The Sense of Congress is to support reforms for rule of law, human rights, and a transition to civilian government in Nigeria. The Sense of Congress is for the President to coordinate with other countries to promote the rule of law, human rights, and democratic civilian government. Additionally, the President should direct the US Representative to the UN Human Rights Commission to advocate for Nigeria at the annual meeting. The United States Representative to the UNCHR should condemn human rights abuses in Nigeria, recognize progress made, and advocate for the renewal of the special rapporteur's mandate and access to Nigeria. Assistance to promote democracy and civil society in Nigeria. Development Assistance for Nigeria under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 should allocate not less than $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2000, $12,000,000 for fiscal year 2001, and $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2002 to support nongovernmental assistance programs. Assistance provided to nongovernmental organizations in Nigeria aims to promote democracy, good governance, and the rule of law. The Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development must ensure that recipients represent a diverse cross-section of Nigerian society. The United States Agency for International Development provides grants to nongovernmental organizations in Nigeria to promote democracy, human rights, and accountable government. Not less than $500,000 for each fiscal year should be available for these grants. The United States Agency for International Development provides grants of up to $25,000 each to support individuals or organizations promoting human rights in Nigeria. Additionally, a minimum of $1,000,000 for fiscal year 2000, $1,500,000 for fiscal year 2001, and $2,000,000 for fiscal year 2002 should be allocated to the United States Information Agency for activities in Nigeria, including promoting awareness of democracy and human rights. The United States Agency for International Development provides grants to support human rights in Nigeria.
