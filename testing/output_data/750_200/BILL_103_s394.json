The amendment introduces a 50 percent credit on qualified cooperative research expenditures, defined as contributions to research consortia for qualified research. The amendment introduces a 50 percent credit on qualified cooperative research expenditures, limited by private source funding. The private source funding ratio is determined by the sum of 50 percent of the organization's gross receipts (excluding governmental support) for the preceding period. The private source funding ratio is calculated based on the organization's gross receipts for the preceding taxable year, with additional percentages from the two preceding years. Limitations apply to certain factors for this calculation. Limitations apply to qualified contributions for the third preceding taxable year, excluding certain costs allocated to services performed by a taxpayer's employees. The taxpayer's contributions to a qualified cooperative research consortium are limited to one-third of the consortium's total nongovernmental support for the consortium's taxable year. The taxpayer's contributions to a qualified cooperative research consortium are limited based on the number of participants in the consortium making nongovernmental contributions. If there are fewer than 5 participants, the contributions of each person will be reduced by 20% if there are 4 participants, or by 40% if there are 3 participants. The taxpayer's contributions to a qualified cooperative research consortium are limited based on the number of participants in the consortium making nongovernmental contributions. Contributions are reduced by 20% if there are 4 participants, or by 40% if there are 3 participants. A qualified cooperative research consortium is an organization registered under the National Cooperative Research Act of 1984 with at least 5 contributors.

If the consortium has at least 5 contributors, specific contribution limits apply to ensure no single member dominates the funding. The taxpayer's contributions to a qualified cooperative research consortium are limited based on the number of participants and their contributions. If the consortium has 3 or 4 contributors, specific rules apply to ensure fair distribution of funding among contributors in the same trade or business. Special rules apply for noncash contributions in the same trade or business, including services provided by a taxpayer's employees, which are valued at their cost. Overhead costs allocated to these services must also be included. Amounts taken into account should not result in a double benefit. The taxpayer's employees' overhead costs for services must be properly allocated. Amounts for qualified cooperative research expenditures cannot be double-counted. Prepaid contributions to research consortia for future research are treated as incurred when the research is conducted. Qualified cooperative research consortiums must submit reports to the Secretary with certification, private funding ratio, and other required information. Each consortium must also provide a copy of the report to contributors. The amendments made by this section are effective immediately. Each consortium must provide a copy of the report to contributors. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after the date of enactment of this Act."
