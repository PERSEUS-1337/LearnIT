    "content": "Public and private health care spending is increasing due to factors like rising health insurance enrollment and an aging population. The tax subsidies in the Internal Revenue Code for health care are often overlooked in budget discussions, as they provide preferential tax treatment for certain forms of income. Congressional focus on health-related tax expenditures is important. Congressional attention to health-related tax expenditures focuses on the value of these provisions, changes over time, impact of the ACA, and comparison to total revenue collected. It also examines the size of health tax expenditures relative to federal spending on health programs. This report analyzes historical data on health-related tax expenditure estimates published by the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) to provide insights into the value of total revenue collected and the size of health tax expenditures relative to federal spending on health programs. The report analyzes historical data on health-related tax expenditure estimates by the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) to provide insights into the value of total revenue collected and the size of health tax expenditures relative to federal spending on health programs. For more information on tax expenditures, refer to CRS Committee Print CP10001 and CRS Report R44012. This report by [author name scrubbed] relies on the tax expenditure definition and estimation methodology used by the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT), which defines tax expenditures as revenue losses attributable to provisions of the Federal tax laws allowing special exclusions, exemptions, deductions, credits, preferential tax rates, or deferrals. JCT uses a modified Haig-Simons baseline definition of income. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) uses a modified Haig-Simons baseline definition of income to estimate tax expenditures, which are revenue losses from special provisions in the tax laws. JCT categorizes these provisions and publishes estimates during each session of Congress. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) categorizes tax expenditures by budget function, such as health, commerce, housing, and energy. The Department of the Treasury also has its own list of tax expenditures organized by budget function. JCT's health budget function for tax expenditures is broader than the \"health\" budget functions used for agency outlays. The health budget function used by JCT to categorize tax expenditures is broader than the \"health\" budget functions used for agency outlays. This is due to historical practices and the challenge of containing cross-cutting health provisions within a narrow category. For example, some health tax expenditures for active-duty military dependents may be related to spending programs in OMB's national defense budget function. Military dependents' tax expenditures may be linked to OMB's national defense budget function. Tax expenditures are categorized by the CBO based on exclusions, exemptions, deductions, preferential tax rates, and tax credits. Economists assess tax expenditures for economic efficiency, equity, and administrative simplicity, aiding Congressional decision-making. Tax expenditures are evaluated based on economic efficiency, equity, and administrative simplicity criteria to aid Congressional decision-making. For example, in the health insurance sector, some tax expenditures can address market inefficiencies but may also create new ones. Exclusions and deductions in tax expenditures could impact tax progressivity by benefiting filers based on their top marginal income tax rate. Administrative considerations are also crucial in assessing the tax code. Tax expenditures can impact tax progressivity based on top marginal income tax rates. Administering social programs through the tax code may benefit lower-income households but could increase complexity and costs. Direct spending or grant programs may be easier for beneficiaries and reduce administrative costs. JCT currently identifies 14 health tax expenditures. Administering tax expenditures as direct spending or grant programs could be easier for beneficiaries and reduce administrative costs. JCT currently identifies 14 health tax expenditures, totaling $234.0 billion in FY2016. Medicare-related provisions were previously included but are no longer part of the estimates. In FY2016, health tax expenditures are estimated at $234.0 billion. The largest tax expenditure is the tax exclusion for employer-sponsored insurance (ESI), projected to increase from $145.5 billion to $169.4 billion. The second largest expenditure is subsidies for insurance purchased in the exchanges. The second largest health tax expenditure is for subsidies for insurance purchased in the exchanges, with the annual amount estimated to increase from $29.6 billion to $84.8 billion from FY2015 to FY2019. These tax provisions subsidize private health insurance costs and activities with positive societal benefits. Some health tax provisions aim to reduce costs for private activities with societal benefits, such as charitable giving to nonprofit health organizations. These provisions have origins in legal doctrine and could have been indirectly influenced by other policies. The origins of the ESI tax exclusion can be traced back to 1918 when employer payments for individual health coverage were deductible as a cost of doing business. Regulatory rulings had conflicting impacts on tax provisions. The ESI tax exclusion originated in 1918 when employer health coverage payments became deductible. The Internal Revenue Code Act of 1954 expanded this exclusion, excluding employer contributions from income. JCT data on health-related tax expenditure estimates from FY1974 is analyzed in this section. The Internal Revenue Code Act of 1954 expanded the ESI tax exclusion, excluding employer contributions from income. JCT data on health-related tax expenditure estimates from FY1974 to FY2019 is analyzed, showing changes in provisions over time. Medicare-related tax provisions are separately analyzed through FY2014. The JCT analyzes tax expenditures separately through FY2014. Multiple provisions are combined to show changes over time in tax expenditures. Provisions with de minimus value are excluded. After adjusting for inflation, health-related tax expenditures have increased over time. From FY2004 to FY2014, these expenditures rose by 43.0% in real terms. The annual tax expenditure value for health-related provisions increased by 11.5% in nominal dollars and 7.5% in real dollars from FY1974 to FY2014. The annual tax expenditure value for health-related provisions has increased by 11.5% in nominal dollars and 7.5% in real dollars from FY1974 to FY2014. In the years after the ACA in 2010, growth rates fluctuate around these averages. Health tax expenditures are estimated to rise from $210.4 billion in FY2015 to $296.2 billion in FY2019, with a total of $234.0 billion in FY2016. Factors like demographic changes contribute to the growth. The net growth of health-related tax expenditures, totaling $234.0 billion, is attributed to factors like demographic changes, rising health care costs, and policy changes affecting costs. Medicare benefits were previously measured as benefits exceeding insurance payments, excluding all Medicare benefits from income tax. Tax expenditures for Medicare increased over time, with JCT measuring the value of insurance benefits exceeding premiums paid for Part A, B, or D programs. Before FY1987, these expenditures were minimal. Tax expenditures for Medicare increased over time, with JCT estimating that Medicare insurance benefits exceeded payments before FY1987. From FY1987 to FY2014, the annual tax expenditure value for Medicare-related provisions increased by 10.2% (nominal) and 7.7% (real) on average. This indicates that the value of Medicare insurance to beneficiaries increased at rates higher than payments over this period. The value of health-related tax expenditures has generally increased at a rate greater than the growth of total revenue collections, from 1.9% in FY1974 to 8.4% in FY2014. In FY2015, health tax expenditures were 6.4% of total revenue, projected to increase to 7.7% by FY2019. Health tax expenditures are projected to increase from 6.4% of total revenue in FY2015 to 7.7% in FY2019. The ACA imposed various taxes to raise revenue, including the Cadillac tax, individual mandate, employer mandate, and medical device tax. Additionally, a 3.8% unearned income Medicare contribution tax was imposed on higher-income taxpayers. The ACA imposed various taxes to raise revenue, including the Cadillac tax, individual mandate, employer mandate, and medical device tax. A 3.8% unearned income Medicare contribution tax was also imposed on higher-income taxpayers. The annual revenue raised by these provisions is small compared to total health tax expenditures. OMB classifies activities under its health budget function differently than JCT organizes tax expenditures. The comparison between outlays and tax expenditures can track federal support to the health sector or household health expenses over time. The comparison between outlays and tax expenditures can help track federal support to the health sector or household health expenses over time. The costs of major federal health programs like Medicare and Medicaid are mostly mandatory outlays, while administrative costs are funded through discretionary spending. Federal health research and veterans' health care are primarily funded through discretionary spending, along with certain public health clinics. Health-related tax expenditures historically exceed health discretionary spending. The values of health-related tax expenditures historically exceeded health discretionary outlays, but were still much less than health mandatory outlays. Mandatory outlays for health increased from 1.0% of GDP in FY1974 to 5.0% in FY2014, while health-related tax expenditures grew from 0.3% of GDP in FY1974 to 1.5% in FY2014. Health-related tax expenditures have grown steadily from 0.3% of GDP in FY1974 to 1.5% in FY2014, while health discretionary outlays remained between 0.3% and 0.5% of GDP over the same period. The appendix provides a description and legislative origins of each health tax expenditure provision identified by the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT), with some provisions being long-standing in the Internal Revenue Code. Health tax expenditures have grown steadily from 0.3% of GDP in FY1974 to 1.5% in FY2014. Some provisions are among the longest-standing in the Internal Revenue Code, with origins in past legal definitions or administrative rulings.
