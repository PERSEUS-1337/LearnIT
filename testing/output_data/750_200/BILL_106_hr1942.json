The Congress finds that free trade agreements improve income and prosperity by increasing competition, eliminating inefficiencies, and lowering costs for manufacturers and consumers. APEC's 21 member economies, representing over half of world production and global trade, are committed to achieving \"free and open trade\" by 2020 for developing countries and by 2010 for developed countries. The United States has a commitment to achieving free and open trade in the Pacific Rim region by 2020 for developing countries and by 2010 for developed countries. This is crucial for economic growth, creating new trade opportunities, and reducing trade barriers. The financial crisis in Asia has caused significant disruptions. The financial crisis in Asia has disrupted the rapid growth of US exports to the region from 1989-1997. Free trade agreement negotiations are crucial in the current world economy to counter protectionist policies and open markets for US goods and services. Building closer ties with countries like New Zealand, Australia, and Singapore, who are long-time allies of the United States in trade liberalization efforts, will provide leverage for market opening measures for US goods and services. This coordination will be beneficial as trade negotiations for liberalization progress in the next century. The United States must continue promoting its interests in the Asia-Pacific region through aggressive trade negotiations to achieve liberalization. Bilateral trade agreement talks have a positive impact on multilateral and regional trade discussions by expanding common areas of agreement on trade disciplines. Trade and investment disputes between the United States and Pacific Rim countries could be more effectively resolved through mutually agreed-upon disciplines and dispute settlement mechanisms in free trade agreements. This approach would provide a firm foundation for enhanced cooperation and avoid issue-by-issue confrontations under trade remedy laws. Free trade agreements between the United States and Pacific Rim countries will enhance cooperation and market access, stabilizing the bilateral trade balance. The United States trade policy with eligible Pacific Rim countries is outlined in Section 2. The United States aims to eliminate tariff and nontariff barriers through bilateral free trade agreements with Pacific Rim countries. Nontariff barriers include regulatory obstacles, denial of national treatment for services and foreign investment, and inadequate protection for intellectual property rights.
