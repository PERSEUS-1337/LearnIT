    "content": "The Act titled \"Coastal Resources Enhancement and Restoration Act of 2000\" mandates that a minimum of 10 percent of engineering research grants from the National Science Foundation be allocated for coastal engineering and shoreline protection research starting in fiscal year 2001. Additionally, supplemental environmental programs in coastal areas are established. SEC. 3 of the Coastal Resources Enhancement and Restoration Act of 2000 amends Section 313 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to allow federal agencies violating the Act to choose constructing artificial reefs or aquatic habitat restoration projects instead of paying fines. SEC. 4. ACCESS TO PUBLICLY OWNED SHORES. (a) Eligibility of Shoreline Protection Projects.--Subsection (d) of the Act authorizing Federal participation in protecting publicly owned shores is amended to consider shores with insufficient public access as privately owned. (b) Cost Sharing.--Section 103(d) of the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 is amended to include additional provisions. The Secretary of the Army will issue rules to ensure public access to publicly owned shores with insufficient access, as defined in the Water Resources Development Act of 1986. The Secretary will ensure public access to every one-half mile of publicly owned shore with exceptions for environmentally sensitive areas. SEC. 5. BEACH NOURISHMENT ACCOUNT. Establishment of the Beach Nourishment Account in the Treasury to receive funds from the general fund under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act for beach nourishment without needing further appropriation. The Beach Nourishment Account is established under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to receive funds for beach nourishment. Funds in the account can be used without further appropriation for a pilot program by the Secretary of Commerce and the Administrator of NASA, as well as for projects for beach nourishment, shore protection, and beach erosion control by the Secretary of the Army. The Beach Nourishment Account receives funds for beach nourishment, shore protection, and erosion control projects. The Secretary of the Army is responsible for carrying out these projects in accordance with cost-sharing requirements and other applicable regulations. Transactions involving the funds in the account must be reported annually to Congress. The Secretary of the Treasury invests the account funds in interest-bearing obligations of the United States, either on original issue or by purchasing outstanding obligations at market price. The account funds are invested in US obligations either on original issue or by purchasing outstanding obligations at market price. Any acquired obligations can be sold at market price, with interest and proceeds credited to the account. SEC. 6. COMPREHENSIVE OCEAN OBSERVING SYSTEM PILOT PROGRAM. The Secretary of Commerce and the Administrator of NASA will jointly implement a pilot program to establish a comprehensive ocean monitoring network in the United States. They will partner with local and regional entities to collect a wide range of data on coastal oceans and inland waterways for real-time availability to interested parties. The pilot program will collect information on coastal oceans and inland waterways in real-time, including wave heights, currents, mammal movement, sewage outfall, water quality, fishing boat tracking, and oil spill tracking. The pilot program will collect real-time data on coastal oceans and inland waterways, including wave heights, currents, mammal movement, sewage outfall, water quality, fishing boat tracking for illegal foreign whalers, oil spill tracking, beach erosion data, weather, river mouth outflow sediment observation, and global information system coastal mapping. Federal cooperation with the Geological Survey, Navy, and Environmental Protection Agency is required, and two regional test projects will be established. The Secretary and the Administrator will establish 2 regional test projects, one in Southern California Bight and the other at a location to be determined. They will coordinate existing efforts in monitoring ocean conditions without replacing or duplicating them. The Beach Nourishment Account will provide $4,000,000 annually from 2001 to 2006 for coordinating ocean monitoring efforts and collecting new information. $2,000,000 per year will be allocated to each of the 2 regional test projects mentioned in the section."
