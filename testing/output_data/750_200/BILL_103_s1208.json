    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Independence Hall Commemorative Coin Act\". The Congress finds that historic buildings in Philadelphia, including Congress Hall and Independence Hall, were cared for by local government units before the Federal Government took over. The Federal Government, through the National Park Service, now preserves and maintains historic sites in the United States due to financial constraints and increased responsibilities. This includes the minting and issuance of United States coins. The Federal Government uses United States coins to commemorate historic buildings and fund their maintenance and preservation due to financial constraints. SEC. 3. COIN SPECIFICATIONS. The Secretary of the Treasury will issue up to 1,000,000 $1 coins made of 90% silver and 10% copper, weighing 26.73 grams and with a diameter of 1.500 inches. The design will feature the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall, symbolizing national shrines of liberty. Each coin will display the coin's value and inscriptions. The coins issued under this Act shall have inscriptions of the year 1994, \"Liberty\", \"In God We Trust\", \"United States of America\", and \"E Pluribus Unum\", and will be legal tender as per section 5103 of title 31, United States Code. The Secretary will obtain silver for the coins from stockpiles under the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act. The design for the coins will be chosen by the Secretary in consultation with the Commission of Fine Arts and reviewed by the Citizens Commemorative Coin Advisory Committee. SEC. 6. ISSUANCE OF THE COINS. The coins authorized under this Act may be issued in uncirculated and proof qualities at a designated Mint facility for a period of up to 1 year after enactment. The coins issued under this Act will be sold by the Secretary at a price equal to the face value, a surcharge, and the cost of designing and issuing the coins. Bulk sales will be offered at a discount, and prepaid orders will be accepted with a discount as well. A surcharge of $7 per coin is required for all sales. SEC. 8. GENERAL WAIVER OF PROCUREMENT REGULATIONS. No procurement laws apply to goods/services for this Act. Compliance with equal employment laws is still required. SEC. 9. DISTRIBUTION OF SURCHARGES. The Secretary collects surcharges from coin sales under this Act. 50% goes to the Treasury to reduce the national debt, and 50% goes to the Independence Hall Preservation Fund for various preservation efforts. The Independence Hall Preservation Fund uses surcharges from coin sales to preserve buildings in Independence National Historic Park and meet other needs deemed appropriate by the Directors to foster respect and admiration for the park. The Comptroller General of the United States has the right to audit the Independence Hall Preservation Fund's expenditure of amounts paid under section 9. The coins issued under this Act are subject to the Numismatic Public Enterprise Fund provisions. Financial assurances are outlined in section 12.
