The Act imposes strict liability on these parties. The \"Gun Violence Economic Equity Act of 1993\" imposes strict liability on defendants in actions brought under section 2(a) for damages arising from bodily injury or death resulting from the discharge of a handgun or assault weapon. Defenses include injury while committing a felony and self-inflicted injury. The plaintiff's injury may not result in liability if it is proven that it was self-inflicted or caused by a law enforcement officer or a member of the United States Armed Forces in the performance of their duties. The court may award a reasonable attorney's fee to the prevailing party in an action brought under section 2(a) involving the use of a handgun or assault weapon issued by the United States or its agencies. The statute of limitations for bringing an action under section 2(a) is 2 years from the discovery of the injury. This Act applies only to handguns and assault weapons manufactured, imported, or transferred in the United States after its effective date. It does not limit other causes of action available to individuals injured by the discharge of a handgun or assault weapon. The Act defines a handgun as a firearm with a barrel less than 12 inches and an assault weapon as a firearm with a barrel of 12 inches or more capable of using large capacity magazines or a semiautomatic firearm not suitable for sporting purposes. The Act defines a large capacity ammunition magazine as a detachable device with a capacity of 15 or more rounds. A semiautomatic firearm is defined as a repeating firearm that requires a separate trigger pull for each cartridge. The term \"law enforcement officer\" includes officers, agents, or employees authorized to prevent, detect, investigate, or prosecute violations of law. Additionally, the terms \"firearm\", \"importer\", \"manufacturer\", and \"dealer\" are defined in section 921(a) of title 18, United States Code. The Act applies to conduct after a 20-day period from enactment."
