    "content": "Smart meter technology is a crucial part of the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) for the smart grid, enabling the two-way flow of electricity and information. Privacy and security concerns arise from the meters' functions of recording real-time data on electricity usage, transmitting data to the smart grid, and receiving communications for demand response. AMI has various beneficial uses, allowing utilities to manage energy consumption, notify outages, and improve billing accuracy. Smart meters increase energy efficiency, integrate electric vehicles and renewable energy, improve grid reliability against cyber attacks and natural disasters, and reduce peak electricity demand. However, the detailed data they collect raises privacy and security concerns as it is transmitted to utilities and potentially intercepted or stolen. The deployment of smart meters funded by government initiatives raises privacy and security concerns as detailed data is collected and transmitted to utilities. The Smart Grid Investment Grant program has helped deploy millions of meters, with a projected total of 15.5 million meters installed. The Institute for Electric Efficiency projects that 65 million smart meters will be in operation in the US by 2015. The installation of smart meters may have legal implications related to privacy, cybersecurity, data retention, and consumer protection. This report examines federal laws that may apply to consumer data collected by smart meters and the implications for consumers, law enforcement, utilities, and hackers. This report explores federal laws concerning smart grid technology and consumer data protection. It focuses on data storage in smart meters, data transmission to the smart grid, and data storage on grid computers. State and local laws, as well as cybersecurity standards, are not addressed. Federal privacy safeguards under the Federal Privacy Act of 1974 apply to smart meter data held by federal agencies. The Privacy Act of 1974 protects smart meter data held by federal agencies and federally owned electric utilities. The Federal Trade Commission can enforce privacy policies and protect meter data from unauthorized access. Fourth Amendment protection for smart meter data is unclear, but it may be safeguarded under the Stored Communications Act, Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and Electronic Communications Privacy Act. Residential smart meters raise privacy and cybersecurity concerns due to the detailed information they provide on energy usage. The National Institute of Standards and Technology identified two main issues: privacy concerns about revealing activities inside a home and fears of inadequate cybersecurity measures leading to misuse of data. Law enforcement may still access smart meter data for investigative purposes under the SCA, ECPA, and FISA. Smart meters offer detailed real-time energy usage data, measuring consumption as frequently as once every minute. By analyzing this data, it is possible to identify specific appliances used and their usage patterns throughout the day. Research has shown that analyzing 15-minute interval aggregate household energy consumption data can pinpoint the use of most major home appliances. The Utilities Commission discussed an Italian study using artificial neural networks to identify heavy-load appliance usage with 90% accuracy from smart meter data. Software algorithms can extract appliance signatures from less detailed data, revealing occupants' behavior and home occupancy patterns. Smart meters can also reveal daily schedules, alarm systems, expensive electronic equipment ownership, and occupancy status. Smart meter data can be used to decipher home occupants' activities by matching electricity usage with appliance load signatures. This information has been used by law enforcement in investigations, such as in the case of United States v. Kyllo where high electricity usage indicated possible illegal activities. Law enforcement can monitor household activities by analyzing electricity usage data from smart meters. This data can reveal occupants' daily schedules and appliance usage, which could be valuable to third parties like health insurance companies, appliance manufacturers, marketers, and even criminals planning burglaries. Smart meters can provide detailed information about a consumer's daily activities and appliance usage, which could be exploited by criminals to time burglaries. Even anonymized data can sometimes be linked back to individuals, revealing personal information such as location and travel history. Additionally, smart grids store a wide range of data including account holder details, billing information, networked appliances, and transactional records. Smart grid technology relies on two-way communication between smart meters and utilities to increase energy efficiency and reliability. Various wireless technologies transmit data to the grid, including twisted-copper phone lines, fiber optic cable, and cellular networks. The Department of Energy outlines four tiers in a typical utility network for data collection and transmission. Energy usage data moves from the smart meter to an aggregation point outside the residence, such as a substation or utility pole-mounted device. The aggregation points gather data from multiple meters and transmit it to the utility using various technologies. Utilities prefer using their private networks for communication with smart meters due to reliability and cost-effectiveness. Consumer data in a smart grid is stored in multiple locations, making it vulnerable to interception by unauthorized parties. The movement of data in smart meters increases vulnerability to interception by unauthorized parties. Police access to smart meter data raises privacy concerns as it can track residents' daily activities in their homes. The Fourth Amendment restricts police access to smart meter data, ensuring protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. Two primary questions must be asked to determine if there has been a Fourth Amendment violation: whether there was state action and whether the person had an expectation of privacy. Analogous cases may provide guidance in assessing potential violations. The Fourth Amendment restricts police access to smart meter data, requiring state action and a reasonable expectation of privacy for Fourth Amendment review. The state action doctrine determines if access to smart meter data warrants further review under the Fourth Amendment. Civil liberties protections in the U.S. Constitution apply to actions by state and federal governments, requiring a connection to government for constitutional rights violations. The state action test determines if a utility's smart meter data collection is governed by the Fourth Amendment. Privately and publicly owned utilities are analyzed for constitutional differences under the state action doctrine. Exceptions to the Fourth Amendment rule include when a utility performs a government function or acts as a state actor. The Fourth Amendment may apply when a private utility acts as an agent of the police. Under the public function exception, a private entity is treated as a state actor when it assumes a role traditionally played by the government. Private utilities do not typically satisfy this exception. In Jackson v. Metropolitan Edison Co., the Supreme Court ruled that a privately owned utility was not a state actor, despite heavy regulation by the state. The Court found that providing utility service is not solely a state prerogative and there was no symbiotic relationship with the state. While a privately owned utility could potentially be considered a state actor under certain circumstances, the Fourth Amendment may apply if the government directs their actions. Private searches without police involvement are typically not governed by the Fourth Amendment, unless there is significant government participation. If a private actor conducts a search at the government's request, they are considered an \"instrument or agent of the state\" and must follow Fourth Amendment rules. This applies even on a broad, programmatic level, as seen in cases where privately owned airlines were required to implement security measures by the government. In such cases, searches conducted by private entities as part of a nationwide effort are considered 'state action' under the Fourth Amendment. If a private party is required to conduct a search or collect data under federal or state laws, it constitutes 'state action' for Fourth Amendment purposes. The government cannot bypass Fourth Amendment protections by using private parties to carry out searches. This agency theory may apply to the collection of smart meter data, where government instigation could trigger further analysis. If police request utility customer data for suspicious energy spikes, Fourth Amendment scrutiny may be warranted. Government use of smart meter data in a dragnet law enforcement scheme could implicate state action. Fourth Amendment may not always apply to public actors collecting information. The Supreme Court has considered the Fourth Amendment in noncriminal investigations and noninvestigatory governmental conduct. Two lines of cases may apply to smart meters, where the Fourth Amendment may not apply or may be reduced based on the government's purpose in collecting data. The \"special needs\" doctrine allows suspicionless searches if the special needs outweigh privacy intrusion, beyond normal law enforcement needs. The special needs doctrine allows suspicionless searches if the purpose is not for law enforcement but for public safety or government integrity. The Fourth Amendment does not apply if the conduct aims to benefit the government in investigative or administrative capacities. In United States v. Attson, the Ninth Circuit ruled that blood collection by a government-employed physician for medical purposes, not for a governmental investigation, did not violate the Fourth Amendment. Applying this to smart meters, if data collection is for business purposes or energy efficiency, it likely does not violate the Fourth Amendment. The Fourth Amendment would seemingly apply if a publicly owned utility collects data for law enforcement purposes. Law enforcement access to smart meter data may be unrestricted under a public records theory, as public records are not typically protected by the Fourth Amendment. The inquiry focuses on whether utility records are considered public records, which varies by state. Some states allow public inspection of municipally owned electric utility records, while others provide statutory and constitutional protections. Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina consider city-operated utility records as public records open for inspection. Oklahoma explicitly permits access to certain utility records. Oklahoma allows access to utility records, including address, service rates, charges, and payment details. Some confidentiality is protected, such as credit information and social security numbers. Other states like Washington and North Carolina also have specific protections for utility records. Determining if smart meter data is a public record or if a utility is a state actor is just the beginning. This determination does not prevent law enforcement from accessing the data but triggers a Fourth Amendment analysis on privacy expectations. The government cannot intrude where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy. Cases have shown that privacy interests in information provided to businesses may not be constitutionally protected. The third-party doctrine allows police access to certain information provided by customers to businesses without Fourth Amendment constraints. However, smart meters raise concerns about erosion of privacy rights due to technological advancements, as they provide more detailed and intimate information about individuals. The use of smart meters raises concerns about privacy rights due to the detailed information they can provide about individuals, potentially warranting increased constitutional scrutiny. The increased use of technology in private lives exposes more personal activities, including those within the home, leading to concerns about the potential access to personal information by various entities. The third-party doctrine historically allowed police access to information shared with businesses without Fourth Amendment protection. This raises questions about the level of constitutional protection needed as technology exposes more personal information in our lives. The third-party doctrine allows police access to business records like telephone, bank, motel registration, and cell phone records. Customers are seen to assume the risk and consent to such access. Lower courts have applied this to analog utility meters. In Miller v. United States, the Court allowed ATF agents to subpoena bank records without a warrant, stating it did not violate the Fourth Amendment. The Supreme Court broadened the third-party doctrine, allowing government access to information shared with third parties without violating the Fourth Amendment. In Smith v. Maryland, the Court extended this doctrine to outgoing phone numbers dialed from a person's telephone, allowing police to track numbers without a warrant. The Court in Smith v. Maryland allowed police to track outgoing phone numbers without a warrant, citing the third-party doctrine. This doctrine states that individuals have no expectation of privacy in information voluntarily shared with third parties, such as telephone companies. In United States v. Starkweather and United States v. McIntyre, courts ruled that individuals do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in their utility records, allowing warrantless access to these records. The Ninth Circuit compared utility records to phone records, while the Eighth Circuit emphasized that the means of obtaining information was legally significant. The court in United States v. Hamilton held that obtaining power records from a third-party through an administrative subpoena is legally significant, moving this situation away from home privacy cases into the third-party line. It is uncertain if this analysis would apply to smart meters, but courts may aim for a clear rule to govern third-party circumstances and utility services administration. This rule should be easy to apply, allowing utilities to manage their affairs effectively and preventing wrongdoers from using third-party services to conceal their crimes. The use of smart meters raises privacy concerns due to the information generated in the home, protected by the Fourth Amendment. Three key considerations include privacy expectations at home, the detailed information conveyed by smart meters, and the lack of consent for data release. This differs from traditional third-party cases, where the location of the search may now hold constitutional significance. The Court has emphasized the importance of the right to privacy in one's home, stating that it is a core aspect of the Fourth Amendment. Technology advancements may lead to a shift in privacy doctrine, as seen in cases like Kyllo v. United States where the use of thermal-imaging devices raised Fourth Amendment concerns regarding government intrusion into the home. The use of a thermal imager outside Kyllo's home revealed areas of high heat, leading to a search warrant being issued. Inside, agents found a marijuana growing operation. Justice Scalia emphasized the importance of warrantless searches being unreasonable in most cases. The Court held that warrantless searches of the home are unreasonable, anchored in the Fourth Amendment's protection of privacy. The minimal expectation of privacy within homes is crucial to prevent police technology from eroding this constitutional right. The Supreme Court ruled that using technology to gather information about the interior of a home without physical intrusion is considered a search, especially if the technology is not widely available. This decision upholds the expectation of privacy within homes as constitutionally protected. In another case, the Court prohibited monitoring the location of a beeper inside a residence, emphasizing the importance of safeguarding home privacy. The Supreme Court ruled that monitoring a beeper in a private residence without a warrant violates Fourth Amendment rights, emphasizing the sanctity of the home as a protected space. Smart meters, like in the cases of Kyllo and Karo, raise concerns about privacy and Fourth Amendment rights. The potential for these meters to gather detailed information about activities inside a home may require a warrant for law enforcement to access such data. The Supreme Court has previously ruled against invasive investigative techniques, indicating that smart meters could pose similar privacy issues. Smart meters may gather intimate details about our daily activities, raising concerns about privacy and Fourth Amendment rights. The level of intrusion from smart meter data suggests a reasonable expectation of privacy. The question of whether smart meters are in \"general public use\" remains unclear, with some courts comparing them to night vision goggles. In 2009, the Department of Energy estimated that 4.75% of all electric meters were smart meters. The Department of Energy estimated in 2009 that 4.75% of electric meters were smart meters, projecting an increase of 52 million meters by 2012. The means of data collection between thermal-imaging in Kyllo and smart meters differ, with smart meters having utility companies compile data subpoenaed by police. The application of the third-party doctrine in this context remains uncertain. The mosaic theory suggests that continuous surveillance of one's activities is more invasive than isolated observations, intersecting with dragnet law enforcement techniques. The Supreme Court has not formally adopted this theory, but there is potential interest. In United States v. Jones, police used GPS tracking to monitor movements. In United States v. Jones, the Supreme Court ruled that attaching a GPS device to track a person's movements constitutes a search under the Fourth Amendment. Justices Scalia, Alito, and Sotomayor all agreed that prolonged GPS monitoring violates privacy expectations. Sotomayor agreed that GPS monitoring creates a detailed record of a person's movements, reflecting various personal associations. The opinion below used the mosaic theory to argue that such data can reveal intimate details about a person's life. While the Jones majority did not fully embrace this theory, five justices showed interest in it. Similar concerns have been raised about the use of smart meter data by police, which could provide extensive personal information. Smart meters provide rich personal data that goes beyond traditional analog meters, revealing detailed daily activities and appliance usage. This data could potentially be subject to the mosaic theory, suggesting a potential invasion of privacy. The dragnet theory may also apply, where continuous surveillance could be seen as a violation of privacy rights. Smart meters may push into the dragnet category due to their 24-hour access to intimate daily activities. The difference in data sophistication between traditional third-party cases and smart meters is highlighted by comparing Smith with Katz. The Smith Court limited pen registers to telephone numbers dialed, while smart meters can collect minute-by-minute activity inside the home, resembling Katz more than Smith. The nature of services and customer consent differentiate traditional third-party cases from smart meters, where customers may assume the risk or consent to sharing information. The consent theory states that disclosing information to a third-party constitutes valid consent to a search. Unlike banking or telephone services where customers can switch providers, electric utilities are monopolies, making it impractical to avoid the recordation of electric usage. Electricity is deemed a necessary component of modern life, making it difficult to terminate utility service. Electricity is a necessary component of modern life, requiring disclosure of identity and usage to the power company. Customers may not fully understand the data collected by smart meters. Smart meters can collect detailed data sets, including usage of specific appliances, raising privacy concerns. The legal implications of smart meters under the Fourth Amendment and federal communication and privacy statutes remain uncertain. Recent decades have seen legislative privacy rules governing new technologies proving to be as protective, if not more so, than parallel Fourth Amendment rules. Federal statutory protections such as the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), the Stored Communications Act (SCA), and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) may apply to the contents of communications sent by smart meters, addressing interception and storage of electronic communications. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) prohibits the interception of electronic communications, including data transmitted by smart meters. Government entities can conduct surveillance under certain procedures and exceptions outlined in ECPA or the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Unlawful interception of electronic communications is punishable by law. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) prohibits unlawful interception of electronic communications, with penalties of up to five years imprisonment and fines up to $250,000 for individuals and $500,000 for organizations. ECPA allows interception with consent of a party involved. In the context of smart meter networks, if the utility consents to law enforcement interception of communication addressed to it, it may not violate ECPA. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) allows law enforcement to conduct surveillance activities without consent in certain criminal cases, with court orders based on probable cause. Information intercepted is limited in use and dissemination, and individuals must be notified when an interception order expires. Electronic surveillance can also be conducted in emergency situations. Additionally, surveillance can be authorized under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) governs electronic surveillance for gathering foreign intelligence information, including on international terrorist organizations. The government typically needs a court order from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) supported by probable cause to conduct surveillance under FISA. The Stored Communications Act (SCA) prohibits unauthorized access to electronic communications and transactional records. The Stored Communications Act (SCA) prohibits unauthorized access to electronic communications and limits disclosure of information by providers of electronic communication services or remote computing services. It also allows law enforcement to compel disclosure of stored communications. The SCA applies only to providers of ECS or RCS, not other entities. This report will examine if the SCA protects stored information collected by a smart meter. The report will analyze if a utility's smart meter network falls under the definition of an ECS or an RCS, discussing protections and disclosure restrictions. An ECS is defined as a service enabling electronic communications, including data transmission to the smart grid. The report will analyze if a utility's smart meter network falls under the definition of an ECS or an RCS, discussing protections and disclosure restrictions. Whether smart meters qualify as an ECS depends on their ability to transmit data to the smart grid. It is debated whether smart meters provide users with the ability to send or receive communications, as they may primarily transmit usage information to the utility. The Ninth Circuit has suggested that an ECS should not include situations where electronic communications are incidental to providing another service. Smart meters may not accurately be considered as users of smart meters, especially if the deployment is for the utility's benefit. However, some smart meters can benefit customers by providing data on energy efficiency. The classification of a smart meter network as an ECS depends on factors like marketing and intended purposes. The classification of a smart meter network as an ECS depends on factors like marketing and intended purposes. Transmissions containing smart meter data are protected under the SCA only while in electronic storage, which includes temporary storage for transmission or backup protection. Data on the smart meter itself before being sent to the utility is likely considered in electronic storage. The smart meter data is protected under the SCA while in electronic storage, whether on the meter or utility's servers. Unauthorized access to electronic communications in storage is prohibited by the SCA, with penalties including imprisonment for up to one year. Unauthorized access to electronic communications under the SCA can result in imprisonment for up to one year and/or a fine of up to $100,000. Violations for malicious purposes may lead to imprisonment for up to five years and/or a fine of up to $250,000. Victims of SCA violations can seek civil relief, including damages of at least $1,000. The SCA limits providers from disclosing communication contents in electronic storage, except in certain cases involving law enforcement. The statute allows disclosures to law enforcement by electronic communication service providers, either voluntarily or compelled. Voluntary disclosure is permitted if communication contents were inadvertently obtained and relate to a crime. The utility as the intended recipient of all smart meter network communications may share electronically stored information with law enforcement if the recipient consents, giving more flexibility than traditional ECS providers. The Stored Communications Act (SCA) requires a search warrant for recent communications, while communications stored for over 180 days can be obtained with a warrant, subpoena, or court order based on specific facts. Customers must be notified of disclosures, unless it poses a risk to safety, flight from prosecution, or evidence tampering. The Stored Communications Act (SCA) requires a search warrant for recent communications, while communications stored for over 180 days can be obtained with a warrant, subpoena, or court order based on specific facts. Customers must be notified of disclosures, unless it poses a risk to safety, flight from prosecution, or evidence tampering. The classification of a smart meter network as a Remote Computing Service (RCS) would depend on whether the data collected is provided as a service to the public or solely for the utility's internal benefit. The Stored Communications Act (SCA) generally protects electronically transmitted communications on smart meter networks classified as Remote Computing Services (RCS). Law enforcement can access the contents with a warrant, subpoena, or court order based on specific facts, with prior notice to the customer required in most cases. The Stored Communications Act (SCA) requires prior notice to customers before disclosing their information. RCS customers can pursue legal action for damages if their communications are disclosed unlawfully. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) prohibits unauthorized access to computers involved in interstate commerce. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) prohibits unauthorized access to computers involved in interstate commerce, such as servers on a utility's network and smart meters. Accessing these devices to obtain customer data without authorization would likely violate the CFAA. Unauthorized access to utility's network or smart meters can violate the CFAA, leading to criminal penalties including imprisonment and fines based on the severity of the offense. The FTC Act's Section 5 prohibits unfair or deceptive acts in commerce, allowing the FTC to enforce penalties on repeat offenders, including imprisonment and fines up to $250,000. The FTC has taken action against businesses for privacy violations, and could potentially enforce Section 5 on utilities for failing to protect smart meter data. The FTC has jurisdiction over investor-owned utilities but it is unclear for publicly owned and federally owned utilities. For-profit electric cooperatives can be subject to Section 5 enforcement, and nonprofit cooperatives may also be affected. The FTC can enforce Section 5 against \"persons, partnerships, or corporations\" without additional jurisdictional requirements. The FTC Act gives the FTC jurisdiction over investor-owned utilities, but it is unclear for publicly and federally owned utilities. For-profit electric cooperatives can be subject to Section 5 enforcement, and nonprofit cooperatives may also be affected. The FTC can enforce Section 5 against a wide variety of entities, including corporations, trusts, and associations organized for profit. The FTC Act gives the FTC jurisdiction over a wide variety of legal entities, including corporations, trusts, and associations organized for profit. The term \"corporation\" is interpreted broadly to include nonprofit entities that provide significant economic benefit to their members. The key factor in determining if an entity falls under Section 5 jurisdiction is whether it is organized for profit. Investor-owned utilities are considered \"corporations\" and are subject to FTC enforcement. The FTC has jurisdiction over investor-owned electric utilities classified as \"corporations\" for profit. It is uncertain if the FTC has jurisdiction over publicly owned utilities, such as municipals and State authorities, as they may be considered \"persons\" instead of \"corporations.\" Publicly owned utilities are nonprofit government entities exempt from state and federal income taxes, providing services to communities at cost. They obtain capital through debt issuance, not by selling ownership interests. These utilities do not fall under the FTC's jurisdiction as they are not organized for profit but to distribute electricity at cost. Any net income is either used to finance operations or transferred to the general fund of the political subdivision. Publicly owned utilities, exempt from income taxes, provide services at cost and finance operations through debt issuance. They are not organized for profit and do not distribute dividends. The FTC's jurisdiction over them as \"persons\" is uncertain, as seen in past cases involving state-chartered municipal corporations. The FTC has asserted jurisdiction over state government agencies regulating professions like dentistry and optometry. In a court case, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals discussed whether a State is considered a 'person' under the FTC's enforcement jurisdiction. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated a rule by the FTC, stating that the agency exceeded its statutory authority. The court debated whether publicly owned utilities are included as \"persons\" under the FTC Act, which lacks a clear definition. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals debated the inclusion of publicly owned utilities as \"persons\" under the FTC Act, which lacks a clear definition. Title 1, Section 1 of the United States Code includes corporations, companies, associations, firms, partnerships, societies, and joint stock companies as \"persons.\" However, Section 5 of the Act lists \"persons,\" \"partnerships,\" and \"corporations\" separately, indicating independent significance for each term. This suggests that the default definition of \"person\" in the Dictionary Act may not apply in this context. The FTC could potentially evade jurisdiction requirements by bringing complaints against entities as \"persons\" instead of \"corporations.\" The court in the California Optometry case did not defer to the FTC's interpretation of its jurisdiction, citing federalism principles over Chevron deference. The California Optometry court referenced the Supreme Court's decision in Will v. Michigan Department of State Police, stating that the term \"person\" typically excludes the sovereign. The Will case involved determining if a state could be considered a \"person\" under 42 U.S.C. \u00a71983, with the Court emphasizing the importance of clear language in statutes that alter the balance between states and the federal government. The Court's decision in Will and California Optometry suggests that Congress must clearly indicate in a statute when subjecting states to new liability, especially if it alters the balance between state and federal authority. There is uncertainty if Congress intended \"persons\" in the FTC Act to include publicly owned utilities. If FTC enforcement against a utility changes the state-federal balance, courts may exclude utilities from the definition of \"persons.\" The determination may hinge on whether the utility's operation reflects state sovereignty. The operation of a state-owned utility may be considered as the state acting in its sovereign capacity or engaging in a proprietary function, which could impact the jurisdiction of the FTC. The interpretation of whether a state is acting in its sovereign capacity or engaging in a proprietary function under the antitrust laws' state action doctrine is complex and may vary. The court could potentially exclude utilities from the definition of \"persons\" under the FTC Act based on federalism principles and the clear statement rule established in previous court cases. The California Optometry court considered whether government entities should be included as \"persons\" under antitrust laws, noting that states can be considered persons for antitrust purposes. However, the court ultimately rejected this argument, stating that states acting in a sovereign capacity are exempt from antitrust laws. This could limit the FTC's enforcement jurisdiction, but if a state operates a public utility in a proprietary capacity, the state action doctrine may not apply. The FTC argues that state boards it asserts jurisdiction over may not be considered states acting in their sovereign capacities, potentially allowing courts to find jurisdiction under the California Optometry case. The interpretation of \"persons\" in Section 5 regarding government entities like publicly owned utilities is uncertain and may depend on statutory construction principles adopted by the court. This includes whether the state is acting in a sovereign capacity or engaging in a proprietary function under the antitrust laws' state action doctrine. The interpretation of \"persons\" in Section 5 regarding government entities like publicly owned utilities is ambiguous. Courts may defer to the FTC's broad interpretation of its jurisdiction under the Chevron doctrine or consider principles of federalism. It is unclear whether the FTC could enforce Section 5 against a federally. The FTC's jurisdiction over federally owned utilities under Section 5 is uncertain due to the ambiguity of whether they can be considered \"corporations\" or \"persons.\" Enforcement may not be necessary for smart meter data due to other federal laws in place. The FTC's jurisdiction over electric cooperatives, including for-profit and nonprofit entities, under Section 5 is uncertain. Most electric cooperatives, especially those receiving funds from the Smart Grid Investment Grant program, are nonprofits. It is possible that the FTC would have jurisdiction over these nonprofit cooperatives as \"corporations\" organized for profit. Electric cooperatives, whether for-profit or nonprofit, are owned by the consumers they serve. Nonprofit cooperatives must provide electric service at cost and return any excess revenues to members as equity. This is in contrast to publicly owned utilities that transfer net income to the government. The FTC's jurisdiction over nonprofit cooperatives under Section 5 is uncertain. While it is unclear if the FTC has jurisdiction over nonprofit electric cooperatives that return net margins to consumer-members, the Supreme Court has provided guidance on factors to consider. In California Dental Ass'n v. FTC, the Court ruled that the FTC could enforce Section 5 against a nonprofit association providing benefits to members. The FTC has jurisdiction over nonprofit associations that provide benefits to members, including those that operate for the profit of its members. The Court did not specify a percentage of activities aimed at members' pecuniary benefit to determine FTC jurisdiction. The Court ruled that a \"proximate relation\" must exist between an entity's activities and its members' profits for FTC jurisdiction. Nonprofit entities organized for for-profit members can still be subject to FTC enforcement under Section 5. In American Medical Ass'n v. FTC, the Second Circuit considered the FTC's jurisdiction over medical professional associations, including the American Medical Association. The court found jurisdiction over medical professional associations, such as the American Medical Association, due to their business activities like lobbying and offering business advice to members, despite their primary charitable and social aspects. In contrast, the Eighth Circuit ruled that nonprofit blood banks were not subject to FTC jurisdiction under Section 5. The court exempted nonprofit blood banks from FTC jurisdiction under Section 5 due to their charitable purposes, lack of profit distribution to members, and asset transfer to other charitable organizations upon dissolution. The court may consider various factors to determine if a private, nonprofit entity like an electric cooperative is subject to FTC's Section 5 jurisdiction as a \"corporation.\" The key factor is whether the nonprofit provides an economic benefit to its members that is more than de minimis and related to its activities. Other factors include profit from business activities, ownership of capital shares, not solely charitable purposes, profit-seeking objectives in articles of incorporation, and being subject to gain exceeding expenditures. The FTC may have jurisdiction over nonprofit electric cooperatives if they provide economic benefits to members through electricity service and returning net margins as patronage capital. This could be considered an \"economic benefit\" under Section 5, depending on the individual utility's characteristics. Electricity service is considered an \"economic benefit\" as defined in case law, similar to advantageous insurance and lobbying services provided by nonprofit associations. It enables members to conduct business profitably and is a significant economic benefit for both business and recreational purposes. The primary objective of an electric cooperative is to provide this service to members, establishing a necessary proximate relation between the nonprofit's activities and the benefit to its members. The nonprofit's activities provide a benefit to its members, but there are issues with considering patronage capital as an \"economic benefit\" as defined by the Court. It may be seen as a loan or a refund of money collected from members. Even if it is considered an economic benefit, it may be minimal. The Supreme Court did not hold that patronage capital must provide immediate advantage to members of a nonprofit. However, the long delay in cash payments could decrease the economic benefit it offers. If a cooperative's net margins are small, patronage capital may be considered de minimis. It is uncertain how a court would view the economic benefit of patronage capital in such cases. The economic benefit of patronage capital to cooperative members is uncertain, as it is unclear if it meets the criteria for providing an advantage. Factors favoring jurisdiction include cooperatives having capital stock, operating for the benefit of members, and returning net margins as patronage capital. Factors specific to each individual cooperative that cannot be evaluated include revenue exceeding expenditures, objectives in foundational documents, tax exemption status, asset distribution upon dissolution, and economic benefits to members through electricity distribution or patronage capital. Generalizations are difficult due to varying factors for each cooperative. The FTC's jurisdiction over electric utilities for privacy and security practices with smart meter data is determined on a case-by-case basis. The FTC can take enforcement action if practices are deemed unfair or deceptive, defined as causing substantial harm to consumers and likely to mislead them. The FTC enforces consumer data privacy and security practices by bringing complaints against entities that engage in deceptive or unfair acts. Violations can result from failing to comply with stated privacy policies or adequately secure consumer data. Failure to protect consumer data may be considered both unfair and deceptive practices. For example, a utility that fails to comply with its privacy policy may engage in deceptive acts under the FTC Act. In the case of Facebook, Inc., the FTC alleged violations of promises in its privacy policy. Facebook violated its privacy policy by allowing third parties access to users' personal information without consent, causing harm to users and sharing personal information with advertisers despite promises not to do so. The FTC alleged that Twitter engaged in \"deceptive\" acts by violating its privacy policy and failing to use appropriate security measures to protect user data. Twitter agreed to improve its privacy controls and implement a comprehensive information security program. The FTC may find it deceptive for utilities to share consumer information without consent or falsely claim privacy controls for smart meter data. It could be considered unfair if utilities do not protect smart meter data from technology threats. In a similar case with DSW Inc., the FTC took action against the company for failing to safeguard customer payment information. The FTC charged a company for creating unnecessary risks by storing information in multiple files, not using security measures to limit access, storing information in unencrypted files, not limiting network connections, and failing to detect unauthorized access. In a case involving Cardsystems Solutions, Inc., the FTC alleged that the company failed to protect its systems from known attacks, leading to unauthorized access to personal information. As part of settlement agreements, the company had to implement a comprehensive information security program. Smart meters also transmit personal consumer information wirelessly across different networks. The FTC may consider a utility's failure to protect smart meter data against common technology threats as an \"unfair\" practice. This could include not encrypting the data, storing it in fewer places, implementing basic wireless network security, and taking other reasonable measures. Failure to dispose of smart meter data safely could also be deemed \"unfair,\" as seen in a case involving Rite Aid Corp. where personal information was not securely disposed of.
