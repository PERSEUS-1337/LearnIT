The \"Municipal Waste Flow Control Transition Act of 1995\" authorizes states and local governments to exercise flow control authority over municipal solid waste and recyclable materials within their jurisdiction, directing them to designated waste management facilities. This authority is only valid if imposed by a legally binding provision before May 15, 1994. The authority of this section applies to specific classes or categories of municipal solid waste for which flow control authority was imposed before May 15, 1994. If waste types are not clearly identified, the authority only applies to household-generated waste. The authority of subsections (a) and (b) applies to contracts for waste or recyclable materials movement until completion of payment for facility costs, as of May 15, 1994. This includes contracts directed by local governments for waste disposal. The authority for flow control of municipal solid waste may be granted to a political subdivision if certain conditions are met, including a commitment to designate waste management facilities for transportation or disposal of waste generated within its boundaries. A commitment to designate waste management facilities is demonstrated by factors such as permits, contracts, revenue bonds, and permit applications submitted before May 15, 1994. The state or political subdivision may authorize the diversion of solid wastes to a different facility for higher environmental protection or liability reduction upon request from a waste generator. The state or political subdivision may authorize the diversion of solid wastes to a different facility for higher environmental protection or liability reduction upon request from a waste generator. Requests should include information on the environmental suitability of the proposed alternative treatment or disposal facility compared to the designated facility. Laws implementing flow control authority in compliance with this section are considered reasonable regulations of commerce and not undue burdens on interstate commerce. The Administrator, in cooperation with the National Academy of Public Administration and the Secretary, conducts a flow control study. The National Academy of Public Administration and the Secretary of the Treasury will conduct a study on the impact of the Supreme Court decision in C&A Carbone v Clarkstown, New York on financing for solid waste management. The study will assess its effects on state waste management plans, recycling, and composting. A report with recommendations for legislation, if necessary, will be submitted to Congress by March 31, 1996. This section will not affect any other environmental laws. The section clarifies that it does not impact other laws related to human health, environment protection, or waste management. It also specifies that political subdivisions cannot use flow control authority inconsistently with state law and that no entity can force the transfer of recyclable materials. The section prohibits the transfer of recyclable materials for transformation or remanufacture unless voluntarily made available to the State or political subdivision. Municipal solid waste includes various materials from households, commercial, institutional, and industrial sources. The curr_chunk defines residue as waste material left after recyclable materials are separated from waste for disposal, excluding hazardous waste, contaminated soil, debris from environmental response actions, construction debris, and medical waste. The curr_chunk defines recyclable materials as materials separated from waste for recycling, composting, or reuse, excluding hazardous waste, industrial waste, and sludge. The curr_chunk further defines terms related to waste management, including waste management facility and flow control authority. The curr_chunk defines the terms 'designate' and 'designation' as the requirement of a State or political subdivision to direct waste or recyclable materials to designated facilities. The table of contents for Subtitle D of the Solid Waste Disposal Act is amended to include Congressional authorization of State and local government control over the movement of municipal solid waste and recyclable materials."
