    "content": "Lilly Ledbetter worked at Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company from 1979 to 1998. Despite initially receiving a salary similar to her male colleagues, a pay disparity developed over time. In 1997, she was paid significantly less than her male counterparts. Ledbetter filed a discrimination charge with the EEOC, alleging gender-based pay discrimination. She claimed her low pay was a result of Goodyear's pervasive discrimination against female managers. A jury ruled in her favor. The Supreme Court reviewed the Ledbetter case to resolve disagreement among appellate courts on the time limit for filing claims in Title VII disparate treatment pay cases. Under Title VII, it is unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an individual with respect to compensation based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. The question in Ledbetter's case was how to determine what activities constitute an unlawful employment practice. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Goodyear in the Ledbetter case, stating that Ledbetter's suit was time-barred. Ledbetter argued that paychecks issued to her and a 1998 decision denying her a raise constituted separate acts of discrimination within the 180-day period preceding her EEOC claim. Goodyear contended that the discriminatory acts affecting her pay had occurred before the 180-day period. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Goodyear in the Ledbetter case, holding that Ledbetter's suit was time-barred because no discriminatory acts occurred within the 180-day charging period. The Court emphasized the need for evidence of discriminatory intent in Title VII claims alleging disparate treatment. Since there was no proof of discriminatory intent by Goodyear when issuing paychecks or denying a raise, the Court found no unlawful employment practice during the specified time period. Ledbetter's claim of suffering from past discrimination's continuing effects was deemed insufficient to establish a claim within the filing period. The Ledbetter case ruling favored Goodyear, stating that the suit was time-barred due to no discriminatory acts within the 180-day filing period. The Court referenced precedents in similar discrimination cases to support their decision. The Court ruled that the EEOC charging period is triggered by a discrete unlawful practice, not subsequent nondiscriminatory acts. Discriminatory intent is crucial in claims of unlawful disparate treatment, as demonstrated in Ledbetter's case. Shifting intent to later paychecks would impose liability without required intent. The Court rejected Ledbetter's claim, concerned that it would impose liability without the required intent and undermine Title VII enforcement procedures and filing deadlines designed to prompt resolution of discrimination allegations. The Court also dismissed Ledbetter's reliance on Bazemore v. Friday, a pay discrimination case involving a discriminatory pay structure. The Ledbetter Court distinguished between Bazemore v. Friday and Ledbetter, stating that ongoing paychecks reflect a current violation of Title VII, while past paychecks reflect a past violation. The EEOC allows challenges based on discriminatory pay with each paycheck, but the Court did not defer to this interpretation. The dissent in Ledbetter disagreed, arguing that paying a discriminatory wage should be considered an unlawful employment practice to align with precedent and the purpose of Title VII. The dissent in Ledbetter argued that the Court's holding was inconsistent with Bazemore, contending that pay discrimination constitutes a fresh instance of discrimination with each paycheck. The dissent also compared pay discrimination claims to hostile work environment claims, allowing Ledbetter's claim to proceed. Pay discrimination was distinguished as fundamentally different from other types of employment bias. The dissent in Ledbetter argued that pay discrimination is different from other types of employment bias, as employees may not realize they are being discriminated against in terms of pay. The dissent criticized the majority's opinion for not aligning with the anti-discrimination purpose of Title VII. The Ledbetter decision was later overturned by statute, but at the time, it raised concerns about the difficulty of bringing pay discrimination claims under Title VII. The Ledbetter decision made it more challenging for employees to bring pay discrimination claims under Title VII, leading to an increase in claims being filed against employers. This affected various classes of claimants beyond just sex discrimination cases. The Ledbetter case impacted pay discrimination claims under various employment discrimination statutes, such as the ADEA, Rehabilitation Act, and ADA. Employees alleging race or age discrimination were more affected than those alleging sex discrimination, as the latter group still had recourse under the EPA, which has a statute of limitations but treats each unequal paycheck as a new discriminatory act. The Ledbetter decision led to congressional efforts to overturn it by clarifying that each unequal paycheck is a new discriminatory act under Title VII. The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 was passed to address this issue. The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 (H.R. 11 / S. 181) clarifies that the time limit for suing employers for pay discrimination starts with each paycheck issued, not just the original discriminatory action. This change applies to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)."
