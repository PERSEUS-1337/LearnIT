The Obama and Trump administrations focused on a comprehensive approach to combat drug use. Drug courts offer an alternative to incarceration by providing treatment and social services for offenders. Drug courts offer diversion programs for individuals arrested, providing treatment and reentry assistance to offenders. They help save on criminal justice costs, address substance abuse issues, and prevent rearrest. The federal government supports drug courts, and research shows their positive impact on offenders and court systems. Drug courts could also help address the opioid epidemic and emerging drug issues. Drug courts are specialized programs offering an alternative to traditional court processes for first-time, nonviolent offenders with substance abuse issues. They aim to reduce recidivism and substance abuse, often diverting participants post-arrest into treatment programs. Drug courts offer an alternative to traditional court processes for first-time, nonviolent offenders with substance abuse issues. Participants may plead guilty to charges to enter the program, with the possibility of amended sentences or expunged offenses upon completion. Some drug court programs are reentry programs for drug-addicted prisoners, providing treatment while reintegrating into the community. Various models of drug courts exist, including referrals as a condition of probation. Drug courts typically involve offender screening, risk assessment, judicial interaction, monitoring, supervision, sanctions, incentives, and treatment services. Managed by a team from criminal justice, social work, and treatment services, they use a multiphase treatment approach including stabilization, intensive treatment, and transition phases. Stabilization may include detoxification, assessment, and education, while intensive treatment involves counseling. The transition phase focuses on reintegration components like social integration, employment, education, and housing. Drug courts, established in 1989 in Florida, have sparked a national movement addressing specific needs of offenders. There are around 3,000 drug courts in the US, serving specialized groups like veterans and juveniles. They go beyond drug abuse to tackle mental health and alcohol-impaired driving issues. The term \"drug courts\" encompasses specialized programs for addicted defendants at various points in the criminal justice process. There is growing support within the federal court system and the Department of Justice for reentry programs that incorporate features of drug courts. Some federal district courts have specialized programs for drug-involved offenders, managing their reintegration into the community. These programs are funded by decentralized allotments given to the districts for offender treatment and supervision. Federal districts have the autonomy to establish these specialized court programs. In 2017, the President's Commission recommended DOJ establish federal drug courts in every district. The Cures Act mandated a pilot program to assess federal drug and mental health courts' effectiveness. DOJ, with court and probation office assistance, must divert certain offenders with mental illness or disabilities to specialized courts. As of January 2018, the pilot program is still in planning stages. In 2018, a pilot program is in planning stages to address challenges faced by veterans postdeployment, leading to involvement in the criminal justice system. Approximately 8% of the total incarcerated population in the US are veterans, with drug offenses and driving while intoxicated being common reasons for their incarceration. Older data shows higher rates of drug dependence or abuse among veteran prisoners compared to nonveterans. In state prisons, veterans have lower levels of past drug use than nonveterans, but more veterans report recent mental health services. Veterans treatment courts, addressing mental health and substance abuse needs, have been established in response. The federal government supports drug court models through financial aid, research, and grants, with approximately 306 veterans treatment courts and 6 federal veterans courts in operation. The Department of Justice provides funding, research, training, and grants for the development and improvement of drug courts. The Drug Court Discretionary Grant Program (Drug Courts Program) is the primary federal grant program supporting the establishment and enhancement of drug courts for nonviolent offenders with substance abuse issues. Grants are administered by the DOJ's Office of Justice Programs (OJP) and SAMHSA within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Funding cannot be used to serve violent offenders, defined by current or past convictions. The Veterans Treatment Court Program, funded through the Drug Courts Program, serves veterans struggling with addiction and mental health disorders. Grants are awarded to state, local, and tribal governments for the establishment of veterans treatment courts, exempt from the violent offender restriction. The Act of 2016 authorized grants for programs for qualified veterans, including veterans treatment courts and services for incarcerated veterans. The VA does not fund veterans treatment courts but operates a Veterans Justice Outreach program. DOJ grants like JAG and JABG can fund drug courts and treatment programs. The JABG program aims to improve prosecution, courts, and drug treatment programs, including establishing juvenile drug courts. Funding for JABG has been unauthorized since FY2009. SAMHSA, along with BJA, administers grants for drug courts, with 122 continuations and 60 new grants funded in FY2016. In FY2017, SAMHSA planned to fund 103 continuations and 71 new grants. Since the inception of drug courts, research has shown positive outcomes in treating drug addictions, reducing recidivism rates, and lowering costs. The National Institute of Justice evaluated 21 drug court programs, with 19 rated as \"effective\" or \"promising\" in reducing recidivism. Cost evaluations showed mixed results, with some programs demonstrating significant savings. Cost evaluations of drug court programs showed mixed results, with some programs demonstrating significant savings while others had insignificant findings. Studies have shown that drug courts may lower recidivism rates and processing costs for defendants compared to traditional criminal justice processing. For example, one study found that drug court investment costs per offender were $1,392 less than traditional processing costs, with over $79 million in savings from reduced recidivism over a 10-year period. Another study of 23 drug courts reported that participants were significantly less likely to relapse into drug use. Drug court participants have lower relapse rates and commit fewer crimes than nonparticipants. However, some critics doubt the effectiveness of drug courts, claiming they only help certain offenders and do not reduce costs. Congress is concerned about drug abuse, particularly opioid-related deaths. In 2015, there were 52,404 drug overdose deaths in the US, with 63.1% involving opioids. SAMHSA estimated 329,000 Americans aged 12 and older were current heroin users in 2016. In 2016, SAMHSA estimated that 329,000 Americans were current heroin users and 3.8 million were misusers of prescription pain relievers. Policymakers are debating the effectiveness of drug courts in addressing the opioid epidemic. Policy options include increasing funding, expanding programs, and possibly including violent offenders in drug courts. Researchers suggest considering the current charge rather than the offender's history of violence. Researchers suggest that when selecting individuals for drug court programs, policymakers should focus on the current charge rather than the offender's history of violence. While individuals with a history of violence may initially appear more likely to fail the program, this relationship disappears when considering total criminal history. More serious offenders may benefit from drug courts as they are less likely to abstain from crime. Substance abuse and crime are closely linked, and diversion and treatment can help individuals avoid criminal behavior. Congress may need to decide whether to maintain the exclusion of violent offenders from the Drug Courts Program. Congress may need to decide whether to maintain the exclusion of violent offenders from the Drug Courts Program or broaden the pool of eligible offenders for BJA-funded drug court programs to include certain violent offenders."
