The \"Congressional Regulatory Review Reform Act of 2000\" amends Chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, to establish Congressional review of agency rulemaking. It defines key terms such as 'agency' and 'major rule', with specific criteria for what constitutes a major rule. The term 'rule' under the Congressional Regulatory Review Reform Act of 2000 refers to regulations that could lead to significant adverse effects on various aspects such as costs, prices, competition, employment, and innovation, excluding rules under the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Section 551 defines the term 'rule' under the Congressional Regulatory Review Reform Act of 2000, excluding rules of particular applicability, agency management or personnel, and agency organization or procedure that do not substantially affect non-agency parties' rights or obligations. Congressional approval is required for major rules before they can take effect. Before a major rule can take effect, it must be submitted to Congress and approved by a joint resolution. Any agency issuing a major rule must provide a report to Congress and the Comptroller General, including a copy of the rule, a general statement about it, and the proposed effective date. Additionally, a cost-benefit analysis of the major rule must be submitted. The agency issuing a major rule must provide a report to Congress and the Comptroller General, including a copy of the rule, relevant actions, and any other necessary information. Each House will distribute the report to the appropriate committees. Approval of a major rule requires a joint resolution from Congress. The term 'joint resolution' in this section refers to a resolution introduced on a specific date, approving a rule without amendments by Congress. The Majority and Minority Leaders of both Houses must introduce a joint resolution of approval for a major rule on the first day of Congress session after its submission. The Majority and Minority Leaders of the House of Representatives must introduce a joint resolution of approval for a major rule. The joint resolution cannot be amended by the committee and must be passed by each House of Congress within 10 days of being placed on the calendar. The joint resolution for approval of a major rule must be introduced by the Majority and Minority Leaders of the House of Representatives or the Senate. If a petition signed by 20% or more of the Members of either House is filed within 30 days objecting to the rule, the resolution process may be affected. The Secretary of the Senate or the Clerk of the House of Representatives accepts filings on non-session days. They must submit petitions and joint resolutions to the Comptroller General. Within 45 days of filing, the Comptroller General provides a report on the major rule to the Senate and House officers. The report includes a regulatory analysis and agency compliance assessment, published in the Federal Register. After the Comptroller General submits a report on a major rule, any Member of Congress can move to proceed to consider a joint resolution. The motion is privileged, not debatable, and not subject to amendment. If agreed to, the joint resolution will be considered. The joint resolution, once agreed to, remains unfinished business in the respective House until disposed of. Debate is limited to 10 hours, divided equally between those in favor and those opposing the resolution. Amendments, postponements, or reconsiderations are not allowed.

Sec. 805 allows a major rule to take effect if the President determines it is necessary due to health or safety threats, enforcement of criminal laws, national security, or international trade agreements. Sec. 806 prohibits an agency from promulgating a major rule in substantially the same form within a 6-month period if a joint resolution of approval is disapproved by Congress. Sec. 807 states that a major rule approved by a joint resolution is not subject to judicial review, and a major rule subject to section 805 is also not subject to judicial review during a specified period. Program for review of agency rules. The President may establish a program for systematic review of agency rules through an Executive order.
