    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Prosthetic Limb Access Act of 1996\". The Congress finds that millions of people worldwide are amputees, with thousands in the US relying on prosthetic devices for full functionality. Many amputees cannot afford proper prosthetic care, leading to used devices being sent to Third World countries due to liability concerns. Recycling prosthetic devices for economically disadvantaged amputees would greatly improve their quality of life. Nonprofit organizations are well-suited for this task. Nonprofit organizations are uniquely suited to provide recycled prosthetic devices to amputees in a cost-efficient manner. Immediate action is needed to limit liability and minimize litigation costs for these providers. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. For the purposes of this Act, a \"claimant\" is defined as any person bringing a civil action related to harm caused by a recycled prosthetic device. \"Harm\" in this context includes physical injury, illness, disease, death, or property damage. A nonprofit organization is defined as an entity described in section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and exempt from taxation under section 501(a) of the same code. A nonprofit provider is an organization established to provide prosthetic devices to economically disadvantaged individuals, meeting the same tax-exempt criteria. (5) Practitioner is a healthcare professional licensed or certified to provide services. (6) Prosthetic device is an artificial limb for amputees. (7) Recycled prosthetic device is a previously used prosthetic device. A \"prosthetic device\" is a previously used artificial limb that has been reconditioned for use by a different amputee, has not been significantly altered except for the socket, frame, or attachment materials. This Act applies to civil actions against nonprofit providers or practitioners for harm caused by recycled prosthetic devices or referrals involving such devices. It supersedes state laws on damages recovery in such cases and defers to federal or state law on other issues. SEC. 5 limits the liability of nonprofit providers, practitioners, and organizations for harm caused by recycled prosthetic devices, except in cases of intentional wrongdoing. SEC. 6 outlines procedures for dismissing civil actions against these entities. Nonprofit providers, practitioners, and organizations can move to dismiss actions subject to the Act during the time when a motion to dismiss can be filed under applicable laws."
