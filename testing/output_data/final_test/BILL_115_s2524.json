    "content": "The \"Substance Use Disorder Workforce Loan Repayment Act of 2018\" establishes a loan repayment program for substance use disorder treatment employees under Title VII of the Public Health Service Act. The Secretary will carry out a program where individuals receive payments on eligible loans in exchange for completing a period of service in a substance use disorder treatment job. Payments are made for each year of obligated service, with additional incentives for service in shortage areas. The program offers payments on eligible loans for individuals who complete a period of service in a substance use disorder treatment job. Payments are made annually based on the outstanding loan amount, with a maximum total payment of $250,000. Eligible loans include those for substance use disorder treatment jobs and nursing student loans. The program offers payments on eligible loans for individuals who complete up to 6 years of full-time employment in a substance use disorder treatment job. Eligible loans include nursing student loans, Federal Direct Stafford Loan, Federal Direct PLUS Loan, Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan, Federal Direct Consolidation Loan, Federal Perkins Loan, and other Federal loans as determined appropriate by the Secretary. The period of service must be in a Mental Health Professional Shortage Area in the United States. The program offers loan repayment for individuals working in substance use disorder treatment in designated high overdose rate areas. Borrowers cannot receive benefits from both this program and other federally supported loan forgiveness programs. The Secretary may establish a liquidated damages formula for breaches of agreements under subsection (a). Failure to complete the full service period does not constitute a breach if the individual completed the years of service for which payments were made. The Secretary can set additional criteria and rules for this section as needed. The Secretary must report to Congress every 5 years on the number and location of borrowers qualifying for loan repayments under the Substance Use Disorder Workforce Loan Repayment Act. The report should also assess the impact of the program on the availability of substance use disorder treatment employees nationally and in shortage areas. The term 'municipality' refers to a city, town, or public body created by State law or an Indian Tribe. A 'substance use disorder treatment job' is a full-time job focused on treating or supporting patients with substance use disorders, including various healthcare and behavioral health professionals.
