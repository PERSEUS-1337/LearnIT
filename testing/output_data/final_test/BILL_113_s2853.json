    "content": "The \"Accelerating Action in Maternal and Child Health Act of 2014\" aims to reduce preventable maternal, newborn, and child deaths in 24 USAID focus countries by 2020, saving 15,000,000 children and 600,000 mothers. Congress finds that child and maternal mortality rates have significantly decreased in the past two decades, with 24 priority countries achieving an 8 percent reduction in under-5 mortality in the last three years. The report \"Acting on the Call: Ending Preventable Child and Maternal Deaths\" by USAID provides essential evidence and knowledge to end these deaths globally. Achieving Millennium Development Goal 4 requires a global annual rate of reduction in under-5 mortality. The global annual rate of reduction in under-5 mortality needs to increase to 15.6 percent from 2012 to 2015, much faster than the 3.9 percent achieved from 2005 to 2012. Every year, 6,600,000 children under 5 die from preventable causes, with the majority of deaths occurring in developing countries, especially in Africa. Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest under-5 mortality rate at 98 deaths per 1,000 live births, more than 15 times the average in developed regions. Investing in women and children can help reduce poverty. Investing in women and children reduces poverty, stimulates economic growth, and saves lives by providing health products like vaccines and treatments. New approaches and technologies are needed to accelerate progress in ending preventable maternal and child deaths. Leading causes of maternal mortality in low-income countries include post-partum bleeding, infection, and hypertension, while newborn deaths are mainly caused by infections and premature birth. Most child deaths under 5 are preventable, with causes like respiratory infections, diarrhea, and malaria. Malnutrition contributes to 45% of child deaths, making them more susceptible to severe diseases. The United States aims to combat maternal, newborn, and child mortality globally by establishing a comprehensive strategy in partnership with various organizations and sectors. This includes scaling up evidence-based interventions, focusing on priority countries, increasing resources, enhancing transparency, and creating new financing mechanisms. The President will establish a strategy to accelerate action in priority countries, focusing on proven interventions to end maternal, newborn, and child deaths worldwide. The strategy will include specific objectives and strategies to address leading causes of maternal mortality. The strategy aims to reduce maternal, newborn, and child deaths by setting clear objectives, responsibilities, benchmarks, and resource needs. Coordination among various entities and public-private partnerships will be emphasized for effective implementation. The strategy aims to expand public-private partnerships for research and innovation, use open and competitive procedures, and focus on evidence-based interventions like safe motherhood, newborn survival, and healthy households and schools including WASH. The strategy focuses on key areas such as maternal and child nutrition, vaccines, prevention of diseases like pneumonia and malaria, and capacity-building of health professionals. The United States Government will establish a pilot program for innovative financing mechanisms to deliver health interventions in priority countries based on recommendations from global experts. The financing framework will mobilize capital using tools like loans, guarantees, and development impact bonds. Priority countries for maternal and child health programming under the Act include Afghanistan, Bangladesh, DRC, Ethiopia, Ghana, Haiti, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, Rwanda, Senegal, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Yemen, and Zambia. The United States Government should prioritize applying mechanisms in these countries. The Act prioritizes countries that have committed to increasing government funding for health and have shown dedication to peaceful governance, civil society engagement, economic freedom, and investments in maternal, newborn, and child health. Eligible countries must demonstrate progress towards the 2001 Abuja Declaration commitments. The President must provide an annual progress report to Congress on activities under the Act, including data on implemented mechanisms, their design, and results. Appropriations are authorized for fiscal years 2015 through 2019."
