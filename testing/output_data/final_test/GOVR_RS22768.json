    "content": "In early 2007, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice promised moderate Arab regimes increased US engagement in the Israeli-Arab peace process in exchange for their support countering Iranian influence in the Middle East. She made eight trips to the region to work with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian Authority President Mahmud Abbas on a political horizon for a two-state solution. Both sides have not fulfilled obligations under the Road Map. In early 2007, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice engaged in efforts to advance the Israeli-Arab peace process. Phase I of the plan called for Israel to freeze settlement activity and for Palestinians to confront terrorists. However, Hamas's participation in the Palestinian unity government hindered progress. After Hamas took control of Gaza in June 2007, Abbas dissolved the unity government, leading to renewed diplomatic efforts by the Bush Administration and Israel. President Bush pledged support for Abbas on July 16. President Bush promised support for Abbas to lay the foundation for negotiations towards a Palestinian state. An international meeting was called for representatives supporting a two-state solution, rejecting violence, recognizing Israel's right to exist, and committing to previous agreements. Olmert, Abbas, and negotiating teams worked on a declaration of principles on final status or core issues over the next four months. Olmert and Abbas worked on a declaration of principles on core issues for four months but failed to produce a document. The United States invited 49 countries and international organizations to a conference at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, MD, including members of the Arab League Follow-on Committee and the G-8 group of industrialized countries. The international conference at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, MD, included key players such as the G-8 group, U.N. Security Council members, and representatives from various organizations. The strong Arab presence indicated a desire for a strategic alliance with the U.S. against Iran and possible support for Abbas over Hamas. Saudi Arabia's attendance was notable as a pro-Western Arab state without relations with Israel, emphasizing that normalization would follow peace. Syria's presence suggested a shift in the Bush Administration's isolation strategy due to its support for terrorist activities. The Bush Administration, previously isolating Syria for supporting terrorist groups and destabilizing Lebanon, may now engage with Syria to revive peace talks with Israel. Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations insisted on Syria's inclusion at the Annapolis conference for a comprehensive peace, including the return of the Golan Heights. Despite initial reluctance from Israel, talks between Israel and Syria have been facilitated by Turkey and Russia. Iran and Hamas were absent from the Annapolis conference, with Iran denouncing the event and Hamas dismissing it as \"useless.\" Despite this, Syria participated in the dialogue with Israel, while the Shiite-led Maliki government of Iraq declined to send a representative. The conference began on November 26 with separate meetings between President Bush, Abbas, and Olmert. President Bush met with Abbas and Olmert separately at the White House, while Secretary Rice hosted a dinner for attendees at the State Department. A plenary session in Annapolis on November 27 focused on international support for the peace process, institutional reform, and capacity building. President Bush read a \"Joint Understanding\" at the conference, emphasizing the immediate launch of bilateral negotiations to resolve all core issues without exception. The Joint Understanding emphasizes the immediate launch of bilateral negotiations to resolve all core issues without exception. A steering committee will oversee negotiating teams, with Abbas and Olmert meeting biweekly to assist. The United States may not play a direct role in the negotiations, but Secretary of State Rice is expected to provide encouragement and assistance by traveling to the region frequently. The resumption of negotiations after a seven-year hiatus is seen as the main achievement of the conference. The parties commit to implementing their obligations under the Road Map, with the United States leading a tripartite mechanism to follow up on implementation. The parties will continue implementing the Road Map until a peace treaty is reached, with the US monitoring and judging fulfillment of commitments. General James L. Jones (Ret.) is named to oversee this task. The President appointed General James L. Jones as special envoy for Middle East security, overseeing security issues for Israelis and Palestinians, security cooperation with neighboring countries, and U.S. assistance to the Palestinian Authority. He will not replace Lt. Gen. Keith Dayton but will work alongside him. Challenges due to domestic political weaknesses of Olmert and Abbas may hinder progress on the Road Map and a peace treaty, raising skepticism about the renewed peace process. Since 1996, the Palestinian Authority has governed the West Bank and Gaza Strip, with Israeli presence. Factional fighting in 2007 led to Hamas controlling Gaza. President Abbas declared a state of emergency, replaced the Hamas government with one led by Prime Minister Fayyad. Abbas struggles to prevent Hamas from launching rockets into Israel. Some Israelis doubt negotiations due to Abbas's perceived weakness, while others believe progress in peace talks would strengthen him. The process aims to strengthen Abbas by delivering benefits for the Palestinian people. Saudi Arabia and others urge Abbas to reconcile with Hamas for a unified Palestinian front in negotiations. However, Hamas's refusal to meet conditions set by Israel, their rejection of the Annapolis conference results, and their continued violence rhetoric pose challenges to the peace process. Hamas retains the capability to disrupt peace efforts through terror attacks. Prime Minister Ehud Olmert faces opposition within his coalition over possible concessions to the Palestinians, particularly on Jerusalem and territory. Rabbi Ovadia Yosef of the Shas Party threatens to leave the coalition if Jerusalem is discussed in negotiations. The Yisrael Beytenu party is open to ceding parts of Jerusalem but not settlements. Opposition leader Benjamin Netanyahu leads in polls and criticizes coalition members for not leaving. Yisrael Beytenu expresses skepticism about Abbas's ability to fulfill commitments and warns against territorial concessions leading to a \"Hamastan.\" The Joint Understanding conditions treaty implementation on the Road Map. Prime Minister Olmert's ability to compromise is limited due to coalition instability. If rightwing parties leave, Olmert could rely on leftwing and Arab parties for support, but many Israelis may not view an agreement with Arab support as legitimate. Prime Minister Olmert's tenure is at risk due to corruption investigations and a forthcoming report on Israel's 2006 war with Hezbollah. His health issues may also impact his role in negotiations. Israeli governments are typically short-lived, and there are concerns about the legitimacy of any agreement with Arab support. The implementation of Phase I of the Road Map remains a point of contention between the two sides. Israel's settlement activity in the West Bank has been a point of disagreement for the past four and a half years. Prime Minister Olmert referenced President Bush's letter to Ariel Sharon in 2004, acknowledging the existence of Israeli settlements as a reality on the ground. The Palestinians criticized this as legitimizing settlements and prejudging final status negotiations. Olmert stated that a freeze on building beyond the 1967 border is not required by the Road Map, but Israel would not establish new settlements. Israel's settlement activity in the West Bank has been a point of disagreement for the past four and a half years. Prime Minister Olmert referenced President Bush's letter to Ariel Sharon in 2004, acknowledging the existence of Israeli settlements as a reality on the ground. Olmert stated that a freeze on building beyond the 1967 border is not required by the Road Map, but Israel would not establish new settlements. In addition, Israel does not believe that construction in East Jerusalem is required in a freeze. Palestinians argue that a freeze means a complete cessation of all settlement construction, including in existing settlements. Phase I also requires the Palestinians to confront terrorists and dismantle terrorist infrastructures. Palestinian officials claim that their limited actions against Hamas-supporting charities and deployment of police in Nablus and Tulkarm prove that they are fulfilling their obligations under Phase I. Yet, they lack the capability to truly confront Hamas and other terror groups, even with the assistance provided thus far by the United States and Israel. Final status issues also remain intractable. For example, on the issue of refugees, Abbas referred at Annapolis to U.N. General Assembly Resolution 194. Abbas referred to U.N. Resolution 194 regarding the issue of Palestinian refugees' right to return to their homes in Israel. Israel insists on resettling refugees only in Palestine and Arab lands, citing President Bush's 2004 letter rejecting a \"right of return\" to Israel. The 2000 Camp David talks failed due to the Jerusalem issue. Olmert is willing to cede some territory for peace. Olmert's willingness to cede Arab neighborhoods and refugee camps in Jerusalem may face challenges regarding control over holy sites. Rightwing Israeli parties could oppose any steps seen as dividing the city. Abbas proposed a Palestinian capital in East Jerusalem and access to holy sites for all religions at the Annapolis conference."
