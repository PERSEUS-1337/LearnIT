Each State must submit a 3-year implementation plan to the EPA within one year of this Act, aiming for increased recycling by 75%, reducing water source pollution, restricting landfill dumping, phasing out solid waste incineration, achieving a 10% waste reduction rate, and increasing composting by 10%. The State must submit a plan to the EPA for approval under this Act, including enforceable limitations, monitoring systems, enforcement programs, and plan revisions as necessary. The State must submit a plan to the EPA for approval, including enforceable limitations, monitoring systems, enforcement programs, and plan revisions as necessary. The plan must be revised if found inadequate by the Administrator and must involve consultation with local political subdivisions. The EPA will establish completeness criteria for plan submissions within 6 months of the Act's enactment. The Administrator will determine if a plan complies with the Act within 6 months of receiving it. If approved, the State must start implementation immediately. If rejected, the EPA will provide reasons for rejection, and the State has 3 months to submit a new plan. The Administrator will determine if a plan complies with the Act within 6 months of receiving it. If approved, the State must start implementation immediately. If rejected, the State has 3 months to submit a new plan respecting the remaining parts. Within 12 months of approval, the State must implement the approved parts. The Administrator will approve a plan submission if it meets all requirements of the Act. Partial approval may be granted if only a portion of the plan revision complies. The entire plan revision must be approved to be considered compliant with the Act. The Administrator may conditionally approve a plan revision if the State commits to specific enforceable measures within a set timeframe. Failure to comply with the commitment will result in disapproval. The Administrator can require plan revisions if the current plan is inadequate, setting deadlines for submission not exceeding 6 months after notification of inadequacies. Each revision to an implementation plan submitted by a State under this Act must be adopted after a public hearing. The Administrator can revise any plan approval, disapproval, or promulgation if an error is found, without requiring further submission from the State. The Administrator shall not approve a plan revision that does not comply with the Act's requirements. The Administrator may impose sanctions listed in section 2 for findings, disapprovals, or determinations related to state plans. A Federal implementation plan will be issued if a State fails to submit a required plan or if the submitted plan does not meet minimum criteria, unless the State corrects the deficiency before the Federal plan is issued. SEC. 3. SANCTIONS. If a State fails to submit or implement required elements of a plan under this Act, sanctions may be imposed by the Administrator until compliance is achieved within 18 months. The Administrator may impose sanctions on a State for non-compliance with safety projects under title 23, United States Code. The prohibition can be lifted for projects related to public transit or certain road constructions. The curr_chunk discusses various programs and strategies to improve traffic flow and reduce congestion, including construction of lanes for high occupancy vehicles, highway ramp metering, parking facilities for multiple occupancy vehicles, vehicle use restrictions in emission concentration areas, and breakdown management systems. The curr_chunk discusses incentives for improving traffic flow and reducing congestion. The Administrator can provide grants to States phasing out solid waste incineration early for environmentally friendly disposal methods. Grants range from $25,000,000 to $60,000,000 based on the timeline of phase-out. States phasing out solid waste incineration can limit importation of solid waste."
