    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Student Non-Discrimination Act of 2011\" and includes findings and purposes. The Student Non-Discrimination Act of 2011 includes findings that highlight pervasive discrimination against LGBT students in public schools, emphasizing the harmful effects of targeting students based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Numerous studies show the negative impact of discrimination, harassment, bullying, and intimidation on these students' educational opportunities. Discrimination, including harassment, bullying, intimidation, and violence in schools based on sexual orientation or gender identity leads to high rates of absenteeism, dropout, adverse health consequences, and academic underachievement among LGBT youth. This discrimination can also result in life-threatening violence and suicide. Public school students have constitutional rights that are violated when school officials are discriminatory or indifferent to such discrimination. The Act aims to ensure a safe educational environment free from discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, as current Federal civil rights statutes do not explicitly protect against such discrimination. This lack of protection has limited legal recourse for students and parents facing discrimination. The Act aims to provide a Federal prohibition of discrimination in public schools based on sexual orientation or gender identity, along with effective remedies and invoking congressional powers to enforce this prohibition. The Act aims to prohibit discrimination in public schools based on sexual orientation or gender identity, allowing the Department of Education to enforce regulations effectively. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines key terms such as \"program or activity,\" \"gender identity,\" and \"harassment\" in relation to public school education programs. The Act defines abusive behavior in public schools based on sexual orientation or gender identity, including verbal, nonverbal, or physical aggression. Public schools refer to elementary and secondary schools under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Sexual orientation encompasses homosexuality, heterosexuality, and bisexuality. The term \"student\" refers to an individual enrolled in a public school or participating in its programs. SEC. 4. PROHIBITION AGAINST DISCRIMINATION; EXCEPTIONS. No student shall be excluded or discriminated against in any program receiving Federal financial assistance based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Harassment on these grounds is also considered discrimination. Retaliation or reprisal based on these factors is prohibited. The Act prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity in programs receiving Federal financial assistance. It also prohibits retaliation for opposing unlawful conduct under the Act, including reporting, participating in investigations, or hearings related to such conduct. The Act prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity in programs receiving Federal financial assistance. It also prohibits retaliation for opposing unlawful conduct under the Act, including reporting, participating in investigations, or hearings related to such conduct. Additionally, the Act allows for the exercise or enjoyment of rights granted or protected by the Act, as long as false information is not purposefully provided to public schools or governmental entities regarding a violation of the Act. SEC. 5. FEDERAL ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT; REPORT TO CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES. Federal departments and agencies providing financial assistance to education programs must comply with section 4 of the Act by issuing approved rules, regulations, or orders. Non-compliance may result in termination of assistance to recipients. The termination or refusal of assistance due to noncompliance with requirements must be limited to the specific recipient and program where the failure occurred, and can only be done after all voluntary means have been exhausted. If a Federal department or agency fails to comply with a requirement, they must report the circumstances to the relevant House and Senate committees before any action can take place. SEC. 6. CAUSE OF ACTION. An aggrieved individual can assert a violation of this Act in court and may receive various forms of relief. This section does not limit other remedies available under different laws and does not require exhausting administrative processes before seeking redress. The statute of limitations for actions under this section follows the guidelines of title 28 of the United States Code. In accordance with the law (42 U.S.C. 1983), actions can be taken in the forum State. State immunity under the 11th Amendment is waived if a State receives Federal financial assistance for a program, allowing suits for violations of the Act. Remedies are available in such suits to the same extent as for violations against any other entity. Attorney's fees are addressed in Section 8. SEC. 8. ATTORNEY'S FEES. Section 722(b) of the Revised Statutes is amended to include the Student Nondiscrimination Act of 2011. SEC. 9. EFFECT ON OTHER LAWS. The Act does not override existing Federal and State nondiscrimination laws, including title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, and section 1979 of the Revised Statutes. The obligations of this Act are additional to those imposed by other laws. The Disabilities Act of 1990 does not affect free speech and expression laws or the rights of religious student groups under other Federal laws such as the 1st Amendment and the Equal Access Act. SEC. 10. SEVERABILITY.\n\nIf any provision of this Act is deemed unconstitutional, the rest of the Act remains unaffected.\n\nSEC. 11. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\nThis Act will be effective 60 days after enactment and does not apply to conduct before that date."
