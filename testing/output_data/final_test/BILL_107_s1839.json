    "content": "The Act titled \"Community Choice in Real Estate Act\" clarifies that real estate brokerage and management activities are not considered banking or financial activities. The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 has been amended to specify that real estate brokerage and management activities are not considered financial activities. The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 has been amended to exclude real estate brokerage and management activities from being considered financial activities. Real estate brokerage activities include acting as an agent for buyers, sellers, lessors, or lessees, listing or advertising properties, providing advice, bringing parties together, and negotiating contracts. The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 has been amended to exclude real estate brokerage and management activities from being considered financial activities. Real estate management activity involves offering or providing real estate management services to the public. This includes engaging in activities that require registration or licensing as a real estate agent or broker under applicable law. Real estate management services to the public involve activities such as procuring tenants, negotiating leases, maintaining security deposits, billing and collecting rental payments, and making various payments related to real property. The paragraph discusses exceptions to activities related to managing real property by a bank holding company or its affiliates. The Secretary may not determine that real estate brokerage or management activities are financial in nature, incidental to financial activities, or complementary to financial activities. The terms 'real estate brokerage activity' and 'real estate management activity' have the same meanings as in the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. An exception is made for activities related to managing real property owned by a national bank or its subsidiary."
