The curr_chunk defines key terms related to the Blunt Reservoir feature of the Oahe Irrigation Project in South Dakota, including the Commission and preferential leaseholder. The Blunt Reservoir feature of the Oahe Irrigation Project in South Dakota is deauthorized, and the Secretary of the Interior must convey preferential lease parcels to the Commission without consideration, with the condition that the Commission honors the purchase option for preferential leaseholders. Preferential leaseholders have the option to purchase the lease parcel under specific terms, including a cash purchase or installment purchase with 3 percent annual interest over 30 years. Option exercise period for preferential leaseholders allows them 10 years after conveyance to exercise the option. They can continue leasing under the same terms until then. The value of the lease parcel is determined by the preferential leaseholder. The preferential leaseholder can choose to pay 110 percent of the per-acre assessment of adjacent parcels or get an appraisal for the agricultural use valuation of the lease parcel. The preferential leaseholder can choose to pay for the cost of appraisal if they elect to use a specific valuation method. The Secretary will convey nonpreferentially leased parcels to the South Dakota Department of Game, Fish, and Parks for wildlife habitat mitigation."
