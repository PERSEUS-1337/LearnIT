The \"Promoting Real Opportunities for Energy Security Act\" authorizes the Secretary of Energy to acquire advanced biofuels for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve if oil prices exceed $75 per barrel for 3 consecutive days. Within 2 years of enactment, the Secretary of Energy, in collaboration with other departments, will submit a report to various committees outlining the implementation of the Act and recommending criteria for making advanced biofuels available from the Reserve. The \"Promoting Real Opportunities for Energy Security Act\" defines \"Administrator\" as the head of the Environmental Protection Agency and \"advanced biofuel\" as renewable fuel with significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions than baseline levels, including ethanol from cellulose, hemicellulose, or lignin, and from sugar or starch. The \"Promoting Real Opportunities for Energy Security Act\" defines \"Administrator\" as the head of the Environmental Protection Agency and \"advanced biofuel\" as renewable fuel with significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions than baseline levels, including ethanol from cellulose, hemicellulose, or lignin, and from sugar or starch. Additionally, the act includes ethanol derived from waste material, biomass-based diesel, biogas, butanol, other alcohols, and other fuel derived from cellulosic biomass as eligible advanced biofuels. The term \"baseline lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions\" refers to the average emissions for gasoline or diesel sold in 2005. \"Biomass-based diesel\" is renewable fuel with emissions at least 50% lower than baseline levels. The term \"cellulosic biofuel\" refers to renewable fuel derived from cellulose, hemicellulose, or lignin from renewable biomass with greenhouse gas emissions at least 60% lower than baseline levels. \"Conventional biofuel\" is ethanol derived from corn starch. The term \"greenhouse gas\" includes carbon dioxide, hydrofluorocarbons, methane, nitrous oxide, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride. The Administrator may add other emitted gases contributing to global warming. \"Lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions\" refer to total emissions from fuel production, including indirect emissions like those from land use changes. The term \"renewable biomass\" includes planted crops, crop residue, planted trees, and tree residue from managed plantations on non-Federal land. The term \"renewable biomass\" includes animal waste material, animal byproducts, slash, and precommercial thinnings from non-Federal forestlands, including those belonging to Indian tribes or individuals under trust or restriction by the United States. This does not apply to forests with specific ecological rankings or old growth forests. The term \"renewable biomass\" includes animal waste material, byproducts, slash, and precommercial thinnings from non-Federal forestlands, excluding specific ecological rankings or old growth forests. Biomass sources may also include algae, separated yard waste, and food waste."
