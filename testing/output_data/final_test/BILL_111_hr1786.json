The Best-in-Class Appliances Deployment Program aims to reward retailers for increasing sales of high-efficiency building equipment, consumer electronics, and household appliances to reduce costs for consumers, promote innovation, and maximize energy savings. Retailers receive bounties for replacing old appliances, while manufacturers are incentivized to develop new super-efficient products. The program incentivizes retailers to promote sales of top-performing product models that demonstrate significantly higher energy efficiency than the average in their class. The Secretary of Energy selects the most efficient ten percent of commercially available models in each product class to qualify as Best-in-Class. The program incentivizes retailers to promote sales of top-performing product models with higher energy efficiency. Best-in-class models are designated by the Secretary of Energy and receive a bonus for qualifying sales over a 3-year period. Other models can be added to the list as they demonstrate higher efficiency characteristics. The Secretary reviews best-in-class product criteria annually and adjusts efficiency criteria to maintain a proper ratio of such products. If energy efficiency requirements are increased, consideration is given to Superefficient Best-in-Class Product models. The Secretary annually reviews and adjusts best-in-class product criteria, specifying new standards, listing qualifying models, adjusting bonus payments, and continuing payments for models meeting previous standards. The Secretary annually reviews and adjusts best-in-class product criteria, specifying new standards, listing qualifying models, adjusting bonus payments, and continuing payments for models meeting previous standards. Bonus payments are determined based on the difference in energy consumption between the qualifying product and the average product in the class. The Secretary consults with State and utility efficiency program administrators to determine the bonus payment amount for each product type. The Secretary ensures that only one bonus payment is given to distributors and retailers per eligible model sold. Retailers sell directly to end-users, while distributors sell in bulk. Distributors may also receive incentives for sales not to end-users. The Secretary of Energy will establish a program to offer bounties for the recovery and recycling of older low-efficiency appliances. Additionally, retailers will receive incentives for selling Best-in-Class Products accompanied by the retirement and recycling of existing inefficient appliances by consumers. The program offers bounties for recycling old appliances, with incentives for retailers selling Best-in-Class Products. Bounty payment is based on energy use difference and may be linked to recycling older appliances to prevent increased energy use. The Secretary ensures recycled products are not resold. The Secretary establishes standards for environmentally responsible recycling of products, especially those with refrigerants. A program rewards manufacturers for developing Superefficient Best-in-Class Products, defined as highly efficient products that can be mass-produced and sold commercially to mass-market consumers. The Secretary may establish standards for Superefficient Best-in-Class Products, even if no existing product exists, based on the potential for mass-producable products to meet the standard. Additionally, a superefficient best-in-class level can be set for existing models with distinct energy efficiency attributes, representing up to 10% of qualifying models. Manufacturers are rewarded with bonus payments for meeting these standards. The bonus payment for Superefficient Best-in-Class Products is in addition to retailer bonuses. The bonus amount per unit is determined by the Secretary and the energy consumption difference compared to the average product in the class. The Secretary determines bonus amounts for different product types based on energy savings over the product's life. Adjustments can be made after consulting with relevant parties. Bonus payments apply to Superefficient Best-in-Class Products for the first 3 years of sales. The program offers bonus payments for Superefficient Best-in-Class Products for the first 3 years of sales. Retailers, distributors, and manufacturers must provide sales documentation and energy consumption data to the Secretary of Energy. No product receiving a Federal tax credit under section 45M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is eligible for bonus payments. The Secretary of Energy will establish monitoring protocols to ensure accurate energy consumption tests and sales of energy-efficient models. Retailers may be required to disclose their participation in the program, and manufacturers must report any product design changes affecting energy consumption. Cost-effectiveness is defined as the savings in energy costs over the product's lifetime compared to the Secretary of Energy's rewards. Savings refer to the electricity or fuel saved by a product, based on efficiency performance. The Secretary prioritizes cost-effectiveness in designing and administering rewards for manufacturers of efficient equipment, electronics, and appliances. The focus is on the savings over the product's lifetime and the impact of retiring low-performing devices for highly-efficient substitutes. Manufacturers may receive lower rewards compared to retailers and distributors. Sums are authorized for fiscal years 2010-2014 for the Secretary of Energy, with a limit of 10% for program administration."
