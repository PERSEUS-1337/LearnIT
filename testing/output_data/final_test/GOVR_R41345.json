    "content": "Congress sought to pass legislation to continue funding for operations into FY2011 by using an appropriations bill that had been partially processed in the first session of the 111th Congress. H.R. 3081, originally the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2010, was amended and renamed in the Senate on September 29, 2010. The Senate passed the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 on September 29, renaming and amending the bill. The House accepted the Senate amendments on September 30, making funds available through December 3, 2010. The measure appropriated funds for continuing projects or activities from fiscal year 2010. The Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 prohibits the use of funds for projects without appropriations from fiscal year 2010. The impact on military construction projects for FY2011 depends on project type and authorization status. Standard military construction projects lack necessary authorization legislation for FY2011. Legislation for FY2011 has not been enacted yet, affecting standard construction projects without funds or authority from 2010. Funding for BRAC 2005 implementation was available in FY2010, with a reduction in funding to $2.35 billion for FY2011. President Obama requested $18.7 billion for military construction and housing in his FY2011 appropriations request. The committees on appropriations recommended Congress appropriate funds equal to the president's request for military construction and housing in FY2011. Senator Tim Johnson and Representative Chet Edwards introduced measures in the Senate and House respectively. The Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies reported H.R. 5822 to the House, which was placed on the Union Calendar. The House Committee on Rules drafted a rule for its consideration, adopting a structured rule (H.Res. 1559). The House passed the rule and the bill after considering 14 amendments, with 11 being adopted. Appropriations account-level data for the Department of Veterans Affairs, Related Agencies, Military Construction and Family Housing, and Overseas Contingency Operations Military Construction are detailed in various tables. Representative Ike Skelton introduced H.R. 5136, the National Defense Authorization Act for 2011, which was passed by the House and received in the Senate. The bill was placed on the Legislative Calendar for further consideration. H.R. 5136 was received in the Senate and placed on the Legislative Calendar. The Senate introduced S. 3454, the defense authorization bill, and it was also placed on the Legislative Calendar. Tables track the progress of appropriations and authorization acts. Military construction appropriations include funds for new construction, improvements, planning, and support for military forces and DOD agencies. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization Security Investment Program (NSIP) is the U.S. contribution to a common fund for construction needed to support major NATO commands. Family housing accounts fund construction, maintenance, utilities, and other expenses for military personnel and their families. The DOD Housing Improvement Fund provides seed money for public-private arrangements for military housing privatization. The Homeowners Assistance Fund aids federal personnel near installations scheduled for closure. The Fund aids federal personnel near installations scheduled for closure by subsidizing or purchasing their homes. The Chemical Demilitarization Construction account funds disposal facilities for chemical weapons destruction. The Base Realignment and Closure Accounts fund environmental remediation and military construction for BRAC rounds and global defense strategies. The Department of Defense justifies construction projects for the upcoming fiscal year to Congressional committees. Congress requires regular projection of future budget plans and review of national defense strategy, including the Quadrennial Defense Review. This is necessary to reassess strategic objectives and potential military threats since the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The Department of Defense published its 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR), expressing intentions to reevaluate its global footprint and focus on a global defense posture with joint, ready forces. The Senate appropriations committee noted DOD's reviews of basing policies and encouraged a focus on U.S. European installations planning. The House committee recommended deferring $464.6 million of the FY2011 presidential request for military construction in Djibouti, Germany, Guam, Honduras, Japan, and the Republic of Korea, due to basing uncertainties highlighted in the 2010 QDR. They directed DOD to include a report detailing how it intends to fund the construction needed for a revised overseas basing plan in its FY2012 budget submission. DOD estimated one-time implementation costs for BRAC 2005 at $34.5 billion. The total cost to implement the 2005 BRAC round and redeploy troops from overseas to the US was estimated at $17.9 billion in FY2007. The House committee recommended deferring military construction funds due to basing uncertainties and requested a report on funding for a revised overseas basing plan in the FY2012 budget submission. The DOD estimated one-time implementation costs for BRAC 2005 at $34.5 billion. The President has requested $2.4 billion as the final implementation installment, with both House and Senate committees recommending full funding. The total new budget authority required to complete the process is now set at $34.5 billion. The President has requested $426.9 million for construction to relocate Marines and their families from Okinawa to Guam, with an additional $139.3 million for military unit deployment. Concerns were raised about DOD's ability to utilize the funds fully, citing issues with environmental impact statements and civil infrastructure upgrades. The Senate committee raised concerns about the lack of a clear DOD global basing strategy, particularly regarding the Guam and Okinawa relocations. They highlighted the cost, environmental impact, and timeline of construction projects. The House committee recommended $393.2 million for Guam construction, while the Senate committee suggested $246.0 million. Military departments and defense agencies typically request authorization and appropriations for major construction projects over several years. Agencies request authorization and appropriations for construction projects in phases, each considered independent. Phased construction results in usable facilities at the end of each phase, while incremental funding breaks projects into two legislative tracks. During the 1980s, the Department of the Army acquired approximately 250,000 acres near Ft. Carson, CO, for a troop maneuvering area, with half purchased through open sale and the rest through condemnation proceedings. Incremental funding for construction projects could commit Congress to long-term support, potentially affecting future congresses. The Department of the Army acquired 250,000 acres near Ft. Carson, CO in the 1980s for a troop maneuvering area. An effort to add 450,000 acres to the PCMTA raised concerns about public condemnation. Legislation in FY2008, FY2009, and FY2010 restricted military construction funds for the Pi\u00f1on Canyon expansion. The House version of the appropriations bill continues this restriction in Section 126 of H.R. 5822. The military's increased presence in domestic garrisons has led to challenges for local school districts in accommodating the influx of military family school children. Impact Aid Program payments provide federal support, but are retroactive and dependent on an annual census. Sec. 2815 of H.R. 5136 may offer an alternative solution by amending 10 U.S.C. to assist local jurisdictions in coping with expanded installation populations. The proposed amendment to 10 U.S.C. 2391 would allow the Secretary of Defense to provide assistance to State or local governments for infrastructure development related to military installation establishment or expansion resulting from base realignment and closure activities. This assistance may include grants, cooperative agreements, and funds from Federal programs administered by agencies other than the Department of Defense. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) administers programs providing benefits to veterans, including disability compensation, pensions, medical care, insurance, home loan guarantees, burial benefits, and educational/training benefits. VA appropriations for benefits and services have increased from $61.84 billion in FY2004 to $109.61 billion. The VA appropriations for benefits and services have increased significantly over the years, reaching $109.61 billion in FY2010 and a proposed $120.79 billion for FY2011. The largest increases in funding are for disability compensation, pension benefits, and readjustment benefits, particularly in education benefits. The proposed budgets aim to allocate $53.49 billion for disability compensation and pension benefits, representing a 12.9% increase from the previous year. The Administration request, H.R. 5822, and S. 3615 propose increased funding for the VA in FY2011, with $120.79 billion requested for the VA overall and $50.61 billion for VA medical care. H.R. 5822 provides $120.81 billion in total funding for FY2011, including higher funding for general departmental administration. S. 3615 would provide $120.84 billion for the VA in FY2011. S. 3615 proposes additional funding for VA medical services and facilities in FY2011, along with higher funding for general departmental administration. There is an almost equal split between mandatory and discretionary funding for the VA, with discretionary funding being less than mandatory funding in the Administration request, H.R. 5822, and S. 3615 for FY2011. All advance funding provided by H.R. 5822 and S. 3615 for FY2012 is discretionary. The American Battle Monuments Commission (ABMC) is responsible for maintaining U.S. monuments and memorials honoring the armed forces' achievements since World War I. They oversee 24 cemeteries and 25 memorials in foreign countries and the U.S. The U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims reviews decisions of the Board of Veterans' Appeals and interprets relevant laws. The U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims has the authority to interpret laws, compel action by the VA, and set aside decisions. It is seeking a new permanent location as its current lease expires in September 2010, with funding provided for a new courthouse in the Administration request and bills H.R. 5822 and S. 3615. The Secretary of the Army oversees Arlington National Cemetery and Soldiers' and Airmen's Home National Cemetery, with H.R. 5822 and S. 3615 providing additional funding and reporting requirements due to recent mismanagement reports. The Armed Forces Retirement Home Trust Fund supports facilities in Washington, DC and Gulfport, Mississippi, offering long-term housing and medical care for around 1,600 individuals. The Gulfport campus of the Armed Forces Retirement Home was damaged by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and is currently being rebuilt with a completion target of 2010. The facility is funded by the Armed Forces Retirement Home Trust Fund, which is supported by gifts, bequests, and a $0.50 per month assessment on active duty enlisted military personnel and warrant officers. Construction of facilities in a fast-changing theater of war has presented DOD with a complex problem. Plans for construction projects are often outdated by the time necessary legislation is passed. Congress has granted DOD temporary authorization through the National Defense Authorization Act since FY2004 to provide timely assistance to commanders in the field. The National Defense Authorization Act grants DOD temporary authorization, \"Contingency Construction Authority\" (CCA), to use a limited amount of already appropriated operations and maintenance (O&M) funds for construction. DOD can use up to $200 million in U.S. Central Command (USCENTCOM) and an additional $300 million in Afghanistan with the Secretary of Defense's certification. The Secretary of Defense has the authority to initiate military construction projects without specific authorization and appropriation. The National Defense Authorization Act grants DOD temporary authorization, \"Contingency Construction Authority\" (CCA), to use already appropriated funds for construction projects without specific authorization. 10 U.S.C. \u00a72804 allows the Secretary to begin construction using already appropriated funds if deferral would be inconsistent with national security. 10 U.S.C. \u00a72805 permits limited use of O&M funds for small construction projects. 10 U.S.C. \u00a72808 allows construction projects after a declaration of war or national emergency. The temporary Contingency Construction Authority (CCA) allows DOD to use already appropriated funds for urgent construction projects in times of war or national emergency. The House committee noted that almost $1.4 billion in O&M funding has been obligated for this purpose. O&M funds are part of the defense appropriation and are used for operational requirements of the armed forces, but using them for construction projects may divert funds from their intended purposes. Before FY2010, construction projects in active military areas would have been requested through emergency supplemental appropriations. In FY2010, war-related construction costs were included in regular annual appropriation requests instead of emergency supplemental appropriations. FY2011 introduced \"Title IV: Overseas Contingency Operations\" in the appropriations bill for flexibility and oversight. The House committee recommended considering all military construction funding for Overseas Contingency Operations as emergency appropriations. The Senate committee adjusted project funding and increased funds for minor construction in response to DOD requests. The committee increased funding for minor construction to meet emerging needs and moved all construction requests for Afghanistan into Title IV. Funding levels for various appropriations accounts in Title IV can be found in Table A-2 in Appendix A.
