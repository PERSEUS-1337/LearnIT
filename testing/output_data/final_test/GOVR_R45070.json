    "content": "The Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA) regulates robocalls, which are automated calls delivering prerecorded messages using autodialers. The TCPA prohibits robocalls to consumers' traditional landline numbers, VoIP landline numbers, and mobile numbers, but not to business landlines. Robocalls are popular in industries like real estate, telemarketing, and direct sales. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Federal Communications Commission (FCC) receive numerous complaints about unwanted and illegal robocalls, with Congress taking action to protect consumers. Efforts include investigating technical solutions to stop illegal robocalls and updating the TCPA to better protect vulnerable groups. Six bills have been introduced in Congress to address this issue. The TCPA regulates robocalls and created the National Do Not Call Registry in 2003. Legal robocalls are allowed for certain purposes, while illegal robocalls are associated with fraudulent telemarketing campaigns. The registry had nearly 230 million active registrations as of September 30, 2017. The TCPA prohibits illegal robocalls intended to defraud consumers, distinguishing between calls to mobile phones and landlines. Autodialers can be used for consumer landlines with restrictions on prerecorded voices. Exceptions include emergency and informational calls. The TCPA prohibits illegal robocalls, with exceptions for informational calls and calls made for noncommercial purposes. Sales calls to business landlines are generally exempt from DNC and robocall rules, except for specific circumstances. Robocalls to both consumer and business mobile phones without consent are generally illegal under the TCPA. Despite exceptions for public service and emergency messages, political robocalls to mobile phones are illegal without prior consent. Consent for non-telemarketing calls can be revoked at any time, making subsequent calls illegal. Despite the DNC Registry, robocalls in the US continue to increase, with an average of 2.4 billion robocalls per month in 2016, rising to 4.1 billion in May 2018. This equals about 12 to 13 calls per person each month, up from just under 8 calls in January 2018. Consumer complaints about robocalls are on the rise in the United States. The FTC received over 7.1 million complaints in FY2017, up from 5.3 million in FY2016. Both the FTC and the FCC have jurisdiction over robocalls and can impose fines on violators. Other federal agencies may also prosecute robocall-related cases under criminal law. The FTC focuses on protecting consumers from scams and enforcing rules related to the DNC Registry. The Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act of 1994 authorized the FTC to regulate telemarketing calls, including disclosure requirements, prohibiting misrepresentations, setting time limits for calls, and payment restrictions. The FTC rules apply to interstate calls, not intrastate calls, and provide exemptions similar to the FCC. The FTC provides exemptions similar to the FCC, but specifically excludes exemptions for telemarketers calling on behalf of exempt entities. The FCC regulates all telemarketing calls, focusing on the call itself rather than the content. States have their own laws for intrastate telemarketing calls, with exemptions similar to the FCC and FTC. The FTC enforces laws against illegal calls. The FTC has taken strong enforcement actions against individuals and companies responsible for fraudulent telemarketing calls, resulting in over $1.5 billion in judgments and bans on future robocalls. They are also pursuing technical solutions like the Robocall Challenge program to block such calls. As of August 1, 2017, consumer complaints about DNC or robocall violations are shared with telecom carriers and industry partners daily to aid in call-blocking solutions. Complaint data, including call details and subjects like debt reduction or home security, help create blacklists for blocking unwanted calls before reaching consumers. This initiative aims to improve call-blocking effectiveness by utilizing consumer complaint information. The FTC and FCC work to combat illegal robocalls by collecting consumer reports and imposing fines on violators. The FCC has taken actions such as forming a Robocall Strike Force and implementing new rules to empower telecom providers to stop robocalls. The agency also publishes data on reported calls on their website. The FCC formed a \"Strike Force\" to develop robocall-blocking solutions, with work groups focusing on Authentication, Consumer Choice, Detection, and Regulatory Support. They created short- and long-term plans, including a Do Not Originate (DNO) Registry to block unwanted calls. The goal is to stop calls from invalid or unallocated numbers. The FCC's Strike Force successfully reduced IRS scam calls by 90% from September 2016 to February 2017 through a trial involving invalid, unallocated, and unassigned phone numbers. The FCC clarified rules allowing voice service providers to block spoofed calls upon subscriber request, promoting initiatives like the DNO database. On November 4, 2016, the FCC held a \"Twitter Town Hall\" on robocalls, discussing policies and trends. A company called \"All About the Message\" filed a petition for a ruling that voicemail messages are not illegal robocalls. The company \"All About the Message\" withdrew their petition regarding voicemail messages not being illegal robocalls, possibly due to negative press coverage. The FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking comments on rules for blocking calls from invalid or unassigned numbers. The FCC sought input on standards to identify illegal calls and proposed a safe harbor provision for carriers blocking suspected robocalls. Participants supported allowing carriers to block calls from invalid and unallocated numbers. The FTC proposed expanding the coverage of the DNO Registry to include certain live calls, particularly impostor calls where the caller pretends to be someone else. While 60% of monthly complaints to the FTC are about robocalls, \"live\" calls also generate a significant number of complaints. The FTC believes that blocking illegal \"live\" calls targeting numbers on the DNC Registry is essential, and commenters agree that the FCC should avoid imposing burdensome processes. The FCC rules allow service providers to block certain numbers, including those requested by subscribers and unassigned numbers to prevent fraud. Safeguards are in place to prevent blocking desired calls, with further mitigation techniques under consideration. The order also mandates consultation with the Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau. The FCC rules allow service providers to block illegal robocalls in specific circumstances, with the option to block DNO calls. The new rules aim to give flexibility to telecommunications providers in blocking illegal calls, with broad support from various groups. The FCC clarified that blocking DNO numbers can be effective in reducing illegal robocalls, despite concerns about temporary gains. The FCC clarified that telecommunications providers can block calls from unassigned numbers to prevent spoofing and potential fraud. This new order allows providers to block calls that purport to originate from invalid or unallocated numbers under the North American Numbering Plan. The FCC allows providers to block calls from unassigned numbers to prevent spoofing and fraud. The FCC seeks comments on mechanisms to unblock erroneously blocked calls and measure the effectiveness of robocall rules. Providers are encouraged to quickly rectify any erroneous blocking and the FCC is considering requiring a formal challenge mechanism for blocked calls. The FCC is considering requiring a formal challenge mechanism for blocked calls to quickly rectify any erroneous blocking. Questions include how callers can inform providers of blocking errors and how to notify callers of blocks for quick resolution. The FCC is considering implementing a reporting obligation on all service providers to rectify erroneous call blocking. Questions include what information should be collected, such as the quantity of false positives, and how this data could help evaluate efforts to combat illegal robocalls. Consumer benefits and costs of requiring providers to report this information are also being considered. The FCC is exploring different data sources to assess the effectiveness of efforts in combating illegal robocalls. The report will focus on progress made by industry, government, and consumers, including calling trends and consumer complaints. The goal is to provide insight into the current state of the robocalling problem and suggest additional measures to help consumers. The DNO Registry, established in November 2017, has broad support from telecommunications service providers. The FCC's November 2017 Order established the DNO Registry with broad support from telecommunications service providers and consumer groups. However, groups representing telemarketers and legal call originators only offer conditional support for limited intervention. Telecommunications service providers are concerned about the high cost of fully implementing the registry, which would require continual upgrades to combat new robocalling methods. They are seeking a funding mechanism, including potential Congressional appropriations, to cover these costs. The telecommunications industry is urging Congress to appropriate funds for combating illegal robocalls. They suggest amending laws to exclude blocked calls from evaluation and increasing penalties for robocall scams. Consumer groups support additional restrictions on robocalls and the implementation of the DNO Registry. Consumer groups including Consumer Federation of America and Public Citizen support FCC proposals to target and eliminate unlawful robocalls. They recommend allowing providers to use advanced tools to block illegal robocalls, offer options to block calls with unauthenticated Caller ID information, and provide free call-blocking tools to customers. They also suggest revising the definition of \"illegal\" robocalls. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Professional Association for Customer Engagement have expressed concerns about congressional action related to telemarketing calls, specifically regarding the establishment of the Do Not Originate Registry and potential misidentification of calls. They have requested that legislation not be overly broad to avoid penalizing companies for informational calls. The Communication Protection Coalition (CPC) was created by PACE to address concerns about legal calls being misidentified and blocked by carriers and analytics companies. The CPC aims to mitigate the harm caused by labeling calls as \"Scam Likely\" or \"Robocaller\" without considering legal entities delivering consented calls. In September 2017, PACE held the first CPC meeting with carriers, analytics companies, industry associations, and federal regulators. The meeting emphasized the need for cooperation to develop best practices and invited consumer groups to future meetings. In the 115th Congress, 12 bills targeting robocalls and consumer protection have been introduced, focusing on spoofing, debt collection, political messages, and protecting seniors from fraudulent robocalls. Three hearings have been conducted on robocalls in the same Congress. Three hearings on robocalls have been held in the 115th Congress, addressing issues such as caller ID spoofing and abusive robocalls. Information about these hearings can be found online. Scammers continue to defraud consumers through robocalls, which are made easier by technological advancements. The FTC acknowledges that law enforcement alone cannot solve the issue, and calls for robust call-blocking technology. The DNO Registry is a proven solution to reduce robocalls, but concerns remain among legitimate telemarketers. The FCC plans to address these concerns in 2018, while the impacts of FTC initiatives on fraudulent robocalls and the telemarketing industry remain oversight issues for Congress. Options for Responding to Unwanted Robocalls include filing complaints with the FCC and FTC, which can lead to legal or regulatory enforcement actions against robocallers. Consumer guidance from both agencies provides tips on how to stop unwanted calls and texts, ultimately reducing exposure to fraudulent robocalls. Regulatory enforcement can be initiated based on complaints filed with the FCC and FTC. Businesses can report violations by robocallers to the FTC. Both consumers and businesses can take steps to block unwanted robocalls. Blocking Robocalls (Consumers and Businesses) Both consumers and businesses can use third-party blocking services, like Nomorobo, a cloud-based solution that routes incoming calls to a second line to identify and hang up on illegal robocalls before they reach the user. Nomorobo uses a database of known robocallers to block illegal calls, while Pindrop offers enterprise-wide solutions using patented Phoneprinting technology to detect fraudulent calls. Consumers and businesses can download apps to filter out calls from unidentified numbers. YouMail app offers protection against robocalls and calculates the Robocall Index. Nomorobo app requires caller verification for calls to go through, available for iPhone users with an Android version coming soon. CTIA lists Android apps for call blocking. Telecommunications carriers offer blocking options for landline, VoIP, and mobile services. Consumer Reports found that internet-based phone services offer the best call-blocking options, while traditional landline and wireless customers have weaker protection. Call-blocking devices can be installed for both traditional and VoIP landlines, with options like a \"blacklist\" or \"whitelist\" to filter calls. The Digitone Call Block Plus device uses both a blacklist and a whitelist for call blocking. Recent law enforcement actions have targeted the \"IRS Scam,\" where callers impersonate IRS employees to defraud victims. The IRS scam involves scammers demanding immediate payment using gift cards or wire transfers, targeting vulnerable individuals such as recent immigrants or those with limited English proficiency. Victims are threatened with deportation if they do not comply. This scam has resulted in over $54 million in losses and has been on the IRS's \"Dirty Dozen\" list since 2014. Additionally, the FTC has held Robocall Challenges in response to the increase in complaints about robocalls from consumers. The FTC held the Original Robocall Challenge in 2013 to block illegal robocalls on landlines and mobile phones. Winners developed solutions like Nomorobo and a Robocall Filtering System. The Zapping Rachel challenge in 2014 aimed to track and minimize illegal robocalls with three phases for security experts to build tools. The Robocall Challenge in 2014 had three phases: Creator, Attacker, and Detective. The winning entries used innovative methods to identify robocalls, circumvent honeypots, and analyze call data. The Robocall Challenge in 2014 had three phases: Creator, Attacker, and Detective. The winning entries used innovative methods to identify robocalls, circumvent honeypots, and analyze call data. In subsequent challenges, participants developed algorithms to predict robocalls based on call metrics and create tools to block and forward robocalls automatically. Winners included RoboKiller and DetectaRobo, showcasing superior functionality, accuracy, innovation, and creativity. The Robocall Challenge in 2014 had three phases: Creator, Attacker, and Detective. Winners like \"Team HaV\", \"Team Milibo\", and \"Team RDAC\" demonstrated superior functionality, accuracy, innovation, and creativity. The FTC imposed fines on fraudulent robocallers in 2017, including Justin Ramsey. Justin Ramsey and Prime Marketing were fined $2.2 million for making illegal robocalls and sales calls to numbers on the DNC Registry. Ramsey continued his unlawful telemarketing through Prime Marketing, making at least 800,000 calls to numbers on the DNC Registry in 2016. Other defendants in the case settled with the commission. On June 2, 2017, a federal district court judge in California approved default judgments proposed by the FTC against Aaron Michael Jones, Steven Stansbury, and nine associated companies for making billions of illegal telemarketing robocalls. The FTC estimated over 100 million illegal robocalls per year were made to numbers on the DNC Registry. Jones, Stansbury, and their companies were permanently banned from telemarketing activities and each imposed a $2.7 million penalty payable to the FTC. Seven individual defendants and Local Lighthouse Corp. settled with the FTC in January. In January, Local Lighthouse Corp settled with the FTC for making illegal telemarketing robocalls. All Us Marketing LLC, previously known as Payless Solutions, was involved in a case where they made false claims about debt relief services and charged consumers upfront fees without providing any services. The defendants also used consumers' personal information to apply for new credit cards. The case involved 15 defendants and was settled on June 5, 2017, with court orders entered against them. On June 5, 2017, a federal district court issued orders against Orlando-based individuals and companies, imposing financial judgments totaling $4,890,797 on 12 defendants. Most defendants were banned from robocalling, telemarketing, or offering \"debt relief\" services. Three other defendants were fined lesser amounts. The FTC settled with defendants who assisted Caribbean Cruise Lines in an illegal telemarketing campaign, with the owner barred from such activities. The settlement order includes a judgment of $1.35 million for illegal telemarketing by Caribbean Cruise Lines, with fines imposed by the FCC in 2017 due to advancements in technology making it easier for robocallers to manipulate caller ID information. The FCC focused on enforcement actions and policies to combat malicious robocalls. In June 2017, they fined Adrian Abramovich $120 million for making 96 million spoofed robocalls using \"neighborhood spoofing\" technology. The calls promoted vacation deals from companies like Marriott and Expedia. The FCC proposed an $82 million fine on robocaller Philip Roesel for making over 21 million spoofed robocalls promoting vacation packages at Mexican timeshare facilities. The calls targeted vulnerable consumers and violated the Truth in Caller ID Act. Proposed legislation in the 109th-114th Congresses aimed at protecting consumers from fraudulent robocalls, including bills in the House of Representatives such as the DISCLOSE Act prohibiting robocalls to 911 call centers and expanding FCC penalties for violations. The United States enacted legislation to combat fraudulent robocalls, including measures to verify caller ID information, expand the definition of caller identification information, criminalize commercial robocalls, prevent fraud targeting seniors, and prohibit politically oriented recorded message calls to numbers on the Do Not Call Registry. The US enacted legislation to combat fraudulent robocalls, including measures to prevent fraud targeting seniors and criminalize most commercial robocalls without consent. The FCC was authorized to impose penalties for violations without prior citation. The Senate has not passed any bills related to robocalls since 2005."
