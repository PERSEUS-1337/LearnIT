    "content": "The \"Rural Recovery Act of 1998\" is introduced, which includes provisions for Rural Recovery Community Development Block Grants under Title I of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974. Congress finds that a modern infrastructure is essential for a prosperous economy in rural areas facing social, economic, and environmental challenges due to high infrastructure costs and low income. The purpose of this section is to provide affordable housing and community development assistance to eligible units of local government and Indian tribes in rural areas with high outmigration and low income levels. Eligible units of local government are defined as governing bodies of rural recovery areas. The term 'eligible Indian tribe' refers to the governing body of an Indian tribe located in a rural recovery area. A 'grantee' is an eligible unit of local government or Indian tribe receiving a grant under this section. The term 'Indian tribe' includes various indigenous groups in the United States eligible for assistance under specific laws. The term 'rural recovery area' refers to a geographic area with specific criteria, including high outmigration levels and low per capita income, not adjacent to a metropolitan area and excluding cities with a population over 2,500. The term 'unit of general local government' includes various political subdivisions of a State, territories, and other recognized entities. It also encompasses States, local public bodies, and agencies as defined in relevant sections. The Secretary may make grants to eligible units of general local government and Indian tribes for providing public facilities or services to new communities under specific eligibility standards. To receive a grant under this section, an eligible unit of general local government or Indian tribe must publish a proposed statement of rural development objectives and description of eligible activities, allowing residents to examine and submit comments. To receive a grant under this section, an eligible unit of general local government or Indian tribe must publish a proposed statement of rural development objectives and description of eligible activities for residents to review and provide feedback. Based on received comments, they must prepare and submit a final statement of rural development objectives to the Secretary. To enhance public accountability and coordination of activities, an eligible unit of general local government or Indian tribe receiving a grant must describe the activities for which the grant will be used and certify compliance with requirements. Additionally, they must provide public notice and comment to residents of the rural recovery area served. The eligible unit of general local government or eligible Indian tribe must provide information on the amount received and activities planned, grant usage records access, and notice of any proposed changes in activity allocation. In each fiscal year, the Secretary distributes grants to eligible local governments and Indian tribes based on population outmigration levels and per capita income in rural recovery areas, with a minimum amount of $250,000. Each grantee must use the funds for eligible activities such as water and wastewater facilities, infrastructure development for industrial parks, and real property acquisition for rural community development. The eligible activities for grant funds include developing telecommunications infrastructure in industrial parks, implementing rural development plans, affordable housing initiatives, and submitting annual performance reports to the Secretary. The grantee must publish proposed rural development objectives and eligible activities. They must also report on activities carried out, changes in objectives, and potential modifications to activities. The grantee can retain income generated from the grant for eligible activities, as long as it was realized after the initial disbursement of funds. The grantee may also modify rural development objectives based on their experience administering the grant. Authorization of Appropriations: $50,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 1999 to 2005 for this section."
