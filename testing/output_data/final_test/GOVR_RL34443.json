    "content": "The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) protects participants and beneficiaries in private-sector employee benefit plans. ERISA supersedes state laws except for certain matters like state insurance, banking, and securities laws. It covers pension plans for retirement benefits and welfare benefit plans for other employee benefits. Employers are not required to provide these plans, but must comply with ERISA standards for those that do. ERISA sets standards for who is covered, vesting requirements, and plan regulations. ERISA sets fiduciary standards for employee benefit plans, ensuring funds are handled prudently. It requires informing participants of their rights and financial status, with the right to sue for benefits. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation insures benefits up to a limit. Tax deductions and deferrals are granted to qualified plans meeting IRC requirements. The Department of the Treasury, Department of Labor, and Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation enforce ERISA regulations for pension plans, with specific oversight on contributions, benefits, and distributions. The IRS oversees plan standards, the DOL regulates fiduciary standards, and the PBGC administers the pension benefit insurance program. Employer-sponsored pension plans in the U.S. originated in the late 19th century in the railroad industry. Pensions in the railroad industry were initially seen as gifts for long service, not protected by law. Congress provided tax benefits for pensions in the 1920s, but it did not immediately boost the private pension system. The Revenue Acts of 1938 and 1942 set requirements for tax-qualified pension plans to prevent discrimination in favor of highly compensated employees. During the Second World War, pensions and deferred compensation were exempt from wage controls, allowing employers to offer increased pension benefits to offset limitations on wages. Federal courts in the 1940s mandated that pensions be included in collective bargaining negotiations. Additionally, employers could integrate pension formulas with Social Security benefits to balance income replacement rates. During the 1950s and 1960s, changes in income tax laws and higher marginal tax rates made pensions more valuable to workers, leading to increased adoption of employer-sponsored pensions. The growth of private pension plans during this time also saw instances of misuse of pension assets, prompting Congress to pass The Welfare and Pension Plans Disclosure Act in 1958 for greater transparency. In response to an automobile company terminating its underfunded pension plan in 1963, Congress began considering legislation to protect pension benefits in the private sector. By the early 1970s, bills were drafted by both the House and Senate labor committees to regulate private pension systems. The Senate Finance Committee also asserted jurisdiction due to the tax benefits private pension plans received. ERISA, passed in 1974, incorporated elements from various committees to set standards for employer pension plans. ERISA, signed into law in 1974 by President Gerald Ford, sets standards for employer pension plans. The law falls under the jurisdiction of various committees in Congress, including the House Committee on Education and Labor, the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, the House Ways and Means Committee, and the Senate Finance Committee. Amendments to ERISA have been made over the years to enhance protection for pension plan participants' survivors and spouses, improve funding practices, strengthen the PBGC's finances, adjust tax-deductible contributions, and ensure fairness in tax-favored plans. ERISA, enacted in 1974, protects participants in private-sector pension plans by requiring full funding of earned benefits and prohibiting misuse of pension funds. It also sets limits on age and service requirements for pension eligibility. Defined benefit pension plans are classified by ERISA and the IRC as specifying the benefit paid to participants or the method of determining it. Contributions vary yearly based on funding requirements, with benefits often tied to average pay and years of service. Some plans offer a flat benefit per year of service. Defined benefit pension plans pay a flat benefit per year of service, with the monthly pension benefit calculated based on the years of service. ERISA mandates full funding for these plans, with the employer bearing the investment risk. Assets in the pension trust must cover participant benefits, and qualified plans are protected from creditors in bankruptcy. Defined contribution plans specify contributions, not benefits, providing individual accounts for participants. Defined Contribution (DC) plans provide individual accounts for participants based on contributions and investment gains or losses. Participants bear the investment risk, and DC plans are not insured by the PBGC. The shift from Defined Benefit (DB) plans to DC plans began in the mid-1980s due to factors such as global competition, a mobile workforce preferring portability, and higher costs of maintaining DB plans under ERISA regulations. The decline in Defined Benefit (DB) plans since the 1980s was mainly due to terminations of small plans, with Defined Contribution (DC) plans overtaking in number of plans, participants, and assets by the late 1990s. Many employers have converted traditional DB plans to hybrid plans like cash balance plans. A cash balance plan is a type of defined benefit plan where the employer contributes a fixed percentage of pay to a common trust, with interest paid on the accumulated balance. Participants do not own individual accounts, but rather have a record of their accrued benefits. Cash balance plans guarantee benefits no less than contributions plus interest. In contrast, 401(k) plans are defined contribution plans authorized in 1978, with the first plans established in 1981. A 401(k) plan is an individual account plan where both the employee and employer can make pre-tax contributions. Taxes on contributions and earnings are deferred until withdrawal. Participants can allocate their balances among investment options selected by the employer. The retirement benefit is the account balance, consisting of contributions, interest, dividends, and gains or losses minus fees. Upon leaving the employer, participants can choose to receive these funds. In a 401(k) plan, participants can choose to receive funds through withdrawals or a lump sum. Some plans offer the option to purchase a life annuity, but it is not mandatory. Employees must decide on contribution amounts, investment options, and employer contributions can be fixed or a percentage of pay. Employers can reduce or suspend contributions based on business conditions. 401(k) plans are the most common type of defined contribution plan. ERISA and the pension provisions of the Internal Revenue Code have been amended multiple times since 1974, with significant changes in the Pension Protection Act of 2006 and the Worker, Retiree, and Employer Recovery Act of 2008. ERISA consists of four titles, with Title I focusing on employee rights in pensions and welfare benefit plans. Title III of ERISA assigns administration and enforcement responsibilities to the Departments of Labor and Treasury. Title IV establishes the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. Title I covers employee pension and welfare benefit plans in the private sector, exempting governmental and church plans, as well as plans for workmen's compensation, unemployment compensation, disability insurance, and non-resident aliens. ERISA's policy is to protect plan participants and beneficiaries through disclosure and reporting requirements. ERISA requires disclosure and reporting of financial and other information to participants and beneficiaries of pension and welfare benefit plans. Sections 101 through 111 outline extensive reporting and disclosure requirements, including dissemination of materials like summary plan descriptions and annual reports. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 also made enhancements to reporting and disclosure. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA) enhanced reporting and disclosure requirements for pension plans, including statements of accrued benefits, annual funding notices, and eligibility to divest employer securities. ERISA mandates plan administrators to provide participants with a summary plan description (SPD) that outlines plan terms and benefits in a clear and comprehensive manner. The SPD must inform participants when they can join the plan and detail the benefits offered. The summary plan description (SPD) must detail when employees can participate in the plan, benefits provided, vesting of benefits, and remedies for denied claims. Any plan alterations must be communicated to participants through a summary of material modifications (SMM) within 210 days after the modification, written in a way understandable to the average participant. ERISA requires that materials be written in a way understandable to plan participants. Courts have determined that certain plan amendments, like establishing or eliminating benefits, are considered material modifications. Section 103 of ERISA mandates certain employee benefit plans to file an annual report with the Department of Labor, serving as a primary source of information for plan operation and funding. The annual report for employee benefit plans must include detailed financial information and be filed with the Department of Labor on Form 5500 within seven months after the plan year ends. Plan participants can request a copy from the plan administrator, and electronic filing of Form 5500 was required by the DOL in 2006. In 2006, the DOL mandated electronic filing of Form 5500 annual reports for employee benefit plans. Plan administrators must provide pension benefit statements to participants and beneficiaries as required by ERISA Section 105. For defined contribution plans, statements must be given quarterly to those with investment control, or annually to those without control. Defined benefit plans must provide statements every three years to eligible individuals. Pension benefit statements must be provided to participants in defined benefit plans upon request, indicating accrued and non-forfeitable benefits. For defined contribution plans, statements should include the value of each investment in the account. Defined benefit plan administrators must also furnish an annual plan funding notice, including information on funding policy, assets, liabilities, participants, and benefits. The Pension Protection Act (PPA) amended ERISA to require plan administrators to provide participants with a notice of their eligibility to divest employer securities held in a defined contribution plan at least 30 days before the divestment date. Participants must be informed of their right to direct divestment and the importance of diversifying their retirement account investments. ERISA requires plan administrators to inform participants about diversifying retirement account investments and limits exclusion from pension plans based on age or service. Employees must have worked at least 1,000 hours in a 12-month period to be considered to have completed a year of service. Alternatively, some plans may require two years of service before participation. ERISA mandates informing participants about diversifying retirement investments and prohibits age-based exclusion from pension plans. Employees need 1,000 hours of work in a year to complete a year of service. Plans may require two years of service before participation. Vesting in certain educational institution plans is 100% after one year, with eligibility at 26 years old or one year of service. ERISA also regulates benefit accrual, defining accrued benefits differently for defined benefit and defined contribution plans. ERISA provides three primary methods for benefit accrual under a defined benefit plan: the \"133-1/3 rule,\" the \"3% rule,\" and the \"fractional rule.\" These rules govern how benefits accrue based on years of service and normal retirement age. ERISA Section 204(g) prohibits plan amendments that eliminate or reduce benefits already accrued in a defined contribution plan. Participants in a defined contribution plan begin accruing benefits once they meet the plan's participation requirements. Employer contributions may be treated differently for vesting purposes than employee contributions. ERISA Section 204(g), known as the \"anti-cutback rule,\" prohibits plan amendments from reducing accrued benefits for plan participants. This includes basic benefits, early retirement benefits, subsidies, and optional forms of benefits. The rule allows freezing or reducing future benefit accruals but aims to protect participants from hindrances in benefit receipt. In Central Laborers' Pension Fund v. Heinz, a retired plan participant's benefits were suspended following a plan amendment that prohibited certain post-retirement employment. The plaintiff argued that this violated ERISA's anti-cutback rule, which the court upheld, stating that any amendment imposing greater restrictions on benefit receipt reduces the accrued benefit. ERISA prohibits age discrimination in benefit accrual for defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Courts have evaluated cash balance plans for age discrimination due to the structure of pay and interest credits. The PPA amended ERISA to address age discrimination in benefit accrual for cash balance plans. While some district court decisions found these plans to be discriminatory, appellate courts have ruled otherwise. The act established new standards to determine if a plan is age discriminatory, stating that a participant's accrued benefit must be at least equal to that of a similarly situated, younger individual to be considered non-discriminatory. The PPA amended ERISA to address age discrimination in benefit accrual for cash balance plans. A \"similarly situated\" individual must have benefits equal to that of the participant, except for age. Benefits must be fully vested after three years, with interest credits not exceeding a market rate of return. New provisions are effective from June 29, 2005, and plans existing before may face legal challenges. Vested benefits can be received once accrued, ensuring nonforfeitable rights for retirement benefits. The participant may receive vested retirement benefits even if leaving the job before retirement. Vesting requirements apply to employer contributions only. ERISA imposes age and service-based vesting requirements for normal retirement benefits. The plan must specify a normal retirement age for vesting purposes. ERISA requires retirement benefits to vest based on age or years of service, with two vesting schedules for defined benefit plans. Defined contribution plans have different vesting requirements, with exceptions for certain plans where participants are immediately vested in employer contributions. Under ERISA rules, retirement benefits must vest based on age or years of service. There are two vesting schedules for defined benefit plans, including cliff vesting and graduated vesting. Cliff vesting requires 100% vesting after three years, while graduated vesting requires 20% after two years, increasing to 100% after six years. Both employer matching and nonelective contributions must vest. ERISA protects against losing credit for earlier service if an employee leaves and returns within five years. The vesting rules under ERISA require that all service before becoming a plan participant be considered for vesting purposes. Nonvested participants must also count years of service before any break in service upon re-employment. A break in service occurs if an employee completes less than 500 hours of service in a year. Workers typically do not incur a break in service for up to one year due to specific reasons like pregnancy or adoption. The Retirement Equity Act of 1984 increased pension protections for survivors. The Retirement Equity Act of 1984 (REA) amended ERISA to increase pension protections for survivors of deceased plan participants. ERISA requires defined benefit plans to provide survivor annuities to married employees, honor qualified domestic relations orders (QDROs) in case of divorce, and provide survivor annuities to spouses of vested participants. The preretirement survivor annuity can be paid by the employer or passed on to participants. Both participant and spouse must sign a waiver form to waive the benefit. Profit-sharing and stock bonus plans must automatically pay the vested account balance to the spouse upon the participant's death unless an alternate beneficiary is designated. Defined benefit plans must provide a joint and survivor annuity as the default form of benefit for married participants. Beginning in 2008, the PPA requires defined benefit plans to offer a 75% survivor annuity option if the plan's survivor annuity is less than 75%, and a 50% survivor annuity option if it is greater than 75%. Waiving the survivor benefit requires written consent from both the participant and spouse, with a minimum of 90 days before the annuity starting date. Joint and survivor annuities are based on the joint life expectancy of the participant and spouse, resulting in lower payouts compared to single-life annuities. The REA of 1984 amended ERISA to allow plans to honor state court orders awarding a share of a worker's pension to a former spouse through qualified domestic relations orders (QDRO). ERISA sets procedures for plan administrators to determine the validity of a QDRO. A qualified domestic relations order (QDRO) allows pension plans to provide benefits to a former spouse of a participant. It must specify details such as names, addresses, amounts, and plans involved. The order should not require the plan to provide additional benefits or pay more than it would have without the order. The Pension Protection Act (PPA) directed the Secretary of Labor to issue regulations clarifying the qualification of domestic relations orders that supersede or revise earlier QDROs. In the event of a company acquisition, pension benefits for participants and beneficiaries must be maintained, and PBGC insurance protections apply. In cases of plan mergers or transfers, participant benefits must be preserved or increased compared to pre-merger levels. This ensures adequate funds for promised pension benefits. ERISA requires plan sponsors to fully fund pension liabilities of defined benefit plans to ensure payment of promised benefits. The PPA modified funding rules, allowing for amortization of liabilities over time. Single-employer plans must amortize past service liabilities over seven years. Defined contribution plans have no funding requirements. Employers must fund pension benefits earned each year, known as the normal cost. The Pension Protection Act (PPA) requires defined benefit plan sponsors to fully fund pension liabilities each year. This includes funding the normal cost of the plan and amortizing past service liabilities. Assets must be held in a separate trust to protect them from creditors in case of bankruptcy. If a plan is underfunded, the sponsor must amortize the unfunded liability over time. The PPA established new rules for determining full funding and required contributions. The Pension Protection Act (PPA) requires defined benefit plan sponsors to fully fund pension liabilities each year, including the normal cost of the plan and past service liabilities. Assets must be held in a separate trust to protect them from creditors. New rules determine full funding and required contributions, effective for plan years starting in 2008. Determining if a pension is adequately funded involves converting future payments into present value to compare with plan assets. An underfunded plan has assets below liabilities' present value. The Pension Protection Act (PPA) requires plan sponsors to fully fund pension liabilities each year. Future payments must be discounted using an appropriate interest rate. New funding requirements mandate plan assets to equal 100% of plan liabilities. Unfunded liability must be amortized over a maximum of seven years. Sponsors of severely underfunded plans face special rules for higher contributions. Credit balances can offset contributions if the plan is funded at 80% or more. The value of credit balances must be adjusted to reflect changes in the market value of plan assets since contributions were made. A plan sponsor's minimum required contribution is based on the plan's target normal cost and the funding target. If a plan's assets are less than the funding target, the plan has an unfunded liability that must be amortized over a maximum of seven years. The minimum required annual contribution is the plan's target normal cost for the year. The annual contribution is the plan's target normal cost for the year, with a 100% funding target being phased in over several years. ERISA requires plans to discount future liabilities using different interest rates based on the time until payment. Short-term, mid-term, and long-term interest rates are used for liabilities due within five years, five to 20 years, and over 20 years, respectively. The rates are determined by the Secretary of the Treasury based on a yield curve of investment-grade corporate bonds. The yield curve of investment-grade corporate bonds, phased in over three years starting in 2007, replaces the four-year average of corporate bond rates from the Pension Funding Equity Act of 2004. Pension plans at risk of defaulting must use specific actuarial assumptions to determine liabilities. Plans failing to meet funding tests are considered at-risk unless funded at least 80%. The minimum funding requirement for pension plans will be phased in over four years, starting at 65% in 2008 and rising to 80% in 2011. Plans failing to meet funding tests are considered at-risk unless funded at least 80%. Plans at risk for at least two of the previous four years will be subject to an additional \"loading factor\" added to the plan sponsor's required contribution. Plans with 500 or fewer participants are exempt from at-risk funding requirements. The actuaries of a pension plan estimate future obligations using mortality tables to project participants' claims and payment duration. ERISA mandates Treasury-prescribed mortality tables, with large plans able to request a plan-specific table. Prior to the PPA, plan sponsors could value assets using actuarial valuations, smoothing investment returns over five years to reduce volatility caused by interest rate fluctuations. The PPA introduced changes to actuarial valuations for pension plans, narrowing the range for valuations and reducing the maximum smoothing period to two years. Plans with over 100 participants must use the first day of the plan year for calculations, while smaller plans have flexibility. Plan sponsors can offset current contributions with previous ones, but only if assets are at least 80% of the funding target. The PPA requires assets to be at least 80% of the funding target, excluding prefunding balances. Credit balances must be adjusted for investment gains and losses, separated by year. ERISA limits plan amendments, benefit accruals, and distribution options for underfunded defined benefit plans. Shutdown benefits are paid when a plant closes. ERISA prohibits shut-down benefits and other \"contingent event benefits\" from being paid by pension plans funded at less than 60% of full funding. The PBGC guarantee for such benefits is phased in over a five-year period. Benefit accruals must cease in plans funded below 60% of full funding, with decisions on past service accruals made once funding is above 60%. Additional contributions prescribed by statute can exempt plans from these requirements. Section 203 of WRERA addresses plan years beginning on or after October 1. Section 203 of WRERA allows pension plans to use the previous year's funding levels to determine benefit accrual restrictions for the first plan year starting from October 1, 2008, through September 30, 2009. Plans with funding below 80% cannot increase benefits without additional contributions, and lump-sum distributions are prohibited below 60% funding level. ERISA mandates restrictions on distributions from underfunded pension plans based on funding levels. Plans below 60% or in bankruptcy with less than 100% funding are prohibited from distributions. Plans between 60% and 80% funding can only distribute up to half of the accrued benefit as a lump sum. Participants must be notified of any restrictions within 30 days. Defined benefit pensions must offer the option of a life annuity or a lump sum at separation from the employer. The lump-sum distribution from a defined benefit pension is determined by the interest rate used to calculate the present value of the accrued benefit. ERISA mandates using specific interest rates and mortality tables to protect employees' benefits. The PPA amended ERISA to require lump-sum payments to be based on corporate bond interest rates. Plans using higher interest rates for larger lump sums must treat them as a subsidy to participants. The new rules for lump-sum distributions are being phased in over five years, starting in 2008. Minimum permissible lump-sum payments will be based on a three-segment interest rate yield curve derived from investment-grade corporate bond rates. Older workers will receive larger lump sums than younger workers due to the use of different interest rates based on age. The Pension Protection Act (PPA) introduced new rules for lump-sum distributions, with rates based on current bond rates. Plans funded below 60% cannot pay lump sums, while those funded at 60% to 80% can pay up to half of a participant's benefit. The PPA also set an interest rate floor for lump sum calculations under IRC \u00a7415(b), limiting annual annuity payments. Plans must use an interest rate of at least 5.5% or the highest of specified rates for this calculation. The Pension Protection Act (PPA) established new rules for improving the funding of multiemployer defined benefit plans in \"endangered\" or \"critical\" status. Plans must use an interest rate of at least 5.5% or the highest specified rate for lump sum calculations. Multiemployer plans are collectively bargained plans maintained by multiple employers and a labor union, subject to different funding requirements than single-employer plans. ERISA requires each multiemployer plan to certify its funding status and project funding for the next six years within 90 days of the plan year start. The Pension Protection Act (PPA) established new rules for improving the funding of multiemployer defined benefit plans in \"endangered\" or \"critical\" status. Plans must certify their funding status and project funding for the next six years within 90 days of the plan year start. If underfunded, plans have 30 days to notify participants and eight months to develop a funding schedule meeting statutory requirements. The PPA increased the limit on tax-deductible employer contributions to multiemployer plans to 140% of the plan's current liability and eliminated the 25%-of-compensation combined limit on contributions to defined benefit and defined contribution plans. The Pension Protection Act (PPA) established rules to improve funding for seriously underfunded multiemployer plans. Plans with a funding deficiency within seven years are considered endangered and must implement a recovery plan. Plans less than 80% funded have 10 years to improve their funding. Endangered plans must reduce underfunding and improve funding percentage by one-third. Plans that are seriously endangered and less than 70% funded have 15 years to improve their funding by one-fifth of the difference between 100% funding and the plan's funded percentage. Endangered or seriously endangered plans may not increase benefits if the parties cannot agree on a funding improvement plan. A multiemployer plan is considered to be in critical status if it is less than 65% funded and has a projected funding deficiency within five years or will be unable to pay benefits within seven years. Plans in critical status must develop a rehabilitation plan within one year to reduce underfunding. The PPA relaxed ERISA's anti-cutback rule for multiemployer plans in critical status, allowing reductions in early retirement subsidies and other adjustable benefits to improve funding. Normal retirement age benefits cannot be reduced, and plans cannot cut benefits for participants who retired before being notified of critical status. Adjustable benefits include certain optional forms of payment, disability benefits, early retirement benefits, joint and survivor annuities, and recent benefit increases. The PPA amended ERISA for multiemployer plans in critical status, requiring funding notices to be sent to participants within 120 days. Plans must provide information on request, certify funding improvement schedules, and notify relevant parties within 30 days of critical status. ERISA imposes obligations on plan fiduciaries. ERISA Section 3(21)(A) defines a fiduciary as someone who has authority over plan management or assets, provides investment advice for a fee, or has administrative responsibilities. Fiduciaries must be named in the plan document, and they owe duties of loyalty, prudence, diversification, and compliance with plan documents under ERISA Section 404(a)(1). ERISA requires plan fiduciaries to act in the best interest of participants and beneficiaries, avoiding conflicts of interest. Engaging in transactions that benefit the fiduciary or a third party does not always constitute a breach of fiduciary duty, as seen in Donovan v. Bierwirth case involving pension plan trustees who were also corporate officers. In Donovan v. Bierwirth, pension plan trustees breached their fiduciary duties by deciding against tendering company stock during a hostile takeover attempt and purchasing additional stock for the plan. The court emphasized that decisions must prioritize the interests of participants and beneficiaries, not the corporation or fiduciaries themselves. The Department of Labor requires plan fiduciaries to assess service providers objectively, monitor their qualifications, work quality, and fees. A final regulation issued in 2007 revises Form 5500 to disclose fees paid to plan administrators and service providers. The Department of Labor published a proposed regulation in 2007 requiring service providers to disclose all fees and compensation to plan fiduciaries. Fiduciaries must act prudently and courts examine the process taken in decision-making regarding plan assets. Success or failure of an investment may not be relevant to a fiduciary's duty of prudence. The Department of Labor regulations clarify the duty of prudence in investment decisions under ERISA. Fiduciaries must consider relevant facts and circumstances, ensuring investments are designed to further the plan's purposes while considering risk, diversification, liquidity, and return. The duty of prudence in investment decisions under ERISA requires fiduciaries to consider risk, diversification, liquidity, and return when investing the plan's portfolio to minimize the risk of large losses. ERISA Section 404(a)(1)(C) does not set fixed criteria for diversification but mandates a case-specific determination. In GIW Industries, Inc. v. Trevor Stewart, the court found that the defendant breached duty by investing heavily in long-term government bonds, exposing the fund to excessive risk. Expert testimony suggested that investing in short-term bonds or bonds with staggered maturity dates would have minimized risk. Similarly, in Brock v. Citizens Bank of Clovis, trustees breached duty by investing over 65% of assets in commercial real estate mortgages, leading to a lack of diversification. The court found that trustees breached their duty by investing heavily in one type of security, exposing the plan to multiple risks. Despite the lack of diversification, in Metzler v. Graham, a trustee was not found to have breached duty for investing over half of the plan's assets in one real estate piece, as the lack of diversification was deemed prudent in that case. Section 404(a)(1)(D) of ERISA requires fiduciaries to act in accordance with the plan documents, as long as they are consistent with ERISA. Courts have interpreted Section 404(a)(1)(D) of ERISA to apply to various writings that impact a plan, such as investment management agreements and collective bargaining agreements. Fiduciaries must disregard plan provisions that conflict with ERISA, even if compliance would breach other fiduciary duties. The Department of Labor argues that fiduciaries must ignore provisions that require imprudent or disloyal actions. This issue was highlighted in Tittle v. Enron. In Tittle v. Enron, the court held that plan fiduciaries have a duty to disregard provisions that would be imprudent to follow. Courts have also found that fiduciaries do not breach their duty if they make good faith errors in interpreting plan documents, as seen in Morgan v. Independent Drivers Association Pension Plan. ERISA prohibits fiduciaries from engaging in specified transactions likely to harm a pension plan, with Section 406(a) barring certain transactions between a plan and a party in interest. Fiduciaries must avoid causing a plan to engage in transactions involving property sales, lending money, providing goods or services, transferring plan assets, or acquiring assets on behalf of the plan. ERISA prohibits certain transactions between a pension plan and parties in interest to prevent harm to the plan. This includes restrictions on dealing with plan assets for personal gain, acting on behalf of conflicting parties, and limits on investing in employer securities or property. The ERISA prohibits transactions between pension plans and parties in interest to prevent harm. Section 407 restricts plans from investing in employer securities or real property unless they are qualifying. Plans cannot hold more than 10% of employer securities or property. Defined contribution plans have new diversification requirements for employer securities under the PPA. Section 204(j) of ERISA allows individuals to divest employee contributions and elective deferrals invested in employer securities and reinvest in other options. Plans must offer at least three alternative investment options for diversification. Employees with three years of service can also diversify employer matching and nonelective contributions out of employer stock. This requirement is phased in over three years for existing contributions before 2007. Plans cannot impose restrictions, except as provided in regulations. ERISA allows individuals to divest and reinvest in other options, with plans required to offer diversification options. Employees with three years of service can diversify employer contributions out of stock, phased in over three years before 2007. Plans cannot impose restrictions on employer stock investment not imposed on other investments. The Labor Department grants exemptions for certain individuals and classes, ensuring feasibility and protection of participants' rights. Prior to the PPA, ERISA's prohibited transaction restrictions discouraged investment advice provision due to the broad categories of prohibited transactions. The PPA amended ERISA to address this issue and provide exemptions for certain transactions, including loans to participants, reasonable arrangements with parties in interest, certain plan investments, and the purchase of insurance from a qualifying insurer. The PPA amended ERISA to provide a statutory prohibited transaction exemption for investment advice, allowing fiduciaries to provide advice without fear of liability. This exemption applies to transactions involving investment advice provided by a fiduciary adviser under an \"eligible investment advice arrangement.\" The PPA amended ERISA to provide a prohibited transaction exemption for investment advice, allowing fiduciaries to provide advice under an \"eligible investment advice arrangement.\" This arrangement must meet specific requirements, including authorization by a plan fiduciary, annual audits, disclosure requirements, and clear participant notifications. Under ERISA, fiduciaries can provide investment advice under an \"eligible investment advice arrangement\" with specific requirements such as authorization, audits, disclosure, and clear participant notifications. Section 404(c) provides immunity for fiduciaries if participants have control over their account assets, but certain requirements must be met for the plan to qualify as a \"404(c) plan.\" Labor Department regulations outline the criteria for a plan to be considered a \"404(c) plan,\" including providing participants with control over their account assets. The ERISA regulations require that individuals have the opportunity to control their account assets and make informed investment decisions. Plans must offer a broad range of diversified investment alternatives, with at least three options that differ in risk and return characteristics. Participants must be able to materially affect the potential return and risk of their account. The ERISA regulations mandate that participants have the ability to control their account assets and make informed investment choices. Plans must provide diverse investment options with varying risk and return profiles to help participants achieve a suitable portfolio. Fiduciaries can avoid liability under Section 404(c) if participants exercise independent control over their investments. Personal liability may arise if fiduciaries breach their duties under ERISA Section 409. Section 409 of ERISA holds fiduciaries accountable for any losses resulting from breaches of duty, with potential forfeiture of profits made through improper use of plan assets. Courts may award monetary and equitable relief as needed. Fiduciaries are not liable for breaches committed before or after their fiduciary role, but may be responsible for rectifying previous breaches. ERISA aims to protect participants' interests and ensure diverse investment options for suitable portfolios. ERISA aims to protect participants' interests and ensure diverse investment options for suitable portfolios. It provides for appropriate remedies, sanctions, and access to Federal courts through an integrated enforcement mechanism. Section 502 allows private parties and government entities to bring civil actions to enforce ERISA provisions and remedies. The actions that can be brought under ERISA's enforcement scheme include redressing failures of plan administrators, recovering benefits, enforcing rights, obtaining relief for fiduciary breaches, enjoining violations, and collecting civil penalties. Section 502 provides exclusive federal remedies and may preempt state law. Under the doctrine of complete preemption, state law claims that conflict with federal statutory schemes in ERISA can be removed to federal court. If a state law claim falls within ERISA's Section 502(a) civil enforcement provisions, it is completely preempted, limiting the plaintiff to remedies available under federal law. The Supreme Court has evaluated claims under Section 502 of ERISA, which allows plaintiffs to bring actions against plans to recover benefits or enforce their rights. If benefits are denied, plaintiffs can sue for unpaid benefits, seek declarations for future benefits, or obtain injunctions. A plaintiff under Section 502 of ERISA can seek a declaration for future benefits or an injunction to prevent benefit denial. Section 502(a)(1)(B) allows successful plaintiffs to receive entitled benefits, excluding compensatory or punitive damages. This section preempts state law claims, sparking controversy over the limitation of damages available. The issue of preemption of state law claims by ERISA 502(a)(1)(B) has been contentious and closely examined by the courts. The Supreme Court in Pilot Life v. Dedeaux evaluated whether a state law claim for wrongful denial of benefits was preempted by Sections 514 and 502 of ERISA. The plaintiffs claimed that denial of disability benefits violated Mississippi common law relating to bad faith. The Court found the state law claim preempted by Section 502, stating that ERISA's civil enforcement provisions are the exclusive means for addressing benefit denials. The Supreme Court evaluated whether state law claims for wrongful denial of benefits were preempted by ERISA in Aetna Health Inc. v. Davila. The issue was whether individual causes of action were preempted by ERISA, leading to removal to federal court. Respondents argued that their state law claim would undermine the federal scheme if allowed. The Supreme Court ruled that state law claims for wrongful denial of benefits were not preempted by ERISA in Aetna Health Inc. v. Davila. Respondents' claim for violating the \"duty of ordinary care\" was found to be solely related to ERISA-regulated plans, not an independent legal duty. The Court clarified that state causes of action seeking larger remedies than ERISA do not fall outside of ERISA claims. Section 502(a)(2) of ERISA allows for civil actions for breaches of fiduciary duty under Section 409, holding fiduciaries personally liable for breaches against an ERISA plan. One controversial issue with breach of fiduciary duty claims under ERISA is that recovery must benefit the plan as a whole. In Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Russell, the Supreme Court evaluated a plan beneficiary's civil action for damages against a fiduciary responsible for mishandling a benefit claim. The Court rejected the plaintiff's claim for damages under ERISA Section 409, stating that beneficiaries cannot sue fiduciaries for monetary damages. The Supreme Court's LaRue v. DeWolff decision addressed whether participants in a defined contribution plan can recover losses affecting individual accounts. In LaRue v. DeWolff, a participant in a 401(k) plan sued plan administrators for failing to change an investment in his account, resulting in $150,000 in losses. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the participant, allowing recovery for fiduciary breaches that impact the value of plan assets in an individual's account. Justice Stevens distinguished LaRue from previous cases, emphasizing the violation of ERISA's statutory duties related to proper plan management. The Supreme Court ruled in LaRue v. DeWolff that fiduciary breaches impacting the value of plan assets in an individual's account can be recovered. The Court emphasized the violation of ERISA's statutory duties related to proper plan management, administration, and investment of fund assets. In contrast, the Court noted that fiduciary misconduct in defined contribution plans does not need to threaten the entire plan's solvency to reduce benefits. The Supreme Court in Varity v. Howe clarified that fiduciary breaches in defined contribution plans can lead to reduced benefits for participants, allowing for individual relief under Section 502(a)(3) of ERISA. This section permits civil actions to address violations of ERISA or plan terms, providing a catchall provision for claims not covered by other sections. The Supreme Court in Varity v. Howe established that individual relief is available under Section 502(a)(3) of ERISA. However, courts have grappled with interpreting \"other appropriate equitable relief\" in this section, particularly in cases seeking monetary relief for ERISA violations. In Mertens v. Hewitt Associates, the Court ruled that monetary relief sought by plan participants was essentially compensatory damages for plan underfunding leading to defaulting on retirement benefits. The Supreme Court held in a 5-4 decision that ERISA Section 502(a)(3) does not authorize suits for compensatory damages against a non-fiduciary. The Court explained that \"equitable relief\" under this section refers to traditional forms of equitable relief such as injunction, mandamus, or restitution, and not compensatory damages. This decision clarified that the relief available under Section 502(a)(3) is limited to traditional equitable remedies. In Great West Life & Annuity Insurance Co. v. Knudson, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the plan beneficiary, stating that ERISA Section 502(a)(3) does not allow for reimbursement sought by the health plan. The Court rejected the plan's argument that the relief sought was restitution, emphasizing that Section 502(a)(3) only authorizes traditional equitable remedies. The Court ruled that under ERISA Section 502(a)(3), restitution sought must be to restore specific funds or property in the defendant's possession. Since the settlement proceeds were not in the defendant's possession, the plaintiff's claim for equitable relief failed. ERISA provides for criminal sanctions under Section 501 for willful violations of reporting and disclosure provisions, with fines up to $100,000 and imprisonment up to 10 years. Section 501 of ERISA includes willful acts or omissions in reporting or disclosure, with fines up to $100,000 and imprisonment up to 10 years. Section 511 prohibits the use of fraud, force, or violence to interfere with rights under an employee benefit plan. Section 411 bars individuals convicted of certain crimes from holding positions related to a benefit plan. Section 411 of ERISA prohibits individuals convicted of certain crimes from holding positions related to a benefit plan. Violators may face fines up to $10,000, imprisonment up to five years, or both. The Federal Criminal Code also prohibits embezzlement or theft of assets from an employee benefit plan, with penalties including fines and imprisonment. Under Section 1127 of Title 18 of the United States Code, individuals who make false statements or conceal facts on required documents under ERISA may face penalties of up to $10,000, five years in prison, or both. Section 1954 of Title 18 prohibits certain individuals from soliciting or receiving bribes related to employee benefit plans, with penalties of fines, imprisonment for up to three years, or both. ERISA gives the Secretary of Labor authority to detect and investigate violations, including criminal offenses. It preempts state laws to ensure uniform regulation of employee benefit plans. ERISA preemption aims to regulate employee benefit plans uniformly at a national level. The debate revolves around ERISA's Section 514, which allows for federal preemption of state laws, and Section 502(a), which governs claims and remedies under ERISA. Section 514(a) specifically preempts any state laws related to employee benefit plans. The Supreme Court has addressed the scope of this provision in cases like Shaw v. Delta Airlines. In Shaw v. Delta Airlines, the Supreme Court interpreted ERISA's preemption clause broadly, stating that any state law with a connection to an employee benefit plan could be preempted. However, the Court's decision in New York State Conference of Blue Cross & Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Insurance Co. signaled a shift in its interpretation of Section 514(a) by considering the specific impact on different insurers. The commercial insurers argued that the law was preempted by ERISA because it \"relate[d] to\" employer-sponsored health insurance plans. The Court concluded that Congress did not intend to displace general health care regulation, which historically has been a matter of local concern. Despite previous cases narrowing the scope of ERISA preemption, Section 514(a) is still considered to broadly preempt state laws. The \"savings clause\" under ERISA Section 514(b) provides exemptions to ERISA preemption, allowing states to enforce laws regulating insurance, banking, or securities. The Supreme Court's interpretation of which state laws \"regulate insurance\" has been a key issue, as seen in the case of Kentucky Association of Health Plans, Inc. v. Miller, where the Court found that Kentucky's \"any willing provider\" laws were saved from ERISA preemption. The Supreme Court introduced a new two-part test for determining if a state law falls within the savings clause of ERISA Section 514(b), focusing on laws specifically directed towards the insurance industry and substantially affecting risk pooling arrangements. The Court clarified that the savings clause regulates insurance, not insurers, and rejected arguments that laws like AWP laws were not directed towards insurers. The Supreme Court introduced a new two-part test for determining if a state law falls within the savings clause of ERISA Section 514(b), focusing on laws specifically directed towards the insurance industry and substantially affecting risk pooling arrangements. The Court clarified that the savings clause regulates insurance, not insurers, and rejected arguments that laws like AWP laws were not directed towards insurers. The Court explained that AWP laws affect the risk pooling arrangement by altering the scope of permissible bargains between insurers and insureds. The \"deemer clause\" in ERISA preemption prevents employee benefit plans from being considered insurers under state law, thus avoiding ERISA preemption. In FMC v. Holliday, the Supreme Court ruled that a Pennsylvania law interfering with subrogation in a self-funded health plan was preempted by ERISA. The law was deemed to control insurance contract terms by invalidating subrogation provisions. The self-funded health plan in question could not be considered an insured plan for state regulation purposes due to ERISA preemption. ERISA's Section 502 allows participants to bring civil actions to recover benefits or clarify their rights under the plan, preempting state law claims within its scope. ERISA regulates welfare benefit plans, including health plans offered by employers for medical benefits. Health plans must meet fiduciary standards, reporting requirements, and appeal procedures. Congress added requirements to ERISA in 1986 for health plan coverage, including rules on continuation coverage and preexisting condition exclusions. The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA) added a new Part 6 to Title I of ERISA, requiring group health plans to offer continuation coverage for qualified beneficiaries in case of certain events. This includes limitations on preexisting condition exclusions, parity between medical/surgical and mental health benefits, and minimum hospital stay requirements for new mothers. The COBRA law requires employers to offer continuation coverage for qualified beneficiaries in case of certain events like loss of coverage due to death, termination, or reduction of hours of employment. The coverage must be provided for at least 18 months, with the possibility of extension depending on the qualifying event. The benefits offered under COBRA must be identical to those offered to non-COBRA beneficiaries, with premiums not exceeding 102% of the group rate. After 18 months, certain participants may be charged 150% of the group rate. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, P.L. 111-5) provides COBRA premium subsidies of 65% to help the unemployed afford health insurance coverage from their former employer. The subsidy is available for up to nine months for those who meet income requirements and were involuntarily terminated between September 1, 2008, and January 1, 2010. Additionally, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) added new requirements for health plan coverage under ERISA. HIPAA amended ERISA to limit preexisting condition exclusions in health plans to 12 months after enrollment. It also prohibits exclusions for pregnancy-related conditions and ensures coverage for newborns and adopted children with no more than a 64-day coverage gap. Special enrollment opportunities are required by HIPAA for certain individuals. Special enrollment rights are provided to individuals who experience certain life events, such as marriage, birth, adoption, or loss of other health coverage. Additionally, group health plans must allow employees and dependents to enroll in two additional circumstances: when Medicaid or SCHIP coverage is terminated, or when financial assistance under Medicaid or SCHIP is obtained. This was mandated by the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009. HIPAA created ERISA Section 702, prohibiting health plans from basing coverage eligibility on certain health factors. It also added Section 703, preventing denial of coverage to employers under certain circumstances. In 1996, Congress enacted the Mental Health Parity Act (MHPA) under ERISA Section 712, requiring health plans offering mental health coverage to have parity in annual and lifetime dollar limits with medical and surgical benefits. Plans can choose which mental health benefits to offer, but substance abuse treatment is not covered. Exemptions exist for plans covering employers with 50 or fewer employees or experiencing a 1% increase in claims costs due to MHPA compliance. The Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act expands the parity requirements under the Mental Health Parity Act for mental health and substance use disorder coverage in group health plans. It amends ERISA to require parity in financial requirements and treatment limitations. The new requirements apply to group health plans starting after October 3, 2009. The Newborns' and Mothers' Health Protection Act (NMHPA) amended ERISA to establish minimum hospital stay requirements for mothers after childbirth. It prohibits limiting hospital stays to less than 48 hours after a normal delivery and 96 hours after a cesarean section. The Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act requires group health plans to cover prosthetic devices and reconstructive surgery for mastectomy patients. Employer-sponsored retirement plans must comply with pension-related provisions of the Internal Revenue Code to qualify for tax deferrals and deductions. The Internal Revenue Code requires employer-sponsored retirement plans to comply with pension-related provisions to qualify for tax benefits. These provisions include nondiscrimination rules, contribution limits, and benefit restrictions. In 2009, the maximum annual benefit payable under a defined benefit plan at age 62 was $195,000 or 100% of the participant's average compensation. The dollar limit for retirement benefits is $195,000 or 100% of the participant's average compensation for the three highest years of earnings, adjusted annually. Actuarial reduction is required for retirement before age 62, except for qualified police and firefighters with 15 years of service. Plan sponsors cannot withdraw money from a pension trust fund but can recover excess assets upon plan termination, subject to corporate income and federal excise taxes. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 increased the excise tax on pension asset reversions from 15% to 50%, with exceptions for qualified replacement plans, significant benefit increases, or bankruptcy liquidation. A qualified replacement plan must cover 95% of active participants and transfer 25% of the reversion amount. Excess assets from a defined benefit pension plan can be transferred to a retiree health plan, limited by the market value of assets over the full funding limit. The Pension Protection Act (PPA) of 2006 amended IRC \u00a7420 to allow defined benefit plan sponsors to transfer surplus assets to retiree health plans. Sponsors can transfer excess pension assets to fund retiree medical costs for up to 10 years, maintaining funded status and retiree benefits levels. In 2007, the maximum tax-deductible employer contribution to a defined benefit plan was 150% of the plan's current liability. Beginning in 2008, the maximum tax-deductible employer contribution to a defined benefit plan is the plan's target normal cost plus 150% of the funding target plus an allowance for future pay or benefit increases, minus the value of the plan's assets. Excess contributions are subject to a 10% excise tax. IRC \u00a7415(c) limits the maximum annual addition to a defined contribution plan in 2009 to the lesser of $49,000 or 100% of annual compensation. The maximum employee contribution to a 401(k), 403(b), or 457(b) plan is $16,500 in 2009, indexed annually. IRC \u00a7404(a)(7) establishes limits on employer tax deductions for contributions to defined contribution plans. The Pension Protection Act (PPA) revised the law regarding contribution limits for defined contribution plans, excluding defined benefit plans insured by the PBGC. Employer contributions exceeding 6% of participant compensation are subject to limits, while elective deferrals by employees are not. The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 allows additional contributions for participants aged 50 or older in various retirement plans. The Pension Protection Act (PPA) made catch-up contributions for 457(b), SEP, IRA, and SIMPLE plans permanent for individuals aged 50 or older. The maximum catch-up contribution is based on a specific dollar limit or the participant's compensation. Highly-compensated employees (HCEs) are defined as those owning 5% or more of the company or earning over $110,000 in 2009. Employers cannot discriminate in favor of HCEs in tax-qualified retirement plans. The Pension Protection Act (PPA) allows catch-up contributions for certain retirement plans for individuals aged 50 or older. Highly-compensated employees (HCEs) are defined as those owning 5% or more of the company or earning over $110,000 in 2009. Employers must ensure that their retirement plans do not discriminate in favor of HCEs. The plan must meet specific tests to ensure it benefits non-highly compensated employees adequately. In a defined contribution plan, the proportion of NHCEs covered must be at least 70% of HCEs, or the average contribution percentage for NHCEs must be at least 70% of HCEs. Plans with after-tax or matching contributions are subject to the ACP test. Some \u00a7403(b) plans have nondiscrimination rules, while \u00a7457 plans generally do not. HCEs in a \u00a7401(k) plan cannot exceed certain contribution limits. Safe-harbor 401(k) plan designs automatically satisfy the ACP test for employer matching contributions. The ACP test automatically checks for employer matching contributions in 401(k) plans. The employer matches 100% of employee elective deferrals up to 3% of compensation, and 50% of deferrals between 3% and 5% of compensation. All matching contributions vest immediately. Employer contributions must equal at least 3% of pay for all eligible NHCEs and must vest immediately. Plans must pass an ADP test for elective deferrals. Safe-harbor designs can automatically satisfy the ADP test. The ACP test automatically checks for employer matching contributions in 401(k) plans. \"Cross-testing\" allows defined-contribution plans to satisfy nondiscrimination tests based on projected account balances at retirement age. Regulations limit the size of permitted disparity in favor of higher-paid workers. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 established uniform distribution rules for pension plans and imposed an excise tax for failure to make required minimum distributions. Defined benefit and money purchase plans offer participants a life annuity as a benefit. Other payment options include lump-sum distributions. Defined contribution plans pay benefits in a lump sum or over a set period, with some offering an annuity option. Participants can start receiving benefits at age 65, after ten years of service, or upon terminating employment. Defined benefit and money purchase plans typically provide benefits at normal retirement age, with some allowing for early retirement at age 55. 401(k) plans allow for account balance withdrawals upon leaving the employer or at age 59\u00bd. Profit-sharing plans may distribute benefits after a specific number of years or upon leaving the employer. Distributions from employer-sponsored plans must begin by age 70\u00bd, unless still employed by the sponsoring company. The required minimum distribution from a retirement plan is based on the participant's age and life expectancy. If a participant in a defined benefit plan retires after age 70\u00bd, their pension benefit must be adjusted. Some employers offer phased retirement options for employees near retirement age. The Pension Protection Act allows defined benefit plans to make in-service distributions starting at age 62. Distributions from a 401(k) plan can begin at age 59\u00bd for current employees without penalty. In-service distributions from DB or DC plans are taxable. Qualified plans may offer loans to participants with reasonable interest rates and security. Loans exceeding limits are treated as taxable distributions. Participants can borrow up to half of accrued benefits or $50,000, to be repaid within five years unless used for a home purchase. Loans from defined contribution plans like 401(k), 403(b), or 457 can be taken out for financial hardship reasons, such as imminent eviction. These distributions are subject to income taxes and a possible 10% additional tax if the recipient is under age 59\u00bd. A 10% additional tax is generally imposed on distributions from qualified plans unless the individual is age 59\u00bd, dies, becomes disabled, or meets other exceptions. Distributions from qualified plans can be made in various circumstances: disability, SEPPs, early retirement, ESOP dividends, IRS levy for back taxes, medical expenses exceeding 7.5% of AGI, or under a QDRO. Departing participants can roll over distributions to an IRA or another employer's plan. Immediate distribution is possible for accrued benefits less than $5,000. When a participant leaves an employer, the plan can distribute funds without consent. Amounts over $5,000 require written consent, including the spouse's approval for married workers. Distributions over $1,000 are automatically rolled over into an IRA chosen by the plan, unless the participant opts for a lump sum or selects their own IRA. The rollover must go to a qualified entity with principal-preserving investments and minimal fees. When leaving an employer, funds can be distributed without consent, but amounts over $5,000 require approval. If not transferred to another qualified plan or IRA, a 10% tax penalty applies for those under 59\u00bd. Direct distributions are subject to 20% tax withholding, but can be rolled over within 60 days to avoid penalties. Social Security benefits favor lower-income workers over higher-income workers. Social Security benefits replace a greater percentage of wages for lower-income workers than for higher-income workers. Private pension plans can narrow this difference by providing larger benefits to higher-paid workers. Plans may integrate their retirement benefit formulas with Social Security using an offset or excess method. Integration in defined benefit plans is related to participant benefits, while in defined contribution plans, it relates to employer contributions. In integrated defined benefit and defined contribution plans, employer contributions are adjusted based on Social Security benefits. The integration level, often set at the maximum annual income subject to Social Security taxes, limits the offset or disparity allowed. Plans are considered top-heavy if key employees earn over $160,000 or receive more than 60% of benefits/contributions. Top-heavy plans have special requirements for employees defined as company officers with earnings over $160,000, owners of at least 1% of the company receiving over $150,000 in compensation, and owners of 5% or more of the company. These plans must implement accelerated vesting schedules, with two options for participants to be 100% vested in benefits after three or six years of service. The vesting schedules for top-heavy plans require accelerated vesting for certain employees, with two options for participants to be 100% vested in benefits after three or six years of service. Additionally, specific minimum benefit and contribution levels must be met for non-key employees covered by the plan, with a required minimum benefit equal to 2% of the employee's average compensation for the five highest consecutive years of compensation. Title III of ERISA covers jurisdictional, administrative, and enforcement matters related to retirement plans. The Treasury Department, Department of Labor, and PBGC coordinate enforcement and regulatory responsibilities. Before issuing a determination letter, the Treasury Department allows certain parties to comment. If violations occur, the Secretary of Labor and PBGC can bring claims against parties for non-compliance with ERISA provisions. Section 3003 and 3004 of ERISA require collaboration between the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Labor in cases involving taxes on prohibited transactions. The Secretaries must consult with each other to develop rules and regulations for efficient administration of the provisions. Title IV of ERISA established the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) to protect retirement income in private-sector defined benefit pension plans. PBGC does not insure defined contribution plans like ESOPs, 401(k), and profit-sharing plans. It maintains separate reserve funds for single-employer and multiemployer plans, receiving no appropriations from Congress. The PBGC is funded by premiums from employers with defined benefit pension plans and assets from terminated plans. It does not receive appropriations from Congress but is required to include its receipts and disbursements in the federal budget. Premiums are set by Congress, with a per-capita premium for all plans and a variable premium for underfunded plans. The per capita premium was increased from $19 to $30 per year by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 increased the per capita premium to $30 per year for single-employer plans and indexed future premiums to wage growth. The variable premium is $9 per $1,000 of underfunded vested benefits, with a composite corporate bond rate used to determine underfunding. The PPA requires all underfunded plans to pay the variable premium, regardless of past funding status. For small employers, the variable premium is $5 per participant. The PPA made permanent a surcharge premium for certain distress terminations, adding a $1,250 annual surcharge per participant for three years for firms terminating underfunded pension plans during bankruptcy. The PBGC guarantees basic benefits, including pension benefits at normal retirement age, early retirement, disability benefits, and survivor benefits. Only vested benefits are insured, with a maximum yearly pension guarantee of $54,000 for participants retiring at age 65 in 2009. The PBGC guarantees basic benefits for pension plans, including pension benefits at normal retirement age, early retirement, disability benefits, and survivor benefits. Benefits are insured at their nominal value and not adjusted for inflation. A sponsor can voluntarily end a pension plan through a \"standard\" termination if fully funded or a \"distress\" termination for financial trouble. The PBGC may also terminate a plan involuntarily under certain conditions. The PBGC becomes responsible for paying benefits in the case of a distress or involuntary termination. An employer can end a plan through a standard termination only if the plan's assets are sufficient to cover all liabilities. Participants must be informed of amounts due to them, and an actuary must certify asset sufficiency. If rules for standard termination are met, annuities are purchased or lump-sum payments distributed. Employer liability ends, and remaining assets can be recaptured after taxes. Underfunded plans can be terminated under distress termination in specific conditions like bankruptcy proceedings seeking liquidation. The PBGC may end a pension plan if specific conditions like bankruptcy proceedings seeking liquidation are met. Companies must meet criteria for distress termination, such as being unable to pay debts or experiencing burdensome pension costs. A contributing sponsor or substantial member of the sponsor's controlled group must meet one of the criteria for distress termination. The PBGC may end a pension plan if specific conditions like bankruptcy proceedings seeking liquidation are met. The plan sponsor is liable for unfunded benefit liabilities in distress or involuntary terminations. Each member of the controlled group can be held responsible for the entire liability. Employer liability to the PBGC is due on the termination date. The PBGC can prescribe terms for payment of employer liability exceeding 30% of net worth. If a company sells a business to evade pension liabilities and the plan is terminated within five years, they can be held liable for unfunded liabilities. The PBGC must be notified of non-compliance, benefit decreases, participant drops, funding issues, substantial owner distributions, and controlled group member departures. The PBGC must be notified of various events such as substantial owner distributions, controlled group member departures, and plan terminations. ERISA requires plan sponsors to provide information to participants in case of underfunded distress terminations or involuntary terminations. Multiemployer pension plans have different rules due to their unique nature. The PBGC provides financial assistance to insolvent multiemployer plans to pay guaranteed benefits. They guarantee a portion of monthly benefits based on years of service, with a reduced guarantee if funding requirements are not met. Employers leaving a multiemployer plan are still liable for underfunding, known as withdrawal liability, to protect remaining contributing employers and the PBGC. The withdrawal liability is imposed on employers who cease contributing to a pension plan to prevent the PBGC from funding their obligations. It is payable in annual installments for up to 20 years and is based on the employer's share of the plan's unfunded vested liability. New employers have a six-year \"free look\" period before incurring withdrawal liability, except if they account for 2% or more of total contributions to the plan. The glossary contains terms and abbreviations used in ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code."
