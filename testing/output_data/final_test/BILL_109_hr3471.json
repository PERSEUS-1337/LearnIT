    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Strengthening the Chafee Foster Care Independence Program Act\". The Congress acknowledges the importance of the John H. Chafee Foster Care Independence Program in assisting youth aging out of foster care, highlighting the need for familial support in their transition to adulthood. After the enactment of the John H. Chafee Foster Care Independence Program, 40 States reported significant increases in independent living services for emancipated foster care youth, leading to improved support for housing, education, and employment. Studies show that these youth face challenges such as low earnings, poor education, homelessness, and chronic medical issues. The Chafee program implementation has weaknesses identified by child welfare experts and the GAO, including gaps in critical services like mental health, mentoring, and housing. Eligible services vary greatly within and across States due to geographic location and differing levels of availability. The GAO found little information on the effectiveness of independent living services for former foster care youth, with varying levels of coverage and services across states. The GAO identified deficiencies in measuring services for former foster care youth, lack of usable program information in the CFSP, and failure to implement the National Youth in Transition Database to monitor States' performance for youth aging out of foster care. Empirical research shows children in kinship care receive fewer independent living services compared to those in foster care. Children in kinship care receive fewer independent living services compared to those in foster care, impacting areas such as employment, housing, financial management, and health/behavioral health, especially concerning as children of color are over-represented in kinship care situations. Improving awareness of available services. The Secretary will distribute information about federal programs to help youth transitioning out of foster care access services for self-sufficiency. States will also have duties to support this initiative. The chief executive officer must certify that the State will inform foster care children about available support services before they leave the system. Developing common standards for foster care. The Social Security Act is amended to develop common standards for foster care, focusing on monitoring the implementation of the John H. Chafee Foster Care Independence Program by states. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will create a standard reporting format for State Child and Family Service plans to assess states' progress in meeting the needs of youth in foster care and those recently emancipated. This format will ensure the appropriate delivery of independent living services. The Social Security Act is amended to develop common standards for foster care, focusing on monitoring the implementation of the John H. Chafee Foster Care Independence Program by states. This includes clear delineation of support services for youth in foster care, transition services for youth and young adults, and ensuring equitable service provision in various foster care settings. The Social Security Act is amended to develop common standards for foster care, focusing on monitoring the implementation of the John H. Chafee Foster Care Independence Program by states, including methods used to ensure youth are informed of available support services. SEC. 5.
