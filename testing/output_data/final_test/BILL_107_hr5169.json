    "content": "The Act titled \"Wastewater Treatment Works Security Act of 2002\" amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act by adding a section on wastewater treatment works security. The Administrator may provide grants for vulnerability assessments and security enhancements to publicly owned treatment works to reduce vulnerabilities and improve security measures. A vulnerability assessment is defined as an evaluation of the treatment works' susceptibility to actions that could disrupt its safe and reliable operation. A vulnerability assessment for treatment works includes identifying methods to reduce vulnerabilities by implementing procedures, countermeasures, and equipment. It involves reviewing facilities, systems, and devices used in sewage storage and treatment, as well as sewer systems and conveyances. Grants for Security Enhancements may be provided for the purchase and installation of equipment to reduce vulnerabilities identified in a vulnerability assessment for treatment works. This includes systems, conveyances, equipment, chemicals, and operation procedures. Security enhancements may include purchasing and installing equipment for access control, intrusion prevention, and detection of intruders and hazardous substances. This involves barriers, fencing, gates, security lighting, cameras, metal grates, wire mesh, manhole cover securing, door locks, and detection systems for smoke, chemicals, and explosives. Additionally, security improvements can be made to electronic, computer, or automated systems. The Administrator may provide grants for security enhancements such as access control, intrusion prevention, security screening of employees, and additional security measures not listed in the previous paragraph. Applicants must submit an application to be eligible for these grants. The Administrator may provide grants for security enhancements, with limitations on fund usage and disclosure of vulnerability assessments. Grants under subsections (a)(2) and (a)(3) cannot be used for personnel costs or facility maintenance. The Federal share of grant costs cannot exceed 75 percent. The Administrator may provide technical assistance and grants for security enhancements to small publicly owned treatment works, including conducting vulnerability assessments and implementing security measures. Nonprofit organizations may also receive grants for this purpose. The total amount of grants for one treatment works cannot exceed $150,000. The Administrator may provide grants to nonprofit organizations to assist small publicly owned treatment works serving fewer than 20,000 people. Authorization of appropriations includes $200,000,000 for grants and $15,000,000 for technical assistance, with funds remaining available until expended. Refinement of vulnerability assessment methodology for publicly owned treatment works. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency may provide grants to a nonprofit organization to improve vulnerability self-assessment methodologies and tools for publicly owned treatment works, including those in combined wastewater treatment and water supply systems. The grants can be used for software upgrades, technical support, information libraries, and user training at no cost to recipients. $1,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2003 to 2007 for this purpose. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency may provide grants to a nonprofit organization for vulnerability self-assessment tools for treatment works. $1,000,000 authorized annually for fiscal years 2003-2007.
