    "content": "The Unemployment Compensation (UC) program provides up to 26 weeks of income support for eligible workers who lose their jobs. Benefits can be extended for up to 13 or 20 weeks through the Extended Benefit (EB) program. The Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC08) program, which provided up to 47 weeks of benefits, expired in 2013. Currently, only the UC and EB programs are authorized, with no state in an active EB period. Former U.S. military servicemembers may also be eligible for unemployment benefits. Former U.S. military servicemembers may be eligible for unemployment benefits through the UCX program, which treats them the same as other unemployed workers. Each state determines the specifics of UC benefits, resulting in essentially 53 different programs. UC eligibility is based on attaining qualified wages and employment in covered work over a 12-month period prior to unemployment. The UC program determines monetary eligibility based on a claimant's average weekly wage, funded by federal and state taxes. FUTA and SUTA taxes finance administrative costs, loans to insolvent state UC accounts, and EB payments. SUTA taxes are limited to funding regular UC benefits and state EB payments. Federal law mandates a state tax on at least the first $7,000 of each employee's earnings. The state tax on employee earnings is required to be on at least the first $7,000, with a minimum rate of 5.4%. States have flexibility in determining their SUTA structure based on UC payments to former employees. Funds from FUTA and SUTA go into the Unemployment Trust Fund. In 2008, the EUC08 program was created to extend unemployment compensation during economic slowdowns. The EUC08 program was a federal temporary program to extend unemployment compensation during economic slowdowns. It was administered by state UC agencies and the benefit amount was equal to the individual's weekly regular UC benefits. The program was extended multiple times and the final amendment was made by P.L. 112-240. The most recent modifications were made by P.L. 112-96, which included changes to the number of weeks available in each tier and the state unemployment rates required for an active tier. The EUC08 program had tiers based on state unemployment rates. Tiers I, II, III, and IV provided varying weeks of benefits based on the state's total unemployment rate. North Carolina did not have access to Tier II, III, or IV benefits. The EUC08 program in North Carolina ended on December 28, 2013. All tiers of benefits expired by January 1, 2014, with no grandfathering of benefits. Most states were prohibited from reducing UC benefits from February 2009 to December 2013, except for North Carolina which implemented benefit reductions. The EUC08 agreement between North Carolina and the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Labor terminated early, ending all tiers of EUC08 benefits in the state on June 29, 2013. State actions reduced UC benefit duration as an alternative to decrease total UC benefit payments, possibly in response to a state UC financing shortfall. The EB program, established by the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970, may extend receipt of unemployment benefits at the state level under certain economic situations. The EB program extends unemployment benefits at the state level based on specific economic conditions. States must pay up to 13 weeks of EB if the insured unemployment rate meets certain criteria. Optional thresholds allow for additional weeks of benefits based on different unemployment rate thresholds. The EB program provides extended unemployment benefits at the state level based on specific economic conditions. States can pay up to 13 weeks of EB if the insured unemployment rate meets certain criteria, with optional additional weeks available based on different unemployment rate thresholds. P.L. 111-312, as amended by P.L. 112-240, made technical changes to triggers in the EB program, allowing states to use lookback calculations based on three years of unemployment rate data for their mandatory IUR and optional TUR triggers. The EB program provides extended unemployment benefits at the state level based on specific economic conditions. States can pay up to 13 weeks of EB if the insured unemployment rate meets certain criteria, with optional additional weeks available based on different unemployment rate thresholds. P.L. 111-312, as amended by P.L. 112-240, made technical changes to triggers in the EB program, allowing states to use lookback calculations based on three years of unemployment rate data for their mandatory IUR and optional TUR triggers. The authorization for the temporary EB trigger modifications expired in December 2013. FUTA finances half of the EB payments and 100% of EB administrative costs, while states fund the other half of EB benefit costs through their SUTA. Beginning on February 17, 2009, P.L. 111-5 temporarily changed the federal-state funding arrangement for the EB program, with FUTA financing 100% of EB benefits until December 31, 2013. The sequester order implemented on March 1, 2013, affects some unemployment insurance expenditures, with regular UC, UCX, and UCFE payments not subject to reductions, while EB, EUC08, and administrative funding are impacted. The FY2013 sequestration order required a 5.1% reduction in nonexempt nondefense mandatory expenditures, leading to a 10.7% reduction in EUC08 and EB payments for weeks of unemployment starting on March 31, 2013. States were provided guidance on implementing these reductions, which began the week of March 31, 2013. The sequestration order in FY2014 required a 7.2% reduction in EUC08 benefits for weeks of unemployment starting on October 6, 2013. Some states did not implement the reductions uniformly and used alternative methods. The DOL will assist states individually in implementing the reductions. The DOL will work with states individually to assist in administering the FY2014 sequester of EUC08, with letters sent to each state approving implementation strategies for required savings. The federal share of EB benefits would have been reduced by 7.2% for weeks of unemployment from October 6, 2013, to September 27, 2014, with no active EB program in any state during that period. In FY2015, the sequestration order requires a 7.3% reduction in nondefense mandatory expenditures, including a 7.3% reduction in EB expenditures for weeks of unemployment. Eleven states and the Virgin Islands owed $13.9 billion to federal accounts within the UTF as of October 28, 2014. The ARRA temporarily halted interest charges on state UC loans until December 31, 2010, after which interest payments resumed. Employers in 13 states and the Virgin Islands faced increased net FUTA for calendar year 2013. The President's Budget Proposal for FY2015 aims to address state and federal financing concerns related to unemployment insurance. It includes measures such as extending the suspension of interest accrual and temporarily suspending net FUTA tax increases. The proposal also suggests increasing the FUTA taxable wage base and adjusting the FUTA tax rate over the next few years. The President's Budget Proposal for FY2015 includes measures such as increasing the FUTA taxable wage base to $15,000 in 2017 and providing funding for various UC program measures, including REAs, Bridge to Work programs, and reducing SSDI benefits for individuals receiving unemployment benefits. Additionally, the proposal includes $4 billion in mandatory funding to support partnerships between businesses and education. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 allocated $4 billion in funding to train 1 million long-term unemployed workers for new jobs. Various proposals in the 113th Congress aim to extend expired federal provisions of UI law, including EUC08 authorization, federal financing of EB, and funds for Reemployment Services. The Senate passed H.R. 3979, the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act of 2014, extending federal UI provisions including EUC08 authorization, EB provisions, and railroad UI provisions for five months. Funding for RES/REAs was reauthorized with changes to requirements. The proposed UI extension bills, including H.R. 4415, H.R. 4550, and others, aim to extend federal UI provisions retroactively for an additional year or two. Some bills, like H.R. 2821, suggest extending the expired provisions through December 2015. Several bills propose retroactive extensions of federal UI provisions for varying durations, ranging from 3 to 10.5 months. Most bills aim to maintain the EUC08 tier structure, while one bill suggests only extending tier I with a maximum duration of 14 weeks. The proposed bills aim to reauthorize all four tiers of EUC08, with the first two tiers reduced to 6 weeks each for a total maximum duration of up to 31 weeks. H.R. 4431 suggests a gradual reduction in weekly benefit amounts for reauthorized EUC08 benefits. Various bills also address temporary EB and railroad UI provisions, funding for RES/REAs, and exceptions to the nonreduction rule for EUC08. Some bills include offset provisions for concurrent receipt of UI and SSDI payments. Several bills propose changes related to the concurrent receipt of UI and Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) payments, including prohibiting individuals with over $1 million in AGI from receiving federal unemployment compensation. Some bills also suggest amendments to REAs, such as assessing the reason for unemployment and allowing states to require EUC08 claimants to participate in job training programs or community service. Additionally, changes to work search and suitable work requirements are proposed to align with EB requirements.

Some bills also suggest amendments to REAs, such as assessing the reason for unemployment and allowing states to require EUC08 claimants to participate in job training programs or community service. Additionally, changes to work search and suitable work requirements are proposed to align with EB requirements. S. 2148, S. 2149, S. 2532, and H.R. 4970 would change the timing of REAs to require availability when entering tier I of EUC08 and again when entering tier III. These proposals include decreases in expenditures or increases in revenues to offset the cost of UI extensions. H.R. 4970, S.Amdt. 2714, S. 2097, S. 2148, S. 2149, and S. 2532 would extend changes made by MAP-21 to discount rates used by DB pension plans for four additional years, allowing sponsors to contribute less and increase taxable income. S. 2077 proposes cost offsets.

H.R. 4970, S.Amdt. 2714, S. 2097, S. 2148, S. 2149, and S. 2532 would extend changes made by MAP-21 to discount rates used by DB pension plans for four additional years, allowing sponsors to contribute less and increase taxable income. S. 2077 proposes cost offsets. S. 2077 proposes to offset the cost of its provisions with previously enacted Farm bill savings found in P.L. 113-79. H.R. 4970, S. 2097, S. 2148, S. 2149, and S. 2532 include an extension of certain customs user fees. S. 2148 and S. 2149 would allow the sponsors of single-employer and multiemployer DB pension plans to prepay the annual flat-rate, per participant premium paid to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). On March 19, 2014, the National Association of State Workforce Agencies (NASWA), an organization of state UI administrators and other employment services stakeholders, provided a letter and fact sheet to Senate Majority Leader Reid and Senate Minority Leader McConnell outlining state administrative concerns related to a potential extension of UI. In particular, these March 2014 NASWA documents responded to the UI provisions in S. 2148. NASWA highlighted a number of key administrative challenges. NASWA highlighted key administrative challenges for states raised by S. 2148, including difficulties with older state UI computer systems, administering work search requirements retroactively, means-testing UI benefits, and lack of clarity on using federal funds to administer EUC08 claims. Some states may choose to terminate their EUC08 agreements with DOL due to these challenges. Some states may consider terminating their EUC08 agreements with DOL due to administrative challenges raised by S. 2148. U.S. Labor Secretary Thomas Perez believes these concerns can be addressed and overcome, citing past bipartisan efforts to expand the EUC program. The Department of Labor has worked with states to implement twelve different expansions to the EUC program, including technical amendments to address concerns. Secretary Perez suggested a \"technical amendment without changing the substance of the agreement\" to clarify legislation prohibiting the use of federal funds for EUC08 claims. Additionally, various bills incorporate similar technical corrections. Title III of H.R. 2821 includes provisions for a \"Reemployment NOW\" program with $4 billion in federal funds distributed to states based on unemployment rates. States must submit plans to the Department of Labor to access funds for reemploying eligible individuals. The \"Reemployment NOW\" program under Title III of H.R. 2821 provides $4 billion in federal funds to states for reemploying eligible individuals through various programs like the \"Bridge to Work\" program, wage insurance, enhanced reemployment services, and start-up of Self-Employment Assistance state programs. H.R. 2821 authorizes states to use funds for administrative costs related to SEA agreements and innovative programs to facilitate reemployment of EUC08 claimants. It provides temporary federal financing for STC benefits in states with existing programs and allows states without programs to enter agreements with DOL for federal reimbursement. H.R. 2821 allows states to receive 100% federal financing for Short-Time Compensation (STC) programs. It also provides grants of up to $700 million to eligible states, with funds allocated for program implementation, administration, and promotion. Additionally, the bill includes provisions for a targeted group under the Work Opportunity Tax Credit for long-term unemployed individuals. The Unemployment Restoration Act, H.R. 2177, offers tax credits for hiring long-term unemployed individuals. Employers can claim a credit of 40% for those employed over 400 hours and 25% for those employed 120-399 hours. H.R. 3205 and other acts propose similar provisions for UI integrity. The proposals in H.R. 3205, S. 1870, and S. 1876 aim to recover state overpayments through reduced federal tax refunds after two years. H.R. 2826 requires states to use PUPS data to verify individuals' incarceration status for UC benefits eligibility. H.R. 3447 clarifies back pay for furloughed federal employees. The Layoff Prevention Extension Act of 2014 would extend STC provisions from the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012. It includes extending federal cost sharing provisions and grants for STC programs. H.R. 1502 aims to eliminate double dipping of Social Security Disability Insurance and unemployment benefits. The GROWTH Act, Reducing Overlapping Payments Act, and other proposed bills aim to disqualify individuals from receiving SSDI benefits if they are entitled to UC, EB, EUC08, or TAA. These bills also propose offsetting UI payments with SSDI payments. Several proposals in the 113th Congress aim to prevent individuals reporting over $1 million in AGI from receiving federal unemployment compensation, including EB and EUC08 payments. Additionally, there are provisions in other proposals to prohibit high-income individuals from receiving EUC08 payments. H.R. 51 and Section 201 of H.R. 4550 would establish an employment assistance voucher program using UC funds. The proposed legislation, H.R. 3864 and S. 2870, would expand state UC demonstration projects by allowing 10 states per year to conduct approved projects. Eligible individuals who have been unemployed for at least six months could receive employment assistance vouchers and be hired by participating employers, with the state providing a subsidy for their wages. The proposed legislation, H.R. 3864 and S. 2870, aims to expand state UC demonstration projects by allowing 10 states per year to conduct approved projects. It includes extending the time period for state demonstration projects until December 31, 2017, revising project requirements, transferring project impact evaluation responsibility to DOL, and requiring a specific termination procedure. H.R. 1530, the Opportunity KNOCKs Act, would require states to allow UC beneficiaries to participate in WIA job training programs. S. 2097, S. 2148, S. 2149, H.R. 3979, and H.R. 1172 propose changes to EUC08 claimants' eligibility for job training programs and benefits. These bills aim to assess the cause of continued unemployment, provide job training options, and adjust the timing of REAs for EUC08 claimants. The bill proposes denying benefits to individuals discharged for alcohol/drug use, in possession of controlled substances at work, refusing employer drug testing, or testing positive on a drug test. States would need to amend their UC laws. H.R. 1277 requires drug testing for all UC claimants, with retesting after 30 days for those testing positive. H.R. 3454 and H.R. 4310 propose drug testing requirements for UC applicants. H.R. 3454 mandates screening for substance abuse and testing for high-risk individuals. H.R. 4310 sets a deadline for DOL to issue final rules on drug testing provisions for UI claimants. The bill proposed in S. 803, the Superstorm Sandy Unemployment Relief Act of 2013, aimed to extend Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA) by 13 weeks for those affected by Hurricane Sandy. It also included provisions to reimburse states for 100% of the unemployment compensation paid to individuals in affected areas. Several proposals aim to target the rehiring of workers who have exhausted unemployment benefits. H.R. 3453 and H.R. 3726 would extend priority treatment for hiring veterans and long-term unemployed workers, while H.R. 3781 would provide incentives for hiring all workers who have exhausted regular unemployment benefits. H.R. 3781, the American Unemployed Worker Investment Act of 2013, extends priority to workers receiving state or federal unemployment benefits for two years after the bill's enactment. H.R. 4033, the American Worker Mobility Act of 2014, offers up to $10,000 in relocation expenses for UC exhaustees to start a new job or move to areas with lower unemployment rates. H.R. 1229, the Security and Financial Empowerment Act, allows individuals who quit due to domestic or sexual violence to be eligible for UC benefits."
