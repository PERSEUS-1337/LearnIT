The Export-Import Bank of the United States administers the Working Capital Loan Guarantee Program to facilitate finance for businesses, especially small businesses with exporting potential, by providing repayment guarantees to lenders on working capital loans secured by export-related accounts receivable and inventory. The Export-Import Bank of the United States offers various programs to support exporters, including guarantees for loans made by private lenders, direct working capital loans for small businesses, and export credit insurance to extend credit terms to foreign customers and insure against nonpayment by international buyers. The Export-Import Bank of the United States provides export loan programs with a 95-percent guarantee for commercial and political losses, arranging financing through a lender using insured receivables as collateral. Small businesses find these programs less appealing due to lending restrictions on loans, such as the requirement for at least 50-percent U.S. content in the export product and the inability to finance sales to foreign military buyers. The Small Business Administration administers the Export Working Capital Program and the International Trade Loan Program, providing short-term working capital and financing up to $5,000,000 with a 90-percent guarantee for small businesses contracting with foreign military buyers. Letters of credit cannot be used in determining the borrowing base. The Small Business Administration offers financing up to $5,000,000 with a 90-percent guarantee for fixed assets or to improve competitive position affected by import competition. The Export Express Program provides streamlined financing up to $500,000 for exporters backed by the Small Business Administration. Lenders make their own credit decisions and loan documentation, while the SBA determines eligibility and provides the loan. The Small Business Administration offers financing with a 90% guarantee for loans up to $350,000 and a 75% guarantee for loans between $350,000 and $500,000. Congress acknowledges the flexibility and quick turnaround times of the export loan programs. The Small Business Administration provides assistance in structuring loan deals, negotiating payment terms, and meeting the financial needs of small businesses. Additionally, they have Regional Export Finance Managers co-located in more locations compared to the Export-Import Bank of the United States. The Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 increased the maximum loan size for export loan programs administered by the Small Business Administration to $5,000,000, covering approximately 80% of small business export loans guaranteed by taxpayers through the Export-Import Bank of the United States. The cities included in the program are Arlington, Boston, Charlotte, Cleveland, Denver, Los Angeles, New Orleans, Philadelphia, Portland, and St. Louis. The Export-Import Bank of the United States and Small Business Administration's export loan programs are duplicative and compete for small business clients. The Export Credit Insurance Program of the Export-Import Bank is crucial for export loan programs. The Small Business Administration will serve small business clients of the Export-Import Bank of the United States if its loan programs lapse. Additionally, a similar Export Credit Insurance Program will be created within the Small Business Administration to support small business exporters. The Export Credit Insurance Program will be established within the Small Business Administration to support small business exporters. The Small Business Act is amended to establish an Export Credit Insurance Program under the Small Business Administration to provide insurance for small business exports, including protection against nonpayment by international buyers. Regulations for the program must be promulgated within 90 days of enactment, similar to the Export Credit Insurance Program of the Export-Import Bank of the United States. The Small Business Act is amended to establish an Export Credit Insurance Program under the Small Business Administration to provide insurance for small business exports, including protection against nonpayment by international buyers. Regulations for the program must be promulgated within 90 days of enactment."
