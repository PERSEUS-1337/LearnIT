The Forest Ecosystem Stewardship Demonstration Act of 1995 acknowledges the adverse effects on forest ecosystems due to various factors like fuel loads, tree density, disease, and habitat loss. It emphasizes the need for a new contracting process to improve forest conditions through ecosystem management, which integrates ecological, economic, and social aspects. The Forest Ecosystem Stewardship Demonstration Act of 1995 aims to improve and restore forest health through ecosystem management. It also focuses on providing employment opportunities and economic viability for rural communities near National Forest System units. The Forest Ecosystem Stewardship Demonstration Act of 1995 aims to improve and restore forest health through ecosystem management by providing flexibility in procurement and funding practices to enter into stewardship contracts to achieve management objectives prescribed in various provisions of law. The Forest Ecosystem Stewardship Demonstration Act of 1995 allows for stewardship contracts to improve forest health through ecosystem management. The Act defines terms like \"Account\" and \"Forest Stewardship Council\" to facilitate its implementation. The Forest Ecosystem Stewardship Demonstration Act of 1995 allows for stewardship contracts to prioritize projects, set goals, evaluate contractor performance, recommend progress payments, and improve the stewardship contract process. Performance specification contracts involve the entity setting project parameters and the contractor determining the method. Resource activities include area access, site preparation, replanting, habitat restoration, and silvicultural practices. The curr_chunk discusses various activities such as wildlife habitat restoration, silvicultural treatments, watershed improvement, fuel treatments, and road closure. It defines terms like \"resource manager\" and \"roadside sale\" related to forest management. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the department. A stewardship contract is a contract for carrying out resource activities for the improvement and restoration of forest ecosystems of units of the National Forest System. It aims to enhance economic sustainability and the viability of rural and regional communities. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Agriculture. A contract for forest ecosystem improvement can use various specification formats such as design, performance, or statement of work. SEC. 3. USE OF STEWARDSHIP CONTRACTS. The Secretary shall establish a demonstration program for forest managers to use stewardship contracts to restore forest ecosystems and support rural communities. Forests may use stewardship contracts for ecosystem management projects within available financial resources. Stewardship contracts involve payment based on treated acres for specific resource conditions, not for road construction, limited timber removal, roadside timber sales, and competitive awards to small contractors. Stewardship contracts for small contractors involve stewardship skill and experience qualifications approved by the Forest Service and local Forest Stewardship Council. Contractors are monitored by both entities and receive progress payments based on successful completion of activities per acre. The Secretary ensures flexibility for resource managers to test different approaches in solving unresolved questions. Various approaches to solving questions left unresolved in previous stewardship contracts include the need for bonding of contractors, preferred methods of marketing forest products, standards for evaluating work quality, desirability of multi-year contracts, and the use of design specifications. The curr_chunk discusses the merits of using different specifications in stewardship contracts, the impact of community involvement, the benefits and challenges of restricting contracts to small contractors, the effects on local economy and community viability, revenue discrepancies from timber sales, and utilization levels of forest products from stewardship projects. The curr_chunk focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of stewardship contracting in achieving forest ecosystem management plans, analyzing the financial aspects of stewardship contracts, assessing administrative costs or savings, and examining the use of local Forest Stewardship Councils in the contracting process. The curr_chunk discusses the development and use of stewardship contracts by resource managers of the National Forest System in cooperation with local Forest Stewardship Councils. The contracts should clearly outline the desired future condition of resources and evaluation criteria for performance. The length of the contracts must comply with the National Forest Management Act of 1976. The National Forest Management Act of 1976 outlines the selection of areas for stewardship contracts based on improving forest health, soil and water quality, and wildlife habitat. Local Forest Stewardship Councils prioritize and select projects in cooperation with resource managers. The Forest Stewardship Councils, established under the National Forest Management Act of 1976, prioritize and select stewardship projects, set operational goals, evaluate contractor performance, recommend progress payments, and make recommendations for process improvement. Council composition includes at least 51% private sector members to ensure a broad representation of public interests. The councils must ensure an open and continuing process without interference.

Council composition includes at least 51% private sector members to ensure a broad representation of public interests. The councils must assure a continuing and open process without interference. Revenue from stewardship contracts is deposited into a Stewardship Account, with 25% of revenues from roadside sales going to States as required by law. SEC. 4. STEWARDSHIP CONTRACT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES. Receipts from contract-designated timber and forest products will be deposited into the Stewardship Account for payments to States and funding resource activities. The Account is appropriated for the Secretary's use until expended, with excess amounts transferred to the Treasury. Additional revenues for stewardship contracting and ecosystem management will also be deposited in the Account. At least 80 percent of the Account's funds must be used for expenditures. Not less than 80 percent of the Account's funds for resource activities must be used for direct costs. Revenues from sales of contract-designated products will be returned to the national forest for additional stewardship contracts. Any additional revenues from Congress appropriations will be available for forest units with stewardship contracts. The Secretary will include revenues, expenditures, and accomplishments related to stewardship contracts in the annual report to Congress. SEC. 5. RELATION TO OTHER LAWS. Stewardship contracts must comply with existing laws without modification. SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act becomes effective upon passage. SEC. 7. TERMINATION DATE. The Act will end five years after its effective date unless extended by Congress."
