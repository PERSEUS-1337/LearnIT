    "content": "Since 1984, only antidumping (AD) law had been applied to goods from nonmarket or transitional economies. However, with the economic growth of countries like China and Vietnam, there is increasing pressure on the U.S. government to use both antidumping and countervailing duty (CVD) laws more aggressively against unfair imports. These trade remedies are imposed when dumped or subsidized imports cause material injury to domestic industries. The report discusses the application of antidumping and countervailing duty laws to goods from nonmarket economy countries, including recent legal decisions and legislative changes. The curr_chunk discusses antidumping laws and the methodology used by the Department of Commerce (DOC) to determine fair value of products from foreign manufacturers. It explains how DOC compares U.S. prices with normal value in the domestic market or other countries to identify dumping. If dumping is found, DOC can use a \"constructed value\" to calculate it. The Department of Commerce (DOC) uses a \"constructed value\" to calculate the dumping margin, which is the difference between the fair market value of a product and its price in the United States. This is the first step in imposing an antidumping (AD) duty. The final step involves the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) determining if the dumped imports have caused or threaten to cause material injury to a U.S. industry. Nonmarket economies pose challenges in applying this methodology due to their resource allocation methods. The Antidumping Act of 1921 to the Trade Act of 1974 introduced the \"surrogate country\" approach for applying AD law to nonmarket economies, substituting prices from third countries to determine fair market value. This method was later codified by Congress but proved challenging to implement. The Treasury Department adopted the \"factors of production\" approach in 1975 as an alternative to the \"surrogate country\" method for nonmarket economies. Congress further refined antidumping provisions in 1979 and 1988 through the Trade Agreements Act and the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act, respectively. In 1988, Congress enacted reforms to antidumping laws, defining a nonmarket economy country as one that does not operate on market principles. The factors considered include currency convertibility, wage determination, and foreign investments. The OTCA provides the Department of Commerce (DOC) with discretion to determine nonmarket economy status for foreign countries, considering factors like government ownership, control of production, resource allocation, and price decisions. DOC's determinations are not subject to judicial review in antidumping investigations. The preferred method for applying antidumping laws is the \"factors of production\" approach. The Department of Commerce (DOC) retains discretion in applying antidumping laws to nonmarket economies, despite the statutory change favoring the \"factors of production\" approach. DOC determines on a case-by-case basis whether to use standard methodology or a different approach, prioritizing factors like prices paid by the NME manufacturer and prices in surrogate countries. The Department of Commerce (DOC) has the authority to apply antidumping laws to nonmarket economies using various surrogate country approaches. Recently, countervailing duty laws were applied to China after a 23-year abstention, providing another option for combating unfair trade practices from nonmarket economy countries. Countervailing duty (CVD) laws provide relief to domestic industries injured by subsidized imports. The duty is equal to the amount of subsidization. Both the ITC and DOC must determine injury and subsidization for relief. Unlike AD laws, CVD laws were recently applied to nonmarket economies like China. The United States CVD laws historically did not apply to nonmarket economies due to difficulties in measuring subsidies. The first application to nonmarket economies involved carbon steel wire rods from Czechoslovakia and Poland. At the time, the U.S. had two separate CVD statutes. The second CVD statute, Section 701 of the Tariff Act of 1930, was enacted to bring the United States into compliance with the Agreement on the Interpretation and Application of Articles VI, XVI, and XXIII of the General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade (Subsidies Code), negotiated during the Tokyo Round of Multilateral Trade Negotiations. Section 701(b) of the Tariff Act applied CVD law to countries under the Agreement on Subsidies Code, requiring a determination of material injury to US industries. Poland and Czechoslovakia, not signatories to the Subsidies Code, were investigated under Section 303. DOC found that no government entity could be excluded from CVD law, but failed to address a second jurisdictional issue at the final determination stage. DOC failed to address the jurisdictional element of whether government activities in a nonmarket economy confer a 'bounty or grant' within the meaning of section 303. Countervailable subsidies cannot be found in a nonmarket economy, as all costs, prices, and profits are centrally controlled by the state, rendering the concept of subsidization meaningless in such an economy. Subsidy is a market phenomena and has no meaning in a nonmarket economy. The Department of Commerce (DOC) stated that it is difficult to determine if misallocation of resources in a nonmarket economy is due to subsidization or central planning. DOC concluded that the countervailing duty law has not directly addressed the application to nonmarket economy countries. The Department of Commerce (DOC) determined that countervailing duty law does not directly apply to nonmarket economy countries. Congress made amendments to U.S. trade remedy law in 1974 and 1979, addressing trade disruption and unfair competition from nonmarket economy imports. DOC concluded it had broad discretionary authority on countervailable subsidies in nonmarket economy situations. In Continental Steel Corp. v. United States, the U.S. Court of International Trade reviewed DOC's negative subsidy determinations. The USCIT disagreed with DOC's conclusion that subsidies cannot exist in a nonmarket economy, reversing and remanding the case for further investigation. USCIT found DOC's determination to be in conflict with the law and past interpretations, emphasizing that the Tariff Act of 1930 does not differentiate based on a country's economic system. The USCIT disagreed with DOC's adoption of a per se rule that subsidies cannot exist in nonmarket economies, finding it irrational, arbitrary, and contrary to law. The USCIT emphasized that the problem is one of measurement, not meaning, and pointed out that antidumping law applies to nonmarket economies using surrogate values. This decision was made in the case of Georgetown Steel Corp. v. United States. In Georgetown Steel Corp. v. United States, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the USCIT and reinstated DOC's conclusions regarding subsidy margins. The court determined that the terms \"bounty\" and \"grant\" in the Tariff Act of 1930 were not intended to apply to nonmarket economies. Congress did not address this issue in the statute's initial enactment in 1897, and subsequent amendments did not change the provision's scope or meaning. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit discussed recent amendments to CVD laws and Congress's intent to address imports from nonmarket economies under antidumping law, not CVD law. The court afforded substantial deference to the Department of Commerce's decisions on the application of CVD law to nonmarket economies. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld the Department of Commerce's broad discretion in determining subsidies under U.S. CVD law, citing the Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. decision. This led to no countervailing duty investigations of subsidized imports from nonmarket economies until 1991, when a petition regarding ceiling and oscillating fans imported from China was examined. The Department of Commerce examined a petition alleging subsidization of ceiling and oscillating fans imported from China, despite China being considered a nonmarket economy. The DOC used a three-part test to determine if the industry was sufficiently market-oriented for economic data reliability in CVD investigations. The Department of Commerce found that the Chinese ceiling and oscillating fan industry did not qualify as a market-oriented industry, leading to the conclusion that CVD law did not apply. Critics have raised concerns about the ambiguity of the \"significantly all\" factor input prices requirement. Critics argue that the ambiguity of the \"significantly all\" factor input prices requirement in CVD law may lead to arbitrary results, creating uncertainty for nonmarket economy producers. Despite the potential for market-based reforms, nonmarket economies can still be immune from CVD investigations. The Department of Commerce initiated a CVD investigation against China in 2006 for coated free-sheet paper, marking a shift in their approach towards nonmarket economies. The U.S. International Trade Commission made an affirmative preliminary subsidy determination in the CVD investigation with estimated subsidy rates. China sought an injunction to prevent the investigation, arguing jurisdiction and the need for a statute authorizing CVD law against nonmarket economies. The United States responded to these claims. The Court of International Trade declined to issue an injunction in response to China's request, stating that the case was not ripe for adjudication. The court held that China and other plaintiffs could seek judicial review after the Department of Commerce completed its investigation and issued a final determination. The Court of International Trade did not issue an injunction in response to China's request, stating the case was not ripe for adjudication. Commerce may apply countervailing duty law to nonmarket economies like China, as seen in the preliminary findings and a memorandum addressing the Georgetown Steel precedent. This does not change China's formal status as a nonmarket economy. The memorandum and justification focused on whether the rationale used to prevent CVD law from applying to nonmarket economies in 1984 remained true for modern-day China. The memorandum concluded that China's present economy does not contain the same obstacles to determining the existence of subsidies as \"Soviet-style economies\" did. Private industry dominates many sectors, entrepreneurship is flourishing, and foreign trading rights have been given to over 200,000 firms. Foreign trading rights have been given to over 200,000 firms in present-day China, allowing business entities to operate freely and respond to market forces. The role of central planners is significantly reduced. The possibility of determining countervailable subsidies from the PRC Government is feasible, as evidenced by successful CVD petitions. The imposition of countervailing duties (CVDs) on goods from nonmarket economy (NME) countries like China and Vietnam involves using a \"surrogate country\" methodology to determine fair market value. Successful CVD petitions have led to the imposition of CVDs on various merchandise, with parties often seeking both antidumping and countervailing duty orders on imports. Article VI:5 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) prohibits imposing both anti-dumping and countervailing duties on imported products for the same situation. The Department of Commerce (DOC) adjusts the export price by the amount of any countervailing duty to offset an export subsidy. There is no provision in antidumping law for adjusting duties for a domestic subsidy. The Commerce Department explained the difference between domestic and export subsidies, highlighting that imposing both an export-subsidy countervailing duty (CVD) and an anti-dumping (AD) duty without adjusting for the CVD would result in a double remedy, which is prohibited by Article VI:5 of the GATT. This adjustment is meant to protect against unfair trade practices. The Commerce Department distinguishes between domestic and export subsidies in the context of countervailing duties (CVDs). Imposing both a CVD on an export subsidy and an anti-dumping duty without adjusting for the CVD would result in a double remedy, which is prohibited by the GATT. This adjustment aims to prevent unfair trade practices by ensuring that the CVD is added to the initial U.S. price to avoid double remedies. The statute prevents double collection of CVDs by not calculating dumping margins to double-collect CVDs. This may not apply in AD investigations involving NME products where a CVD order is imposed to remedy a domestic subsidy. The distinction was explained in a 2009 court case involving CVDs on Chinese imports. The issue of double counting in antidumping duties on Chinese imports is discussed, where the export price is compared with a subsidy-free normal value. This could result in a double remedy, as seen in court cases and WTO challenges. WTO Members imposing duties on products from non-market economy countries must navigate various agreements. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (GATT 1994) and related agreements govern the imposition of antidumping and countervailing duties by WTO Members on goods. Article VI of GATT 1994 sets limits on these duties, ensuring they do not exceed the margin of dumping or subsidization. It also prohibits the imposition of both types of duties for the same situation. Article VI of GATT 1994 sets limits on antidumping and countervailing duties, requiring material injury to be found before imposition. It does not distinguish between market and nonmarket economy countries, allowing for the use of surrogate country data in certain cases. The WTO Appellate Body allows investigating authorities to disregard domestic prices and costs of non-market economy (NME) countries in determining normal value, and instead use prices from a market economy third country. GATT Article XVI addresses subsidization and imposes notification requirements and obligations on the use of export subsidies by WTO Members. The WTO Agreement on Antidumping governs the application of export subsidies, prohibiting subsidies on primary products and limiting subsidies on other products to prevent unfair trade practices. The WTO Agreement on Antidumping applies GATT Article VI to actions under national antidumping laws. It states that antidumping measures must be conducted in accordance with the Antidumping Agreement. The Agreement also addresses dumping by nonmarket economy countries and incorporates the GATT Article VI interpretative note. Additionally, the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures expands on obligations in GATT Articles VI and XVI. The WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures expands on obligations in GATT Articles VI and XVI, defining subsidies as financial contributions by governments that confer benefits. It prohibits export subsidies and those contingent on using domestic over imported products. The WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures prohibits export subsidies and subsidies contingent on using domestic over imported products. The Agreement allows for challenges to specific industry subsidies that cause adverse effects, known as \"actionable\" subsidies. Members can respond through WTO dispute settlement or imposing countervailing duties on subsidized goods. The Agreement also provides for using cross-border benchmarks in CVD proceedings involving non-market economy countries. The WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures prohibits export subsidies and subsidies contingent on using domestic over imported products. Article 14 of the SCM Agreement addresses how a WTO Member may calculate a subsidy in terms of the benefit to the recipient, using market-based rates and prices. The United States has used benchmarks from foreign market economy countries when a market-based benchmark is not available in a non-market economy country. The WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures prohibits certain types of subsidies provided by governments, including equity capital, loans, loan guarantees, and provision of goods and services. The adequacy of remuneration for these subsidies is determined based on prevailing market conditions. In a specific case in January 2004, the WTO Appellate Body ruled on the issue of subsidies in United States \u2014 Final Countervailing Duty Determination with Respect to Certain Softwood Lumber from Canada. The WTO Appellate Body ruled on the use of benchmarks other than private prices in the determination of subsidies for softwood lumber from Canada. The AB established limitations on the use of such benchmarks, requiring them to be connected with prevailing market conditions and reflect various factors. However, the AB did not suggest specific alternative methods, stating that such reviews should be done on a case-by-case basis. The WTO Appellate Body set limitations on using cross-border benchmarks in subsidy investigations, citing findings in previous cases. In a recent ruling on China's challenge to US countervailing duties, the AB upheld the rejection of in-country private prices for calculating benefits, stating that distorted prices due to government involvement can be rejected under Article 14(d). The WTO Appellate Body emphasized that price distortion must be established on a case-by-case basis in subsidy investigations, rejecting in-country private prices due to government involvement. The WTO Appellate Body upheld the decision in CVD investigations, stating that private prices distorted by government involvement cannot be used as benchmarks. They also ruled on the use of cross-border benchmarks in determining the benefit of a government loan in CVD investigations. The WTO Appellate Body ruled that in CVD investigations, private prices distorted by government involvement cannot be used as benchmarks. They also addressed the use of cross-border benchmarks when determining the benefit of a government loan. The AB stated that investigating authorities can use benchmark interest rates on loans denominated in currencies other than the investigated loan's currency, or use proxies when interest rates are distorted. If a comparable commercial loan is not available, a proxy can be used to determine what would have been paid. The WTO Appellate Body ruled that in CVD investigations, private prices distorted by government involvement cannot be used as benchmarks. They also addressed the use of cross-border benchmarks when determining the benefit of a government loan. Authorities can use proxies for what 'would' have been paid on a comparable commercial loan that 'could' have been obtained on the market, if interest rates are distorted. The AB upheld the panel's decision that the US acted consistently in rejecting domestic interest rates in this case. The WTO Appellate Body ruled that in CVD investigations, private prices distorted by government involvement cannot be used as benchmarks. The AB found that the panel had not adequately determined whether the actual proxy benchmark used by the United States was consistent with Article 14(b) due to insufficient factual record in the WTO case. The WTO Accession Protocols of NME countries support the use of surrogate countries or substitute benchmarks in trade remedy laws. The WTO Accession Protocols of NME countries allow the use of alternative methodologies in trade remedy laws, such as surrogate countries or substitute benchmarks. Article 15 of China's WTO Accession Protocol states that in determining price comparability, the importing Member can use Chinese prices or costs, or a methodology not based on a strict comparison with domestic prices in China if market economy conditions prevail. In trade remedy laws, WTO Accession Protocols of NME countries allow alternative methodologies like surrogate countries or substitute benchmarks. Article 15 of China's WTO Accession Protocol permits the use of Chinese prices or costs for price comparability, or a different methodology if market economy conditions prevail. China's WTO Accession Protocol allows for alternative methodologies in trade remedy laws, such as using Chinese prices or costs for price comparability. Once China is recognized as a market economy by the importing WTO Member, certain provisions will be terminated, with non-market economy provisions expiring after 15 years. The non-market economy provisions no longer apply when prevailing economic conditions change in an industry or sector. The use of cross-border benchmarks in CVD proceedings is acceptable and permissible under WTO obligations, providing flexibility in identifying and measuring subsidy benefits for Chinese imports. While the use of cross-border benchmarks in countervailing duty (CVD) proceedings may not violate WTO obligations, their application to specific industries or products can still be challenged. China's challenge to the U.S. application of CVD law focused on compliance with SCM Agreement guidelines, requesting consultations in 2008 and making claims regarding specific investigations. China filed a complaint in 2009 against U.S. antidumping and CVD investigations, alleging violations of WTO obligations. The complaint included claims about antidumping and CVD investigations involving Chinese goods, citing inconsistencies with various WTO agreements. China specifically challenged the determination of subsidies for state-owned enterprises and the benefits received by trading companies. China challenged the US on alleged benefits received by trading companies from state-owned enterprises in CVD investigations. They argued that the US improperly calculated subsidy benefits and failed to show specificity in certain cases. China challenged the US for improperly rejecting prevailing terms in China for determining subsidy benefits, imposing a \"double remedy\" by levying excessive antidumping and countervailing duties, and failing to make a fair comparison in antidumping investigations. China argued that the United States failed to comply with WTO Antidumping Agreement requirements, imposed excessive antidumping duties, did not grant China MFN treatment, and made procedural errors in antidumping and countervailing duty investigations. China argued that U.S. law is inconsistent with WTO obligations regarding double remedies for goods from China. The WTO panel rejected most of China's claims regarding DOC's determinations in investigations. The WTO panel found that China failed to prove that the United States violated the SCM Agreement by considering state-owned enterprises and banks as \"public bodies.\" China's claims regarding the specificity of DOC's determinations were also mostly rejected, although the panel did find inconsistencies in the U.S.'s determination of regional specificity in one investigation. The WTO panel found that China failed to prove that the United States violated the SCM Agreement by considering state-owned enterprises and banks as \"public bodies.\" The panel also determined that the government provision of land-use rights in one investigation was regionally specific. Regarding U.S. benefit determinations, the panel found inconsistencies in the U.S.'s determination of regional specificity in one investigation and in the OTR investigation. The WTO panel rejected China's double remedy claims, finding that double remedies were not inconsistent with relevant agreements. China also failed to prove procedural violations by the United States. The WTO Appellate Body reversed the panel's findings on the interpretation of \"public body\" and \"double remedies\" in the SCM Agreement, stating that the term refers to entities controlled by the government. This decision overturned the panel's ruling that certain SOEs and SOCBs did not qualify as public bodies. The WTO Appellate Body reversed the panel's findings on the interpretation of \"public body\" in the SCM Agreement, stating that it refers to entities controlled by the government. The AB concluded that DOC's determinations in CVD investigations were inconsistent with the Agreement, but upheld the determination that SOCBs in the OTR investigation constituted public bodies. The AB also upheld findings on specificity and DOC's use of foreign benchmarks for subsidy benefit calculations. The WTO Appellate Body reversed the panel's findings on RMB-denominated SOCB loans, citing inconsistencies with the SCM Agreement. They also found issues with \"double remedies\" and the imposition of antidumping and countervailing duties. The WTO Appellate Body found the United States in violation of multiple provisions of the SCM Agreement, including Article 19.3, Article 10, and Article 32.1, due to inconsistencies in imposing antidumping and countervailing duties without assessing \"double remedies.\" The AB's report was adopted by the WTO Dispute Settlement Body, leading to concerns from the United States and other Members regarding the AB's interpretation of the term \"public body\" and its legal reasoning. The United States disagreed with the WTO Appellate Body's findings on double remedies, arguing that the AB's interpretation of Article 19.3 was not concerned with the concurrent application of antidumping and countervailing duties. The US maintained that Article 19.2 focused on the imposition and collection of countervailing duties, with the phrase \"appropriate amounts\" simply referring to the non-discriminatory imposition of CVDs. The United States criticized the WTO Appellate Body's lack of clarity on determining 'appropriate' amounts of countervailing duties and the burden of proof on importing Members. They raised concerns about the complexity of measuring the effect of subsidies on export prices and the challenges in addressing trade-distorting subsidies by non-market economy Members. The United States intended to comply with a WTO decision regarding subsidies by NME Members. They requested determinations to align with DSB recommendations in antidumping and countervailing duty investigations with China. The United States is actively working on aligning with WTO recommendations on subsidies for NME Members. They have issued questionnaires to Chinese respondents and are analyzing responses for possible countervailing duty investigations. Congress passed a law allowing the imposition of CVDs on NME goods following a court ruling in December 2011. The United States passed a law (P.L. 112-99) in March 2012 authorizing the Department of Commerce to impose countervailing duties on merchandise from nonmarket economy countries to address double counting issues. This law allows Commerce to reduce antidumping duties to avoid a \"double remedy\" when both countervailing and antidumping duties are applied simultaneously. Commerce is currently working on implementing this new legislation. The United States is working to implement a new law allowing the Department of Commerce to impose countervailing duties on merchandise from nonmarket economy countries to address double counting issues. Despite compliance efforts, the US did not fully comply by the deadline in a dispute with China. A procedural agreement was reached with China to facilitate any compliance panel proceedings. If found out of compliance, China could pursue sanctions. China has not yet requested a panel. In a separate case, the US Court of International Trade ruled on countervailing duties on Chinese off-the-road tires. The US Court of International Trade ruled that applying countervailing duties on imports from nonmarket economy countries without adjusting for double counting was unreasonable and inconsistent with US law. The court instructed the Department of Commerce to refrain from imposing countervailing duties on these imports until improved methodologies or new statutory tools are in place. Commerce has the discretion not to impose countervailing duties as long as the nonmarket economy antidumping methodology is used. The US Court of International Trade ruled that applying countervailing duties on imports from nonmarket economy countries without adjusting for double counting was unreasonable and inconsistent with US law. The court instructed the Department of Commerce to refrain from imposing countervailing duties on these imports until improved methodologies or new statutory tools are in place. Commerce must apply methodologies to avoid double counting and ensure fair trade practices. The US Court of International Trade ruled that applying countervailing duties on imports from nonmarket economy countries without adjusting for double counting was unreasonable and inconsistent with US law. The court instructed the Department of Commerce to refrain from imposing countervailing duties on these imports until improved methodologies or new statutory tools are in place. The court found that the DOC's list of offsets in dumping margin calculations was not compliant with the statute, leading to a remand and a prohibition on applying CVD law to certain exporters. The decision was affirmed by the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The CAFC affirmed the lower court ruling that Congress had ratified interpretations that CVD law does not apply to NMEs, prohibiting the Commerce Department from imposing CVDs on certain imports. The department must seek legislative authority to change this. The decision does not affect the authority to impose antidumping duties on NME country goods. The court found that the statute was not ambiguous, Congress had spoken on the issue, and only one statutory interpretation was allowed. The court disagreed with the Commerce Department's reasoning on double remedies and the imposition of countervailing duties on imports from NMEs. The court found that the statute is not clear on imposing countervailing duties on goods from NME countries, interpreting it in line with previous decisions like Georgetown Steel. Congress intended the term \"countervailable subsidy\" to be understood similarly to \"bounty or grant,\" making previous interpretations applicable. The CAFC found that Congress ratified the prevailing interpretation of the countervailing duty statute in 1988 and 1994, requiring the statute to bar countervailing duties in the NME context. This principle of legislative ratification applies when Congress reenacts or amends a statute with awareness of a specific interpretation, as seen in FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. The court found that Congress ratified the interpretation of the countervailing duty statute in 1988 and 1994, which barred countervailing duties in the NME context. Congressional awareness of the interpretation was evident in various legislative actions, including the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984 and the Omnibus and Competitiveness Act of 1988. The court rejected DOC arguments regarding statutory authority to regulate tobacco. The court rejected DOC arguments regarding the application of countervailing duty law to NME countries, including China, based on past practice and legislative history. Congress intended for CVD laws to apply to China only under specific conditions, such as finding that China was no longer an NME country or had a market-oriented industry. The court also addressed the 2010 House-passed legislation on currency undervaluation as evidence of Congress's understanding, despite it not being enacted into law. The court rejected DOC arguments regarding the application of countervailing duty law to NME countries, including China, based on past practice and legislative history. Congress intended for CVD laws to apply to China only under specific conditions. Legislation was introduced and quickly enacted in response to the GPX decision, allowing the Commerce Department to impose CVDs on NME products with existing orders and future investigations. The new statute, designated P.L. 112-99, authorizes the application of countervailing duties (CVDs) to non-market economy (NME) products, addressing double counting of subsidization. It amends antidumping law to provide a mechanism for the Department of Commerce to handle simultaneous AD and CVD investigations. Section 701(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930 directs the imposition of CVDs on imported merchandise if certain criteria are met. The new law, P.L. 112-99, allows for countervailing duties (CVDs) on products from non-market economy (NME) countries if subsidized imports harm domestic industries. It amends Section 701 to cover NME merchandise and provides guidelines for identifying government subsidies. These provisions apply to CVD proceedings initiated by the Commerce Department after November 20, 2006, and related legal actions. The new law, P.L. 112-99, allows for countervailing duties (CVDs) on products from non-market economy (NME) countries if subsidized imports harm domestic industries. It amends U.S. antidumping law to address double counting of domestic subsidization in simultaneous antidumping and CVD orders on the same NME merchandise. The Commerce Department is directed to reduce antidumping duty on NME merchandise if a countervailable domestic subsidy has been provided, shown to reduce import prices, and can be reasonably estimated. The new law, P.L. 112-99, allows for countervailing duties (CVDs) on products from non-market economy (NME) countries if subsidized imports harm domestic industries. It addresses double counting of domestic subsidization in simultaneous antidumping and CVD orders on the same NME merchandise. The Commerce Department is directed to reduce antidumping duty on NME merchandise if a countervailable domestic subsidy has been provided, shown to reduce import prices, and can be reasonably estimated. The duty reduction may not exceed the portion of the CVD rate attributable to the countervailable subsidy. The double counting provision applies to all CVD proceedings initiated on or after March 13, 2012, and all Section 129 dumping determinations issued under the Uruguay Round Agreements Act. The new law, P.L. 112-99, addresses double counting of domestic subsidization in simultaneous antidumping and countervailing duty orders on products from non-market economy countries. It applies to all countervailing duty proceedings initiated on or after March 13, 2012, and Section 129 dumping determinations under the Uruguay Round Agreements Act. The U.S. government petitioned for a rehearing of a case en banc after the introduction of the GPX legislation. The CAFC requested arguments on the effect of P.L. 112-99 on the GPX case. The U.S. government asked for the appellate decision to be vacated and the case to be remanded to the U.S. Court of International Trade. Importers argued against the retroactive effective date of the new CVD authority. The CAFC granted a rehearing and remanded the case to address constitutional issues. The CAFC addressed issues with the new statute's effective dates, ruling that it did not violate separation of powers as the GPX case was still pending on appeal when the legislation was enacted. The court rejected arguments that the legislation was unconstitutional due to creating a special rule for the case and potential double counting of duties. The CAFC addressed issues with the new statute P.L. 112-99, ruling it did not violate separation of powers as the GPX case was pending on appeal. The court rejected arguments that the legislation was unconstitutional due to creating a special rule for the case and potential double counting of duties. On remand, the USCIT upheld the constitutionality of P.L. 112-99, with GPX challenging it on three grounds, including retroactive application violating the Constitution. The USCIT upheld the constitutionality of P.L. 112-99, rejecting GPX's arguments on ex post facto and due process grounds. The court found that trade remedy laws are remedial and not subject to the ex post facto clause, and upheld the retroactive application of the CVD under rational basis scrutiny. The court applied a four-part test from Nachman Corp. v. Pension Ben. Guar. Corp. to assess the rationality of the statute's retroactivity. GPX failed to show a vested property right interfered by P.L. 112-99, as trade duties are calculated based on imprecise laws. The court found that GPX had notice of the uncertainty regarding China's status as a non-market economy (NME) at the time of imports, making it difficult to predict duty rates. The court concluded that entering merchandise meant inevitable litigation. The government's assertion that Congress acted to protect U.S. industry from unfair trade practices and ensure finality of existing orders was accepted. GPX's claim that P.L. 112-99 violated equal protection guarantees by allowing double remedies on NME products was not supported. The court upheld differential treatment for NME products in trade remedy investigations, finding it rationally related to the government's interest in finality. The court also reviewed DOC's methodology for determining CVDs and remanded issues regarding subsidies to a company acquired by GPX. The court remanded the issue of subsidized loans received by a company acquired by GPX."
