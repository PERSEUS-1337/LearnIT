The Secretary of the Treasury will make an agreement with the Free File Alliance to offer free forms-based software for individual taxpayers to electronically file their income tax returns through the IRS website using standard forms and schedules. This service will be in addition to what Free File member companies already offer under the government's agreement with the Alliance. The agreement, signed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue on October 30, 2002, and subsequently amended, has a term of 60 months and can be renewed. The Secretary of the Treasury will work with the Free File Alliance to provide free electronic tax preparation services and will not develop similar products. The Agreement, signed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue on October 30, 2002, includes provisions such as participating companies in the Free File program not being allowed to advertise or charge for products/services, and conducting a public education campaign to raise awareness among taxpayers, especially EITC communities. The Secretary will consult with various entities with expertise in the issue area, including the National Taxpayer Advocate, ETAAC, professional organizations, and Federal, State, and local agencies as needed. The Secretary of the Treasury will provide reports to Congress every 6 months on the implementation and usage of the e-file program. After implementing the e-file program, the Secretary of the Treasury will report to Congress on taxpayer usage, in consultation with the National Taxpayer Advocate and ETAAC. Members of the Free File Alliance must meet federal government standards for business responsibility. The Secretary of the Treasury is prohibited from implementing a return-free tax system without authorization from Congress."
