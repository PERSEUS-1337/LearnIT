    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Medical Device Safety Monitoring Act\" and includes provisions for device pilot projects. The \"Medical Device Safety Monitoring Act\" includes provisions for postmarket pilot projects to assess the safety and effectiveness of cleared or approved devices. The Secretary will initiate pilot projects within one year for voluntary participation by device manufacturers. The \"Medical Device Safety Monitoring Act\" requires postmarket pilot projects for device manufacturers to generate safety and surveillance data. Projects must inform the development of methods for devices not included, and be conducted in coordination with a comprehensive evaluation system. The \"Medical Device Safety Monitoring Act\" mandates the use of electronic health data, prioritizing devices based on safety and effectiveness criteria. The Secretary will establish conditions and processes for authorizing voluntary participation of device manufacturers in a pilot project and facilitating public recommendations for prioritizing devices under the project. The Secretary will establish conditions and processes for authorizing voluntary participation of device manufacturers in a pilot project and facilitating public recommendations for prioritizing devices under the project. Implementation may involve continuing or expanding existing projects, beginning new projects, or entering into agreements with entities that meet specific criteria and security measures. The entity must maintain security measures to protect data confidentiality and privacy. In case of contract termination, they must still comply with confidentiality requirements and return any disclosed data. The entity must have qualifications in research, statistics, epidemiology, or clinical expertise to handle data under this subsection.

The Secretary will report to Congress on pilot projects conducted under the subsection, detailing implementation, participating manufacturers, data sources, and devices involved. The Secretary will report to Congress on pilot projects conducted under the subsection, detailing implementation, participating manufacturers, data sources, devices involved, device categories, number of patients involved, and compliance with record/report requirements. Manufacturer participation in a pilot project will not affect eligibility for quarterly reporting programs. Manufacturer participation may meet certain requirements if the project successfully captures relevant adverse event information and the Secretary establishes procedures. The Secretary has established procedures for disclosing adverse event and safety information collected from pilot projects to the public. Privacy requirements mandate that individual identifiable health information should not be disclosed, and projects must comply with specific laws. The coordination for real-world evidence use in devices must comply with specific conditions and will sunset on October 1, 2022. The Secretary will conduct a review by January 31, 2021, to evaluate evidence collected from pilot projects. The Amendments of 2017 and section 519 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act aim to inform decision-making for various device types and assess the effectiveness and safety surveillance of devices through pilot projects."
