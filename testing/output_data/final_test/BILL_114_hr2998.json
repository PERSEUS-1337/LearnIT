    "content": "The \"Claims Licensing Advancement for Interstate Matters Act\" or the \"CLAIM Act\" allows for state flexibility in multistate adjuster licensing reforms. The \"CLAIM Act\" requires states to enact uniform laws and regulations for licensing independent claims adjusters within a 4-year period from the enactment of the Act. States must establish criteria for the qualifications and training of licensed adjusters to ensure uniformity. The \"CLAIM Act\" mandates states to create uniform licensing laws for independent claims adjusters, including continuing education and ethics course requirements. It prohibits imposing restrictions on nonresident adjusters that limit their activities. The \"CLAIM Act\" requires states to establish reciprocity for independent claims adjusters, allowing nonresident adjusters to receive licenses in other states without additional requirements, as long as they submit a uniform license application. The \"CLAIM Act\" mandates states to offer reciprocity for independent claims adjusters, enabling nonresident adjusters to obtain licenses in other states by submitting a uniform license application, providing proof of a valid license in their home state, and paying any required fees. States must also recognize the continuing education requirements met by adjusters in their home state. The \"CLAIM Act\" requires states to grant reciprocity to nonresident independent claims adjusters, allowing them to work in other states without limitations based on their residence. States must comply with reciprocity requirements within a 4-year period determined by the Department of the Treasury, Office of General Counsel. The Department of the Treasury, Office of General Counsel will annually review states' compliance with reciprocity requirements. Judicial review for any challenges will be under the exclusive jurisdiction of the appropriate United States District Court. The court will review challenges under this section using the standards in section 706 of title 5, United States Code. The Act does not require states without licensing requirements for independent claims adjusters to adopt them, does not limit states from establishing licensing fees, and does not affect the authority of state insurance regulators. It also grants authority for interstate claims adjusting. SEC. 4. AUTHORITY FOR INTERSTATE CLAIMS ADJUSTING. Independent claims adjusters can apply for membership with the National Association of Agents and Brokers for licensure in states not compliant with licensing requirements after a 4-year period. They must pay necessary fees. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS. For the purposes of this Act, the term \"home state\" refers to the state where an independent claims adjuster is licensed and maintains their principal place of residence or business. If the adjuster's home state does not issue licenses for the line of authority sought, the term can also apply to any other state where the adjuster is licensed. The term \"independent claims adjuster\" refers to an individual who investigates, evaluates, and negotiates property, casualty, liability, disability, or workers' compensation claims on behalf of insurers or self-insurers. This includes company or staff adjusters employed by property casualty insurers. A public adjuster is a person who, for compensation, helps insured individuals determine and settle first-party claims related to property insurance. The term \"State\" refers to various regions within the United States and its territories. The term \"State law\" includes all laws, decisions, rules, regulations, or other State action of any State having the effect of law; a law of the United States applicable only to the District of Columbia is treated as a State law."
