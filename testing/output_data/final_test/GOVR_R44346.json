Congress questioned the rationale for the funding increase and the return on investment for IRS operations. During the 2015 filing season, IRS taxpayer assistance was lacking with over 60% of calls going unanswered and long wait times. Audit rates dropped to their lowest level since FY2005, and IRS enforcement staff decreased by 18% from FY2010 to FY2014. Despite increased workload, the IRS had to implement new responsibilities like the ACA and FATCA, while dealing with a 700% increase in identity theft cases from FY2010 to FY2013. In 2015, concerns were raised about the IRS's declining resources affecting taxpayer services, new systems implementation, tax evasion, identity theft, cyberattacks, and taxpayer confidence. Critics argued for the IRS to demonstrate effective resource use before budget increases. The IRS faced concerns in 2015 about declining resources impacting taxpayer services, tax evasion, and cyberattacks. Critics called for efficient resource use before budget increases to achieve strategic goals and reduce the federal tax gap. Congress should consider implications of budget proposals on IRS efficiency and effectiveness. The BCA of 2011 reinstated limits on discretionary budget authority from FY2012 to FY2021. Adjustments to spending caps can be made for specific reasons like emergencies, Overseas Contingency Operations, health care fraud, and disaster relief. Additional appropriations are allowed for program integrity initiatives. The Obama Administration requested additional funding for IRS enforcement activities and operations support in FY2016 through a program integrity cap adjustment to reduce improper benefit payments and collect unpaid taxes. This adjustment aimed to ensure the funding does not supplant other federal spending on these activities. The BCA has been amended to adjust discretionary spending limits for the IRS from FY2016 to FY2025. The adjustments would total $18.716 billion in budget authority and $18.570 billion in outlays over the period. An IRS estimate suggests that these adjustments could lead to $59.735 billion in added revenue from FY2016 to FY2025, with $432 million in added tax revenue in FY2016 alone. This estimate assumes that every additional dollar in enforcement spending could result in $6 in additional revenue, mainly from collecting delinquent taxes. Congress has previously enacted similar proposals for IRS enforcement funding in FY2006, FY2009, and FY2010. Congress may want to consider funding IRS's enforcement activities through program integrity cap adjustments to reduce the federal tax gap and increase tax compliance. Current budget scorekeeping rules do not count budgetary savings from additional appropriations as offsets to spending, following guidelines from the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. The guidelines for budget scorekeeping cannot be changed without unanimous consent from all budget scorekeepers. This affects the enforcement activities of the IRS, where additional revenue raised cannot be used to finance tax cuts or spending increases. Proposed changes in IRS funding impact the federal budget deficit accordingly. The limitation on changing budget scorekeeping guidelines affects IRS enforcement activities, with proposed funding changes not impacting the federal budget deficit. This limitation also applies to other compliance activities like preventing improper Medicare payments or federal student loan claims. Some believe this limitation prevents agencies from reallocating resources to justify larger budgets. Legislative proposals altering tax laws may reflect indirect and dynamic revenue effects. H.Res. 5 requires CBO and JCT to consider macroeconomic effects in cost estimates for major legislation. The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) includes the macroeconomic effects of major legislation in cost estimates, but does not consider the indirect revenue effects of changes in IRS funding. This practice may bias Congress to appropriate less for IRS collection activities. Congress should evaluate the overall impact of IRS administration on the federal budget when determining future budgets."
