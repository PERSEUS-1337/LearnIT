    "content": "Disabled individuals and those 65 or older are entitled to benefits from the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program under Title XVI of the Social Security Act. SSI benefits are paid from the general revenue of the United States, with participants receiving a basic monthly federal benefit. Participants may also receive Medicaid coverage in most states. The average monthly cash benefit for SSI beneficiaries was $499.40 in June 2011, with a total of nearly $4.3 billion paid out in federally administered SSI benefits to over 8 million people. The countable resource limit for SSI eligibility is $2,000 for individuals and $3,000 for couples, set by law since 1989. Various types of resource exclusions are provided by the Social Security Act and federal regulations to allow individuals or couples to own certain assets without them being counted against the resource limit. The countable resource limit for SSI eligibility is $2,000 for individuals and $3,000 for couples. Certain federal benefit programs do not count benefits as resources for SSI eligibility. Money set aside for burial expenses and burial plots are excluded from the resource limit. The burial expense exclusion for SSI eligibility may be reduced by the face value of life insurance policies or money in an irrevocable trust. Trust corpus is considered a resource unless payments cannot be made for the individual's benefit.

Trust corpus is considered a resource unless payments cannot be made for the individual's benefit. A Plan for Achieving Self-Support (PASS) is an individual employment plan designed by an SSI beneficiary with assistance from vocational rehabilitation agencies or disability service organizations. A Plan for Achieving Self-Support (PASS) is a written plan approved by the SSA's PASS Cadre, outlining specific employment goals, timeline, needed goods/services, and resources that are not counted against SSI limits. Resources can include money for training or assistive technology devices. Individual Development Accounts (IDAs) are matched savings accounts for low-income families to save for education, home purchase, or business creation. Funds can be matched by the state's TANF block grant. Nonprofit organizations and governments can compete for grants to fund IDAs for low-income households. Individual Development Accounts (IDAs) funded through grants are known as Demonstration Project IDAs. Money saved in these IDAs, including state contributions and interest earned, is not counted towards SSI eligibility. There are limits on contributions to IDAs, and when a child SSI beneficiary is owed back benefits, the money must be placed in a dedicated account in the child's name. This money cannot be invested in securities and belongs to the child. The representative payee can use money from a dedicated account for the child's medical care, education, personal needs assistance, special equipment, housing modifications, or therapy based on the child's disability. Money in a dedicated account cannot be used for daily expenses, food, clothing, or shelter. The payee must keep records of deposits and expenditures and is liable for any misuse. Money in a dedicated account is not counted as a resource for determining SSI eligibility."
