    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Multidistrict Litigation Restoration Act of 2005\" and its purpose is outlined in Section 2. The Multidistrict Litigation Restoration Act of 2005 established the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation to centralize civil actions with common questions of fact from multiple federal districts. These actions often involve mass torts with plaintiffs from various states and cover critical national issues like information technology and intellectual property. The Multidistrict Litigation Restoration Act of 2005 created the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation to consolidate cases with common facts from different federal districts. The panel assigns cases to a United States district court for pretrial matters and then remands them back to the original district. For three decades, the transferee court used a general venue statute to transfer cases for the convenience of parties and witnesses. In 1998, the US Supreme Court ruled that the Judicial Panel must remand all civil actions back to their original districts. This limitation hampers the Panel and transferee judges in achieving the goals of promoting just and efficient multidistrict litigation. The Judicial Panel has rulemaking authority for multidistrict litigation, ensuring all related civil actions are centralized in one district court. Congress has granted the Panel rulemaking authority within legal boundaries, including in cases involving punitive damages. The purpose of this Act is to improve the litigation system by allowing a Federal judge to retain jurisdiction over civil actions transferred under section 1407 of title 28, United States Code, for trial to determine liability and compensatory and punitive damages in compliance with due process requirements. SEC. 3. MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION. Section 1407 of title 28, United States Code, allows actions to be transferred for trial purposes to another district in the interest of justice and convenience. Actions transferred must be remanded for compensatory damages determination unless the trial district also has jurisdiction. The court may transfer the action for trial to another district for convenience and justice, but compensatory damages determination should be retained in the original district if it has jurisdiction. Technical amendment to the Multiparty, Multiform Trial Jurisdiction Act of 2002. Section 1407 of title 28, United States Code, is amended to allow the transferee district court to retain actions transferred under this section for determining liability and punitive damages based on section 1369. Actions retained for liability determination may be remanded for damages determination if deemed necessary for convenience and justice. Remands are not effective until certain conditions are met. The transferee court can retain actions for liability and punitive damages determination. Remands for damages are not effective until certain conditions are met, and appeals can be made during a 60-day period. Once the remand is effective, liability and choice of law determinations are final and not subject to further review. Appeals can also be made for punitive damages determination during the 60-day period. The transferee court has the authority to transfer or dismiss an action based on inconvenient forum. Appeals for remand decisions on damages, excluding punitive damages, are not reviewable. The effective date of the amendments in this Act applies to pending or new civil actions. A technical amendment is retroactively effective as if enacted in a specific section of another Act."
