    "content": "Congress has been divided over the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) since its enactment in 2010. Lawmakers have debated repealing, defunding, or amending the law. The House, under Republican control, passed numerous bills related to the ACA, including ones to repeal the entire law. The Senate, under Democratic control, had less debate on ACA legislation. In the 114th Congress, Republicans used budget reconciliation to try and repeal parts of the ACA, which allows expedited procedures for legislation related to spending, revenue, and debt limits. This process appealed to opponents of the law. In the 114th Congress, Republicans used budget reconciliation to repeal parts of the ACA, appealing to opponents of the law. The House passed a reconciliation bill (H.R. 3762) containing provisions to dismantle the ACA. The Senate approved the bill on December 3, 2015, with its own more extensive ACA repeal provisions. The House approved the Senate-passed bill on January 6, 2016, and President Obama vetoed H.R. 3762 on January 8, 2016. The House failed to override the veto on February 2, 2016. The report presents ACA changes signed into law during the 112th, 113th, and 114th Congresses, along with other ACA bills passed by the House. Table 3 summarizes ACA provisions in the reconciliation bill vetoed by President Obama. Lawmakers have used the annual appropriations process to eliminate funding for ACA implementation and address concerns with the law. The ACA made significant changes to U.S. healthcare to increase access to affordable care for the uninsured and underinsured. It included provisions for health insurers to comply with federal standards. The ACA established private health insurance exchanges for individuals and small employers to compare and enroll in qualified health plans. Financial assistance in the form of refundable tax credits is available for those with incomes between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level to help pay insurance premiums. Tax credits are available upon enrollment for eligible individuals and families to receive immediate subsidies. Cost-sharing subsidies are also available to reduce out-of-pocket costs for health services. Small employers with up to 25 full-time equivalent employees can use exchanges to purchase insurance and may qualify for a tax credit. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2015 that premium tax credits are available to all qualified individuals regardless of the exchange administrator. The ACA's \"individual mandate\" requires compliance. The ACA includes an \"individual mandate\" for most U.S. citizens and legal residents to obtain coverage, with penalties for remaining uninsured. There is also an \"employer mandate\" for companies with 50 or more employees to offer affordable health coverage. Non-compliance may result in a tax penalty if employees purchase coverage through an exchange with a subsidy. The purpose is to encourage participation in the insurance market and maintain affordable coverage for employees. The ACA includes provisions for private insurance and Medicaid expansion. The Supreme Court made Medicaid expansion optional for states. The law also addresses healthcare access, costs, and quality through various programs and provisions. The ACA includes provisions for private insurance and Medicaid expansion, affecting federal spending on exchange subsidies and Medicaid expansion. Implementation of the ACA impacts both mandatory and discretionary spending, with mandatory spending controlled through authorizing laws and discretionary spending funded through annual appropriations. Federal spending on ACA implementation can be categorized into mandatory and discretionary spending. Federal spending on ACA implementation is divided into three categories: mandatory spending on expanding insurance coverage, mandatory spending on other programs, and discretionary spending. This includes exchange subsidies, Medicaid expansion costs, and tax credits for small employers. The Congressional Budget Office projected that this spending would be offset by revenues from new taxes and fees, as well as savings from adjustments to Medicare provider payments. The ACA authorized new Medicare and Medicaid spending, including phasing out the Medicare prescription drug benefit \"donut hole\" and increasing payments for primary care services. It also provided funding for grant programs and health insurance exchanges, as well as establishing the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation to test innovative healthcare payment and services. The ACA created special funds like the Community Health Center Fund, Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund, Prevention and Public Health Fund, and Health Insurance Reform Implementation Fund to support various healthcare programs and activities. The Health Insurance Reform Implementation Fund (HIRIF), funded with $1 billion from the ACA, covered initial administrative costs. The ACA impacted discretionary spending by creating new grant programs with authorization but limited funding. Agencies like CMS and IRS incurred significant costs enforcing the law, requesting increased funding in past budget submissions. Since FY2013, CMS and IRS have not received additional discretionary funds for ACA implementation, relying on fund transfers and ACA mandatory funds. Table 1 outlines legislation amending the ACA since its enactment in 2010, detailing changes in reverse chronological order. During the 111th Congress, clarifications and technical adjustments to the ACA were made. Subsequent Congresses passed bipartisan amendments, including repealing the CLASS Act and IRS Form 1099 provision, and reducing PPHF appropriations by $9.75 billion over FY2013-FY2024. The PPHF annual appropriations were reduced by $9.75 billion over FY2013-FY2024. CRS decided to include only provisions that made changes to new programs authorized by the ACA, excluding provisions for existing programs. Table 2 summarizes the ACA provisions in authorizing. Table 2 summarizes the ACA provisions in authorizing legislation that passed the House in the 112th, 113th, and 114th Congresses (2011-2016) but saw little further legislative action. The House-passed bills included provisions to repeal, restrict, or replace specific ACA provisions, eliminate appropriations, and block implementation of the ACA. Republican leaders made efforts to repeal or amend the ACA through legislative procedures, including using the reconciliation process to pass legislation that would eliminate core provisions of the ACA. H.R. 3762, the Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act of 2015, was vetoed by President Obama on January 8, 2016. The House passed H.R. 3762 on October 23, 2015, containing provisions to repeal ACA mandates, taxes, and defund the PPHF. CBO estimated a $129 billion deficit reduction over FY2016-FY2025. The Senate substituted broader ACA provisions. The Senate passed H.R. 3762 on December 3, 2015, and the House approved it on January 6, 2016. The President vetoed the bill on January 8, 2016, and the House failed to override the veto on February 2, 2016. The bill aimed to repeal key ACA provisions such as premium tax credits, penalties for mandates, Medicaid expansion funding, and various taxes and fees. CBO and JCT estimated that the bill's revenue loss would be offset by eliminating subsidies and Medicaid expansion spending. The reconciliation bill aimed to reduce the budget deficit by $474 billion over FY2016-FY2025 by eliminating subsidies and Medicaid expansion. Reconciliation bills in the Senate can pass with a simple majority and are not subject to filibuster, but amendments must be germane to the bill. The Byrd rule allows Senators to block extraneous provisions in a reconciliation bill. The Byrd rule in the Senate allows Senators to block extraneous provisions in a reconciliation bill if they do not impact outlays or revenues significantly. Senators can raise a point of order against such provisions, and if sustained, the extraneous material is deleted. Waiving the Byrd rule requires 60 votes. The Budget Act requires 60 votes to waive the Byrd rule or override the parliamentarian's ruling on a point of order. The Senate parliamentarian ruled that the provisions to repeal the individual and employer mandates in H.R. 3762 were extraneous. Senate Republicans modified the provisions to avoid violating the Byrd Rule, keeping the mandates but eliminating the penalties for noncompliance. H.R. 3762 repealed most of the ACA's taxes and fees, with provisions potentially challenged under the Byrd rule for reducing revenues. CBO and JCT projected that while the bill's spending reductions offset revenue losses in the short term, deficits could increase beyond 2025 due to rapid revenue loss growth, especially from repealing the Cadillac tax. The House approved a resolution authorizing a lawsuit against the President for actions related to the ACA. The lawsuit claimed the President exceeded his duties by delaying the employer mandate and that cost-sharing subsidies were unconstitutional. The House approved a resolution authorizing a lawsuit against the President for actions related to the ACA. The lawsuit claimed the President exceeded his duties by delaying the employer mandate and that cost-sharing subsidies were unconstitutional. The Administration challenged the lawsuit, arguing that the House had no legal standing to sue. The judge ruled that the House did have standing to pursue the claim that the Administration was violating the Constitution by paying cost-sharing subsidies without an appropriation. The judge issued a merits decision, holding that Congress had not appropriated funds for the payment of cost-sharing subsidies."
