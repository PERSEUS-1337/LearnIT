    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"State-Owned Entity Transparency and Accountability Reform Act of 2016\". Congress acknowledges that foreign states are generally immune from US court jurisdiction, except for the \"commercial activity\" exception. The Supreme Court noted the trend of governments creating separate legal entities for various tasks. The Supreme Court noted that state instrumentalities are established as separate entities with powers to hold property and operate as distinct economic enterprises. These entities enjoy flexibility and independence from political control, prompting governments to use them for large-scale investments. Courts presume government instrumentalities as independent entities under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, but will not uphold this if the entity is extensively controlled by its owner or if doing so would result in fraud or injustice. State instrumentalities have become more complex and opaque over time, making it difficult for companies and consumers in the United States to determine which entity to sue under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. This complexity is exacerbated by globalization, as these entities are increasingly involved in commerce and trade. State instrumentalities, growing larger and more involved in commercial activities with US companies and consumers, assert immunity from lawsuits in US courts. Courts struggle to identify the correct entity under their jurisdiction and reject claims for lack of intra-instrumentality alter ego relationship. Given the complex structure of state instrumentalities and their interactions with US entities, it is crucial to protect potential claims of US individuals. For determining jurisdiction under the \"commercial activity\" exception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976, companies and consumers in the United States should not have to prove an alter ego relationship between members of a state instrumentality to establish subject-matter jurisdiction. The amendment to Section 1603(d) of title 28, United States Code, clarifies that a commercial activity of a foreign state agency or instrumentality can be attributed to a corporate affiliate that owns a majority of shares and is also a foreign state agency or instrumentality."
