    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Restoring the Partnership for County Health Care Costs Act of 2015\". The United States Supreme Court has ruled that governmental entities must provide medical care to individuals involuntarily confined in jails, detention centers, and prisons. However, the Federal Government does not offer health benefits to inmates under Medicare, Medicaid, SSI, or CHIP, except for those released on bond, recognizance, or house arrest. The cost of healthcare in prisons and jails has significantly increased. The cost of providing healthcare for inmates has risen due to various factors such as high incarceration rates, chronic conditions, mental illness, and rising prescription drug costs. This poses a significant financial burden on local governments already struggling with budget deficits and cuts to safety net programs. Jails often have a higher number of mentally ill inmates, as they serve as temporary holding facilities for those awaiting placement in mental health facilities. The rising cost of bail has led to an increase in jail population and healthcare costs for inmates, disproportionately affecting African-Americans and Latinos. Terminating benefits for individuals in county jails awaiting trial violates the presumption of innocence. Eligible individuals charged but not convicted should still receive Federal health benefits. Individuals charged but not convicted should continue to be eligible for Federal health benefits, such as Medicare, Medicaid, SSI, or CHIP, until they may be sentenced to an institution. SSI payments should be held until the inmate is acquitted and released, or until they complete their sentence and are released. SEC. 3. Removal of inmate limitation on benefits under Medicaid, Medicare, SSI, and CHIP. The amendment allows individuals in custody pending charges to receive benefits under Medicaid, Medicare, SSI, and CHIP. The amendment allows individuals in custody pending charges to receive benefits under Medicaid, Medicare, SSI, and CHIP, with specific provisions for withholding or paying supplemental security income benefits. The effective date for these amendments is set to be more than 60 days after the enactment of the Act. The amendment, effective more than 60 days after enactment, applies to items, services, and supplemental security income benefits provided after that date."
