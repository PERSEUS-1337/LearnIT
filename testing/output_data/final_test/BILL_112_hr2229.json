    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Student-to-School Nurse Ratio Improvement Act of 2011\". It includes findings related to school nurse ratios. The Congress finds that school nurses play a crucial role in providing comprehensive health services to children, acting as leaders and coordinators of school health services. National data shows that 45% of public schools have a full-time nurse, while 30% have a part-time nurse. The American Nurses Association highlights the importance of having a registered nurse on school premises for administering necessary medications. The responsibility for administering medications and treatments, as well as monitoring children with health issues, falls on school administrators, educators, and staff. Statistics show that 16% of children in schools have chronic health problems, with a 60% increase in special education students with health impairments. Asthma has increased by 40% in the past 10 years. In the past 10 years, there has been a nearly 50% increase in diabetes incidence. The American Academy of Pediatrics highlights increased social issues for students and the need for preventative services. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report 8.9% of children lacked health insurance in 2008, with schools being the main source of healthcare for many. Communicable diseases result in millions of lost school days, but school nurses positively impact immunization rates. Using a formula-based approach for determining a balanced student-to-school nurse ratio can lead to better student outcomes, as shown by a recent study. Students with health concerns attended to by school nurses were able to return to class 95 percent of the time, compared to only 82 percent for students attended to by nonlicensed staff. SEC. 3. REDUCING STUDENT-TO-SCHOOL NURSE RATIOS. The Secretary of Education may provide demonstration grants to eligible local educational agencies to reduce student-to-school nurse ratios in public elementary and secondary schools. Agencies must submit an application with current ratio information to be considered for a grant. The Secretary of Education may prioritize high-need local educational agencies for grants to improve nursing services in public schools. Recipients may need to provide matching funds, and a report to Congress is required within 24 months of receiving the grant. The Secretary of Education must report to Congress on the results of the grant program for improving nursing services in schools, evaluating its effectiveness in reducing student-to-school nurse ratios and the impact on student health and learning. Definitions for terms like \"elementary school\" and \"local educational agency\" are provided in the section. Eligible local educational agencies are those with specific student-to-school nurse ratios in public schools. The term \"high-need local educational agency\" refers to agencies serving a significant number of children from low-income families. A \"nurse\" is defined as a licensed nurse according to State law. Appropriations are authorized for implementing this section from 2012 to 2016."
