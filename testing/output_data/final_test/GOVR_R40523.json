    "content": "The federal government subsidizes state and local bond issuances through tax-exempt bonds, which offer a lower pre-tax interest rate than corporate bonds. Tax credit bonds provide a tax credit or direct payment proportional to the bond's face value in lieu of the tax exemption. Tax credit bonds (TCBs) are designated for specific purposes such as public school construction, renewable energy projects, and economic development. The appeal of TCBs and municipal bonds depends on issuer and investor characteristics. Many recent TCBs are no longer eligible for new issuances due to expiration of issuing authority or full subscription limits. Legislation has been introduced to extend or modify certain TCB programs. The issuing authority of Tax Credit Bonds (TCBs) has been extended for the 2015 and 2016 tax years, with $400 million of issuing capacity for each year. Legislation is being considered to extend the Build America Bonds (BAB) program indefinitely. The President's FY2017 Budget includes proposals for a new TCB for infrastructure programs. Various types of TCBs are designated for specific purposes, such as public school partnership programs, clean renewable energy projects, and disaster relief efforts. Tax Credit Bonds (TCBs) offer tax credits to reduce federal income tax liability. Different types of TCBs include Qualified Forestry Conservation Bonds (QFCBs), Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds (QECBs), Qualified School Construction Bonds (QSCBs), Build America Bonds (BABs), and Recovery Zone Economic Development Bonds (RZEDBs). Table 1 summarizes the acronyms for these bonds. The credit rate for TCBs varies depending on the bond principal and type. The credit rate for Tax Credit Bonds (TCBs) depends on a national credit rate set by the Treasury. The credit amount is included in the bond holder's gross income and is limited to their current tax liability, making it non-refundable. Unused tax credits can be carried over to the next tax year. The credit rate for investor and issuer credit TCBs is also dependent on a national credit rate set by the Secretary of the Treasury to allow issuers to sell bonds at face value without additional interest expense. The credit rate for Tax Credit Bonds (TCBs) is determined by the Treasury Department based on investment grade ratings. The national credit rate set by Treasury on the issue sale date is the bondholder's annual rate of credit. Different types of TCBs have varying credit rates, with 100% credit TCBs providing a benefit equal to the national credit rate multiplied by the bond principal. For example, a $100,000 bond issued on September 8, 2016, with a 3.92% annual tax credit rate would allow the taxpayer to claim a federal tax credit based on this rate. The tax credit rate for Tax Credit Bonds (TCBs) is determined by the Treasury Department based on investment grade ratings. Different types of TCBs have varying credit rates, with CREBs and QECBs allowing for a credit equal to 70% of the national credit rate. Investor credit TCBs receive an annual tax credit based on the face value of the bond, while issuer direct payment TCBs depend on the interest rate agreed upon between the issuer and investor. The relationship between the final credit rate and negotiated interest rate varies for different types of Tax Credit Bonds (TCBs). BAB and RZEDB credits are 35% and 45% of a market-determined taxable bond interest rate for the specific issuer. The issuer can choose to receive a direct payment from the Treasury equal to the credit amount or allow the investor to claim the credit. If the tax-exempt rate of the bond is greater than 5.20%, then the direct payment is a better option for the issuer. The direct payment option for Tax Credit Bonds (TCBs) is preferred by issuers if the tax-exempt rate of the bond is greater than $5,200. As the marginal tax rate of investors in the municipal bond market increases, traditional tax-exempt bonds become more attractive compared to direct payment TCBs. The direct payment TCB is modeled after the taxable bond option, proposed in the late 1960s. The taxable bond option aims to improve financial market efficiency and reduce inequity in the income tax system by eliminating tax exemption on municipal bonds. It has been well received by issuers and investors, with over $181 billion in Build America Bonds (BABs) issued. However, annual sequesters under the Budget Control Act of 2011 have reduced credit rates for certain issuer direct payment TCBs. The stripping provision for taxable credit bonds (TCBs) allows the separation of the credit from the underlying bond, making TCBs more attractive and marketable to issuers, investors, and financial intermediaries. This provision enables financial intermediaries to sell the principal portion and the stream of credits separately, increasing the competitiveness of TCBs compared to traditional bonds. The maximum term for taxable credit bonds (TCBs) is determined by the prevailing interest rate for municipal debt with a maturity of over 10 years. TCBs issued on September 8, 2016, had a maximum term of 45 years, while Midwest Disaster Bonds (MWDBs) had a maximum term of two years. The Treasury publishes the credit rate and term daily. Some TCBs are required to follow labor standards under the Davis-Bacon Act of 1931, which mandates contractors to pay workers the locally prevailing wage for comparable work. New CREBs are among the bonds subject to this labor standard. The Davis-Bacon labor standard applies to certain bonds like new CREBs, QECBs, QZABs, QSCBs, and RZEDBs. The credit rate for investor credit TCBs is set higher than municipal bond rates to offset taxability. Investors seek a return higher than municipal bond rates, while issuers aim for lower interest costs compared to other financing options. Tax-exempt bonds are usually the next best alternative for governmental issuers. Investors' marginal tax rates play a crucial role in bond investment attractiveness. The attractiveness of bond investments is determined by the credit rate needed for tax credit bonds (TCBs) over municipal bonds. TCBs must exceed after-tax returns on municipal and taxable bonds of similar maturity. TCBs and taxable bonds are equally attractive for investors anticipating tax liability, regardless of tax bracket. Investors without tax liability holding TCBs face different considerations. Investors without tax liability holding tax credit bonds can claim a credit for future tax liability or sell the credits to an entity with tax liability. Issuers aim to borrow at the lowest interest cost, with tax credit bonds being a lower cost option compared to tax-exempt bonds. Direct payment tax credit bonds offer issuers the choice of receiving payments directly from the Treasury. Reducing the issuer credit rate may lead issuers to opt for traditional tax-exempt bond finance. The interest rate of tax credit bonds (TCBs) is crucial as it determines the issuer's payment. TCB issuers can establish a sinking fund to repay bond principal, reducing interest costs. The sinking fund yield was 1.55% on September 8, 2016, while the TCB rate was 3.92%. The appeal of tax-exempt bonds and TCBs varies with economic conditions, with tax-exempt bonds typically offered at lower rates than corporate bonds. The average high-grade municipal bond rate was 2.84% on September 2, 2016, offering a subsidy to the issuer. The gap between municipal and corporate bond rates fluctuated from late 2008 to early 2015, with municipal bond rates sometimes higher than corporate bond rates. Turmoil in the financial markets during the Great Recession may have contributed to the increase in municipal bond rates. The spread between corporate and municipal bonds returned to near historical average in 2015, possibly due to anticipated interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve. The value of TCB credit is determined by bond interest rates and Treasury credit rates, making TCBs less dependent on economic conditions compared to municipal bonds. TCBs may be more attractive than municipal bonds in low growth or uncertain economic periods. Authority to issue TCBs is usually limited nationally or by state, with some set asides for sub-state governments. Table 2 lists existing TCBs and their authorization levels, with common parameters standardized by P.L. 110-246. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) introduced various bond provisions, including QSCBs, BABs, and RZEDBs. These bonds allow issuers to receive a direct payment from the U.S. Treasury instead of tax-exempt interest payments or tax credits for investors. BABs and RZEDBs have an agreed-upon interest rate between the issuer and investor, with tax credit rates set at 35% for BABs and 45% for RZEDBs. Legislation in the 114th Congress, such as H.R. 2676 and S. 1515, aims to reauthorize and extend the issuance of BABs. Legislative activity includes reauthorizing and extending BABs and QZABs, with recent actions taken in the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act of 2010. QZAB debt limits have varied annually, with additional funds authorized in 2015 and 2016. States have limits based on their population below the poverty line. States allocate available credit to local governments or qualified zone academies based on their population below the poverty line. Unused credit can be carried forward for up to two years. Public schools use QZABs for renovation, equipment, teacher training, and course materials. Schools must be a \"Qualified Zone Academy\" designed in cooperation with businesses to enhance academic curriculum and prepare students for college and the workforce. The Qualified School Construction Bonds (QSCBs) are used for rehabilitating public school facilities, providing equipment, developing course materials, and training teachers. These bonds had a national limit of $11 billion in 2009 and 2010, with an additional $200 million allocated to Indian schools. States allocate the bonds based on their share of Title 1 Basic Grants, and the District of Columbia and U.S. possessions are also eligible for QSCBs. The U.S. possessions, excluding Puerto Rico, were allocated QSCBs based on population with income below the poverty line. 40% of the bond volume is dedicated to large LEAs, defined as the 100 largest based on children from families below the poverty level. The Secretary can choose up to 25 additional LEAs in need of assistance for school construction. Each large LEA receives an allocation based on their share of the total. Each large LEA receives an allocation based on their share of the total Title I basic grants directed to large LEAs. States can issue QZABs and QSCBs, with QZAB allocations available until 2016 and QSCB allocations made until 2010. The credit rate on QZABs and QSCBs was 3.92% with a term of 45 years. No bills have been introduced in the 114th Congress to extend this provision. Authorized by P.L. 109-58, CREBs had a national limit of $1.2 billion, with $750 million available for governmental bodies. Clean renewable energy bond lenders, defined in the tax code, could issue the bonds. The Secretary of the Treasury selects projects without a formula, and there are no state minimums. IRS Notice 2005-98 outlines the allocation strategy. The IRS Notice 2005-98 describes the allocation strategy for CREBs, with projects considered based on dollar amounts. CREBs offer a 100% credit for financing energy production projects such as wind facilities, bio-mass facilities, and solar energy facilities. The new CREBs authorized in P.L. 110-343 had a national limit of $2.4 billion. In contrast to the original CREBs, the credit rate on new CREBs is 70% of the original rate. Allocation of new CREBs is limited for public power providers, governmental bodies, and cooperative electric companies. The Secretary determines qualified projects for allocation based on project costs. QECBs were created with a national limit of $800 million under P.L. 110-343. The QECB program was created with a national limit of $800 million under P.L. 110-343, which was later expanded to $3.2 billion under P.L. 111-5. These tax credit bonds offer a credit rate that is 70% of the rate offered on old CREBs. The program is now fully subscribed and was allocated to states based on their share of the U.S. population. Large local governments with a population of over 100,000 are eligible for a direct allocation of QECBs for capital expenditures to reduce energy consumption. The bonds are used for capital expenditures to reduce energy consumption in buildings, implement green community programs, support rural development for renewable energy, and fund research in various energy-saving technologies. This includes cellulosic ethanol development, carbon dioxide capture, nonfossil fuel production efficiency, transportation fuel reduction technologies, and energy-efficient building technologies. Projects, including forestry conservation purposes, are eligible for Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds (QECBs) and Qualified Forestry Conservation Bonds (QFCBs). QFCBs have a unique feature allowing an allocation amount to offset federal taxes. Qualified issuers are states, political subdivisions, 501(c)(3) organizations. Forestry conservation purposes must meet specific criteria, such as being adjacent to US Forest Service Land. Bonds must be spent within three years of issuance. The land acquired for Qualified Forestry Conservation Bonds (QFCBs) must be adjacent to United States Forest Service Land. At least half of the land acquired must be transferred to the United States Forest Service at no cost, with the rest remaining with or conveyed to a State. All land must have a native fish habitat conservation plan approved by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, and the acreage acquired must be at least 40,000 acres. GTCBs were bonds issued after Hurricane Katrina, with a total of $350 million available for issuance by Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. The maturity length of GTCBs was shorter than other TCBs, with a maximum term of two years. GTCBs were bonds with a maximum term of two years, designed to assist state and local governments burdened with fiscal stress. 95% of proceeds had to be used for bond payments outstanding before Hurricane Katrina. MWDBs were for areas affected by severe storms and flooding in the Midwest in 2008, based on population. Eligibility to issue GTCBs expired in 2006. In 2008, states affected by severe storms and flooding in the Midwest could issue MWDBs based on population. States with over 2 million affected residents could issue up to $100 million, while those with less than 2 million and more than 1 million could issue $50 million. Illinois, Missouri, and Nebraska could issue up to $50 million each, and Indiana, Iowa, and Wisconsin could issue up to $100 million. MWDBs had a maximum term of two years and were intended to help sub-state jurisdictions under fiscal stress. The Build America Bonds (BABs) were not targeted in their designation and had no volume limit. They could be issued for any purpose eligible for traditional tax-exempt bond financing, except private activity bonds, before January 1, 2011. BABs offered a credit amount equal to 35% of the interest rate, and were a direct payment Tax Credit Bond (TCB). In the 114th Congress, legislation has been introduced to reinstate and permanently extend Build America Bonds (BABs). H.R. 2676 and S. 1515 propose to extend issuance authority for BABs with a decreasing schedule for the credit rate, decreasing from 35% to 28% for bonds issued in 2019 or later. BABs have saved municipal issuers around $20 billion in interest costs. Additionally, there are Recovery Zone Economic Development Bonds (RZEDBs) with a 45% credit rate, targeted at economically distressed areas. Recovery Zone Economic Development Bonds (RZEDBs) are aimed at areas in distress due to military base closures, economic downturns, or designated zones. These bonds support economic development through funding for property, public infrastructure, facilities, and job training programs. States received a $10 billion volume limit allocation based on 2008 employment declines, with all states and territories eligible regardless of employment changes. States and U.S. territories are guaranteed a minimum of 0.90% of the $10 billion allocation for Recovery Zone Economic Development Bonds (RZEDBs). Large municipalities and counties also receive a share based on employment decline. RZEDB authority expired on January 1, 2011."
