However, they typically require extensive training with many gradient-based weight updates and unique image examples. This paper introduces a method combining neural attention and meta learning techniques with autoregressive models to enable effective few-shot density estimation. The modified PixelCNN model shows state-of-the-art performance on the Omniglot dataset. Additionally, the learned attention policy demonstrates intuitive algorithms for tasks like image mirroring and handwriting without supervision. The model is further extended to natural images, showcasing its capabilities. Few-shot image density estimation is a challenging task in machine learning. Autoregressive neural networks show promise in this area, especially when combined with meta-learning techniques. The model's performance on the Omniglot dataset is impressive, demonstrating intuitive algorithms for tasks like image mirroring and handwriting without supervision. Further extensions to natural images show the model's capabilities in few-shot image generation. Neural networks are efficient for few-shot density estimation due to their speed, stability, and tractable likelihoods. They allow for easy comparison of model variants and adding complexity to generative models. Autoregressive image models factorize joint distributions and use conditioning variables like image captions or class labels. Few-shot density estimation involves using samples from the target distribution as conditioning variables for the model. This approach learns a learning algorithm embedded in the network weights. Training a deep network from scratch with few training samples may lead to memorization rather than generalization. Few-shot density estimation involves learning a learning algorithm embedded in the network weights to avoid memorization of samples and promote generalization. To achieve this, a learning algorithm that can work on tiny training sets is needed, which may involve learning the algorithm itself. This approach involves two nested learning problems, where the inner problem is less constrained than the outer one, allowing for rapid learning with few data points. Meta-learning is a model that can rapidly infer, generate, or learn using few data points. It is seen as a data-driven alternative to hand-engineering priors, allowing models to be deployed on resource-constrained devices like mobile phones. This approach may be crucial for protecting private data and personalization. The curr_chunk discusses different approaches to meta-learning, including sample-conditional density models and unconditional models that adapt their weights based on few-shot samples. It also introduces PixelCNN, Attention PixelCNN, and Meta PixelCNN. The text connects this work to previous attentive autoregressive models and gradient-based meta-learning. In Section 3, Attention PixelCNN and Meta PixelCNN are described in detail, showcasing how attention improves performance in few-shot density estimation by transferring texture information from the support set to the target image. Section 4 compares various few-shot PixelCNN variants on different tasks, demonstrating that both gradient-based and attention-based approaches can effectively learn simple distributions and achieve state-of-the-art results on Omniglot. The concept of learning to learn, or meta-learning, has been explored in cognitive science and machine learning for decades, with recent advancements showing the ability to optimize optimizers through gradient descent and learn in black-box optimization settings. BID4 demonstrated learning to learn through gradient descent in black-box optimization. BID17 showed the effectiveness of learning an optimizer in few-shot learning. BID7 introduced a simplified variation where the optimizer is fixed, reducing meta-learning to learning initial base parameters. This approach was effective in imitation learning and real robotic manipulation tasks. BID22 trained a neural network for one-shot classification on Omniglot. Few-shot density estimation has been explored using matching networks and variational autoencoders. BID3 applied variational inference to memory addressing. In this work, the focus is on extending autoregressive models to the few-shot setting, particularly PixelCNN. Autoregressive models with attention have been well-established in language tasks, inspired by an attention-based network for machine translation. Visual attention has been used to improve image captioning systems and in motor control for imitation learning. Additionally, convolutional machine translation models have been developed with attention over the input sentence. Our model, Attention PixelCNN, utilizes attention over input pixels for image generation. The network queries a memory for generating each pixel, which includes support images and textures. This differs from previous works where the encoding was shared across all pixels. Our model, Attention PixelCNN, uses a context-sensitive attention mechanism to encode support images for generating each pixel in the target image. This approach replaces the shared encoding function used in previous works, allowing for a more efficient and effective learning process. Our model, Attention PixelCNN, utilizes a shallow convolutional network to encode support images into spatially-indexed key and value vectors for image generation. The support images are encoded in parallel and reshaped into a queryable memory matrix. The Attention PixelCNN model encodes support images into a queryable memory for image generation. Features are obtained by encoding global context and generated pixels, using a PixelCNN layer. Patch attention features are incorporated into pixel predictions using a scoring function. The resulting attention-gated context function is combined with global context features for improved image generation. The Attention PixelCNN model incorporates support images into a queryable memory for image generation. Simple modifications to the model, such as adding position information and image labels, can significantly improve performance. The proposed implicitly-conditioned version using gradient descent in the Attention PixelCNN model introduces no additional parameters and aims to maximize the objective L(x, s; \u03b8) = log P (x; \u03b8). This approach allows for flexibility in defining inner and outer objectives. The model in BID15 allows for flexibility in setting different inner and outer objectives. It can learn to produce gradients that increase log P (x; \u03b8) without computing log likelihood or respecting causal ordering of pixels. Input features for computing L inner (s, \u03b8) are the L-th layer of spatial features from PixelCNN. The features are processed through a convolutional network to generate a scalar inner loss. The support set encoder in the model includes layers of stride-2 convolutions with 3 \u00d7 3 kernels, followed by elementwise squaring and a sum over all dimensions. Experiments were conducted on image flipping, Omniglot, and Stanford Online Products datasets. The support image encoder structure consists of a 5 \u00d7 5 conv layer, followed by 3 \u00d7 3 convolutions and max-pooling. The support image encodings are then processed through two fully-connected layers to obtain the support set embedding for few-shot learning tasks like image flipping. The Attention PixelCNN algorithm successfully learned to copy pixel values from the support to the target location, while the baseline conditional PixelCNN and Meta PixelCNN did not. The model was trained on ImageNet BID5 images resized to 48\u00d748 for 30K steps using RMSProp with a learning rate of 1e \u22124. The network architecture included a 16-layer PixelCNN with skip connections and conditioning on attention features in the latter 8 layers. The Attention PixelCNN algorithm successfully learned to apply horizontal flip operation to images, while the baseline models failed to do so. The attention model achieved significantly lower nats/dim scores compared to the baseline models on both training and validation sets. The Attention PixelCNN model achieved lower nats/dim scores compared to baseline models on training and validation sets. It learned a copy operation during sampling, with attention proceeding in right-to-left order over the input and output written in left-to-right order. The model was benchmarked on Omniglot BID14 and trained on 26x26 binarized images with a small network architecture to avoid overfitting. The network conditions on attention features and induces a density model of characters from images. Meta PixelCNN achieves state-of-the-art likelihoods but combining attention and meta learning does not show improvement. Future work could explore more effective ways to combine these techniques. The network learns to attend to corresponding regions of the support set when generating output images, with results showing improved sample quality with attention. In this section, results are demonstrated on natural images from the Stanford Online Products Dataset BID24, consisting of sets of images showing the same product from eBay listings. The task is to induce a density model over images of a single object given a set of 3 images. The dataset includes various product categories with different backgrounds and views, requiring a multiscale architecture for effective modeling. The Attention PixelCNN model in BID19 Figure 5 shows better matching of textures and colors from support images compared to the baseline PixelCNN model. The attention model captures objects more accurately and can even copy textures from support images. However, there is no significant improvement in test likelihood compared to the baseline model. In this paper, the Attention PixelCNN model achieves state-of-the-art results on Omniglot and natural images for few-shot density estimation. The model is simple, fast to train, and learns sensible algorithms for generation tasks. Additionally, the Meta PixelCNN model shows that gradient-based meta learning methods can also be used for few-shot density estimation. The Attention PixelCNN model achieves state-of-the-art results on Omniglot and natural images for few-shot density estimation. It outperforms previous models in terms of likelihood, but other factors like training time and scalability also play a role in model selection. The model has 286K parameters compared to 53M for ConvDRAW, showing conflicting rankings between likelihood and sample quality. The conditional ConvDraw model used in experiments is a modification of models introduced in BID10. The model, encoded with 4 convolution layers, is concatenated to the ConvL-STM state at every Draw step. Training followed the same protocol as the PixelCNN experiments."
