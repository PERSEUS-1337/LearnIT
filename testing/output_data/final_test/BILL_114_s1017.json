    "content": "Section 216 of the Federal Power Act is amended to address the siting of interstate electric transmission facilities. The policy of the United States is to maximize the benefits of the national interstate transmission system by supporting cleaner power generation, reducing emissions, meeting public policy requirements, and achieving cost savings through reduced congestion, enhanced trading opportunities, lower line losses, and resource-sharing. The benefits of the national interstate transmission system include generation resource-sharing, enhanced fuel diversity, reliability benefits, risk diversification, competition enhancement, collocation on existing rights-of-way, land use priorities, compliance with regulations, and the contribution of demand side management, energy storage, distributed generation resources, and smart grid. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of a high-priority regional transmission project, which includes various transmission facilities and equipment necessary for its operation. This definition is important for cost allocation purposes under Order Number 1000 of the Commission. The curr_chunk defines terms related to Indian land and Indian tribes, including the criteria for land held in trust and the eligibility for special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians. The curr_chunk discusses the siting of high-priority regional transmission projects to ensure they are in the public interest and align with established policies. Developers must first seek state authorization before seeking federal approval for construction. The Commission may authorize construction of a high-priority regional transmission project if a State fails to approve it within 1 year. The Commission may authorize a high-priority regional transmission project if a State fails to approve it within 1 year, or if the State rejects the application, imposes unreasonable conditions, or lacks authority to approve the project. The developer cannot apply for State authorization to construct a high-priority regional transmission project if they do not serve end-users in the State. An applicant for such a project can only apply for a certificate of public convenience and necessity under specific circumstances outlined in subsection (c)(2)(B). The application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity must be made in writing as per the regulations set by the Commission. Upon receiving the application, the Commission will provide public notice and a hearing, and then may approve or disapprove the application. The Commission will coordinate all Federal authorizations and environmental reviews for a high-priority regional transmission project. The Commission will coordinate Federal authorizations and environmental reviews for high-priority regional transmission projects, ensuring timely and efficient review and permit decisions. The Commission will establish a coordinated project plan with milestones for all Federal authorizations. A certificate will be issued to a qualified applicant for the proposed operation, construction, acquisition, or modification covered by the application. The Commission may attach reasonable terms and conditions to a certificate for construction, acquisition, or modification if it is deemed necessary for public convenience and necessity. Parties can submit portions of a state proceeding record to the Commission for consideration. The Commission considers public convenience and necessity when evaluating applications for facilities included in an Interconnection-wide transmission grid plan for a high-priority regional transmission project. If a certificate holder cannot acquire necessary property rights through negotiation, they may have the right of eminent domain for the project. The Commission may grant a certificate for a high-priority regional transmission project and acquire necessary land through eminent domain. Recommendations from Federal, state, and tribal agencies for mitigation measures must be considered. The Commission may incorporate identified mitigation measures as conditions to the certificate for a high-priority regional transmission project. If a recommended mitigation measure is deemed inconsistent, infeasible, or not cost-effective, consultations will be held with relevant agencies and tribes to resolve the issue, and appropriate measures will be incorporated based on those consultations. The Commission may incorporate mitigation measures as conditions for a high-priority regional transmission project certificate. If a recommended measure is not feasible, consultations will be held with relevant agencies and tribes to address the issue. The transmission project in a State does not need a separate siting authorization from the State or local authorities. For projects on Indian land, the certificate holder must comply with Federal law for obtaining rights-of-way. This section does not override environmental or historic preservation laws, including the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The section outlines that the development of transmission projects must comply with Federal environmental and historic preservation laws, including the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. It also specifies that State law still applies to the construction or modification of transmission facilities. Additionally, it states that the section does not apply in Alaska or Hawaii, or to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas."
