    "content": "The \"Accountability for Business Choices in Iran Act\" is the short title of this legislation. It includes findings related to business practices in Iran. Congress finds that Iran is a party to the NPT and IAEA, and the US has issued executive orders to address the threat posed by Iran's nuclear weapons program. The Iran Sanctions Act was signed into law in 1996 to impose sanctions on Iran. The Iran Sanctions Act (ISA) was enacted to sanction companies investing in Iran's petroleum or natural gas sectors. The Iran Nonproliferation Act was also signed into law to address transfers of certain goods, services, or technology to Iran. The Iran Freedom Support Act (IFSA) was signed into law to hold Iran accountable for its threatening behavior and extended the Iran Sanctions Act (ISA) until December 31, 2011. The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) has passed resolutions urging Iran to stop its nuclear activities and imposed sanctions to prevent the supply of certain goods or technologies. Iran is in violation of UNSC resolutions regarding uranium enrichment and nuclear activities. The US revoked authorization for transfers involving Iran, effective November 10, 2008. Iran has not suspended its enrichment activities as required by the Security Council, according to a June 5, 2009 IAEA report. Iran was found to be covertly enriching uranium in Qom, Iran, which was concealed from the IAEA until September 21, 2009. President Obama, British Prime Minister Brown, and French President Sarkozy revealed this information on September 25, 2009. The Sense of Congress is outlined in Section 3. The Sense of Congress outlines the serious threat posed by Iran's illicit nuclear activities, unconventional weapons development, and support for terrorism. The United States should support diplomatic efforts to end Iran's nuclear activities and the UN Security Council should tighten sanctions on Iran. The United States should take measures to discourage foreign banks from providing export credits to entities investing in Iran's energy sector. Foreign governments should stop state-owned entities from investing in Iran's energy sector and exporting refined petroleum products to Iran. Moderate Arab countries play a vital role in this issue. (6) Moderate Arab countries, especially those with large oil deposits, should use their economic leverage to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons by dissuading other countries like Russia and China from assisting Iran's nuclear program. (7) Implementing effective economic measures to isolate Iran's regime could lead to a diplomatic resolution rather than a nuclear standoff. (8) International firms doing business in Iran should cease providing support to facilitate a diplomatic solution. International firms doing business in Iran should stop supporting the Iranian economy, as this Act aims to prevent entities doing business with the United States from engaging with Iran. The Act prohibits United States government contracts. The executive agency must ensure that contracts with companies include a clause requiring certification that the company does not do business in Iran. Remedies can be imposed if false certification is submitted. The head of an executive agency can terminate a contract with a company for false certification, suspend or debar the contractor from federal contracts for up to 3 years, and include them on a list of excluded parties. The Procurement Policy Act allows for debarment, suspension, or ineligibility of contractors for false certification. The President can waive this requirement on a case-by-case basis if it is in the national interest. The Procurement Policy Act allows for debarment, suspension, or ineligibility of contractors for false certification. The President can waive this requirement on a case-by-case basis if it is in the national interest. The Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy must report waivers granted, and the Federal Acquisition Regulation will be revised to implement these requirements within 120 days of the Act's enactment. The Administrator of General Services will submit a report one year after the regulation is revised. General Services, along with other executive agencies, will report to the Office of Management and Budget and congressional committees on the actions taken under this section. State and local governments have the authority to prohibit contracts with individuals listed in section 4(b)(4). The Act will end 30 days after Iran stops supporting terrorism and pursuing weapons of mass destruction. The Act defines \"company\" as various types of entities, including those owned or controlled by a foreign government, and \"affiliate\" as individuals or entities that are connected to the company through control. The Act defines \"entity\" as various types of organizations and \"Federal funds\" as money from US taxpayers provided to companies. Business operations under the Act include providing Iran with refined petroleum resources. The Act prohibits activities that would enhance Iran's access to refined petroleum resources, including providing resources, services, technology, or investments of $20,000,000 or more. The Act prohibits investments of $20,000,000 or more that enhance Iran's ability to develop petroleum resources and provide sensitive technology to the Government of Iran. The Act prohibits investments over $20,000,000 that boost Iran's petroleum development and supply sensitive technology to the Iranian government. This includes petroleum, petroleum by-products, oil or liquefied natural gas tankers, and products for oil or gas pipelines. Sensitive technology refers to hardware, software, and telecommunications equipment that could be used by Iran to control information flow. The Act prohibits investments over $20,000,000 that support Iran's petroleum industry and supply sensitive technology to the Iranian government. Sensitive technology includes hardware, software, and telecommunications equipment that could control information flow in Iran. The term \"appropriate congressional committees\" and \"executive agency\" are defined in the Act."
