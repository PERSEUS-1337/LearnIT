    "content": "The Bureau of Reclamation, part of the Department of the Interior, manages federal dams and water structures in the western U.S. It is the largest water wholesaler and second-largest hydropower producer. Reclamation projects aim to develop arid lands for agriculture and other uses, providing water, flood control, recreation, and wildlife benefits. Reclamation projects operate on a beneficiary pays principle, requiring reimbursement for project costs. They must obtain state water rights and comply with state laws. The Bureau of Reclamation has evolved to focus on multi-purpose projects since the 1970s, including water reuse, conservation, and Indian water rights settlements. The primary goal is not reclaiming land for agriculture. The Bureau of Reclamation focuses on multi-purpose projects, including water reuse, conservation, and Indian water rights settlements. It has played a significant role in federal development efforts in the western states and territories. The report provides background on the Bureau of Reclamation's history, authorities, and selected issues before Congress. The Bureau of Reclamation's history dates back to the mid-19th century with the Homestead Act and Desert Land Act, encouraging settlement in the West through land incentives and irrigation projects. This led to the development of large-scale irrigation infrastructure to facilitate widespread settlement. The Carey Act of 1894 shifted responsibility for irrigation development to states and territories, but many efforts failed due to various reasons. Supporters then turned to the federal government for funding and support. The Reclamation Act of 1902 marked the first federal approval for large-scale irrigation projects in the West, funded by a newly established Reclamation Fund. The Reclamation Act of 1902 established the Reclamation Fund to finance irrigation projects in western states. Authorized activities were limited to 17 designated states, with settlers allotted up to 160 acres of land for agricultural purposes. Repayment to the federal government for project construction expenses was required within a 10-year period. The Reclamation Act of 1902 established a 10-year repayment period for Reclamation projects and directed payments into the Reclamation Fund for new projects. Interest payments were not required for agricultural beneficiaries. Congress also directed deference to state water laws under the act. The Reclamation Act of 1902 established a 10-year repayment period for projects, with deference to state water laws. The United States Reclamation Service, later renamed the Bureau of Reclamation, was created in 1902 within the USGS and became an independent bureau in 1907. The Bureau of Reclamation, formerly known as the Reclamation Service, focused on irrigation projects. Congress made changes to provide additional federal funds, including $20 million in 1910 and $5 million in 1938. The Reclamation Extension Act of 1914 aimed to control overspending by requiring annual appropriations. In 1924, the Fact Finders Report led to the \"Fact Finders Act,\" which imposed new requirements on the bureau and contractors. Congress made significant changes to the Reclamation project development process, authorizing new revenue sources and altering repayment terms. This included authorizing revenues from water sales, onshore royalties, and hydropower revenues to shore up Reclamation Fund balances. The repayment period for Reclamation projects was extended from 10 years to 40 years through legislation enacted in 1914 and 1926. Congress further extended the repayment period to 40 years in 1926. The Reclamation Project Act of 1939 authorized irrigation assistance covered by hydropower and water sales revenues. Water service contracts for up to 40 years were also authorized. Legislation in 1946 and 1958 provided federal credit for fish and wildlife preservation activities. Unique project repayment terms and extensions were authorized by Congress for specific Reclamation projects. Legislation was also passed to support project repairs. In 1949, Congress authorized rehabilitation and betterment improvements for Reclamation projects to be repaid according to existing schedules. Loans were provided to irrigation districts for distribution system construction on authorized projects. Many Reclamation projects were authorized in specific acts of Congress, with financing directed through the General Fund during the Great Depression. The 1928 Boulder Canyon Act authorized the construction of Hoover Dam and the All-American Canal. The construction of Hoover Dam, All-American Canal, and Central Valley Project in California were authorized by Congress. Other large Reclamation projects were authorized during and after World War II. The last major new Reclamation project construction authorization was the Colorado River Basin Project Act of 1968. Environmental requirements in the 1970s and 1980s led to a slowdown in Reclamation's construction program. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Endangered Species Act of 1973 increased environmental protections but also raised costs and administrative conditions for new Reclamation projects. Many prime project sites in the West were already developed or protected by this time, leading to rejections or significant scaling back of projects. The 1976 failure of Reclamation's Teton Dam in Idaho resulted in fatalities and raised doubts about the viability of large federal dams, leading to the Reclamation Safety of Dams Act of 1978. The Reclamation Safety of Dams Act of 1978 authorized safety modifications at dams. The Carter and Reagan Administrations assessed water resource projects, with the Carter Administration proposing defunding of several projects. The Reagan Administration acknowledged a shift in Reclamation's mission in 1988. The Administration highlighted the need for facilities to meet current and future water demands, with a shift in Reclamation's role towards operations, maintenance, environmental enhancement, and dam safety. Congress enacted the Reclamation Reform Act of 1982, expanding ownership limitations under the 1902 Reclamation Act. The Reclamation Reform Act of 1982 expanded ownership limitations under the 1902 Reclamation Act to 960 acres, applied acreage limitation to all operator-owned lands, and introduced full-cost pricing for water delivery. The Act made major changes to Reclamation contracts, increasing costs for contractors by limiting irrigation with federally subsidized water. The Reclamation Projects Authorization and Adjustment Act of 1992 realigned priorities and mitigated environmental effects, including the Central Valley Project Improvement Act. The Central Valley Project Improvement Act (CVPIA) made significant changes to the management of the Central Valley Project (CVP) in California, benefiting fish and wildlife but leading to less water delivery and higher rates for CVP contractors. Congress also directed the operation of Glen Canyon Dam to protect Grand Canyon National Park and authorized a review of federal activities affecting water resources in western states. Despite limited new traditional Reclamation projects, Congress has approved other construction efforts since the 1970s. Since the 1970s, Congress has approved Reclamation involvement in rural water projects, construction of new water infrastructure for Indian tribes, and financial assistance for water conservation activities. These authorities were consolidated into Reclamation's WaterSMART Program in 2010. The WIIN Act provided Reclamation with its first significant new authorization. In the WIIN Act (P.L. 114-322), Congress authorized Reclamation for water storage projects in 17 western states. Reclamation is overseen by the Commissioner and funded through discretionary appropriations by Congress. Reclamation's infrastructure assets include 491 dams, 338 reservoirs, and over 8,000 miles of conveyance infrastructure. These facilities have a total replacement value of $99 billion and serve one in every five farmers in the West. Some of Reclamation's dams and reservoirs, such as Grand Coulee Dam, Hoover Dam, and Glen Canyon Dam, are among the largest in the world. Lake Mead and Lake Powell are the country's two largest reservoirs. Reclamation supports nonfederally-owned facilities and provides financial assistance for projects benefiting the West. In FY2017, Reclamation generated $63 billion in economic impacts, with $45 billion from irrigation production. The bureau's annual budget is $1.66 billion, with additional funding from water and power contractors for project operations. The report discusses Reclamation's major project types for Congress, including traditional water supply projects. Reclamation's projects include traditional water supply, federal water storage, dam safety modifications, rural water projects, Indian water rights settlements, and grants for nonfederal projects promoting alternative water supplies. Cost-share structures and authorities for these projects are detailed in Table 2. Reclamation owns around 180 traditional projects in 17 western states, authorized under the Reclamation Act of 1902. Reclamation projects are authorized by Congress and funded by the federal government initially. Beneficiaries, such as irrigation contractors and municipal governments, repay their share of the construction costs over a 40 to 50 year term. The federal government funds reclamation projects, with beneficiaries repaying their share of costs over 40 to 50 years. Once construction costs are repaid, project operation and maintenance may be transferred to beneficiaries, but projects remain federally owned unless Congress authorizes transfer of ownership. Title transfer involves divesting qualifying assets to nonfederal users. Congressional authorizations for Reclamation projects have shifted, with a new process for approving and financing water storage projects under the WIIN Act. Congress has refrained from enacting site-specific authorizations since 2012, but new authority in Section 4007 allows federal support for water storage projects by nonfederal entities. The WIIN Act authorized federal support for water storage projects, with a maximum of 50% for federal projects and 25% for nonfederal projects. Nonfederal shares must be provided up-front for federal support. Federal construction funding is contingent on project benefits being federal benefits. Unlike traditional Reclamation projects, there is no expectation of repayment of the initial federal investment. The WIIN Act authorizes federal support for water storage projects, with specific requirements for funding under Section 4007. Reclamation must find projects feasible, have a cost-sharing partner, recommend projects to Congress, and Congress must mention them by name in appropriations legislation for funding approval. Funding for Section 4007 projects is typically done in three steps: Congress appropriates funding, Reclamation recommends projects, and Congress decides on project-level expenditures. Reclamation recommended seven projects to receive $33 million in FY2017 funding for WIIN Act Section 4007 projects in early 2018. Congress agreed to these recommendations in the FY2018 Energy and Water Development appropriations bill (P.L. 115-141). In February 2019, Reclamation recommended another round of project-level allocations to receive $75 million in FY2017 and FY2018 appropriated funds. Congress agreed with all of the Administration's recommendations for FY2020 appropriations, except for $57 million proposed for the Shasta Dam and Reservoir Enhancement Project. As of early 2020, Congress had appropriated $469 million for Section 4007 projects, with only $51 million released to specific projects, while the remainder awaited further action. Reclamation's dam safety program, authorized by Reclamation Safety of Dams Act of 1978, provides for inspection and repairs to qualifying projects at Reclamation dams. Projects authorized under this authority have a different cost-share structure than traditional Reclamation construction projects. Reclamation conducts dam safety inspections through the Safety Evaluation of Existing Dams program and carries out corrective actions through the Initiate Safety of Dams Corrective Action program. Modifications on priority structures are funded based on an evolving identification of risks and needs. In 2014, P.L. 114-113 increased Reclamation's authority to approve dam safety modifications up to $20 million without congressional authorization. The Secretary of the Interior can develop additional project benefits alongside dam safety modifications if deemed necessary. Funding participants must agree to a cost share for these additional benefits. Congress has also authorized Reclamation to carry out various projects and programs. Congress has authorized Reclamation to carry out projects and programs, including incorporating M&I water resource benefits into larger projects and undertaking rural water supply projects in specific rural areas from 1980 to 2009, primarily in North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, and New Mexico. The Rural Water Supply Act of 2006 (P.L. 109-451) authorizes federal funding for tribal and nontribal rural water projects, with the federal government covering up to 100% of the costs. This program aims to address water supply issues in tribal reservations and nontribal rural communities with substandard or declining water quality. The Rural Water Supply Program, authorized by the Rural Water Supply Act of 2006, aimed to address water supply issues in tribal reservations and nontribal rural communities. It allowed Reclamation to work with rural communities and tribes to identify water needs through feasibility studies. However, no projects were recommended or authorized through this program, and its authority expired in 2016. Reclamation continues to construct rural water projects initiated outside of this program. Reclamation developed prioritization criteria for budgeting rural water projects initiated outside of the Rural Water Supply Program. Criteria include tribal components, financial resources, urgency of need, and meeting water and energy objectives. $1.3 billion is needed to complete ongoing projects, with $132.7 million funded in FY2019. FY2020 requested $27.8 million. The Administration requested $27.8 million for FY2020, with Congress appropriating an additional $117.4 million for Reclamation's rural water projects. Indian water rights are recognized as vested property rights with a trust responsibility by the United States. Disputes have arisen between Indians and non-Indian water users, particularly in the western U.S., regarding water rights established by the Winters doctrine in 1908. The Winters doctrine and prior appropriation system allocate water rights in western states based on acquisition order. Indian reserved water rights are often senior to non-Indian rights, but non-Indians have greater access to water through infrastructure. Disputes are typically resolved through negotiated settlements involving tradeoffs for tribes, water users, and governmental entities. Negotiated settlements for water rights involve tradeoffs for tribes, water users, and government entities. Congress has authorized Reclamation to build infrastructure to provide tribes with actual water. Since 1978, 32 settlements have been enacted into law, with total federal costs exceeding $5.8 billion. Some settlements require no federal funding, while others receive hundreds of millions of dollars. In 2010, Congress established the Reclamation Water Settlements Fund under Title X of P.L. 111-11. The Reclamation Water Settlements Fund, established under Title X of P.L. 111-11, provides up to $120 million annually for Indian water rights settlements from FY2020 to FY2029 without further appropriations. The WaterSMART program combines funding for water conservation programs within Reclamation, including grants for water and energy efficiency projects and the Title XVI Water Reclamation and Reuse Program for water recycling. The Reclamation and Reuse Program funds water recycling projects, the Drought Response Program assists with drought plans and projects, the Basin Studies Program evaluates water supply, the Cooperative Watershed Management Program supports local water management projects, and Water Conservation Field Services provide assistance for water conservation plans and improvements. The largest programs are WaterSMART Grants and the Title XVI Water Reclamation and Reuse Program, receiving a total of $401 million and $579 million respectively. The Title XVI Water Reclamation and Reuse Program received $401 million and $579 million in appropriations from FY2009 through FY2020. Congress authorized various WaterSMART sub-programs, including WaterSMART Grants, parts of the Drought Response Program, the Basin Studies Program, and the Cooperative Watershed Management Program. Most WaterSMART efforts require cost sharing of at least 50% to leverage nonfederal resources. Recent funding levels for the WaterSMART Program are detailed in Figure 3. Section 4009 of the WIIN Act added new authorities for Reclamation to assist in the construction of desalination projects. Section 4009 of the WIIN Act expanded Reclamation's role in desalination projects by authorizing federal funding of up to 25% of the total cost for eligible projects. Nonfederal parties must submit feasibility studies to Reclamation for approval before receiving support. Congress also authorized a similar process for previously unauthorized Title XVI projects to receive federal funds without specific congressional approval. In the 116th Congress, Congress appropriated $42 million for Section 4009(a) desalination projects and $70 million for Section 4009(c) Title XVI projects. The WIIN Act's Sections 4007 and 4009 authorities have sparked broader congressional discussions on Reclamation's missions and future role. Two bills in Congress propose significant Reclamation policy changes. In the 116th Congress, two bills propose Reclamation policy changes: S. 1932, the Drought Resiliency and Water Supply Infrastructure Act, and draft legislation by Representative Huffman. The debate includes questions on supporting new water supply infrastructure, like surface water storage projects. The last major Reclamation water storage project was the Animas La Plata Project. Congress has not authorized Reclamation for new projects outside of specific settlements and rural water projects. The WIIN Act's Section 4007 provided new water storage authorities, a departure from traditional Reclamation project approval processes. It allows nonfederal sponsors to lead or contribute to projects, requiring less federal investment upfront. This could impact the bureau's future direction. The WIIN Act's Section 4007 offers new water storage authorities, allowing nonfederal sponsors to lead projects with less federal investment upfront. This could impact future Reclamation projects. Some members of Congress are considering extending and amending this authority, with proposed funding for new storage projects in California, Washington, and Idaho. The legislation proposes changes to the reporting process for federal projects and nonfederal water storage projects. It would increase authorization for Section 4007 storage projects to $750 million and extend the authority through FY2025. Supporters argue that new construction will increase water availability in the West and address climate change effects. Some oppose the extension of Section 4007. Some oppose extending Section 4007 authority under the WIIN Act, preferring a limited federal role in water projects. They suggest focusing on environmentally friendly alternatives like water conservation. Congress's decision on extending the authority will impact Reclamation's involvement in new water development projects. If not extended, Congress may shift focus to other mission areas and transition projects to nonfederal users. Congress may decide to complete projects funded through the WIIN Act on an ad hoc basis or use other financing authorities. Title XVI has been popular for funding water reuse projects in the West since 1992. Section 4009 of the WIIN Act allowed for approval of new Title XVI construction projects and federal support for nonfederal desalination projects. Reclamation published the first report under this authority in 2017. In 2017, Reclamation published a report under Section 4009 authority, with Congress approving new projects via the WIIN Act in 2018 and 2019. Section 4009 allows nonfederal entities to carry out studies and receive federal support for water storage projects. Several bills in the 116th Congress propose to extend Section 4009, with funding for Title XVI and Desalination projects. S. 1932 would authorize $160 million and $80 million, while Representative Huffman's draft legislation would authorize $500 million and $260 million for these projects. Both S. 1932 and Representative Huffman's draft legislation propose to extend Section 4009 authorities through 2024 and increase the federal cap for Title XVI projects from $20 million to $30 million. Supporters argue that these projects provide environmentally friendly water supplies to fast-growing areas in the West, while opponents question their priority and urban-focused benefits. The Bureau of Reclamation faces challenges with aging infrastructure, with most facilities being 60-100 years old and estimated replacement value of $99 billion in 2015. The beneficiary-pays model poses difficulties for contractors in financing repairs, and obtaining funding from Congress for infrastructure projects is a challenge. Congress is interested in Reclamation's funding and repayment structures. Reclamation estimates its infrastructure needs, including dam safety and upgrades, under the major repair and rehabilitation category. In early 2020, it projected $3.8 billion for five-year maintenance and rehabilitation, funded by various sources. Reclamation is developing a strategy to address aging infrastructure needs as required. Reclamation is working to estimate and address its aging infrastructure needs, as required by the Reclamation Transparency Act. Recent experience suggests that funding for maintenance and repairs will continue to be necessary, with potential challenges for contractors to repay without federal aid. Some may question additional federal spending on these projects, but infrastructure failures could pose significant risks. Proposed legislation in the 116th Congress aims to address Reclamation's aging infrastructure. In the 116th Congress, legislation such as S. 2044 and H.R. 4659 proposes the creation of an Aging Infrastructure Account in the Treasury for maintenance work on Reclamation projects. Additionally, P.L. 116-9 authorizes a title transfer process to facilitate ownership transfer of facilities for infrastructure upgrades. Indian water rights settlements have led to significant Reclamation project authorizations, with Congress approving nine new settlements from 2010 to 2016. The Reclamation Water Settlement Fund, established in 2010, is expected to provide $120 million annually from FY2020 to FY2029 for infrastructure upgrades. Legislation in the 116th Congress, such as H.R. 1904 and S. 886, aims to extend this funding, with H.R. 1904 proposing perpetual availability and S. 886 suggesting funding through FY2039. S. 886 would extend deposits to the Reclamation Water Settlement Fund through FY2039, limiting the Secretary of the Interior to $90 million per year per settlement. Congress must decide on the long-term funding approach for settlements, with some advocating for mandatory funding while others prefer annual discretionary appropriations. Additionally, new Indian water rights settlements are being considered, such as S. 3019, which would authorize a significant settlement. The Rights Protection Action in the 116th Congress includes authorizing large Indian water rights settlements like the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Water Compact in Montana. Other legislation would authorize new settlements with the Navajo Utah and the Hualapai Tribe of Arizona, as well as amendments to the 2010 Aamodt Settlement Litigation Act. Congress may debate the merits of these settlements and proposals to finance Reclamation activities through additional revenues and loan programs. In the 116th Congress, proposals have been made to use additional funding from the Reclamation Fund for priority activities such as new water storage, infrastructure upgrades, and water rights settlements. H.R. 2473, the SAVE Act, aims to redirect $300 million annually from FY2030 to FY2060 without further appropriation. In the 116th Congress, proposals have been made to use additional funding from the Reclamation Fund for priority activities such as new water storage, infrastructure upgrades, and water rights settlements. H.R. 2473, the SAVE Act, aims to redirect $300 million annually from FY2030 to FY2060 without further appropriation. Additionally, H.R. 1904 and S. 886, the Indian Water Rights Settlement Extension Act, would extend $120 million per year in mandatory funding through FY2029. Members have proposed alternative financing for western water resource infrastructure projects. Proposals in the 116th Congress suggest alternative financing, known as Reclamation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (RIFIA) proposals, modeled after the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA). These proposals aim to provide federal project financing capped at 49% of project costs, to be repaid over time by project sponsors. WIFIA loans offer significant credit assistance with minimal budget authority needed in annual appropriations. Eligible projects may include water supply projects. In the 116th Congress, proposals for Reclamation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (RIFIA) programs aim to provide federal financing for western water supply projects, separate from municipal projects. Both S. 1932 and H.R. 2473 would authorize pilot RIFIA programs with $150 million allocated for expenses from FY2021 to FY2025, potentially leveraging over $1 billion in federal funding for projects."
