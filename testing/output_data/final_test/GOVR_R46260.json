Enacted in 1976, PILT was a response to a shift in federal policy towards retaining federal lands permanently for public use. The Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program was established in response to a shift in federal policy towards retaining federal lands permanently for public use. PILT payments are provided to compensate state and local governments for tax-exempt federal lands, and can be used for various governmental purposes such as firefighting, police protection, and public infrastructure projects. The Office of the Secretary in the Department of the Interior is responsible for calculating and distributing PILT payments. The Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program, administered by the DOI, provides annual payments to local governments for tax-exempt federal lands. Payments are made to units of general local government, mainly counties, and are calculated through three mechanisms: Section 6902, Section 6904, and Section 6905. Section 6902 payments, based on a statutory formula, make up the majority of PILT payments, with additional payments provided under Section 6904 and Section 6905 in specific circumstances. The PILT program provides annual payments to local governments for tax-exempt federal lands, totaling $9.2 billion through FY2019. Congress considers amending PILT within appropriations and authorizing legislation, including changes to payment calculations and eligibility of federal lands. The report outlines PILT's authorization, appropriations, Section 6902 payments calculation, and issues for Congress to address. The PILT program provides annual payments to local governments for tax-exempt federal lands. Congress has funded PILT through discretionary and mandatory appropriations. Concerns have been raised about changes in appropriations sources and the uncertainty that may accompany such changes. Congress amended the language in 2008, changing the section title from \"Authorization of Appropriations\" to \"Funding.\" Since 2008, Congress changed PILT funding from discretionary to mandatory for fiscal years 2008 through 2012. Funding for PILT has been provided through both discretionary and mandatory appropriations since FY2008. Congress has amended Section 6906 multiple times to adjust the fiscal year for funding. Since FY2008, Congress has funded PILT through both discretionary and mandatory appropriations. Funding for PILT has been provided through annual appropriations since FY2015, with specific funding levels allocated in some years. In FY2018, FY2019, and FY2020, funding for PILT was treated as mandatory spending and provided at the full statutory calculation levels. Congress has provided funding for PILT through both one-year and multiyear appropriations, resulting in full or partial funding in different years. This variability may impact counties relying on PILT funding in their annual budgets. In addition to funding, Congress also provides guidance on PILT within the annual appropriations process, including minimum payment thresholds and provisions for prorating payments when appropriations fall short of authorized amounts. This disparity between authorized and appropriated amounts is shown in Figure 1. Section 6902 payments under PILT are provided to counties and other jurisdictions to compensate for entitlement lands within their boundaries. In FY2019, almost all PILT payments were made through Section 6902, with more counties eligible for these payments compared to other sections. Out of 1,931 counties receiving PILT payments, 1,927 received payments under Section 6902. In FY2019, 1,927 counties received payments under Section 6902 of the PILT statute for entitlement lands, including federal lands like those in the National Park System, National Forest System, Bureau of Land Management, National Wildlife Refuge System, and others. The Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture manage various types of federal lands, including those in the National Park System, National Forest System, and lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management. Other categories of lands are tied to specific laws or actions, such as those acquired under the Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act. Entitlement lands within the National Wildlife Refuge System are only those withdrawn from the public domain, excluding purchased additions. The Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture manage various federal lands, including those in the National Park System, National Forest System, and lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management. Entitlement lands in the National Wildlife Refuge System are withdrawn from the public domain. Section 6902 payments for PILT are calculated based on factors like entitlement acres, per-acre rates, population-based maximum payment, and available funds. Data from federal agencies and states is collected to determine PILT payments for counties. The county collects data from federal agencies and the state to determine Section 6902 payments for PILT. This involves calculating entitlement acres and population-based ceilings using population data from the U.S. Census Bureau. County population data from the U.S. Census Bureau is used to calculate Section 6902 payments for PILT. Counties with populations smaller than 5,000 use their actual population, while larger counties round to the nearest 1,000. Counties over 50,000 are considered to have a population of 50,000. Payment rates generally decrease as population increases, but the population-based ceiling may increase. In FY2019, payment rates remained the same for certain population sizes despite increases in population. In FY2019, payment rates for counties with populations of 26,000, 27,000, and 28,000 remained the same at $94.98. However, payment ceilings do not always increase with population size. For example, counties with 50,000 population had a lower ceiling than those with 49,000. Payment rates are adjusted annually for inflation based on the Consumer Price Index. The payment rates ranged from $186.56 per person for counties with populations of 5,000 or fewer to $74.63 per person for counties with populations of 50,000 or greater. Alternative A has a higher per-acre payment rate than Alternative B. Alternative A has a higher per-acre payment rate than Alternative B, but is subject to a deduction for prior-year payments from federal payment programs listed in various statutes. The Taylor Grazing Act of June 28, 1934 established the PILT payments. Alternative A has a higher per-acre payment rate but deducts prior-year payments, while Alternative B uses a lower rate without deductions. The per-acre payment rates for FY2019 were $2.77 for Alternative A and $0.39 for Alternative B. The population-based ceiling may replace the calculated amount if it exceeds the per-acre payment. The Section 6902 authorized payment for the county is determined by the greater of the two alternatives. The Section 6902 authorized payments are calculated for every county and added to Sections 6904 and 6905 payments to determine the full statutory calculation for a fiscal year. DOI compares this with available funding to decide on adequate PILT payments. Counties receive either their full authorized amount or a prorated payment based on available funding. The proration for PILT payments is determined by the ratio of appropriated funding to the full statutory calculation. Counties may receive less than their authorized payment if funding is insufficient, even if total appropriations match the calculation. This can happen when part of the appropriated amount is used for purposes other than county payments, such as administrative expenses. In FY2019, Section 6904 and Section 6905 payments accounted for 0.15% of total PILT payments, totaling $750,605 out of $514.7 million. These payments are distributed to counties for property taxes lost due to federal ownership of entitled lands, with funds allocated to governmental units and school districts for any governmental purpose. Section 6904 specifically authorizes payments to counties with lands in the National Park System and National Forest Wilderness Areas. Section 6904 and Section 6905 authorize payments to counties for property taxes lost due to federal ownership of entitled lands in Wilderness Areas and specific national parks. Payments are calculated as 1% of the land's fair market value at acquisition, not exceeding the previous year's property taxes, and are made annually for five years. Section 6905 allows payments for lands in Redwood National Park and Lake Tahoe Basin acquired by the U.S. government. Payments in the Lake Tahoe Basin under the Act of December 23, 1980 are made at a rate of 1% of the fair market value of the acquired land or the previous year's property taxes, whichever is lesser. These payments continue for five years or until they total 5% of the land's value. PILT is a topic of interest for Congress and stakeholders, especially county governments who rely on these payments for their annual budgets. Questions surrounding PILT funding, entitlement lands, and payment levels are regularly addressed by Congress. Congress annually addresses questions of how funding should be provided to PILT, which has been funded through both mandatory and discretionary appropriations. While PILT has consistently received funding, the appropriations process has created uncertainty among stakeholders about the level of annual funding. Stakeholders have advocated for greater certainty in funding guarantee and amount. Members of Congress may have different views on discretionary versus mandatory spending compared to counties receiving PILT payments. Several bills have been introduced in Congress to amend how PILT is funded, including legislation in the 116th Congress that would require mandatory funding for PILT for a set period of time or indefinitely. The question of which lands should be eligible for PILT payments is also of interest, as entitlement lands are restricted to specific federal land types. However, this definition does not fully encompass all federal lands or account for those exempt from state and local taxes. Some Members of Congress have considered amending the definition of entitlement lands under PILT to include various types of federal lands, which could have implications for counties that rely on PILT payments for revenue. Amending the definition of entitlement lands under PILT could increase payments for states with added lands, affecting how Congress funds PILT. The authorized payment level under Section 6902, largely unchanged since 1994, adjusts for inflation, resulting in increasing payment rates. Congress regularly reviews the formula for calculating PILT payments. In the 116th Congress, bills have been introduced to adjust the payment structure for counties with a population of less than 5,000 under PILT. This could impact how population or area is factored into PILT payments, raising questions about equitable distribution. PILT is important to many counties and state entities, and Congress may need to address various issues related to the program's place among federal compensation programs for tax-exempt lands."
