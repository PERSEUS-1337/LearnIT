President Bush planned to visit five African countries to review progress in fighting diseases. He called on Congress to double U.S. international funding for AIDS to $30 billion over five years. In 2008, President Bush called on Congress to double U.S. international funding for AIDS to $30 billion over five years. Sub-Saharan Africa has been severely affected by HIV/AIDS. The Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS reported in 2007 that there were between 20.9 million and 24.3 million HIV-positive adults and children globally. In 2007, Africa had between 20.9 million and 24.3 million HIV-positive individuals, with 1.7 million newly infected. About 1.6 million adults and children died of AIDS in 2007, making up 76% of global AIDS deaths. Since 1982, an estimated 30 million Africans have died of AIDS, and UNAIDS projects that 55 million Africans may die from AIDS between 2000 and 2020. The HIV/AIDS prevalence in Africa is high, with a rate of infection of 6.1% in late 2005, dropping to 5% by 2007. The epidemic has stabilized or declined moderately in recent years, with the total adult and infected populations increasing. HIV has become endemic in many countries, affecting several future generations. HIV has become endemic in many countries, affecting future generations. Declines in prevalence have been seen in Kenya, Zimbabwe, and some urban areas. Southern Africa has seen increases in prevalence, except for Zimbabwe and Angola. Recent data suggests that the epidemic has reached a plateau in many countries, with declines in new infections attributed to various factors such as behavioral changes and increased access to testing and drug therapy. In Southern Africa, HIV prevalence remains high, with some countries experiencing increases. Nigeria has the largest number of infected individuals in Africa after South Africa. The spread of HIV is primarily through heterosexual contact, but unsafe medical practices may also play a role. Prevention efforts include both sexual and medical transmission strategies under PEPFAR. In Africa, women make up a significant portion of HIV-positive individuals, with young women being particularly at risk. The AIDS epidemic in Africa has a greater impact on children, with over 600,000 African infants getting infected yearly through mother-to-child transmission. In Africa, millions of children are affected by AIDS, with many contracting the disease through maternal transmission. Despite a slight decrease in the number of HIV-positive children, the majority of affected children do not receive basic support services. The number of AIDS orphans in Africa is large but appears to be slightly decreasing, with an estimated 11.4 million orphans in 2007. The number of AIDS orphans in Africa is decreasing, with an estimated 11.4 million orphans in 2007. HIV-positive orphans face risks of malnourishment, abuse, and lack of education due to social stigma. UNICEF recommends strengthening family and community support, providing protection services for orphans, and increasing public education about HIV-affected children. Human Rights Watch reported that African governments have not adequately addressed barriers to education for AIDS-affected orphans. The Assistance for Orphans and Other Vulnerable Children in Developing Countries Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-95) authorizes U.S. assistance for basic care for orphans and vulnerable children in developing countries, including education, employment training, and AIDS care. Africa's AIDS epidemic is attributed to poverty, lack of health systems, and high rates of untreated sexually-transmitted infections. Africans suffer from high rates of untreated sexually-transmitted infections, increasing susceptibility to HIV due to limited capabilities in health systems. Poverty forces many African men to migrate for work, leading to multiple sex partners and increased risk of infection. Women and girls are disproportionately affected by AIDS in Africa, with migrant workers and long-distance drivers playing a role in the spread of HIV. According to UNAIDS officials and publications, older men contracting HIV with young girls is a significant factor contributing to higher infection rates among young women in Africa. Many young women lack comprehensive knowledge of HIV transmission, and believe that respecting women's rights and empowering them politically and socio-economically could lower infection rates. Domestic violence targeting women in some African countries has also made them more vulnerable to HIV. Violence against women in African countries increases their vulnerability to HIV by limiting their ability to negotiate condom use. Policy advocates suggest supporting fidelity campaigns for African men. Women in Africa often lack property rights, leading to the risk of losing their homes or property when their spouses die from AIDS. The HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa is causing severe social and economic consequences, with a projected demographic catastrophe in the hardest-hit countries. The HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa is projected to have severe social and economic consequences, with up to a quarter of populations being killed. This will lead to increased poverty, political instability, and a significant impact on national productivity and earnings. Labor productivity will decrease, education benefits will be lost, and resources for investments will be redirected. The HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa is projected to have severe social and economic consequences, with up to a quarter of populations being killed. This will lead to increased poverty, political instability, and a significant impact on national productivity and earnings. Labor productivity will decrease, education benefits will be lost, and resources for investments will be redirected. The most severely affected countries are experiencing sharp drops in life expectancy, reversing major gains achieved in recent decades. Studies show that AIDS has devastating effects on rural families, leading to rapid impoverishment. The HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa is projected to have severe social and economic consequences, with up to a quarter of populations being killed. This will lead to increased poverty, political instability, and a significant impact on national productivity and earnings. Labor productivity will decrease, education benefits will be lost, and resources for investments will be redirected. Studies show that AIDS has devastating effects on rural families, leading to rapid impoverishment. In 2001, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization reported that AIDS had killed about 7 million agricultural workers in 25 hard-hit countries in Africa and would likely cause 16 million more to die by 2020. Labor force losses of between 10% to 26% were forecast in 10 of the most affected countries. Some experts attribute serious food shortages in southern Africa in 2002 and 2003 to AIDS-related production losses. In a statement to the Committee and the House International Relations Committee, WFP Executive Director James Morris highlighted AIDS as a central cause of famine in southern Africa, leading to a \"death spiral\" due to the pandemic's impact on human capacity and rural areas. The FAO supports programs to address the threats AIDS poses to agriculture and food security, including shortages of skilled workers and teachers. UNAIDS Executive Director Dr. Peter Piot warned of the devastating effects of AIDS on African countries, with significant losses in skilled personnel and lives at various levels of management. A special U.N. General Assembly meeting on AIDS in June 2005 projected that 11 African countries would lose 10% of their workforce to the disease by 2006. Reports show high HIV infection rates among teachers in Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, and South Africa. AIDS poses security threats in Africa, affecting military and peacekeeping operations. South Africa has an estimated infection rate of 23%, with higher rates in KwaZulu-Natal province. Some Southern African militaries are addressing the increase in AIDS infections. Efforts to combat the epidemic include prevention programs and treatment with antiretroviral drugs, although access to treatment remains limited in Africa. The Bush Administration advocates expanding prevention programs focusing on abstinence until marriage and marital faithfulness to slow the spread of HIV in Africa. Critics argue that these approaches may be unrealistic in impoverished and poorly educated social environments, especially for poor married women who lack power to refuse sexual demands or control their spouses' activities due to prevalent polygamous marriages. First Lady Laura Bush defended abstinence as an effective method in fighting sexually transmitted diseases, especially in African countries where girls may feel pressured to comply with men's wishes. Donor-sponsored voluntary counseling and testing programs help African men and women learn their HIV status, with HIV tests becoming routine in Botswana. AIDS awareness programs are present in African schools and workplaces to reduce infection rates among employees. Several projects aim to reduce infection rates among employees by providing condoms and instruction in condom use. Success has been seen in reducing mother-to-child transmission by administering AZT or Nevirapine before and during birth. Controversy surrounds Nevirapine, with allegations of reporting flaws in a study conducted in Uganda under NIH sponsorship. The South Africa's ruling Africa National Congress accused top U.S. officials of promoting Nevirapine sales in Africa through lies. The controversy surrounding Nevirapine in Africa was addressed by NIH, stating it is safe and effective for preventing mother-to-child HIV transmission. Despite concerns, a National Academies' Institute of Medicine assessment validated the drug's use. Church groups and humanitarian organizations have supported Africa in AIDS care and education programs for orphans. Public-private partnerships, including support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, have been crucial in responding to the African AIDS pandemic. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, along with other organizations like the Rockefeller Foundation, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck and Company, Pfizer, and Roche, have been actively involved in supporting AIDS research and programs in Africa. These partnerships aim to improve AIDS care, health infrastructure, and provide treatment to those in need. Pfizer, for example, funds Uganda's AIDS Support Organization and trains AIDS specialists annually. Roche plans to help African firms produce generic versions of its WHO-endorsed ARV, Saquinavir. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria commits grant funds to Africa and worldwide for fighting AIDS. UNAIDS reports significant funding gaps in HIV/AIDS fight, with $14.9 billion needed in 2006 but only $8.9 billion likely to be provided. The funding gap is projected to increase in the future. African leaders' lack of engagement has been criticized for slowing the spread of AIDS in Africa, with President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa facing particular criticism. In March 2001, President Mbeki of South Africa rejected calls to declare AIDS a national emergency. Despite increasing pressure, the government only tripled the AIDS budget in April 2002. The South African Treatment Action Campaign launched civil disobedience when an ARV drug program was not implemented by March 2003. The government finally started offering treatment at five hospitals in Gauteng in April 2004 after facing threats of a lawsuit from TAC. In 2004, the South African government began offering ARV treatment at five hospitals in Gauteng province. By December 2005, 112,000 patients were enrolled in ARV therapy. Estimates vary on the total number of patients in treatment and the proportion under public and private care. In May 2006, UNAIDS reported that about 190,000 South Africans were receiving ARV treatment, but over 80% of those in need were not receiving it in 2005. The delays in South Africa's response to the pandemic have been costly, with rising HIV infection rates among pregnant women. In 2004, about 29.5% of pregnant women were HIV positive, up from 27.9% in 2003. The Health Department estimated 5.6 million HIV-positive South Africans in 2004. A report predicted AIDS-related deaths exceeding 500,000 yearly from 2007 to 2011. However, a November 2005 data release suggested the epidemic may be \"leveling off.\" Some critics accuse government leaders of being \"AIDS denialists\" and hindering access to ARVs. South Africa's Health Minister questions ARV effectiveness and promotes alternative remedies like raw garlic. Nelson Mandela announced his son's death from AIDS to combat stigma. Other African heads of state are actively fighting the epidemic through regional initiatives. In August 2003, the Southern African Development Community (SADC) launched an AIDS strategic framework with a regional fund. NEPAD, in collaboration with the African Union and UNAIDS, has developed strategies to combat AIDS. Uganda's president, Yoweri Museveni, led a successful prevention campaign with the ABC program. Dr. Anne Peterson testified about Uganda's success in fighting AIDS at a Senate hearing in May 2003. Sophia Mukasa Monico, a member of the Global Health Council, testified about the prevention efforts in Uganda, highlighting successes in promoting abstinence, faithfulness, and increased condom use. A study in Rakai District attributed HIV prevalence decline to condom use and deaths of infected individuals, raising questions about the effectiveness of behavior change programs. In July 2005, First Lady Laura Bush praised Uganda's ABC model for AIDS prevention, emphasizing abstinence, faithfulness, and condom use. Reports of a condom shortage in Uganda sparked controversy, with blame placed on U.S.-funded abstinence programs. Access to antiretroviral drugs for the poor remains a contentious issue in Africa's AIDS epidemic. Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) is a key treatment for Africa's AIDS epidemic, with Highly Active ART (HAART) using three or more ARVs to halt HIV replication. ARVs have been effective in developed countries, reducing AIDS-related deaths. However, the high cost of ARVs has hindered access in Africa, where most patients are poor. Despite the initial high costs, ART expenses have decreased significantly in recent years. In recent years, ART costs have dropped significantly, with major pharmaceutical companies negotiating price reductions for AIDS drugs in Africa. UNAIDS and pharmaceutical firms collaborated to improve treatment access, leading to agreements in 10 African countries to lower prices in exchange for health infrastructure improvements. Initiatives to expand ARV availability were supported by the Global Fund and PEPFAR programs. The WHO launched the \"3 by 5\" campaign in 2003 to treat 3 million AIDS patients in poor countries by 2005, with funding from the Global Fund and donors. Leaders of the G8 pledged support for HIV initiatives in July 2005. In July 2005, G8 leaders promised universal access to HIV treatment by 2010. Former President Bill Clinton's foundation initiated a program to provide affordable ARV treatment in Africa and the Caribbean. The program expanded to over 100 developing countries with support from UNICEF, the World Bank, and the Global Fund. Clinton Foundation also launched a pediatric AIDS program to double the number of children on ARV therapy. Former President Bill Clinton's foundation, the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), negotiated agreements in 2006 to lower prices of HIV tests and antiretroviral drugs for 50 developing countries. CHAI helps implement care, treatment, and prevention programs, with partner governments leading the efforts. UNAIDS reported in 2006 that 810,000 Africans were receiving ART, up from 500,000 in June 2005. In late 2005, UNAIDS reported that ART coverage levels in Africa varied, with some countries achieving 45% or greater coverage while others had rates below 10%. Access to ART in rural areas was poorer than in urban areas, despite efforts to expand treatment and care. African countries face challenges in effectively utilizing increased treatment funding for AIDS drugs. Concerns include the ability of supply channels to consistently provide medications, lack of monitoring by medical personnel, and the emergence of drug-resistant HIV strains due to irregular drug intake. Despite these challenges, many African patients adhere to their therapy regimens. The development of once-daily combined ARV tablets is seen as a potential solution to improve access and adherence to treatment. The multinational drug firms Gilead and Bristol-Myers Squibb developed a once-daily combined ARV tablet to improve access and adherence to treatment in impoverished settings. Challenges in scaling up treatment in Africa include administrative inefficiencies, donor limitations, and a \"brain drain\" of health personnel. The health minister of Mozambique mentioned in 2004 that the country faced shortages of staff and equipment hindering the launch of a nationwide ARV drug treatment program. Africa has the lowest ratio of health workers to population, with critical shortages of doctors, nurses, and midwives in many countries. AIDS activists advocate for compulsory licenses to address the healthcare workforce crisis. AIDS activists push for compulsory licenses in African countries to allow affordable generic AIDS drugs. The WTO's Doha declaration supports access to medicines by permitting compulsory licenses and giving least-developed countries until 2016 to implement TRIPS. Some critics argue that the declaration falls short by not allowing imports of generics. In August 2003, the WTO agreed to allow poor countries to import generic copies of essential drugs, but the debate over access to ARVs in Africa continues. This agreement was ratified in December 2005. In March 2005, India passed patent legislation expected to raise prices for Indian-manufactured generic copies of newly discovered AIDS medications. The response to AIDS in Africa has shown some successes, with Uganda experiencing a significant decrease in infection rates among pregnant women. However, overall prevalence rates in most African countries have remained stable, with some changes in sexual behavior patterns among young urbanites. Despite some progress, the number of HIV-positive individuals in Africa continues to rise due to population growth, increasing from 21.6 million in 2003 to 22.5 million in 2007. The number of HIV-positive persons in Africa increased from 21.6 million in 2003 to 22.5 million in 2007. Experts highlight social barriers to an effective AIDS response, including cultural norms hindering discussions on sexual matters. Advocacy for AIDS awareness, public education, and outreach efforts is crucial. Identifying and treating opportunistic infections like tuberculosis could significantly prolong and improve the lives of HIV patients in Africa. Africans with dual HIV-TB infections often delay seeking treatment or fail to complete drug regimens, leading to high death rates. UNAIDS and WHO recommend cotrimoxazole for HIV-infected individuals to prevent opportunistic infections. Pfizer donates Diflucan to treat AIDS-related infections in 18 African countries through the Diflucan Partnership Program. The Pfizer Diflucan Partnership Program (DPP) is a public-private effort in collaboration with health ministries, local clinics, and non-governmental organizations to provide aid in response to AIDS in Africa. Resources and information on AIDS can be found at various websites including CDC, Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis & Malaria, and UNAIDS. U.S. concern over AIDS in Africa began in the 1980s. In 1987, Congress allocated funds to fight AIDS globally, recognizing its potential to undermine development efforts in Africa. Despite initial criticisms of the U.S. response to the epidemic, there was a growing consensus for increased action. In 1999, the Clinton Administration proposed an additional $100 million for global AIDS initiatives. In 1999, the Clinton Administration proposed $100 million for a global LIFE AIDS initiative, focusing on Africa. Funds approved in FY2000 supported the initiative, engaging HHS, DoL, DoD, and USAID in the fight against HIV/AIDS. Peace Corps volunteers in Africa were trained as AIDS educators. USAID claimed leadership in the international AIDS response since 1986, sponsoring education programs. USAID sponsored AIDS education programs, trained educators and clinicians, supported condom distribution, and conducted AIDS research in Africa. They claimed successes in reducing HIV prevalence among young Ugandans, preventing outbreaks in Senegal, reducing sexually transmitted infections, increasing condom availability in Kenya, assisting AIDS orphans, and developing new technologies like the female condom. The Bush Administration made significant pledges to combat the AIDS pandemic in Africa, including $200 million to the Global Fund and a $500 million International Mother and Child HIV Prevention Initiative. In January 2003, President Bush announced the $15 billion President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) to combat AIDS in Africa. He pledged $10 billion in new funding and made AIDS a focus during a trip to Africa in July 2003. Secretary of State Colin Powell addressed the U.N. General Assembly on AIDS in September 2003. Colin Powell emphasized the severity of the AIDS epidemic at a U.N. session, stating it was more devastating than any terrorist attack. The U.S. pledged to lead efforts in combating the epidemic through the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), authorized in 2003. PEPFAR has led to increased funding for HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and treatment in 15 focus countries, primarily in Africa. The Global HIV/AIDS Initiative (GHAI) manages PEPFAR funds and is overseen by a U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator. The Global AIDS Coordinator position is filled by permanent incumbents nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. Ambassador Mark Dybul currently holds this position. PEPFAR, initiated in 2003, aims to prevent new infections, provide ARV drugs, and care for infected individuals, including orphans. The State Department issued a report in February 2004 detailing PEPFAR implementation and proposed public-private partnership treatment programs. Annual reports to Congress describe PEPFAR program policy and administration. The Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator (OGAC) at the State Department administers the majority of U.S. AIDS assistance to Africa through PEPFAR. PEPFAR was enacted to simplify the international AIDS budget, enhance transparency, and emphasize the President's commitment to fighting AIDS. Prior to PEPFAR, HIV/AIDS assistance to Africa was primarily through USAID and the Global AIDS Program (GAP) of the CDC. USAID mainly spends on AIDS in Africa through the Child Survival and Health Programs Fund, with some funds from other accounts like the Economic Support Fund, Peace Corps, and Migration and Refugee programs. The Department of Defense has an HIV/AIDS Prevention Program focused on African armed forces, funded by Congress in FY2006. The program was not requested funding in FY2007. Foreign Military Financing funds also support this initiative. The Department of Labor previously supported AIDS education in African workplaces but was not funded in FY2006 or requested in FY2007. Additional U.S. funds for AIDS programs in Africa come indirectly through the United Nations, World Bank, and Global Fund. The response to the AIDS pandemic in Africa by the United States and other donors is a subject of intense debate, with criticism from U.N. Special Envoy Stephen Lewis and activist groups. Singer Bono had a disagreement with President Bush over funding levels. Some argue that Africa's capacity to absorb increased funding is limited and health infrastructure needs to be expanded first. Despite criticism, many praise the President's initiatives, especially the significant funding levels. Some critics initially felt PEPFAR was slow to start and too unilateral, urging closer cooperation with other countries and donors like the Global Fund. Questions arose about whether PEPFAR would strengthen African healthcare institutions or primarily benefit U.S.-based organizations. Calls for increased funding, including $1 billion annually for the Global Fund, were made by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan in 2004. Some critics have raised concerns about the emphasis on abstinence programs in PEPFAR, arguing that it has replaced other HIV prevention measures. The United States has been criticized for sending fewer condoms abroad compared to 1990. Some critics have raised concerns about the emphasis on abstinence programs in PEPFAR, arguing that it has replaced other HIV prevention measures. The United States is sending fewer condoms abroad than in 1990. A Government Accountability Office report found that guidance requiring 33% of PEPFAR HIV prevention funds be spent on abstinence and faithfulness-focused programs had led to decreases in funding for other types of HIV prevention efforts. The guidance also created uncertainties among some country field teams about how to implement PEPFAR programs. The first annual report on the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) highlighted the initiative's impact, including 152,000 African patients receiving AIDS treatment and millions reached through mass media campaigns promoting abstinence, faithfulness, and other prevention measures. The report also noted a significant increase in condom shipments to Focus Countries. Additionally, the United States faced criticism for withholding support from an AIDS treatment program in Kenya due to concerns about using generic drugs. The United States faced criticism for withholding support from an AIDS treatment program in Kenya due to concerns about using generic drugs. However, in May 2004, the U.S. FDA announced an expedited process for the approval of Fixed Dose Combinations (FDCs) in PEPFAR-funded programs, which many hailed as a positive step. The FDA announced an expedited process for approving Fixed Dose Combinations (FDCs) in PEPFAR-funded programs, leading to mixed reactions. Critics argued that relying on WHO approval would be more efficient. By June 2005, FDA had cleared seven generic antiretrovirals from South Africa and India. Some African countries preferred WHO approval over FDA for U.S.-funded programs. President's FY2008 budget allocated $3.421 billion to 12 focus countries in Africa under the GHAI account. In August 2000, the Global AIDS and Tuberculosis Relief Act authorized funding for a worldwide HIV/AIDS effort under USAID. In May 2003, the U.S. Leadership Against HIV/AIDS Act allocated $3 billion per year for PEPFAR from FY2004 to FY2008. The U.S. government allocated $15 billion from FY2004 to FY2008 for global AIDS efforts and established the office of the Global AIDS Coordinator at the State Department. Various appropriations measures supported programs to combat the pandemic in Africa, including the Assistance for Orphans and Other Vulnerable Children in Developing Countries Act of 2005. Bills introduced in the 109th Congress addressed the African AIDS pandemic, such as the Mother to Child Plus Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2005. In the 110th Congress, legislation focused on AIDS in Africa included bills such as the African Health Capacity Investment Act of 2007, which aimed to improve healthcare capacity in sub-Saharan Africa through international or nongovernmental organizations. The bills H.R. 1713 and S. 2415 aimed to improve human health care capacity in sub-Saharan Africa by developing a comprehensive global HIV prevention strategy for women and youth, coordinating HIV/AIDS policy with other countries and organizations, and reducing gender disparities in HIV infection rates. During the first session of the 110th Congress, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee held hearings on HIV/AIDS, focusing on global efforts to combat diseases like AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. S.Con.Res. 31 (Feingold) expressed support for increased U.S. engagement in health programs in developing nations to address infectious diseases, improve women's and children's health, reduce malnutrition, prevent unintended pregnancies, fight HIV/AIDS, promote healthy behaviors, and strengthen healthcare capacity. The Subcommittee on Africa and Global Health of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs held a hearing on HIV/AIDS and the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief on October 9, 2007 during the first session of the 110th Congress."
