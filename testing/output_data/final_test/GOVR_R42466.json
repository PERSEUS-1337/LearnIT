    "content": "The annual Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill includes funding for the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) in the Department of the Interior (DOI). For FY2013, the House Committee approved $1.16 billion, a 21.5% decrease from the previous year. The President had requested $1.55 billion, an increase of 4.9% over FY2012. The committee's proposed changes ranged from elimination to a 6% decrease in various accounts. The House Committee approved $1.16 billion for the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) in the Department of the Interior for FY2013, a 21.5% decrease from the previous year. The committee reserved the option to limit funding for unauthorized programs, resulting in a 50% reduction in some FWS accounts. The largest portion of the FWS annual appropriation is the Resource Management account, with $1.04 billion approved, down 15.1% from FY2012. Funding for programs like Endangered Species and Law Enforcement were included in the Resource Management account. Funding for the endangered species program in the Resource Management account is a contentious issue in the FWS budget. The House committee approved $134.0 million for FY2013, a decrease from the previous year. The Administration had requested $179.7 million. The committee reduced funding for various subaccounts, with Critical Habitat Designation being most affected. Critics argue that FWS should prioritize listing species in need of protection, while others believe listing petitions are essential for species conservation. The committee bill for FY2013 continued specific ceilings on maximum spending for listing species in response to petitions, foreign species, and critical habitat designation. The House committee approved $45.9 million for consultation, a decrease from the previous year. The Administration requested an increase in funding for consultation under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act. Federal agencies are required to consult with FWS on actions affecting listed species. The committee sought a biological opinion from FWS on potential jeopardy to listed species, including the northern spotted owl. Funding for consultations was reduced, but FWS was directed to ensure timely Biological Opinions for the owl and provide assistance to land management agencies. The House committee approved $14.1 million for the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund (CESCF), a 55.9% decrease from FY2012. The Administration requested $60.0 million, up 25.8%, to assist states with Habitat Conservation Plans (HCPs) for listed species. The House committee approved a 55.9% decrease in funding for the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund (CESCF) compared to FY2012 levels. Habitat Conservation Plans (HCPs) are developed for non-federal actions by various entities to obtain an Incidental Take Permit for actions affecting listed species. States can use funds to coordinate HCPs, develop umbrella plans, or acquire land for mitigation. Despite the expiration of Section 15 of the ESA in FY1992, agencies still have authority to enforce prohibitions within the act. The expiration of a provision authorizing appropriations does not end the statutory obligations created by that law, as stated in Section 11(g) of the Endangered Species Act. The U.S. Supreme Court allows citizens to commence civil suits on specified provisions of the act, even if funds have not been appropriated. The House committee approved $437.4 million for the National Wildlife Refuge System, down 9.9% from FY2012, while the President requested $494.8 million, up 1.9%. Costs of operations have increased on many refuges due to various factors, leading to cuts in funding for programs on refuge lands. The FY2009 economic stimulus law provided additional funding for the National Wildlife Refuge System to address staffing and restoration needs. One response to reduced funding has been the consolidation of refuges under a single manager, which has faced resistance from supporters concerned about resource loss. Law Enforcement is part of the Subaccount for Migratory Birds, Law Enforcement, and International Affairs, covering activities such as wildlife inspections and investigations of violations. The House committee approved $54.7 million for endangered species and waterfowl hunting laws, a 15.2% decrease from FY2012. The Administration requested $63.9 million, a 2.8% increase. The committee provided $127.2 million, a 6.0% decrease from FY2012, with funding for National Fish Hatchery Operations at $46.1 million. The Administration's FY2013 request was $131.6 million, down 2.7%. The committee rejected proposals to reduce funding for hatcheries. The House committee provided $3.0 million for a program supporting climate change research and mitigation efforts, a significant decrease from previous funding levels. The program works with federal, state, tribal, and local partners to address wildlife impacts and habitat changes due to climate change through Landscape Conservation Cooperatives. The House committee allocated $3.0 million for a climate change program, a substantial decrease from previous funding levels. The Administration requested $33.1 million, while the committee proposed $15.0 million for land acquisition from the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), down 72.5% from the previous year. The committee recommended no new funding for general land acquisition within the program. The House committee proposed no new funding for general land acquisition, allocating $4.0 million for the Highlands Conservation Act instead. The Migratory Bird Conservation Account provides mandatory funding for FWS land acquisition, sourced from the sale of duck stamps and import duties. For FY2013, available funds for FWS land acquisition are estimated at $61.0 million, with a proposed increase in duck stamp prices. The National Wildlife Refuge Fund compensates counties for federal lands under FWS jurisdiction, funded by receipts from activities on the National Wildlife Refuge System. The committee approved $12.0 million for the National Wildlife Refuge Fund, which would provide counties with 22.8% of the authorized level. The Administration did not request funding for NWRF in FY2013, which would result in counties receiving only 6.6% of the authorized level. FWS plays a role in conserving species across international boundaries, including migratory birds and other selected species of international interest through programs like the Multinational Species Conservation Fund. The Multinational Species Conservation Fund (MSCF) and Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Fund faced reductions in funding by 50% relative to FY2012. The MSCF benefits various endangered species like elephants, tigers, and marine turtles. The Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Fund supports bird conservation projects between North and South America. The State and Tribal Wildlife Grants help fund conservation efforts. State and Tribal Wildlife Grants, established in the FY2001 Interior appropriations law, provide funding for conservation projects for species of concern to states, territories, and tribes. The program offers formula grants to states and territories for conservation plans and projects, as well as competitive grants to tribal governments and states with no specific matching requirements. This grant program has garnered significant support from state and tribal governments. The House committee reduced funding for the Coastal Impact Assistance Program by 50.0% and increased the state's minimum share to 50%. The President requested $61.3 million for these grants, with no change from the previous year. The program focuses on assisting states and local governments with the impacts of offshore development on coastal ecosystems. The Coastal Impact Assistance Program (CIAP) assists states and local governments with impacts of offshore development on coastal ecosystems. Eligible states include Alabama, Alaska, California, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. The program had a mandatory spending authority of $250 million annually from FY2007 to FY2010, resulting in a total of $1 billion over four years. Approximately $565 million remains unobligated, with a proposal to cancel $200 million. The House committee has not taken action on this proposal. The Coastal Impact Assistance Program was initially administered by the Minerals Management Service and later by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation, and Enforcement (BOEMRE) before being transferred to FWS in FY2012. Despite a proposed cancellation of $200 million, the program will continue using the remaining unobligated balance of $365 million for oversight, monitoring, and other functions. The program has mandatory spending authority for the remaining balance, so no additional language is needed in the annual appropriation bill. Additionally, H.R. 6091 included administrative provisions affecting FWS, such as provisions related to gray wolves and captive-bred species. On October 5, 2011, FWS proposed a rule to remove gray wolves in Wyoming from the endangered species list. The rule would allow regulated hunting of wolves in certain zones and end their protection under ESA. Approval from the Wyoming legislature is required for the rule to be finalized. The proposed rule to remove gray wolves in Wyoming from the endangered species list is pending approval from the legislature. The rule assumes certain management practices for wolves on federal lands and is currently under review by FWS. The House committee included a section requiring the Secretary of the Interior to issue a final rule before a specified deadline. Without an approved wolf management plan and legislative approval, wolf management in Wyoming may fall short of recovery goals. Enactment of \u00a71713 was significant as legislation to delist species had rarely been proposed successfully in the past. An amendment to delete this section was defeated in the committee. The House committee approved a section to direct the Secretary of the Interior to reissue a final rule without judicial review, affecting U.S. captive-bred scimitar-horned oryx and addax. The 2005 rule allowed hunting and other activities for endangered North African game species like scimitar-horned oryx, addax, and dama gazelle, which were rare or extinct in their native habitat due to hunting, conflict, and habitat loss. The rule was challenged for violating the ESA by granting a broad exception to all game farms instead of issuing permits on a case by case basis. The 2005 rule allowed hunting of endangered North African game species like scimitar-horned oryx, addax, and dama gazelle. FWS removed the exclusion, requiring permits for hunting or transporting these species. The House committee's bill directs no funds be used to prohibit hunting, fishing, or recreational shooting on Federal land if not prohibited before January 1, 2012. The cited provision in the U.S. Code applies to lands managed by the Forest Service and BLM, allowing closure for hunting, fishing, or recreational shooting for up to 30 days for special events or public safety, extendable for 90 days for weather conditions. Clarification is needed on which lands are covered by this provision. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) and International Species Conservation Funds are discussed in CRS reports.
