    "content": "The Act titled \"Military Reserve Mobilization Income Security Act of 2004\" introduces a refundable credit for activated military reservists under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. This credit pertains to wage differentials for activated reservists. The \"Military Reserve Mobilization Income Security Act of 2004\" introduces a credit for qualified reservists against taxes, based on their active duty wage differentials. The credit is calculated by multiplying the daily wage differential by the number of days the reservist participates in qualified reserve duty during the taxable year. The \"Military Reserve Mobilization Income Security Act of 2004\" provides a tax credit for qualified reservists based on their daily wage differential during qualified reserve duty. Average daily qualified compensation is calculated by dividing the reservist's one-year qualified compensation by 365. The term 'qualified compensation' for reservists refers to contingent income for work, not including vacation or sick leave pay. 'Average daily military pay and allowances' is the daily wage differential during reserve duty. The term 'military pay and allowances' for qualified reservists is the amount paid during the taxable year for participation in reserve duty, divided by the total days of duty, including travel time. Military pay is defined in section 101(21) of title 37, United States Code. The term 'allowances' refers to payments to Armed Forces members under chapter 7 of title 37, United States Code. 'Qualified reserve component duty' includes active duty for contingency operations or full-time National Guard duty ordered by the President for over 90 consecutive days. Qualified reservists are individuals engaged in normal employment and are members of the National Guard or Ready Reserve. Normal employment duties include self-employment. No credit is allowed for qualified reservists called to active duty for training under title 10, United States Code. The text discusses the inclusion of training activities for National Guard members in the United States Code and the amendment of certain sections related to tax credits. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2003."
