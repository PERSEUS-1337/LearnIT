The program's objectives include developing these technologies by 2012 to surpass traditional incandescent and fluorescent lighting. The Next Generation Lighting Initiative, led by the Secretary of Energy, aims to develop advanced solid-state lighting technologies using white LEDs that are longer lasting, more energy-efficient, and cost-competitive compared to traditional lighting technologies. The goal is to create an inorganic white LED with 160 lumens per watt efficiency and a 10-year lifetime, and an organic white LED with 100 lumens per watt efficiency and a 5-year lifetime that illuminates a full color spectrum, covers large areas over flexible surfaces, and does not contain harmful pollutants like mercury found in fluorescent lamps. The Next Generation Lighting Initiative, led by the Secretary of Energy, aims to develop advanced solid-state lighting technologies using white LEDs. The initiative involves private consortiums selected through a competitive process to conduct fundamental research activities. Each consortium must submit a program plan and be structured as a joint venture. The Secretary serves on the governing council, and applicants must represent U.S. solid-state lighting research and development to be eligible for grants. The Secretary awards grants for fundamental research to a consortium, which can then distribute funds to researchers. The consortium must submit a research description and list of recipients to receive funding. National Laboratories can also participate in the research and receive funds from the consortium. The consortium and the Federal Government have royalty-free nonexclusive rights to use intellectual property from research funded under this subsection. The Secretary awards development, demonstration, and commercial application activities through awards to private firms, trade associations, and institutions of higher education, with preference given to consortium members. The consortium formulates an annual operating plan including research priorities, technical milestones, and technology transfer plans. The Secretary shall conduct periodic reviews of the Initiative with the National Academy of Sciences to evaluate research priorities, technical milestones, and technology transfer plans. Results of the reviews will be considered in evaluating submitted plans. An independent auditor will perform an audit of the consortium. The Secretary will conduct reviews with the National Academy of Sciences to evaluate research priorities, technical milestones, and technology transfer plans. An independent auditor will annually report audit results to the Secretary and Congress for research and development programs under this section. Non-Federal sources must commit to cost-sharing for these programs. The Secretary may reduce or waive the non-Federal cost requirement for research and development projects if they are deemed basic or fundamental. For demonstration or commercial application projects, at least 50 percent of costs must come from non-Federal sources, with the possibility of reduction by the Secretary. The Secretary may reduce or waive non-Federal cost requirements for research and development projects deemed basic or fundamental. The non-Federal commitment amount may include personnel, services, equipment, and resources. Authorization of appropriations includes $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2004 and $50,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2005 to 2013. The Initiative must be terminated by September 30, 2013."
