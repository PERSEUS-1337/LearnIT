    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 21455.5 of the Vehicle Code is amended to allow for automated traffic enforcement systems at intersections, with specific requirements for signage to notify drivers. Automated traffic enforcement systems at intersections must meet specified criteria and be operated by a governmental agency in cooperation with law enforcement. Prior to issuing citations, a warning notice program must be implemented for 30 days, with a public announcement made at least 30 days before enforcement begins. Establish guidelines for screening, issuing violations, and handling confidential information for automated traffic enforcement systems. Administrative tasks include selecting locations based on safety needs, regular equipment inspections, and ensuring proper installation and calibration. The activities related to overseeing the operation of automated traffic enforcement systems include certifying proper installation, inspecting warning signs, managing signal phases, and controlling citation delivery. These activities can be outsourced by the government agency, except for specific tasks that must be maintained in-house. The printed representation of computer-generated information, video, or photographic images from automated traffic enforcement systems is not considered hearsay. Photographic records from these systems are confidential and can only be accessed by governmental and law enforcement agencies for specific purposes. Confidential information from the Department of Motor Vehicles for enforcing traffic laws must also be kept confidential. The confidential records and information from automated traffic enforcement systems can be retained for up to six months or until the citation is resolved, after which they must be destroyed. The registered owner or identified driver can review the photographic evidence of the violation. A contract between a governmental agency and a manufacturer or supplier of automated traffic enforcement equipment cannot include provisions for payment based on the number of citations or revenue generated. This restriction does not apply to contracts made before January 1, 2004, unless renewed, extended, or amended after that date. Governmental agencies installing such systems must not prioritize revenue generation beyond covering operational costs. A manufacturer or supplier operating an automated traffic enforcement system must submit an annual report to the Judicial Council, including the number of violations captured, citations issued, types of violations, dismissal rates, and pre/post-installation collision data at each intersection. Starting January 1, 2016, governmental agencies are prohibited from installing automated traffic enforcement systems. Agencies already using these systems must conduct a traffic safety study at each intersection by February 28, 2016, to determine if the system has reduced traffic accidents significantly. If signs meeting the requirements of the law before January 1, 2013, are in place, they cannot be removed until new signs meeting the updated requirements are posted. A study found a significant decrease in traffic accidents at intersections where the main cause was a violation of specific traffic laws. The traffic study will analyze rear-end collisions near the intersection and consider various factors that could affect red-light running, such as engineering countermeasures, traffic volume, weather, impairment, statistical regression, and overall trends. It will use data from before and after the installation of the automated traffic enforcement system, adjusting for any differences between the two periods. The traffic safety study, conducted according to federal standards, must list all raw data used and be completed by January 1, 2017. If the study does not show a significant reduction in red-light running accidents at intersections with automated enforcement systems, the system must be terminated by January 1, 2018, and no violations captured after that date can be used for prosecution. If a traffic safety study does not show a significant reduction in accidents caused by motorists failing to stop before turning right on a red light at intersections with automated enforcement systems, the system must be terminated by January 1, 2018. No violations captured by the system after January 1, 2018 shall be used for prosecution."
