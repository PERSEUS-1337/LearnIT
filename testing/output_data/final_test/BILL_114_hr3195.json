    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Small Business Administration Franchise Loan Transparency Act of 2015\" and its purpose is outlined in Section 2 as findings and purpose. Franchise businesses are a significant part of the US economy, with the Small Business Administration playing a key role in financing. Projections, including revenue, are required for franchise financing. An audit highlighted issues with revenue projections for Huntington Learning Center franchises. The SBA needed to improve management of its 7(a) loan portfolio risk, particularly with franchises that had high default rates. A study showed that 28% of 7(a) loans to franchises required guarantee payments over a 10-year period, totaling $1.5 billion. Franchisees should include revenue estimates in SBA loan applications, but this information may not be in the franchise disclosure document. Franchise companies typically collect royalties based on gross revenue, making revenue data easily accessible. The franchisee bears the total liability for the loan, even though both the franchisor and lender benefit from SBA financing. The purpose of the Act is to ensure transparency in SBA loan processes for franchise borrowers, lenders, and the Administration. The Act aims to improve transparency in SBA loan processes for franchise borrowers by ensuring key financial data is disclosed, reducing fees and rates for franchisee borrowers, and lowering default rates to increase loan availability. SEC. 3. REQUIRED DISCLOSURES. Franchisors must disclose financial information in the FTC disclosure document, including average first-year revenue, number of locations that closed or were sold in the first year, and average revenues for all locations over the past five years. Financial information provided to prospective franchisees must be disclosed by the franchisor or its representatives. Financial information provided by the franchisor or its representatives for loan qualification must be disclosed to prospective franchisee borrowers. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines terms like \"disclosure document\" and \"franchise\" as per specific regulations. SEC. 5. SEVERABILITY. If any part of this Act is deemed invalid, the rest remains unaffected."
