Congress found that the Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes of the Fort Peck Reservation filed a complaint to recover interest earned on trust funds held in special deposit accounts. The Court held the United States liable for income derived from investment of the trust funds during that period. The plaintiffs settled with the United States for claims under Docket No. 773-87-L on December 31, 1998. The settlement included payment of $1,339,415.33 for interest earned on funds held in Special Deposit accounts at the Fort Peck Agency from August 13, 1946, through September 30, 1981, and $2,749,354.41 for interest on the principal indebtedness from August 13, 1946, through July 31, 1998, plus per diem interest thereafter. The settlement terms were approved by the Court on January 8, 1999, with $4,522,551.84 transferred to the Department of the Interior on March 18, 1999. The amount was deposited in an escrow account for attorney's fees and distribution to the Tribe and individual Indian trust beneficiaries. On January 31, 2001, a joint stipulation was approved by the Court for the identification, notice, and distribution of a judgment amount to the Tribe and individual Indian beneficiaries. On February 14, 2001, $643,186.73 was transferred to an account for the Tribe, representing 54.2 percent of their share of the judgment amount. The Court-approved stipulation allows the Tribe to use transferred funds in accordance with a plan under the Indian Tribal Judgment Funds Use or Distribution Act. Additional payments are expected once all eligible individuals are identified for distribution. The distribution amount is completed, pro rata shares are calculated, and additional payments would include the balance of the Tribe's share, investment income earned, income derived on special deposit accounts not attributable to the Tribe or individuals, and shares attributable to individual Indians that cannot be located.
