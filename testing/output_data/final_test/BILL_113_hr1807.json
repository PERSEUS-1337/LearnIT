    "content": "The Act may be cited as \"The Residential Energy and Economic Savings Act\" or the \"TREES Act\". The Congress recognizes the utility sector as a major source of greenhouse gas emissions in the US, with heating and cooling homes taking up a significant portion of residential electricity usage. Shade trees can reduce cooling costs by 30%, provide carbon benefits, reduce stormwater runoff, and prevent topsoil erosion. Trees play a crucial role in reducing topsoil erosion, preventing land pollutants from entering waterways, slowing down water runoff, and replenishing groundwater. Additionally, strategically placing trees near residential properties can increase home values. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines \"nonprofit tree-planting organization\" as a tax-exempt entity focused on urban tree cover, tree distribution, environmental awareness, and education. It also defines \"retail power provider\" as an entity authorized to generate power under State or Federal law. The term \"tree-siting guidelines\" refers to science-based measurements for tree planting locations, including species and minimum distances from buildings, utilities, and other structures. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy, and \"State\" includes all States, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories. The guidelines include specifications for tree planting locations, species, and distances from buildings, utilities, and other infrastructure such as septic systems and swimming pools. The purpose of the guidelines is to provide specifications for tree planting locations, species, and distances from buildings and infrastructure. The Act aims to help retail power providers establish targeted residential tree-planting programs for various purposes, including reducing peak-load demand for electricity, lowering energy demand in winter, protecting air quality, and mitigating climate change effects. This initiative also aims to lower electric bills for residential ratepayers. The Act aims to lower electric bills for residential ratepayers by limiting electricity consumption, relieve financial pressure on retail power providers from peak-load energy demand, protect water quality by reducing stormwater runoff, and promote community education on tree canopy coverage. SEC. 5. GENERAL AUTHORITY. The Secretary may establish a grant program to assist retail power providers in implementing residential tree-planting programs. Additionally, a national public recognition initiative may be created to promote participation in tree-planting programs. Cooperation with State foresters or equivalent officials is allowed, and retail power providers must meet certain requirements to qualify for assistance under this Act. The Act allows for the establishment of a tree-planting program that provides free or discounted shade or wind-reducing trees to residential consumers. The program aims to optimize electricity consumption reduction by strategically planting trees around residences to maximize shade in summer or wind protection in fall and winter using the best available science. The program will use tree-siting guidelines based on the best available science to plant optimal tree species in locations that reduce energy demand and minimize disruption to infrastructure. Recipients will receive tree planting and care instructions. Certification from the Secretary is required to ensure program goals are met. The Secretary will collaborate with the Forest Service's Urban and Community Forestry Program to ensure certification requirements align with program goals. At least 30 percent of funds will be distributed to retail power providers without established tree-planting programs or with programs less than three years old. SEC. 6. AGREEMENTS BETWEEN RETAIL POWER PROVIDERS AND NONPROFIT TREE-PLANTING ORGANIZATIONS. The Secretary is authorized to award grants to retail power providers who have agreements with nonprofit tree-planting organizations. The agreement must outline conditions for a targeted residential tree-planting program, including participation in a local advisory committee and potential volunteer coordination and public awareness campaigns. The Secretary authorizes grants to retail power providers for a residential tree-planting program. The program includes public awareness campaigns, education on tree benefits, maintenance encouragement, and monitoring tree health and energy savings. The program authorizes grants to retail power providers for a residential tree-planting program. Trees must be provided and maintained for at least five years. Trees near power lines must not interfere with electricity distribution. Consultation is required before planting near high-voltage transmission lines. If no nonprofit organization exists in the area, legal requirements still apply. The requirements in this section apply to legal agreements between retail power providers and local municipal governments or conservation districts. These entities can enter into cooperative agreements with nonprofit organizations to meet specified goals. SEC. 7. TECHNICAL ADVISORY COMMITTEES. To qualify for assistance under this Act, a retail power provider must consult with a nonprofit tree-planting organization and State foresters to establish a local technical advisory committee. The committee can design plant lists, planting specifications, and ensure tree recipients are educated on long-term care. The local technical advisory committees established under this Act aim to engage the public in tree planting and care, prioritize tree locations for energy conservation benefits, and collect data on tree health and survival. Committee members will not receive compensation and will be composed of representatives with expertise in energy efficiency from various organizations. The local technical advisory committees established under this Act will include representatives from organizations with expertise in demand-side energy efficiency management, urban forestry, or arboriculture. The committee will consist of individuals from the retail power provider, nonprofit tree-planting organization, and local nonprofit conservation or environmental organizations. Preference will be given to organizations with experience in engaging the public in energy conservation practices. The local technical advisory committees established under this Act will include representatives from various organizations with expertise in energy efficiency, urban forestry, and infrastructure management. This includes individuals from affordable housing agencies, local government, and organizations responsible for roads and infrastructure. The local technical advisory committees established under this Act will include representatives from transportation agencies, the nursery and landscaping industry, State foresters, the research community, and academia with expertise in natural resources or energy management. Each committee will elect a chairperson from eligible representatives to preside over meetings and direct committee operations. At least one member of each committee must have credentials in the relevant field. At least one member of each local technical advisory committee must have credentials from organizations like International Society of Arboriculture or Society of American Foresters. SEC. 8. COST-SHARE PROGRAM. The Federal share of support for tree-planting programs funded under this Act shall not exceed 50 percent and shall be provided on a matching basis. Non-Federal entities can contribute to the remaining costs. SEC. 9. RULEMAKING. The Secretary can initiate a 6-month rulemaking period for public comments. A competitive grants process will be established for retail power providers to apply for Federal assistance. SEC. 10. NONDUPLICITY. SEC. 10. NONDUPLICITY. This Act does not override or duplicate programs under the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of 1978. SEC. 11. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Sums necessary for implementing this Act can be appropriated."
