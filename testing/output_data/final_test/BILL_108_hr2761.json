    "content": "The \"Nuclear Security Act of 2003\" is the short title of this Act. It includes definitions for various terms used within the Act. Section 11 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 is amended to include definitions for \"design basis threat\" and \"sensitive nuclear facility,\" which encompass various types of nuclear facilities licensed by the Commission. The Commission determines certain facilities used in licensed activities should be treated as sensitive nuclear facilities under section 170C. SEC. 170C of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 amends Chapter 14 to protect sensitive nuclear facilities against the design basis threat. In SEC. 170C of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, definitions are provided for terms like nuclear security force, Fund, qualification standard, and security plan. The Commission is required to establish a nuclear security force and develop security plans for sensitive nuclear facilities. The Commission is mandated to develop security plans for sensitive nuclear facilities to protect against the design basis threat, including the deployment of a nuclear security force with specific tactics and numbers of members at each facility. The Commission is tasked with developing security plans for sensitive nuclear facilities, including tactics and capabilities of the nuclear security force, protective measures like critical control system designs, restricted personnel access, perimeter and internal site security, fire protection barriers, and increased protection for spent fuel storage areas. The Commission is responsible for creating security plans for sensitive nuclear facilities, including measures like background security checks for employees, placement of spent fuel in dry cask storage, and a schedule for completing security requirements within 18 months of enactment. License holders or local governments can request additional security plan requirements, and implementation must occur within 270 days of enactment. The Commission, in consultation with license holders, must implement security plans for sensitive nuclear facilities within a specified timeframe. If the security plan is deemed insufficient, a classified report must be submitted to Congress and the President identifying vulnerabilities. The Commission must establish a program for hiring and training a nuclear security force within 90 days of the enactment of this section. Qualification standards for individuals to be hired as members of the force must be established within 30 days. The Commission must develop and administer a nuclear security force personnel examination for individuals seeking employment. Criminal and security background checks are required for hiring members of the force. Procedures to disqualify individuals presenting national security risks will be established. The Commission ensures background checks are conducted to prevent national security threats in the nuclear security force. An annual proficiency review is required for all members to continue employment. The Commission mandates training for nuclear security force members to ensure they have the necessary knowledge and skills to protect sensitive nuclear facilities from potential threats. The Commission will develop a training plan for nuclear security force members and may collaborate with other federal agencies for assistance. A Nuclear Security Fund is established to administer programs for securing sensitive nuclear facilities. The Nuclear Security Fund is established by the Commission to secure sensitive nuclear facilities. The Fund receives fees collected and appropriated amounts, which are then invested in interest-bearing obligations of the United States. The Nuclear Security Fund is used to pay for salaries, training, and security expenses of the nuclear security force, as well as for developing and implementing security plans. Obligations acquired by the Fund can be sold at market price, with interest and proceeds credited back to the Fund. The Nuclear Security Fund covers salaries, training, and security expenses for the nuclear security force, including developing and implementing security plans. The Commission assesses licensees a fee to ensure there are enough funds for assistance. Appropriations are authorized as needed. The Commission must fully implement the changes within 270 days of enactment. The Nuclear Security Fund covers expenses for the security force, including developing security plans. Licensees are assessed a fee to ensure adequate funds. Appropriations are authorized as needed. The Commission must fully implement changes within 270 days of enactment, including uranium supply and protection of sensitive nuclear facilities."
