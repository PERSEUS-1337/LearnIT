These proposals have been consistently presented since FY2010, with Congress yet to implement them. The Administration argues that these tax preferences are costly to taxpayers and do not effectively incentivize production or lower consumer prices. The Obama Administration aims to eliminate tax deductions and credits for the oil and natural gas industries, saving $40.7 billion over the next decade. The American Petroleum Institute argues that these tax provisions are standard business deductions and necessary for a national income tax system. The Administration sees repealing these preferences as eliminating market distortions and funding investments in clean energy resources. Eight proposed tax changes are targeted at reducing fossil fuel consumption. The proposed tax changes aim to equalize tax treatment between independent oil producers and major oil companies by eliminating preferential tax treatment for independent companies. These changes are estimated to raise $3.9 billion in FY2014, with most revenue coming from three proposals. The current budget proposal estimates lower revenue for the current year but higher revenues over a 10-year period compared to the FY2013 budget proposal. The major difference in revenue estimates comes from revisions in revenue gains from repealing tax provisions for the oil and natural gas industries. The enhanced oil recovery credit provides a 15% credit for allowable costs associated with oil recovery technologies. The marginal well tax credit, available during periods of low oil prices, supplements natural well pressure to enhance production from older wells. However, the credit has not been in effect for several years and eliminating it would likely not impact current or expected oil production. Keeping older, higher-cost wells producing during periods of excess supply is generally ineffective for oil companies. The marginal well tax credit was recommended by the National Petroleum Council in 1994 to support low-production oil and gas wells during periods of low prices. It aims to maintain U.S. production levels even when global oil prices are low. The credit, enacted in 2004, has not been utilized due to high market prices. It may not be significant if prices remain high or if the U.S. transitions to alternative energy sources. High-cost wells in this category could be among the first affected. The expensing of intangible drilling costs, part of the federal tax code since 1913, covers various necessary activities and supplies for drilling or well development. This allows for a quicker return of invested funds through reduced tax payments, attracting capital to a historically risky investment. The use of advanced technology in oil exploration has reduced the risk of finding \"dry holes\" and expanded the range of exploration activities. Current law allows full expensing of intangible drilling costs for independent oil producers, while major integrated oil companies can expense 70% and capitalize the remaining 30% over 60 months. The FY2014 budget proposal aims to repeal direct expensing and accelerated capitalization provisions. The repeal of expensing of intangible drilling costs provision is estimated to yield $10.9 billion in revenue over the decade to 2023. The Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA) estimated that the tax change would result in a $3 billion reduction in investment in U.S. oil development. IPAA's estimate implied a direct relationship between higher taxes and reduced investment, with little empirical evidence provided. The elimination of expensing of intangible drilling costs in FY2012 was estimated to result in a one-third reduction in drilling budgets. The repeal of expensing of intangible drilling costs provision is estimated to yield $10.9 billion in revenue over the decade to 2023. Actual reductions in drilling budgets are likely to be determined by the effect of increased taxes in conjunction with the price of oil. If the price of oil were to settle in the $40-per-barrel range that prevailed in December 2008, the burden of additional tax expense on independent firms could reduce drilling activity. The combination of low oil prices and additional taxes might not justify the development of high-cost resources, especially in deep waters like the Gulf of Mexico. However, with the October 2013 price of oil around $100 per barrel, reflecting political unrest in the Middle East, the additional tax expense is likely to have a smaller effect on reducing oil development activity. Tertiary injection expenses, including the injectant cost, can be fully deducted in the current tax year. Supporters argue that maintaining favorable tax treatment for tertiary recovery methods is crucial for older well output and environmental benefits. Repealing the passive loss exception for working interests in oil and gas properties would have a minimal impact on tax revenues. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 allows for \"passive income (or loss)\" categorization in oil and gas projects, incentivizing investors. Percentage depletion, dating back to 1926, deducts 15% of gross income to represent extracted oil value for tax purposes, similar to asset depreciation in other industries. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 allows for \"passive income (or loss)\" categorization in oil and gas projects, incentivizing investors. Percentage depletion deducts 15% of gross income to represent extracted oil value for tax purposes. This allowance is limited to domestic U.S. production by independent producers, on the first 1,000 barrels per day, per well, and is limited to 65% of the producer's net income. Percentage depletion was eliminated for major oil companies in 1975, but their production of oil showed little variation as a result. The repeal of the percentage depletion allowance in the Tax Reform Act of 1986 would yield approximately $10.7 billion in tax revenues over a ten-year period. Additionally, the repeal of the domestic manufacturing tax deduction for the oil and natural gas industries is estimated to contribute $1.1 billion in revenue. Ownership of oil in the United States is attractive for companies as it allows for private ownership, unlike in most other countries where ownership is vested in the national oil company. The tax provision for the oil and natural gas industries, enacted in 2004, aims to increase tax revenue by $17.4 billion from FY2014 to FY2024. The deduction, part of the American Jobs Creation Act, incentivizes American employment in manufacturing. The deduction, starting at 3% in 2005 and reaching 9% in 2010, is based on net income from domestic manufacturing activities, with a 6% rate limit for the oil and gas industries. The tax provision for the oil and natural gas industries, enacted in 2004, aims to increase tax revenue by $17.4 billion from FY2014 to FY2024. The deduction, part of the American Jobs Creation Act, incentivizes American employment in manufacturing by allowing a percent deduction of net income, up to the payroll limitation, reducing the effective cost of labor to the manufacturer. This reduction in labor cost is intended to expand employment, increase output, and make domestically manufactured goods more competitive in the U.S. and world markets. The oil and natural gas industries have seen high profits since 2004, with oil exploration increasing when prices are expected to rise. The industry employed approximately 185,500 workers in December 2011, but the capital-intensive nature of the industry limits the impact on national employment levels. The variability and level of expected oil and natural gas prices play a crucial role in determining capital investment budgets for exploration and production development. Geological and geophysical expenses incurred during resource development should ideally be deducted in the year they are incurred, rather than spread out over several years for tax purposes. The longer the amortization period, the less favorable the tax treatment, as it delays the recovery of the entire cost. Under the FY2014 budget proposal, independent producers may have their amortization period for geological and geophysical costs extended to seven years, aligning with major integrated oil companies. This change is estimated to yield $1.3 billion over the period FY2014 to FY2023. The current favorable tax treatment of these expenses encourages domestic resource development, but altering this provision could impact exploration and development activities. The FY2014 budget proposal suggests extending the amortization period for geological and geophysical costs for independent producers to seven years, aligning with major integrated oil companies. This change aims to yield $1.3 billion over the period FY2014 to FY2023. The current favorable tax treatment of these expenses encourages domestic resource development, but altering this provision could impact exploration and development activities. The FY2014 budget proposal includes various tax changes affecting the oil industry, such as repealing the LIFO accounting method, increasing Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund taxes, reinstating Superfund taxes, and modifying the Dual Capacity Rule. LIFO is an established accounting method that allows firms to deduct the cost of the most recent goods sold, reducing taxes during periods of price inflation. The FY2014 budget proposal includes potentially repealing the LIFO accounting method, which could have significant tax implications for the oil industry. The API suggests that keeping LIFO in place could be advantageous due to rising oil prices. Repealing LIFO could result in companies needing to redirect cash or sell assets to cover tax payments, potentially harming businesses. The proposed change could raise $80.8 billion over the period FY2014 to FY2023, with $28.3 billion coming from the oil and natural gas industries. The budget proposal for FY2014 includes increasing the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund financing by raising the tax on imported and domestic crude oil to 9 cents per barrel in 2014 and 10 cents per barrel in 2017. These tax increases are expected to generate $64 million in 2014 and $1 billion over the period 2014 to 2023. The proposal also reinstates an excise tax of 9.7 cents per barrel on domestic and imported petroleum products to finance the Superfund for cleanup of contaminated sites. The Administration and supporters propose reinstating Superfund taxes to reduce reliance on general Treasury revenues. The API argues that excise taxes would unfairly burden oil production and petroleum sales. Reinstating the taxes could raise $1.3 billion in 2014 and $20.2 billion from FY2014 to FY2023. The Dual Capacity Rule, dating back to 1918, allows corporations to credit foreign income taxes paid against their U.S. tax liabilities. In the 1950s, the oil industry saw a change where royalties paid to oil-producing countries like Saudi Arabia were transformed into income taxes, allowing companies to pay more to these countries. Proposed modification of dual capacity rules would restrict companies from claiming full foreign income taxes as credit against U.S. taxes, reducing after-tax revenues and overseas investment returns. This could lead to U.S. firms investing less in marginal overseas projects, generating estimated revenue of $552 million in 2014 and $11 billion from 2014 to 2023. The Department of the Interior's budget proposal includes changes in fees and revenue-generating items affecting the oil and natural gas industries, expected to yield $2.5 billion in revenues from 2014 to 2023. These proposals may increase costs for oil and gas activities under DOI's management but are unlikely to have a significant impact due to representing only a fraction of overall revenues. Supporters argue that these fees are necessary user charges. The proposed tax changes in Table 1 could increase tax collections from the oil and natural gas industries, potentially reducing exploration and production. This may lead to higher consumer prices and increased dependence on foreign oil. However, these changes could also be seen as eliminating tax preferences that have favored these industries, making oil and gas products artificially cheap. The overall impact of these proposals is expected to be minimal if oil prices remain high. The 2014 estimated tax revenues from the oil and natural gas industry tax proposals are approximately $3.8 billion, about 4% of net revenues, and one third of one percent of total revenues."
