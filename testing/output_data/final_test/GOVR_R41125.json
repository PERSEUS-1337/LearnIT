    "content": "On March 23, 2010, the President signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (HCERA), which amended PPACA. HCERA includes two titles: Coverage, Medicare, Medicaid, and Revenues, and Education and Health. Title I of HCERA contains provisions related to health care and revenues, including modifications to PPACA. Title II includes amendments to the Higher Education Act of 1965 and other health amendments. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that PPACA and HCERA together will reduce federal deficits by $143 billion over the 2010-2019 period through spending and revenue changes. The Congressional Budget Office issued a preliminary cost estimate for PPACA and HCERA, projecting a $138 billion reduction in federal deficits over the 2010-2019 period. PPACA aims to extend health insurance coverage to the uninsured, reduce expenditures, improve care coordination, and quality of care. HCERA modifies Medicaid and CHIP provisions in PPACA. PPACA aims to extend health insurance coverage to uninsured U.S. residents through health insurance Exchanges, Medicaid expansion, and other reforms. Key provisions include expanding Medicaid eligibility to individuals under 65 with income up to 133% of the federal poverty level, maintaining current coverage levels through 2013 for adults and 2019 for children, and implementing outreach and enrollment initiatives. PPACA includes provisions to improve outreach, streamline enrollment, and coordinate with health insurance Exchanges. It adds new mandatory and optional benefits to Medicaid, such as premium assistance, coverage of birth clinics, and tobacco cessation services. The law also introduces measures to reduce Medicaid expenditures and increase federal matching payments for eligibility expansions. PPACA includes cost control reforms such as reductions in Medicaid DSH payments and prescription drug expenditures, as well as payment reforms to reduce inappropriate hospital expenditures. It also implements program integrity reforms with new enforcement tools and data reporting requirements. Nursing home accountability is enhanced with transparency requirements and information for LTC consumers. PPACA includes various provisions for improving the delivery, quality, and payment of services in Medicaid and CHIP programs. It adds new offices within CMS to coordinate care and establish an Innovation Center for testing new payment models. The HCERA modifies provisions in PPACA related to Medicaid and CHIP, including eligibility requirements based on categorical and financial criteria. Medicaid limits income and assets for eligibility. Medicaid eligibility is determined by income and asset limits, which vary by state and population group. There are approximately 50 pathways into Medicaid, with some being mandatory and others optional for states to cover. The federal government's share of Medicaid costs is determined by the federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) formula, which provides higher reimbursement to states with lower per capita income. FMAPs range from 50% to 83%. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided temporary enhanced FMAP rates for states from FY2009 to FY2011. The PPACA requires states to expand Medicaid eligibility to individuals with income up to 133% of the FPL in 2014, including childless adults and certain parents. Additionally, the law will increase the mandatory Medicaid income eligibility level for children aged 6 to 19 from 100% FPL to 133% FPL. Income eligibility for individuals in the \"newly eligible\" population, other non-elderly individuals eligible under prior law, and certain CHIP eligible individuals will be based on modified gross income (MGI) or household income. \"Newly eligible\" individuals will receive benchmark or benchmark-equivalent coverage as per Section 1937 of the Social Security Act, with some exceptions. States will receive 100% FMAP for the cost of care for \"newly eligible\" populations from 2014 to 2016, with a lower FMAP for these individuals starting in 2017, except for Nebraska. Expansion states will receive a significant increase in federal financial participation rates for \"newly eligible beneficiaries\" under PPACA and HCERA, with a ceiling of 95%. Nebraska will have an FMAP lower than 100% for \"newly eligibles\" and will be grouped into expansion and non-expansion states. Expansion states that do not qualify for additional FMAP will not receive the increase. Under PPACA and HCERA, states can receive increased federal financial participation rates for Medicaid coverage, with a 2.2 percentage point increase to their regular FMAP for existing eligibility groups from January 1, 2014, to September 30, 2019. Additionally, between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2016, states meeting specific criteria can receive a 0.5 percentage point increase to their FMAP rate. HCERA also modifies the financing provisions for newly eligible populations under PPACA. The FMAP rates for care provided to \"newly eligible\" populations under PPACA would be 100% in 2014-2016, decreasing to 90% in 2020 and beyond. Nebraska's permanent 100% FMAP rate for \"newly eligibles\" was repealed. The 2.2 percentage point increase for expansion states was shortened to December 31, 2015. Massachusetts-specific 0.5 percentage point increase was repealed. Expansion states will receive an increase above their regular FMAP rate for care provided to currently eligible childless adults. Under PPACA, Medicaid's financial requirements place limits on income and assets for eligibility. Income disregards and asset tests will no longer apply. Standards vary across states and for different population groups. Under PPACA, Medicaid's financial requirements will no longer include income disregards and asset tests for eligibility. Instead, income eligibility will be based on Modified Gross Income (MGI) or household income for certain individuals. MGI is defined as gross income minus certain deductions, and will also determine premium and cost-sharing amounts under the state plan. Medicaid enrollees affected by the change in income-counting will still be able to maintain coverage. Under HCERA (Sec. 1004), income eligibility for newly eligible individuals, non-elderly individuals eligible under prior law, and certain CHIP eligible individuals will be based on modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) or household income. MAGI includes deductions such as trade and business deductions, losses from sale of property, and alimony payments, increased by tax-exempt interest and income earned abroad. PPACA prohibits the use of income disregards under Medicaid. The reconciliation bill requires states to reduce countable income for Medicaid eligibility by 5% of the upper income limit. States have flexibility in setting provider reimbursement rates under Medicaid, with additional requirements for inpatient hospital and long-term care services. The PPACA allows states to set provider reimbursement rates independently. HCERA will require states to set Medicaid payments for primary care services relative to Medicare rates. Primary care services by certain physicians will be paid at Medicare rates or higher in 2013 and 2014. The bill will require Medicaid payments for primary care services to be set relative to Medicare rates, with the federal government fully financing the portion of payments that exceed existing state rates. States must also make adjustments to payment rates for hospitals treating low-income and Medicaid patients. The Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) provision adjusts payment rates for hospitals treating low-income and Medicaid patients. States must define qualifying DSH hospitals and payment formulas in their Medicaid plans. DSH payments are capped based on unreimbursed costs for Medicaid and uninsured patients. Special rules apply to low DSH states in determining federal allotments. Special rules apply to \"low DSH states\" for determining federal DSH allotments. For FY2004 through FY2008, allotments increased by 16% each year. Starting in FY2009, DSH allotments for all states are adjusted based on the consumer price index. In FY2009, federal DSH allotments totaled nearly $10.6 billion, with additional funding from ARRA increasing it to $10.9 billion. PPACA reduces federal DSH allotments based on changes in state-specific uninsurance rates. State DSH allotments will remain unchanged until a certain uninsurance level is reached. The current law reduces federal DSH allotments based on changes in state-specific uninsurance rates. Reductions depend on a state's status as a low DSH state and spending patterns compared to a benchmark. Low DSH states face reductions of 17.5% or 25%, while other states face reductions of 35% or 50%. Further reductions occur if a state's uninsurance rate decreases further. The DSH allotment reductions under the PPACA and HCERA are based on a state's status as a low DSH state and its spending patterns compared to a benchmark. Reductions range from 20% to 55% depending on the state's status. Additionally, a state's DSH allotment will not be less than 50% of its FY2012 allotment, adjusted for inflation. Under HCERA, aggregate reductions in DSH allotments are required, totaling $500 million to $5.0 billion from FY2014 to FY2017. The Secretary will be required to impose reductions on states based on their uninsured population percentages, DSH payment targeting, and budget neutrality calculations for coverage expansions. Reductions range from $500 million to $5.6 billion from FY2014 to FY2020. The reduction in DSH allotments for states approved under Section 1115 will be applied quarterly. States with $0 DSH allotment in certain quarters will have their allotments set at $47.2 million in FY2012 and $53.1 million in FY2013. The FMAP determines federal share for Medicaid costs based on a formula favoring states with lower income. FMAP ranges from 50% to 83%, with territories typically at 50%. Medicaid programs in territories have annual federal spending caps. The Congress has increased federal Medicaid funding levels in the territories in recent years, with annual spending caps set in statute. Territories also have access to other federal matching funds and may be eligible for enhanced federal match under Medicaid. PPACA increases spending caps for territories by 30% for certain quarters. Beginning FY2009, funds spent on specified administrative activities will not count against Medicaid caps. The law increases spending caps for territories by 30% for certain quarters and raises the applicable FMAP to 55%. Payments for medical assistance for \"newly eligible\" individuals won't count towards spending caps starting in FY2014. Newly eligible individuals are defined as non-pregnant childless adults eligible under the new Medicaid group. HCERA strikes Medicaid provisions related to territories' payments in PPACA. HCERA strikes Medicaid provisions related to territories' payments in PPACA, allowing territories to establish Exchanges by October 13, 2013. $1.0 billion is appropriated for premium and cost-sharing assistance for residents to obtain health insurance coverage through the Exchange, with $925 million allocated for Puerto Rico. Territories must structure their Exchanges to ensure no gap in assistance between Medicaid and Exchange eligibility. Under HCERA, territories not establishing an Exchange by a specified date receive increased Medicaid funding caps. $6.3 billion is available for distribution among territories from July 1, 2011, to September 30, 2019. Personal care attendants assist individuals with daily living activities. Under PPACA and HCERA, states have the option to cover personal care services for Medicaid beneficiaries. This includes home and community-based attendant services for those with income below 150% of poverty. Outpatient prescription drugs are also covered by most states for Medicaid beneficiaries. Medicaid law requires drug manufacturers to pay rebates to states to sell their products to Medicaid agencies. Medicaid requires drug manufacturers to pay rebates for outpatient drugs purchased on behalf of beneficiaries. The rebates are determined based on the type of drug, with different components for innovator drugs and non-innovator drugs. The basic rebate is calculated using the drug's Average Manufacturer Price (AMP) or a percentage of the AMP. Single source innovator drugs also require an additional rebate. PPACA requires drug manufacturers to pay additional rebates to Medicaid for new formulations of single source or innovator drugs, known as line extensions. HCERA will limit line extension drugs to oral solid dosage forms. PPACA also modifies the definition of Average Manufacturer Price (AMP) by excluding various rebates, discounts, and fees extended to wholesalers and pharmacies. Under the reconciliation bill, the definition of AMP will be modified to exclude discounts paid by manufacturers to Medicare Part D plans, making the calculation of AMP more reflective of the actual cost of outpatient prescription drugs. Program integrity initiatives aim to combat waste, fraud, and abuse in healthcare by ensuring correct payments to legitimate providers for eligible services. Additional funding was provided by Congress for these initiatives. Under the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, Congress allocated funding for the Medicaid Integrity Program (MIP) to enhance state program integrity efforts. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (HCERA) increased funding for the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control (HCFAC) account, primarily supporting Medicare activities. Additionally, HCERA raised Medicaid Program funding levels proposed in the House health care reform bill. The House health care reform bill (H.R. 3962) is increased by HCERA, which also raises Medicaid Program Integrity funds by linking them to changes in the consumer price index."
