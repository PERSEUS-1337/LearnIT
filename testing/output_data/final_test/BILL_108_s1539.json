    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"National Clean and Safe Water Fund Act of 2003\". Congress acknowledges that a significant portion of the assessed water in the United States fails to meet water quality standards, affecting rivers, shorelines, and lakes with pollution from sediments, nutrients, and microorganisms. This led to the enactment of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act to protect the integrity of the nation's water. Establishing a national clean and safe water fund would help States protect and improve watersheds and aquifers, as penalties assessed under environmental Acts are not available for this purpose. Establishing a national clean and safe water fund is proposed to help States protect and improve watersheds and aquifers, as penalties assessed under environmental Acts are not available for this purpose. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act is amended to establish the National Clean and Safe Water Fund in the Treasury, funded by fines and penalties collected from enforcement actions. This fund aims to support States in protecting and enhancing watersheds and aquifers. The National Clean and Safe Water Fund, established under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, collects funds from enforcement actions to support States in watershed and aquifer protection. The Secretary of the Treasury invests excess funds in interest-bearing US obligations. The National Clean and Safe Water Fund, established under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, collects funds for water quality projects such as water conservation, wetland protection, contaminated sediment, and drinking water source protection. The Fund supports projects that aim to improve water quality through various best management practices. Projects eligible for funding under the National Clean and Safe Water Fund include decentralized stormwater or wastewater treatment projects, conservation easements, stream buffer construction, sewer overflow remediation, and other similar projects as determined by the Administrator. The National Clean and Safe Water Fund can only be used for specific projects outlined by the Administrator and cannot cover legal or administrative expenses. The funds allocated are in addition to any other funding for similar projects under different laws. The selection of projects is determined by the Administrator. The Administrator gives priority to projects in watersheds of states with violations under the Clean Water Act or Safe Drinking Water Act. Selection criteria are established to maximize water quality improvement. The Administrator prioritizes projects in watersheds with violations under the Clean Water Act or Safe Drinking Water Act. Criteria are set to maximize water quality improvement in watersheds and aquifers for project selection. Coordination with states is required for project selection, and implementation involves making grants to various entities. The Administrator prioritizes projects in watersheds with violations under the Clean Water Act or Safe Drinking Water Act, making grants to entities such as publicly-owned treatment works, nonprofits, public water systems, Federal interstate water compact commissions, Indian tribes, and Native Hawaiians. The Administrator is excluded from making grants to certain entities. The Administrator is restricted from making grants to private entities regulated under the Clean Water Act or Safe Drinking Water Act. A report must be submitted to Congress biennially detailing funded projects and selection criteria. The Administrator is required to report to Congress biennially on funded projects, selection criteria, and priorities for future fund use to achieve water quality goals in impaired or threatened water bodies. This does not affect the obligation of entities to comply with the Clean Water Act or Safe Drinking Water Act. SEC. 4. USE OF CIVIL PENALTIES FOR REMEDIAL PROJECTS. Amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to allow civil penalties to be used for projects in accordance with specified clauses. Conforming amendment allows for the use of civil penalties for carrying out projects."
