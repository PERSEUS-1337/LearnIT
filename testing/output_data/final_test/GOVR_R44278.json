    "content": "The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is a proposed free trade agreement among 12 Asia-Pacific countries, including the United States. The agreement was concluded in late 2015 and signed by trade ministers in February 2016. Congress would need to pass implementing legislation for the agreement to enter into force. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) aims to liberalize trade and investment beyond the World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. It is open to new members and issues, with countries like Indonesia, the Philippines, and South Korea expressing interest. The TPP is a key part of the U.S. \"rebalance\" towards the Asia-Pacific region, aiming to boost economic growth and jobs through expanded trade and investment. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) aims to deepen U.S. trade and investment integration in the Asia-Pacific region, accounting for 37% of total U.S. trade. Proponents argue it allows the U.S. to \"write the rules\" of trade, while opponents raise concerns about job losses and regulatory limitations. Controversial aspects include market access issues on dairy, agricultural products, autos, and textiles. The TPP aims to address market access issues on dairy, agricultural products, autos, textiles, intellectual property protection, environment and worker rights, treatment of SOEs, investor-state dispute settlement, government procurement, and currency valuation. The economic impact will depend on trade liberalization achieved and current trade levels among TPP members. It is the largest U.S. FTA by trade flows. The TPP aims to eliminate tariffs on manufactured products and most agricultural goods, with Japan's entry increasing the economic significance. Japan is the largest economy and trading partner in the TPP without an existing U.S. FTA. U.S.-Japan trade differs from other TPP partners, with Japan being the fourth-largest export and import market for the U.S. The TPP aims to eliminate tariffs on manufactured products and agricultural goods, with Japan's entry increasing economic significance. Malaysia and Vietnam, without existing U.S. FTAs, show potential for growth due to high tariffs and presence of SOEs. TPA requires the ITC to estimate the TPP's economic impact within 105 days of signing.

Malaysia and Vietnam, without existing U.S. FTAs, show potential for growth due to high tariffs and presence of SOEs. TPA requires the ITC to estimate the TPP's economic impact within 105 days of signing. Studies estimating the agreement's economic impact vary, with the Peterson Institute predicting a $131 billion gain in annual real income for the U.S. from TPP, while a study by Tufts University predicts a slight decline in U.S. GDP growth and a loss of 770,000 jobs split amongst all TPP participants. Critiques have been made against both studies, with the Tufts study drawing particular criticism for its unconventional framework. The TPP has strategic implications for U.S. trade policy and geopolitical interests in the Asia-Pacific region. The Obama Administration argues that the agreement would strengthen allies, reaffirm U.S. economic leadership, and failure to pass it could signal declining U.S. interest in the region. The failure of the TPP could have significant geopolitical costs, as China aims to reduce U.S. presence in the region. Some argue that the TPP could counter Chinese influence, shaping regional rules more favorable to U.S. interests. Others believe past trade pacts have limited impact on foreign policy dynamics, viewing the TPP primarily for its economic benefits to the U.S. The TPP negotiations serve strategic goals in U.S. trade policy by potentially revitalizing the global trading system, opening markets, and updating trade rules to reflect modern commerce. It may counter Chinese influence in the region and provide an alternative to less comprehensive FTAs. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and other FTAs, potentially excluding the United States, could impact U.S. businesses and workers due to limited provisions on agriculture, services, investment, and intellectual property rights. The President emphasizes U.S. leadership in global trade rules, contrasting with Chinese initiatives. Some argue that FTA proposals in the region, including those supported by China, could complement U.S. efforts and pave the way for future expansion of TPP or a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP). The TPP agreement consists of 30 chapters covering market access, rules on trade-related issues, and commitments to eliminate tariffs and quotas on industrial goods and agriculture. Tariffs on all manufactured goods would be eliminated under the agreement. Under the TPP agreement, tariffs on all manufactured goods would be eliminated, with some tariffs phased out over up to 30 years. Approximately 90% of U.S. tariff lines and 88% of partner country tariff lines would be duty-free initially, increasing to 99% eventually. Agricultural goods would have tariffs and quotas remaining on sensitive products. The agreement details the timeline for tariff elimination for each country. The TPP agreement reached in October 2015 aims to improve market access for U.S. food and agricultural products in TPP markets, particularly in Japan, Vietnam, and Malaysia.
