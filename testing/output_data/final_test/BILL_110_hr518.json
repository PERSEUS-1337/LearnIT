    "content": "The Act titled \"International Solid Waste Importation and Management Act of 2007\" is introduced. It includes provisions for the international transportation and disposal of municipal solid waste under the Solid Waste Disposal Act. Until all final regulations to implement the Agreement are effective, a State can enact laws limiting foreign municipal solid waste disposal. This action should not unduly burden interstate or foreign commerce. The Administrator has the authority to enforce provisions of the Agreement regarding the importation and exportation of municipal solid waste without affecting international trade obligations. The Administrator must issue final regulations within 24 months of enactment regarding their responsibilities. When considering importation consent under the Agreement, the Administrator must give weight to state and local government views and assess the impact on recycling programs. The importation of municipal solid waste must adhere to State and local recycling programs, consider landfill capacity, air emissions, and road deterioration from increased vehicular traffic. Violations of the agreement are prohibited, and compliance orders may be issued by the Administrator. The Administrator may issue civil penalties for violations of waste importation regulations, with a maximum penalty of $25,000 per day per violation. Orders must specify the nature of the violation and consider compliance efforts. A public hearing is required for any orders issued under this section. The Administrator may issue civil penalties of up to $25,000 per day for violations of waste importation regulations. A public hearing is required if a person requests one within 30 days of receiving the order. Failure to comply with a compliance order may result in penalties. The Agreement Concerning the Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Waste between the United States and Canada, signed in 1986, defines foreign municipal solid waste as waste generated outside the US. Municipal solid waste includes materials discarded by households, hotels, and motels. The curr_chunk discusses waste materials generated by commercial, institutional, municipal, and industrial sources that are essentially the same as materials discarded by households, hotels, and motels. These materials are collected and disposed of with other municipal solid waste as part of normal waste collection services, excluding hazardous materials. The curr_chunk explains that municipal solid waste does not include hazardous materials regulated under certain regulations. Examples of municipal solid waste are food waste, yard waste, paper, clothing, appliances, packaging, diapers, office supplies, cosmetics, glass and metal containers, and household hazardous waste. It also includes debris from construction, remodeling, repair, or demolition of structures. The curr_chunk specifies that municipal solid waste excludes hazardous waste regulated under specific laws, such as response actions under environmental laws. The curr_chunk outlines various materials exempt from being classified as municipal solid waste, including recyclable materials separated at the source, scrap rubber for fuel, and materials returned to manufacturers for credit. The curr_chunk specifies that any solid waste generated by an industrial facility and transported for treatment, storage, or disposal to a facility owned by the generator or its affiliate is exempt from being classified as municipal solid waste. The curr_chunk outlines specific types of waste that are exempt from being classified as municipal solid waste, including medical waste, sewage sludge, combustion ash from resource recovery facilities, and waste from manufacturing or processing operations. The curr_chunk discusses exemptions for solid waste generated in air transportation services under the Solid Waste Disposal Act. The curr_chunk states the section number for international transportation and disposal of municipal solid waste, passed by the House of Representatives on April 24, 2007."
