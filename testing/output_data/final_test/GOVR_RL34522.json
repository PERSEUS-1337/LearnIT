    "content": "Since January 2007, Bangladesh has been under a state of emergency led by a military-backed caretaker government. The administration postponed elections to address election-related violence and has focused on an anti-corruption drive. The government aims to hold elections by the end of 2008 to return to democracy. The anti-corruption efforts target endemic corruption associated with former Prime Ministers Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia. Despite these efforts, the Awami League and Bangladesh National Party are expected to be the main contenders in the upcoming election. Rising food prices may contribute to public discontent. Discontent over food prices may escalate political tensions in Bangladesh, potentially leading to street protests and hindering the caretaker government's governance. The government arrested 10,000 individuals in early June to maintain order before elections, including local leaders, activists, and labor representatives. In May 2008, the interim government invited main political parties for dialogue on restoring democracy, but Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia boycotted, citing the absence of key leaders for elections to proceed. Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia John Gastright expressed concerns about Bangladesh's democracy, stating that money, cronyism, and intimidation were influencing elections. He also questioned the military-backed caretaker government's intentions, but acknowledged their responsiveness to calls for a roadmap to elections and democracy restoration. The United States values its relationship with Bangladesh for its moderate voice in the Islamic world and interests in political stability. The United States values its relationship with Bangladesh for its moderate voice in the Islamic world and interests in political stability, democratization, economic reform, social and economic development, environmental issues, countering anti-Western Islamist groups, and improving human rights. Bangladesh has received significant international aid, with the State Department requesting $88.8 million in assistance for FY2008 to support health and economic development programs, improve working conditions, and eliminate child labor. The United States provides aid to Bangladesh for various programs, including improving working conditions and eliminating child labor. P.L. 480 funds offer food assistance and disaster relief. The U.S. has a negative trade balance with Bangladesh, with the U.S. being its largest export destination. Key exports to the U.S. include ready-made garments and jute carpet backing. The U.S. exports wheat, fertilizer, cotton, communications equipment, and medical supplies to Bangladesh. Ambassador James Moriarty outlined three key dimensions of American foreign policy towards Bangladesh in April 2008. Ambassador James Moriarty outlined three key dimensions of American foreign policy towards Bangladesh in April 2008: democracy, development, and preventing terrorists from gaining influence. He mentioned the challenges of conducting credible elections under a state of emergency but noted progress in human rights. The State Department is focused on strengthening law enforcement agencies to combat terrorism and improve border control. American aid priorities aim to promote peace and security by addressing underlying factors that make Bangladesh vulnerable to extremism through democracy-focused programs. The U.S. has provided about $5 billion in aid to Bangladesh since independence in 1971, aiming to address factors that make the country vulnerable to extremism. Bangladesh, a poor and corrupt country, faces frequent setbacks from natural disasters. It gained independence from Pakistan in 1971 after a civil war. Bangladesh is believed to have large natural gas reserves. The partition of Bangladesh from Pakistan was driven by ethnic division and the desire for self-expression by Bengalis. Bangladeshi politics have been marked by a bitter rivalry between the Bangladesh National Party (BNP) and the Awami League (AL), led by former Prime Ministers Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina Wajed respectively. Zia is the widow of former president Ziaur Rahman, while Hasina is the daughter of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Political violence in Bangladesh has been prevalent in recent years, with attacks targeting prominent leaders of the opposition and civil society. The State Department strongly condemned a bomb attack in 2005 that killed four people, including former Awami League Finance Minister A.M.S. Kibria. The President's powers are largely ceremonial, but are expanded during caretaker governments. Strikes and demonstrations by the AL and BNP have been used to challenge the ruling party, often leading to government immobilization and economic disruption. In 2004, grenades were thrown at opposition leader Sheikh Hasina in Dhaka, killing 22 people. This marked a surge in political violence in Bangladesh. The Awami League accused Islamist parties of protecting the radicals behind the attacks. Bangladesh is a low-lying country prone to flooding, with 40% of its land flooded annually. It has a delta formed by the Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Meghna rivers. Bangladesh is vulnerable to major cyclones and flooding due to its low-lying terrain. The Sundarbans house Bengal Tigers, while the Chittagong Hill Tract and Sylhet regions have hills. The 2007 elections were postponed by a military-backed interim government to address political violence and corruption. During the 2001 election in Bangladesh, the Zia-led Bangladesh National Party and its alliance partners won 41% of the votes, while the Hasina-led Awami League won 40%. The BNP won 193 seats, AL won 58 seats, and other parties won a total of 49 seats. Elections in Bangladesh are held every five years, with provisions for an interim government appointed by the President to prevent unfair political advantage. The political environment in Bangladesh is characterized by intense rivalry between the BNP and AL, along with the presence of radical Islamist groups. Challenges include corruption, weak governance, human rights issues, communal conflict, environmental disasters, and poverty. Concerns also exist about security, Islamic militancy, and the military's potential political role despite pledges for democratic government. Former U.S. Ambassador Patricia Butenis highlighted the challenges faced by Bangladesh in establishing genuinely democratic political parties focused on national issues rather than personalities. Concerns arose before the 2007 election regarding political infighting, corruption, rising Islamist extremism, and violence targeting opponents of Islamization. There is worry that the 2008 elections may be delayed, leading to a further erosion of democracy. The acting leader of the Awami League, Zillur Rahman, stated that his party will not participate in the next general elections if held under a state of emergency. Sheikh Hasina, held on corruption charges, is a key figure for the party. The Bangladesh National Party has split into two factions. Street protests are threatened for Hasina's release. Polls are doubted to be held by the end of the year. The Bangladesh National Party has split into two factions, with one loyal to Khaleda Zia and another breaking away. Zia is under detention on corruption charges, and the breakaway faction led by Hafizuddin Ahmed is strengthening its claim to leadership. The recent rise in food costs is contributing to the destabilized political situation in Bangladesh. The rise in food costs in Bangladesh, exacerbated by natural disasters and global price increases, has led to acute shortages and doubled prices. This has caused riots in Dhaka and discontent with the government. More than half of Bangladesh's population are landless laborers who spend a significant portion of their income on food, worsening the crisis. The state of emergency in Bangladesh has emboldened parties to act, with the military-backed interim government increasingly seen as a threat to democracy. Corruption is widespread, with Bangladesh ranked among the most corrupt countries. Chittagong port, handling 90% of trade, is hampered by corruption. The Chittagong port, responsible for 90% of trade in Bangladesh, is affected by corruption and piracy. The caretaker government aims to eliminate political figures like Hasina and Zia through a \"minus two\" strategy, with limited success. A \"truth commission\" was formed to address fraud, with those confessing being banned from elections for five years. The Directorate General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI) is believed to hold significant power within the caretaker government. The military, led by Army Chief General Moeen Ahmed, aims to rid Bangladesh of corrupt leaders and ensure honest leadership comes to power. There are discussions about a proposed National Security Council (NSC) and uncertainty about uniform support for the military's objectives within the armed forces. General Ahmed's term has been extended to June 2009. The military, led by Army Chief General Moeen Ahmed, aims to eliminate corrupt leaders and promote honest leadership in Bangladesh. Concerns have been raised about the proposed National Security Council (NSC) potentially institutionalizing the military's role in state affairs. Internal tensions within the armed forces have arisen due to difficulties in handling economic issues, natural disasters, and the \"minus two\" strategy. There is a divide within the officer corps between senior and junior officers, with the latter group believing that senior officers have been corrupted by politics. General Ahmed is speculated to have presidential ambitions, and there are discussions about reforming the presidency to give more power to the president. The military in Bangladesh supports reforms to strengthen the presidency, allowing the president to remove an elected prime minister and dissolve parliament. The proposed National Security Council would aid the president's governance. The military's involvement in international peacekeeping may limit its actions. Bangladesh is a significant contributor to U.N. peacekeeping missions, with concerns that military actions could impact its peacekeeping contracts. The rise of Islamist influence in Bangladesh has been attributed to the failure of political elites to effectively govern, creating space for extremists. The May 2008 attacks in Jaipur, India, by Islamist extremists from Bangladesh, resulted in 80 deaths and 200 injuries. The May 13 bombings in Jaipur, India, are believed to have been carried out by the Bangladeshi group Harkat ul-Jihad-al-Islami, resulting in 80 deaths and 200 injuries. Indian investigators suspect Islamist extremism as a threat to communal harmony in India, with fears of reprisals against Indian Muslims. The caretaker government in Bangladesh executed six leaders of the extremist group Jamaatul Mujahideen Bangladesh in March 2007, showing resolve against terrorism. There are concerns that the current crisis in Bangladesh could create a vacuum for radical Islamists to exploit. The influence of Islamist extremism in Bangladesh was demonstrated by Islamist parties being coalition partners in the previous BNP government. The parties, Jamaat Islami and Islami Okiya Jote, with ties to radical extremists, enjoyed disproportionate political influence due to the close electoral balance between BNP and AL. The current split within BNP may lead to a more multi-party system, potentially reducing the influence of Islamist parties. Islamists rioted in Dhaka in April 2008 protesting a draft law for equal inheritance rights for women, leading to further protests in Chittagong. Several terrorist groups operate in Bangladesh, including HuJi, JMJB, and JMB. The presence of Islamist parties in the former ruling BNP Coalition government expanded Islamist influence, creating space for terrorist and extremist groups to operate. Islami Okiyya Jote has ties to the radical HuJI. Islami Okiyya Jote has ties to the radical Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami (HuJI), which is linked to Al Qaeda. HuJI has been implicated in terrorist attacks, including the 2002 attack on the American Center in Calcutta. The group is on the U.S. State Department's list of terrorist organizations and is believed to have connections to Pakistani militant groups. Former fundamentalist leader Bangla Bhai is reported to have ties to Jamaat-e-Islami. The previous government in Bangladesh has been accused of allowing communal extremist forces to operate freely. International extremists have reportedly obtained Bangladeshi passports with the help of sympathetic officials at Bangladesh Embassies. Members of Islami Okiyya Jote have been linked to the reemergence of Harkat ul Jihad (HuJi) under the name \"Conscious Islamic People.\" There are reports that the political wing of HuJi may enter politics as Islami Gono Andolon. The former BNP government denied the presence of significant terrorist elements in the country and expelled a lawmaker for speaking out against extremists. They eventually moved to suppress terrorist groups like Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen (JMB) and Jagrata Muslim Janata Bangladesh (JMJB). The government in Bangladesh sentenced JMB leaders Shaikh Abdur Rahman and Bangla Bhai to death for their role in bombings and the murder of two judges. They aimed to replace the secular legal system with Sharia law. The government also arrested numerous militants, including senior leaders, on terrorism charges. Despite this, the opposition leader Sheikh Hassina accused the government of having ties with militants. The former BNP government in Bangladesh shifted its stance on addressing Islamist militants in August 2005. JMB leader Rahman warned of exposing authorities, echoing allegations by the AL opposition of government involvement in allowing Islamist militancy to rise. Analyst Selig Harrison highlighted a growing Islamic fundamentalist movement linked to al-Qaeda and Pakistani intelligence agencies in Bangladesh. The strategically located nation of Bangladesh is becoming a new hub for terrorist operations reaching into India and Southeast Asia. Former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia's coalition with the Jamaat-e-Islami Party led to fundamentalist control over the economy, Islamist madrassas acting as fronts for terrorism, and rigging of elections. The State Department sees the government of Bangladesh working to stop terrorist activities. The government of Bangladesh is seen as working to thwart terrorist activities, with some successes in arresting leaders of major terrorist groups. However, there is still a lot of work to be done in terms of stopping other operatives. In July 2006, coordinated bomb blasts in Mumbai, India killed around 200 people and injured 500 others. In response to the coordinated bomb blasts in Mumbai, India in July 2006, Indian authorities arrested individuals with ties to terrorist groups in Bangladesh and Nepal, linked to Pakistan. Allegations were made that the bombers were backed by Pakistan-supported terrorist groups, but Pakistan denied these claims. Bangladesh authorities stated that the attacks in Bangladesh in August 2005 were of Indian origin. Six of the eight arrested in India had received training from Lashkar-e-Toiba in Pakistan, an Al Qaeda-allied terrorist group. The terrorism focus in India has shifted to Bangladesh, with BJP President Rajnath Singh urging the Indian government to pressure Bangladesh to dismantle terrorist training centers. The anti-terrorism squad investigating the Bombay blasts also interrogated individuals in a village in Tripura, India, near the Bangladesh border. A bombing in Varanasi in March 2006 was linked to HuJi in Bangladesh. Army forces captured Habibur Rahman Bulbuli in June 2007, who claimed to be a veteran of fighting in Afghanistan and a follower of Osama bin Laden. Bangladesh police charged Mufti Hannan in June 2007. In June 2007, Bangladesh police charged Mufti Hannan and three accomplices for attempting to assassinate the British High Commissioner Anwar Choudhury in 2004. Choudhury was injured in a grenade attack along with 50 others, resulting in three deaths. The Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) captured four suspected members of Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen with grenades and explosives near Kishoregani. Bangladesh faces economic challenges due to poverty, population growth, natural disasters, and political instability, despite having potential natural gas deposits for future prosperity. Bangladesh is facing economic challenges with high consumer price inflation, particularly in food staples. The country also experienced natural disasters like Cyclone Sidr and heavy flooding, leading to a shortfall in rice production. Underemployment is another key issue adding to the volatile political situation. Bangladesh's economic growth is expected to slow, with underemployment estimated at 24.5% of the population. GNP growth was 6.6% in 2006, projected to be 6.5% in 2007, and slow to 5.7% in 2008. Textile exports, labor issues, and weakened external demand are contributing factors. The garment sector accounts for 80% of exports and 40% of industrial jobs. Key export markets include the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, France, and Italy. Private consumption makes up 65% of GDP, and Bangladesh is believed to have significant natural gas reserves. Bangladesh has significant natural gas reserves, with estimates varying from 5 to over 32 trillion cubic feet. Natural gas makes up 80% of the country's commercial energy consumption. There have been talks of exporting gas to India, but the focus has been on meeting Bangladesh's energy needs. India is considering building a pipeline through Burma to access gas reserves. Burma earned $2.7 billion from gas exports in 2007. Bangladesh's population is predominantly Muslim, with smaller percentages of Hindus, Christians, and Buddhists. In Bangladesh, 10% of the population is Hindu, with the majority being Christian and Buddhist. There is relative peace between religious groups currently, but past conflicts during the struggle for independence in 1971 resulted in inter-communal strife and a large number of deaths. The state religion is Islam, but the Constitution allows for freedom of religion. Attacks on religious and ethnic minorities remain a concern, and religion plays a significant role in politics. The government in Bangladesh is sensitive to Islamic consciousness, but there are concerns about discrimination and violence against Hindu, Christian, and Buddhist minorities. The state of emergency and postponement of elections have undermined political rights, with freedoms like expression and press being suspended. The anti-corruption drive has raised due process concerns. The anti-corruption drive in Bangladesh raised concerns about due process. There was a decrease in extrajudicial killings by security forces, but they still acted with impunity and engaged in torture."
