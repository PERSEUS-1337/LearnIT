    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Comprehensive Torture Victims Relief Act\" and includes findings related to torture victims. The Congress finds that torture creates fear and insecurity, destroys individuals and society, and is used as a weapon against democracy by repressive governments. Torture victims face long-term physical and psychological threats, with perpetrators often not brought to justice. Many refugees and asylees entering the United States have been victims of governmental torture, deserving prompt consideration of their asylum applications for protection. Torture survivors living in the US should receive rehabilitation services to integrate into society. The treatment movement for torture survivors offers new opportunities for action. The treatment movement for torture survivors presents opportunities for action to oppose state-sponsored torture. A comprehensive strategy is needed to protect and support victims and eliminate torture globally. The US can help heal survivors and prevent torture by implementing provisions of the Convention Against Torture. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines terms according to the Immigration and Nationality Act. The term \"torture\" includes sexual violence by a person in authority. SEC. 4. PROHIBITION ON INVOLUNTARY RETURN OF PERSONS FEARING SUBJECTION TO TORTURE. The United States is prohibited from expelling, extraditing, or involuntarily returning an individual to a country if there is substantial evidence that the individual would fear torture. \"To return involuntarily\" means returning without consent, even if not induced by force, or taking actions that foreseeably lead to the individual's return. This section also addresses immigration procedures for torture victims. Any alien who presents a credible claim of torture in their country of nationality or last habitual residence and applies for refugee status, asylum, or withholding of deportation will be processed accordingly. Officials must consider the effects of torture on these applications. The processing of refugee applications for individuals claiming torture must consider the impact of torture on the applicant's ability to provide information, the challenges victims face in recounting their experiences, and the fear of returning to their country where their torturers may still hold power. Refugees with credible claims of torture are given priority in the selection process. Upon request, asylum officers may expedite asylum interviews or deportation proceedings for refugees with compelling humanitarian concerns to prevent further harm from torture. Additionally, refugees suffering from torture effects may be granted parole instead of detention upon entry to the United States. In cases where refugees exhibit symptoms of torture, such as depression and anxiety, parole under section 212(d)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act may be granted instead of detention. Congress urges the Attorney General to allocate resources for maintaining information on torture in foreign countries. Specialized training is required for consular, immigration, and asylum personnel. The Attorney General and Secretary of State provide specialized training for relevant officials on identifying evidence of torture, its effects, and how to interview victims without retraumatizing them. Gender-specific training is provided for interacting with male and female victims of torture by rape or sexual violence. The National Institutes of Health will study torture victims in the US since 1987 to identify their needs and available recovery services. A report with recommendations for increasing services will be submitted to Congress by December 31, 1997. Amendment to the Immigration and Nationality Act allows the Secretary to provide grants for programs in the US to assist torture victims with rehabilitation, social services, and training for healthcare providers. The definition of 'torture' follows the Comprehensive Torture Victims Relief Act. The Immigration and Nationality Act amendment authorizes funding for domestic centers and programs to treat victims of torture, following the definition in the Comprehensive Torture Victims Relief Act. Funding will be available from fiscal year 1996 onwards, with the effective date set for October 1, 1995. SEC. 9. FOREIGN TREATMENT CENTERS. Amendments to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 authorize the President to provide assistance for the rehabilitation of victims of torture through grants to treatment centers and programs in foreign countries. This assistance includes direct services to victims of torture and research/training for healthcare providers to treat the physical and psychological effects of torture. The amendment authorizes funding for the rehabilitation of torture victims in foreign countries, with funds remaining available until expended. The effective date of the amendment is October 1, 1995. SEC. 10. MULTILATERAL ASSISTANCE. Funding authorized for the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture: $4,000,000 for fiscal year 1996 and $5,000,000 for fiscal year 1997. Amounts appropriated shall remain available until expended. Congress urges the President to seek new ways to support and protect the Fund. The United States urges the Fund to support treatment centers for torture victims, back the Special Rapporteur on Torture, and establish a country rapporteur to investigate human rights violations. The United States urges the Fund to support treatment centers for torture victims and establish a country rapporteur to investigate human rights violations, indicating a systematic practice of torture in that country."
