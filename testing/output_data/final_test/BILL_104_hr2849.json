It establishes the Hudson and Mohawk Rivers National Historical Park and two specific sites. The Hudson and Mohawk Rivers in New York saw rapid industrial growth in the early 19th century, earning the title \"Birthplace of America's Industrial Revolution\". The area connected New England markets with other cities and Europe, fostering industries like collar manufacturing, iron, and textiles. The shift from agrarian to industrial society in this region brought about significant changes. The city of Troy and Cohoes in New York exemplified different relationships between workers and employers, with Troy leading in trade union development and Cohoes showcasing the influence of company towns on mill workers' lives. Harmony Mills in Cohoes, America's largest cotton mill, was a significant example of this company town model. Public Law 102-101 prompted a national labor theme study at Harmony Mills. The Harmony Mills complex and the Kate Mullaney house, home of the organizer of the first female union in the Nation, were nominated for National Historic Landmark status. This area serves as a reservoir of historic and cultural lands, waterways, and structures reflecting the diverse endeavors of American workers in creating a productive urban industrial society. The resources in this Hudson-Mohawk area offer opportunities for illustrating cultural themes of the U.S. heritage and for education, public use, and enjoyment. Seven cities, towns, and villages in the area have formed a cooperative arrangement. The Hudson-Mohawk Urban Cultural Park, also known as RiverSpark, is a cooperative arrangement among cities in the area to manage cultural resources. It has been designated as one of 14 urban cultural parks in New York, representing industrial development and labor themes. The park focuses on conservation, preservation, education, recreation, and economic development through partnerships between government and private entities. The purposes of this initiative are to preserve and interpret significant places for the benefit and education of the people of the United States. The Hudson-Mohawk Urban Cultural Park aims to preserve and interpret significant places representing the legacy of area workers, maintain the integrity of the setting, coordinate efforts for education and recreation, and enhance public understanding of the area's history and culture.
