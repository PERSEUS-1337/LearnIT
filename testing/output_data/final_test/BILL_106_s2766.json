    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Equal Access to Medicare Home Health Care Act of 2000\". Congress finds that over 30,000,000 Medicare beneficiaries rely on home health services for cost-effective care, enabling them to stay at home with dignity. The Medicare home health benefit reduces the burden on hospitals and skilled nursing facilities. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 was projected to cut $16.1 billion from Medicare home health. The Congressional Budget Office projected a $69.4 billion cut from the Medicare home health benefit between fiscal years 1998 and 2002, which is more than 4 times the reduction initially projected by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. The Health Care Financing Administration's delay in disbursing payments under the interim payment system has caused issues. The delay in implementing 1861(v)(1)(L) of the Social Security Act has led to overpayments to home health service providers, impacting their financial stability. Access to care for high-cost patients is a growing issue due to insufficient payments under the current system. The proposed regulation for a new payment system will split payments, with 50% upfront and 50% after the 60-day episode period. The Medicare program needs to ensure steady cash flow for home health service providers to support Medicare beneficiaries receiving necessary care during a 60-day episode period. Studies by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission have highlighted the importance of this for certain populations of beneficiaries. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 has led to concerns that Medicare beneficiaries may not receive essential home health services due to payment limitations, potentially perpetuating the crisis in the interim payment system. Elimination of 15 percent reduction in payment rates under the Medicare prospective payment system for home health services. The amendment to the Social Security Act involves the computation of a standard prospective payment amount based on audited cost report data for a 12-month period. The system shall calculate payment amounts based on audited cost report data for a 12-month period, standardized to account for case mix and wage adjustments, with recognition of regional and urban differences. Effective date is retroactive to the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999. SEC. 4. OVERPAYMENTS. (a) 36-Month Repayment Period for overpayments by the Secretary of Health and Human Services to home health agencies for services provided after October 1, 1997. Agencies can repay overpayments over 36 months. (b) Interest on Overpayment Amounts: No interest accrues on the outstanding balance during the 36-month repayment period if the agency elects to repay overpayments. Interest accrues on overdue balances of overpayments after the 36-month repayment period at the rate charged by banks for loans to their most favored commercial customers. If an agency does not make an election to repay overpayments, interest will accrue on the outstanding balance at the same rate. No election for cost reporting periods after implementation of prospective payment system for home health services under section 1895 of the Social Security Act. Effective date of subsection (a) is as if included in Balanced Budget Act of 1997. SEC. 5. Additional payments for services in rural areas and security services under the prospective payment system. Additional payment amounts for home health services in rural areas and security services are being increased under the Social Security Act. For home health services in rural areas, a 10 percent addition or adjustment to the payment amount will be provided. Additionally, there will be an additional payment for security services. The Secretary will provide additional payment for security services to individuals furnishing home health services in areas at risk of physical harm. The standard prospective payment amount for home health services will not be reduced for rural services and security services. The amendments made by this section will offset payment increases resulting from services furnished in rural areas and security services. Effective date is 270 days after enactment of the Act. Rule of construction regarding telehomehealth services. Rule of construction relating to telehomehealth services: Amendment to Section 1895(b) of the Act allows home health agencies to provide services via telecommunications without it being considered a home health visit for payment purposes. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will submit a report to Congress within one year of the Act's enactment, containing recommendations on the feasibility of including home health services provided through telecommunications systems for payment and physician certification requirements. The report to Congress will include recommendations on the feasibility of including home health services provided through telecommunications systems for payment and physician certification requirements under section 1814(a)(2)(C) of the Act."
