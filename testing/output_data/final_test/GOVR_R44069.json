    "content": "Barriers to sharing cybersecurity information within and across sectors hinder effective cybersecurity, especially for critical infrastructure like the financial system and electric grid. Private-sector entities cite concerns about legal liability, antitrust violations, and misuse of intellectual property as reasons for not sharing information. There are also concerns about risks of disclosure and government use of shared information. Some private-sector entities feel the federal government does not effectively share classified information with them. Barriers to sharing cybersecurity information within and across sectors hinder effective cybersecurity, especially for critical infrastructure like the financial system and electric grid. Private-sector entities cite concerns about legal liability, antitrust violations, and misuse of intellectual property as reasons for not sharing information. Institutional and cultural factors, such as traditional approaches to security emphasizing secrecy and confidentiality, impede information sharing. Most information sharing is voluntary through sector-specific ISACs or programs under the DHS. The Obama Administration established the National Cybersecurity and Communications. The Obama Administration established the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) in 2009 to enhance information sharing and incident response for critical infrastructure. Legislation like CISPA and CISA aimed to address obstacles to cybersecurity information sharing but faced challenges in passing through Congress. In the 113th Congress, cybersecurity bills like H.R. 624 and S. 2588 were introduced but did not pass the Senate. However, NCCIC was authorized under S. 2519, along with four other cybersecurity bills focusing on critical infrastructure protection, research, and workforce development. Additionally, bills like H.R. 1560 and H.R. 1731 were introduced and reported by House committees with proposed amendments. The committee reported H.Res. 212 ( H.Rept. 114-88 ) on two bills, allowing consideration of amendments. Amendments to H.R. 1560 were adopted, passing by 307 to 116. Similarly, amendments to H.R. 1731 were adopted, passing by 355 to 63. The bill, known as CISA, was passed by a vote of 355 to 63. A sunset amendment and all but one other amendment were adopted. A GAO study on privacy and civil liberties impacts was agreed to by recorded vote, 405 to 8. The bill was introduced as an amendment to H.R. 1735 but faced challenges before being debated in the Senate. The Senate passed CISA, with a manager's amendment, on October 27. Other bills on information sharing have been introduced in the 114th Congress, addressing concerns about cybersecurity information sharing. The NCPAA and PCNA bills focus on cybersecurity roles, with NCPAA emphasizing the DHS and NCCIC, while PCNA focuses on the IC and CTIIC. H.R. 2596 also addresses CTIIC, with opposition from the White House. CISPA and CISA address roles of DHS and the IC as well. The bills and proposals aim to facilitate information sharing among private-sector entities for cybersecurity purposes, with provisions for liability protection. Different bills cover various private-sector entities and information types, limiting government use for regulatory purposes. Some bills authorize private-sector entities to monitor and use defensive measures, while others do not. Privacy and civil liberties concerns are addressed in all proposals. The WHP, NCPAA, and S. 456 proposals focus on privacy and civil liberties concerns, with varying roles for key entities like the Attorney General and Chief Privacy Officers. They all require reports to Congress and include provisions to protect shared information from public disclosure. Additionally, they address the roles of information sharing and analysis organizations (ISAOs). The WHP, NCPAA, and S. 456 proposals focus on privacy and civil liberties concerns, with varying roles for key entities like the Attorney General and Chief Privacy Officers. They all require reports to Congress and include provisions to protect shared information from public disclosure. Additionally, they address the roles of Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations (ISAOs) in enhancing the security of critical infrastructure. Executive Order 13691 also plays a role in encouraging and facilitating the formation of ISAOs, coordinating with them on information sharing, and facilitating the sharing of classified cybersecurity information with appropriate entities. The White House supports the NCPAA and CISA bills, with a focus on cybersecurity of federal agencies and critical infrastructure sectors. They call for narrowing liability protections and adding safeguards for defensive measures. Concerns were raised about provisions in CISA by the Department of Homeland Security. Homeland Security raised concerns about provisions in CISA in July 2015. The White House announced support for CISA passage by the Senate with some reservations, particularly regarding defensive measures. Key issues in the debate over information-sharing legislation include types of information, sharing processes, information usage limitations, and necessary improvements to standards and practices. Improvements needed for efficient information sharing to protect information systems, networks, and contents include addressing privacy rights, civil liberties, and liability protections. Congressional debate may consider statutory protections to encourage private-sector entities to share cybersecurity information while balancing risks to established protections. Information sharing in cybersecurity can involve a wide range of material, from policies to threat intelligence. The sensitivity and value of shared information can vary, requiring human processing for usefulness. Shared information in cybersecurity can be used for various purposes, such as informing situational awareness, identifying defensive actions, and planning. The utility of shared information may vary for different users and sectors, with best practices being more useful for small businesses than advanced threat signatures. Shared information in cybersecurity is more useful for small businesses than advanced threat signatures. The information needs to be actionable and provided in a timely manner to be effective in defending against cyberattacks. If the information shared is not useful or lacks relevant details, recipients may be less likely to participate in information-sharing initiatives. The rapid sharing of actionable information in cybersecurity, known as \"real-time\" or \"near real-time\" sharing, is crucial for defending against cyberattacks. Timing is measured in seconds or milliseconds, with little time for human examination. Implementation of sharing affects operational effectiveness and privacy concerns. Increased information sharing may lead to overload, impacting cybersecurity effectiveness. The relationship between information volume and cybersecurity improvement is complex. Effective cybersecurity information sharing is challenging due to the vast amount of data available. Both providers and recipients incur costs in developing, processing, and applying the information. For sharing to be useful, the information must be relevant and easily applicable. However, an excessive amount of information can be counterproductive if it overwhelms the recipient and proves to be of little use. The current structure for cybersecurity information sharing is complex but limited in scope, involving multiple federal entities such as NCCIC, CTIIC, NCIJTF, and the federal Information Sharing Environment. Determining useful information to share can be challenging, as an excessive amount of irrelevant data can lead to misdirection and resource waste. The current structure for cybersecurity information sharing involves federal entities like NCCIC, CTIIC, NCIJTF, and the Information Sharing Environment. Different models exist for information sharing, including decentralized peer-to-peer and centralized hub-and-spoke like ISACs. ISACs are sector-specific organizations, but gaps in information sharing exist, prompting the proposal to broaden the scope of ISAOs. Absence of appropriate mechanisms can hinder information sharing for entities. A proliferation of sharing mechanisms, like the Administration's ISAO model, could hinder information sharing if it becomes inefficient or confusing. While it may improve coverage among sectors, it could also lead to duplication, overspecialization, and conflicting information. Market competition from duplication could drive innovation and rapid improvement in information sharing. The development of consensus standards and best practices can improve the effectiveness of information sharing. Adoption of standards can address concerns about reliability and utility of information received, especially as the number and scope of ISAOs grow. Market forces may lead to lower costs and innovation in information sharing, but could also result in higher costs and decision-making challenges for participants. A narrow, tightly defined structure for information sharing could impede innovation in response to the evolving cyberspace. The development of consensus standards and best practices can improve information sharing effectiveness, especially as the number and scope of ISAOs grow. Challenges exist in creating a common set of standards due to varying sharing requirements and benefits among different entities and sectors. However, the NIST cybersecurity framework experience suggests a flexible structure can be created for entities to identify appropriate standards. Privacy, confidentiality, and civil liberties protection in information sharing remain controversial areas. Concerns about privacy and civil liberties in legislation on information sharing have sparked debate. Provisions in the bills aim to reduce risks of inappropriate information sharing. Observers have varying opinions on the adequacy of safeguards, especially regarding privacy-related information in cybersecurity sharing. The issue is complex due to factors like advances in data analytics, known as \"big data.\" Data mining and analytics can uncover private information from seemingly harmless data sources. The impacts of these activities on privacy in information-sharing legislation have not been thoroughly analyzed. Legislation on information sharing is seen as necessary or beneficial, but concerns remain about potential risks to confidentiality and privacy. Sharing of information among private-sector entities may not significantly increase with proposed actions in the legislation. Information sharing is seen as necessary or beneficial, with benefits outweighing the risks for many organizations, especially when shared with the federal government. Timely and actionable information can help prevent or mitigate attacks. However, without incentives for reciprocity, organizations may not see the benefit of sharing information unless they are government entities or cybersecurity service providers. Indirect benefits may arise through reciprocity among sharing entities, but information sharing alone is not enough to improve cybersecurity. Sharing information alone is not sufficient to improve cybersecurity. The recipient must have processes in place to effectively use the information. Legal concerns and reputation costs may deter businesses from sharing information on cyberattacks. Government measures like data-breach notification requirements can incentivize organizations to share information to prevent future attacks or prosecute cybercriminals. Legislative proposals on information sharing aim to reduce risks for private-sector entities. Proposals for information sharing lack explicit incentives to stimulate provision, potentially hindering increased sharing under legislative proposals. Information sharing is just one aspect of cybersecurity, with concerns about overemphasis on its role. Organizations must also prioritize resources and processes for effective cybersecurity risk management. In the data breaches of federal employees' information by OPM, specific details on threats and defensive measures may not have prevented the attacks due to OPM's shortcomings in implementing FISMA requirements. Information sharing focuses on immediate concerns like cyberattacks, but cybersecurity also involves education, workforce, acquisition, cybercrime law, and long-term challenges like integrating security into hardware and software design. The report compares provisions in NCPAA, PCNA, and CISA related to information sharing, cybersecurity of federal agencies, critical infrastructure, and other cybersecurity matters. Some sections in the tables are interconnected, such as Sec. 203 of CISA being included in Table 1 due to its correspondence with provisions in Sec. 216 of NCPAA.
