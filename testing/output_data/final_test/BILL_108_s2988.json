The Long Term Care Quality and Consumer Information Improvement Act of 2004 includes Medicare payment adjustments for skilled nursing facilities based on quality data. Section 1888(e) of the Social Security Act is amended to establish 10-15 quality measures for skilled nursing facilities by July 1, 2005. The Long Term Care Quality and Consumer Information Improvement Act of 2004 includes Medicare payment adjustments for skilled nursing facilities based on quality data. Section 1888(e) of the Social Security Act is amended to establish 10-15 quality measures for skilled nursing facilities by July 1, 2005. The Secretary shall consult with residents, patient advocacy organizations, state regulatory representatives, skilled nursing facility industry representatives, and quality measure experts. One quality measure must relate to staffing levels in skilled nursing facilities. The quality measures for skilled nursing facilities established under the Long Term Care Quality and Consumer Information Improvement Act of 2004 include consideration of staffing levels and the mix of licensed staff. Risk adjustment methodology is applied to ensure differences in quality measures reflect care provided by facilities, not resident population characteristics. The risk adjustment methodology for skilled nursing facilities may exclude certain residents, stratify them into high-risk and low-risk groups, or use statistical adjustments like regression analysis. Special provisions are made for small facilities to determine which quality measures apply. The Secretary annually reviews and revises quality measures for skilled nursing facilities in consultation with relevant individuals and groups. Skilled nursing facilities must submit data to receive quality measures. Skilled nursing facilities must submit data to receive quality measures for payment adjustments under subparagraph (C) as required by the Secretary. Quality ratings are published annually on the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services website and in national newspapers. Each skilled nursing facility submitting data will receive a quality rating and additional payment amount based on established quality measures. The update and payment adjustment are provided to facilities that submit data as required by the Secretary. Each skilled nursing facility submitting data will receive the full market basket update for the following year. Payments will be adjusted based on quality measures starting from fiscal year 2006. In the preceding fiscal year, nursing facilities in the top 10 percent will receive a 2 percent increase in payment amounts, while those below the top 10 percent will not receive this increase. In the top 20 percent of skilled nursing facilities, payment amounts will be increased by 1 percent starting from fiscal year 2007 based on quality measures. The bottom 20 percent of nursing facilities may have payment amounts decreased by 1 percent if they do not submit data under quality measures. Additionally, small skilled nursing facilities may not be denied market basket updates or increases/reductions based on data submission. The Secretary ensures budget neutrality by limiting expenditures under this title to avoid exceeding the amount that would have been spent without the new paragraph. The Secretary will assume a budget baseline for skilled nursing facility services and conduct an evaluation of the implementation of the amendment. A report is due by December 31, 2007. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will submit a report to Congress by December 31, 2007, with recommendations based on an evaluation of skilled nursing facility services."
