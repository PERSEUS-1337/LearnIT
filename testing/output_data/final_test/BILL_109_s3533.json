    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Community Response System Initiative Act of 2006\" or the \"CRSI Act\". The findings are also included in the Act. Congress finds that injury is a leading cause of death in America, affecting over 2.4 million children annually. Prompt aid could save 50% of these lives. It is crucial to educate the public on emergency preparedness, including citizen-based training at the community level. This includes teaching children age-appropriate first aid, CPR, the Heimlich maneuver, and biohazard precautions. The United States Conference of Mayors adopted a resolution urging mayors to form a Community Response System Initiative Committee to address the need for first aid skills training. Studies show that such training increases children's willingness to assist in emergencies. Additionally, statistics on unintentional injury deaths and heart attacks in the US highlight the importance of CPR training in schools. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration suggests that teaching life-saving first aid skills to the public could significantly reduce the 22,000 preventable highway deaths in the US each year. Basic life supporting first aid education for children is emphasized. In this section, definitions are provided for terms like \"age-appropriate,\" \"appropriate municipal entity,\" \"children,\" \"emergency medical professional,\" \"emergency response provider,\" and \"local government.\" The Secretary of Homeland Security, through the Chief Medical Officer, will contract with an organization to provide funds for education and training in life supporting first aid to children, including scene safety procedures. The selected organization must have experience in training individuals, especially children, in life supporting first aid skills. They should use emergency medical professionals as instructors and work with government entities to promote public emergency preparedness. The selected organization must have experience in training individuals, especially children, in life supporting first aid skills. They should have a testing component for evaluation, accountability, and data collection, and be an affiliate of the Citizens Corps of the Department of Homeland Security. Funds provided will be used for creating educational materials, conducting training, and data collection. Priority will be given to emergency medical services, fire departments, law enforcement agencies, hospitals, and school nurses when providing funds to municipal entities under this section. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2007 through 2010 is set at $10,000,000 to carry out this Act."
