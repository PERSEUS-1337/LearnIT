    "content": "Shortly after becoming Secretary of State in April 2018, Mike Pompeo lifted the hiring freeze imposed by his predecessor, Rex Tillerson. The State Department plans to increase Foreign and Civil Service personnel levels in line with Congress' funding. The Trump Administration is implementing modernization projects to improve workforce readiness and address diversity concerns in the Foreign Service. The Trump Administration has been slow in nominating senior State Department positions, leading to concerns about lack of diversity and overstaffing. Some argue for personnel reform to restore the department's influence, while others criticize policies under Secretary Tillerson for weakening the Department of State. Senator Robert Menendez has expressed concern about the weak and understaffed Department of State under the Trump Administration. Secretary Pompeo aims to empower the department's personnel and ensure they understand the President's mission. Congress is interested in shaping the department's policies. The Foreign Service Act of 1980 established the modern-day Foreign Service, which is the United States' professional diplomatic corps. It outlines procedures for admission, appointment, promotion, and separation of Foreign Service members, reflecting congressional intent for over a century. The Foreign Service Act of 1980 established the modern-day Foreign Service as America's professional diplomatic corps, reflecting congressional intent for over a century. The Department of State also employs over 10,000 Civil Service employees. Congress has long been involved in governing the Civil Service, with the Pendleton Act of 1883 and the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 providing the legal framework. The Trump Administration's focus on changes for State Department personnel has sparked renewed congressional interest in ensuring any changes align with congressional prerogatives. The report provides a background summary of Department of State personnel infrastructure and practices, focusing on the Foreign Service and Civil Service categories. It highlights key statutes and authorities relevant to current workforce issues and identifies selected issues for Congress to address. The report highlights the history of the Department of State's personnel infrastructure and practices, emphasizing the limited staff and diplomatic representation in the late 18th century. It identifies key issues for Congress to consider regarding changes sought by the Trump Administration. The Department of State had limited diplomatic ties with several countries and employees' rank and salary were tied to specific positions. This system, known as the \"spoils system,\" required new appointments and compensation levels for overseas posts, leading to funding constraints and limited representation at larger posts like London and Paris. President Theodore Roosevelt criticized the \"spoils system\" for appointing officials based on patronage rather than merit. Congress established compensation levels for diplomatic positions in 1855, removing this power from the President's hands. U.S. consuls were provided with federal salaries based on their posting locations for the first time. The spoils system continued to be used for staffing the federal bureaucracy, leading to issues after the Civil War. Secretary of State Hamilton Fish threatened to resign if President Grant and his allies did not stop interfering with department operations and appointments. President Grover Cleveland implemented a merit system for the lower grades of the consular service in 1885. President Theodore Roosevelt professionalized the diplomatic service by implementing a merit system based on \"character, responsibility, and capacity\" for appointment. He created a Board of Examiners to develop an entrance examination system and oversee a merit promotion system for diplomatic and consular positions. The Stone-Flood Act of 1915 gave previous executive orders in this area the force of law, establishing salary levels, personnel classes, and appointment procedures. The Rogers Act of 1924 established the modern Foreign Service, combining diplomatic and consular services for the first time. It introduced the concept of \"rank-in-person\" for diplomatic personnel and defined Foreign Service Officers as permanent officers subject to promotion on merit. The Act also established grades and classes for Foreign Service Officers. The Rogers Act of 1924 established grades and classes for Foreign Service Officers, set salaries, required appointments after examination or probation, allowed for transfers between posts, and required appointments to be made with the advice and consent of the Senate. The Foreign Service Act of 1946 established a new Director General of the Foreign Service, a Foreign Service Board, and a Board of Examiners to improve administration. It also included improvements in assignments policy, promotion procedures, allowances, benefits, home leave, and the retirement system. The Foreign Service Act of 1980 (P.L. 96-465) created a new Senior Foreign Service, reformed overseas allowances and spousal rights, and aimed to maintain the professionalism of the Foreign Service. It established procedures based on merit principles and a rank-in-person classification system. Section 105 of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 outlines personnel actions based on merit principles for career members and candidates in the service. Section 301 requires the Secretary of State to prescribe various examinations for appointment to the service, while Section 211 mandates the President to establish a Board of Examiners for the Foreign Service to oversee these examinations. At least five members of the Board must not be Government employees. The Foreign Service Act of 1980 mandates the establishment of a Board of Examiners for the Foreign Service, with at least five members who are not Government employees. The Board evaluates the fitness and aptitude of career candidates for the service, and individuals admitted into the Foreign Service must serve a trial period before receiving a career appointment. The Foreign Service Act of 1980 establishes a Board of Examiners to evaluate career candidates for the service. Presidential appointments for various positions in the Foreign Service are outlined in Sections 301, 302, and 303, ensuring that appointments preserve the professional status of the organization. The Foreign Service Act of 1980 establishes a Board of Examiners to evaluate career candidates for the service. Presidential appointments for various positions in the Foreign Service are outlined in Sections 301, 302, and 303, ensuring that appointments preserve the professional status of the organization. Foreign Service officers, including Senior Foreign Service members, are appointed by the President with Senate approval and serve over multiple administrations. Salary classes, rather than individual positions, are established for Foreign Service personnel, maintaining a rank-in-person approach. The Foreign Service Act of 1980 establishes a merit-based system for appointing and promoting officers in the Foreign Service. The \"up or out rules\" require timely promotion or retirement for career members not meeting performance standards. Selection boards evaluate personnel based on merit for promotion within salary classes. The Foreign Service Act of 1980 establishes a merit-based system for appointing and promoting officers in the Foreign Service. Selection boards evaluate personnel for promotion based on performance, including factors like character, ability, conduct, and experience. The Secretary of State makes promotions in accordance with the boards' rankings. The Foreign Service Act of 1980 allows for the delay or removal of an individual from a promotion list in special circumstances. The Act also ensures that members cannot be separated without due process, with the Secretary of State having the authority to separate members for cause to promote efficiency. Members cannot be separated for misconduct without a hearing before the Foreign Service Grievance Board. The Foreign Service Grievance Board, authorized by the Foreign Service Act of 1980, ensures impartiality in cases of involuntary separation of Foreign Service employees. If a grievant's claim is valid, the Board can direct the Department of State to retain the member. Department of State personnel are categorized as Foreign Service or Civil Service, with various legal regulations governing different categories. The Foreign Service Act of 1980 governs categories of Department of State personnel, including Chiefs of Mission, U.S. diplomats, and locally employed staff. Congress can influence executive branch practices based on the employment category and associated legal authorities. The Constitution and The Foreign Service Act of 1980 grant Congress significant authority over the appointment and management of Foreign Service personnel. Congress has the power to advise and consent on the appointment of Ambassadors and other senior Department of State officials. The Foreign Service Act of 1980 defines the Foreign Service and its employees, including admission, appointment, promotion, and separation procedures. The Foreign Service Act of 1980 defines the Foreign Service and its employees, including admission, appointment, promotion, and separation procedures. It authorizes the Senior Foreign Service and the appointment of various personnel categories, operating in line with merit principles. The Act grants more discretion to the executive branch in certain areas, such as the assignment of Foreign Service Officers and salary classes. It also allows for shared responsibilities between the legislative and executive branches, like determining trial periods for career Foreign Service Officers. The Department of State has flexibility in determining trial periods for Foreign Service personnel, including Ambassadors and Ambassadors-at-Large. The President appoints these senior personnel with Senate advice and consent, except for special missions lasting up to six months or through recess appointments. The President appoints Ambassadors and Ambassadors-at-Large with Senate advice and consent. Ambassadors heading U.S. missions are designated as \"Chief of Mission\" (COM) and serve as the President's personal representative in diplomatic efforts under the supervision of the Secretary of State. COM authority is granted by the Foreign Service Act of 1980. The President appoints Ambassadors and Ambassadors-at-Large with Senate advice and consent. Ambassadors serve as the President's personal representative in diplomatic efforts under the supervision of the Secretary of State. Approximately 70% of U.S. ambassadorship appointees are career Foreign Service Officers. Ambassadors-at-Large are appointed by the President to help with emergent problems worldwide. Ambassadors-at-Large, appointed by the President, serve globally to address emergent issues or conduct negotiations as needed. They are based in Washington, DC and rank below assistant secretaries of state. Foreign Service Officers work in consular, economic, management, political, or public diplomacy roles within the Foreign Service. Foreign Service Officers, also known as \"Foreign Service Generalists,\" are flexible diplomats appointed by the President after a trial period. Their mission is to promote peace, support prosperity, and protect American citizens while advancing U.S. interests abroad. The Foreign Service Act of 1980 establishes a trial period of service for Foreign Service Officers, with a maximum of five years. It also sets up a salary schedule with nine classes for compensation and outlines the promotion process based on merit principles and the needs of the Foreign Service. Foreign Service Specialists provide technical, management, healthcare, or administrative services at Department of State posts. They are appointed by the Secretary of State, not presidentially. There are 19 specialist jobs in categories like administration, information technology, and medical services, created by the Department of State. The Department of State administers a career candidate program for Foreign Service Specialists separate from the program for Foreign Service Officers. Foreign Service Specialists serve under career or limited appointments and are compensated through the same means as Foreign Service Officers. They are entitled to the same statutory protections as Foreign Service Officers. The Foreign Service Act of 1980 established a Senior Foreign Service (SFS) as the corps of senior leaders and experts for the management of the service. The Senior Foreign Service (SFS) was created to address an excess of senior officers in the Department of State. Congress implemented higher entrance standards and time-in-class limitations to prevent bloating of the SFS ranks and ensure alignment with available senior-level positions. Officers exceeding these limitations are required to retire from the Foreign Service. The President can appoint career members of the Senior Foreign Service (SFS) with Senate approval, including conferring the rank of career ambassador for distinguished service. The Secretary of State can make limited, noncareer appointments to the SFS, but there are restrictions to prevent exceeding 5 percent of the total Senior Foreign Service members. The Foreign Service Act of 1980 prescribes salary classes for the Senior Foreign Service (SFS) and titles for each class. Promotion within the SFS is based on moving from one salary class to the next. The Department of State employs 50,225 Locally Employed Staff (LES), including Foreign Service Nationals (FSNs) and Appointment Eligible Family Members (AEFMs). The Department of State employs Locally Employed Staff (LES), including Foreign Service Nationals (FSNs) and Appointment Eligible Family Members (AEFMs). FSNs are appointed by individual overseas posts and provide continuity at overseas posts. They are hired under local compensation plans based on prevailing wage rates. The Department of State employs Locally Employed Staff (LES), including Foreign Service Nationals (FSNs) and Appointment Eligible Family Members (AEFMs). FSNs are appointed based on prevailing wage rates and compensation practices in the locality of employment, as provided by Section 408 of the Foreign Service Act of 1980. The Office of Overseas Employment in the Bureau of Human Resources handles human resources policies for FSNs, including recruitment, position evaluation, classification, and compensation. Family members of government employees can be appointed for positions typically filled by Foreign Service officers, personnel, and foreign national employees under Section 311(a) of the Foreign Service Act of 1980. The Department of State employs Appointment Eligible Family Members (AEFMs) who must be U.S. citizens, spouses or domestic partners of sponsoring employees, listed on travel orders, and residing at the post of assignment abroad. AEFMs can be employed through family member appointments or temporary appointments, with compensation based on the Foreign Service Schedule. The Department of State employs Appointment Eligible Family Members (AEFMs) through temporary appointments lasting one year or less. The Family Member Employment Program recognizes the challenges of finding meaningful employment overseas for family members of Foreign Service employees. Despite the lifting of the federal hiring freeze, the Department of State has chosen to maintain its freeze on hiring. The Department of State elected to maintain its hiring freeze, including for AEFMs, which drew criticism for harming morale at overseas posts and hindering important tasks. Despite exemptions granted by Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan, the hiring freeze on AEFMs was lifted by then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in December 2017. Secretary Pompeo announced the lifting of the hiring freeze on AEFMs in May 2018, following Tillerson's directive. The Department of State employs over 10,000 Civil Service employees involved in various policy and management areas. The Department of State employs over 10,000 Civil Service employees in various policy and management areas, serving as a counterpart to Foreign Service consular officers. The staffing levels and global presence of the department have increased significantly throughout American history, with a notable growth in the 20th century. For example, the number of domestic State Department employees increased from 1,128 in 1940 to 3,767 in 1945, while the number of Foreign Service personnel increased from around 1,650 in the years following World War II to 3,436 by the end of 1957. In more recent years, the total number of Foreign Service Generalists and Specialists has increased from 11,555 in 2008 to 13,676 in 2017, and the number of Civil Service employees increased from 9,262 to 10,503 over the same period. The number of Foreign Service and Civil Service employees at the Department of State declined from December 2016 to December 2017. The American Foreign Service Association (AFSA) expressed concern about reductions in Senior Foreign Service Officers, with declines in Career Minister and Minister Counselor ranks. AFSA attributed the declines to department decisions to reduce promotions. The American Foreign Service Association (AFSA) expressed concern about reductions in Senior Foreign Service Officers, attributing the declines to department decisions to slash promotions. The Department of State will face challenges in replacing lost talent quickly due to the recruitment and development process. Department officials attribute the decline in Senior Foreign Service personnel to Senate inaction in approving promotions. Congress has a longstanding interest in State Department personnel matters. In 2017, reports from the Atlantic Council and the American Academy of Diplomacy recommended reforms for the State Department, including redesigning personnel processes and increasing front line staff. The Heritage Foundation also suggested longer assignments abroad, qualified ambassador appointments, and evaluations. The 115th Congress is addressing State Department personnel issues, including efforts to enhance workforce capabilities and performance reviews. Concerns have been raised about staffing levels and the department's ability to fulfill its mission. The Department of State is facing concerns about staffing levels and its ability to fulfill its mission. Congress is also monitoring the nomination process for senior department positions and oversight of efforts to diversify the Foreign Service. The Impact Initiative, part of the Redesign project, was released on February 12, 2018. The Impact Initiative is part of the Redesign project initiated by former Secretary Tillerson to improve efficiency and accountability in the Department of State. Secretary of State designate Pompeo will review and potentially implement some of the initiative's priorities to modernize processes and technology, fostering a culture of continuous improvement and strong leadership. The Impact Initiative includes 16 key modernization projects in three focus areas: Modernizing Information Technology and Human Resources Operations, Modernizing Global Presence and Policy Implementation, and Improving Operational Efficiencies. These projects were developed based on feedback from a listening tour and survey conducted with Department of State personnel. The \"Workforce Readiness\" initiative aims to address delays in staffing, lack of developmental opportunities, and skills mismatch in Department of State personnel. It seeks to provide flexibility in employment types, clarity on needed skills, and responsiveness to changing mission dynamics. The Department of State is implementing a \"Workforce Readiness\" project to recruit top talent, develop a workforce with the right skills, and create new career models. They are assessing their operational state and plan to have a workforce readiness implementation plan by spring 2018. Additionally, they are developing a talent framework with a completion date of September 2019 and a strategic workforce plan and civil service hiring pilot program planned for 2020. The Department of State is focusing on improving performance management to foster accountability and address under-performing staff. Their modernization project aims to enable frequent, timely, and substantive discussions for employee recognition and support. This initiative also includes tools for performance improvement and the expedited removal of poor performers. The Department of State is redesigning its performance management system and developing new programs from 2018-2020. Congress has provided oversight on the redesign effort, including restrictions on funds for implementation without consultation. Additionally, recent legislation aligns with the department's goals to enhance workforce readiness and improve performance management and personnel accountability. The Department of State is implementing new security training requirements for personnel assigned to high-risk posts, aiming to increase the pool of capable individuals for deployment during overseas crises. Legislation also emphasizes recruiting individuals with experience in predominantly Muslim countries to better align personnel skills with mission demands and strengthen the capacity of the Office of Inspector General. The Department of State is enhancing its capacity for accountability by requiring timely reporting of allegations of waste, fraud, and abuse. Congress may provide additional oversight and direction for the implementation of workforce readiness initiatives. The Impact Initiative modernization projects could be modeled after Section 7081(b)(3) of P.L. 115-141 to consider new conditions for Department of State personnel. Congress could authorize additional training programs similar to those mandated by Section 121 of P.L. 114-323 to improve workforce readiness. This could be done if Congress believed the Administration's efforts were incorrectly targeted, with appropriations for such programs provided through additional funds. The State Department may receive additional funds for programmatic areas through appropriations to the Human Resources Programmatic Allocation. Efforts to improve performance management and employee accountability could lead to amendments in the Foreign Service Act of 1980. Congress may consider adjusting provisions related to separation of Senior Foreign Service Officers and Foreign Service Officers. The Board determines cause for separation has been established, and Congress may adjust provisions for Secretary of State to separate Foreign Service members. President Trump froze federal civilian hiring, later lifted by OMB M-17-22, but State Department maintained freeze for internal redesign plan. Former Secretary Tillerson issued hiring freeze waivers for new Foreign Service Officers. Some Members of Congress and observers recommended the Department of State rescind the hiring freeze to maintain U.S. diplomats' capacity to protect national interests. Despite the freeze, the Department of State had a comparable number of Foreign Service Employees in 2017. The Department of State planned to reduce its workforce by nearly 2,000 employees, or approximately 8%, by the end of FY2018 through attrition and buyouts. The reductions would focus on the Civil Service, with numbers declining by around 12%, and the Foreign Service, with numbers declining by approximately 4%. Additionally, the department offered $25,000 voluntary buyouts to selected personnel to further reduce staffing by an additional 641 employees. The State Department offered $25,000 voluntary buyouts to reduce staffing by 641 positions through the VSIP program. Concerns were raised about potential brain drain and reductions in Senior Foreign Service personnel. The AFSA expressed worry over the rapid loss of senior officers. The AFSA expressed concern over the rapid loss of senior officers, emphasizing the impact on the United States' ability to influence global events. Department of State officials argued that personnel reductions would enhance efficiency and accountability, noting that employment levels were similar to those under the Obama Administration. Secretary Pompeo's approach towards department personnel appears to differ following his confirmation. In 2018, Secretary Pompeo lifted hiring freezes for AEFMs and Foreign/Civil Service Officers to fill essential positions. The Department of State planned to return staffing levels to those in place on December 31, 2017, in line with the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 appropriated $2.77 billion to the State Department's Human Resources category for salaries of American employees. Congress has the power to determine agency funding and appropriations, including for hiring Foreign or Civil Service officers. The Impoundment Control Act requires the President to spend appropriated funds unless rescinded by Congress. The Department of State is now seeking to increase personnel levels in line with congressional funding. Congress could appropriate more funds to the Human Resources category to further increase hiring. The Department of State is seeking to increase personnel levels with congressional funding. Congress could provide guidance on fund usage and consider expanding hiring to address potential personnel shortages. Shortages in certain ranks within the Foreign Service may prompt Congress to expand the three-year pilot program for mid-career entry. The appointment process for the 266 PAS positions at the Department of State involves selection by the President and Senate confirmation. The Trump Administration's pace of selecting nominees for these positions has been under scrutiny. The Trump Administration has been criticized for the slow pace of nominating candidates for Assistant Secretary of State positions. As of May 14, 2018, nominations had not been sent to the Senate for seven positions. The Senate had confirmed 10 nominations, with five more awaiting action. President Trump has transmitted state nominations and has yet to act on five additional nominations. He has not submitted nominations for ambassadorships to key countries. Secretary of State Pompeo is prioritizing filling senior vacancies to strengthen the diplomatic corps. Opinions vary on the responsibility for the slow pace of appointments. President Trump has expressed that filling all presidential appointment positions is not necessary and blames the Senate for the slow pace of appointments. Senator Menendez criticized the Administration for not nominating individuals for Senate-confirmed positions at the Department of State. Representative Rohrabacher emphasized the importance of having the president's nominees in key positions to direct policy. Some Members of Congress and observers believe that delays in nominating key positions at the State Department are hindering American foreign policy and national security interests. President Trump has downplayed the importance of these positions, while others emphasize the need for his nominees to direct policy. Some argue that acting officials at the State Department lack a long-term mandate and endorsement from the President, impacting their ability to engage with foreign officials and address emerging policy challenges. Vacancies have stretched department personnel thin, hindering their ability to fulfill their mission. Observers are concerned about continued vacancies for important country ambassador positions, suggesting that the Administration's inaction in designating nominees could signal a devaluation of key alliances and partnerships abroad. The Senate has the authority to provide advice and consent for presidential appointments of ambassadors and other public ministers and consuls, with Congress leveraging this authority for the Department of State. Congress has taken actions to expedite the process of filling Department of State PAS positions by eliminating the requirement for advice and consent for 163 positions, including selected positions within the Department of State. This was done through the Presidential Appointment Efficiency and Streamlining Act in 2012. The Senate passed S.Res. 116 in 2011 to create a new process for Senate consideration of nominations to 272 positions, bypassing formal committee consideration unless any single Senator objected. The Senate could further reduce the number of Department of State positions requiring advice and consent. On November 21, 2013, the Senate reinterpreted the \"cloture rule\" to lower the threshold for invoking cloture, allowing a simple majority of Senators to restrict the time for considering nominees. The Senate reinterpreted the cloture rule in 2013 to lower the threshold for invoking cloture, allowing a simple majority of Senators to restrict the time for considering nominees. Some Members of Congress argue against changing the cloture process, believing that the Senate's ability for lengthy debate is vital for its legislative role. The Senate's deliberative function is crucial for its role as a check on the executive branch, specifically in executive business like nominations and treaties. The Foreign Service Act of 1980 aims to make the Foreign Service more representative of the American people in terms of race, gender, socioeconomic background, and regional origin. The Foreign Service Act of 1980 requires the Secretary of State to establish a minority recruitment program and provide annual reports to Congress on equal employment opportunity. Congress also amended the State Department Basic Authorities Act in 1990 to promote knowledge and interest in employment with the Foreign Service among minority students. Grants have been provided for programs like the Thomas R. Pickering Foreign Affairs. The Department has funded the Thomas R. Pickering Foreign Affairs and Charles B. Rangel International Affairs Fellowship Programs since 1992 and 2002, respectively. These programs offer up to $37,500 annually for graduate school expenses and require fellows to serve at the department for five years after completion. Recent legislation increased the number of fellows selected each year and called for enhanced recruitment at minority-serving institutions. Former Secretary Tillerson was involved in these efforts. Former Secretary Tillerson emphasized the importance of diversity in the Foreign Service, promoting equal opportunity and enriching the department's work with different perspectives. He focused on broadening recruiting efforts, increasing diversity among senior personnel, and training minority employees for leadership roles. Secretary Pompeo also prioritizes diversity, stating that the workforce must be diverse in every sense. He has not commented on former Secretary Tillerson's efforts. Former Secretary Tillerson and Secretary Pompeo both emphasized the importance of diversity in the Foreign Service. While Tillerson focused on recruiting efforts and training minority employees for leadership roles, Pompeo has not commented on these efforts. Congress could pass a measure to explicitly authorize programs like the Rangel and Pickering Fellowships to ensure they are funded at a level reflecting congressional intent. Congress could potentially direct the Administration to expand efforts to recruit veterans into the Foreign Service by authorizing veteran-centered recruitment programs. This could be done through general authorizations modeled on existing legislation or through more targeted authorizations to establish specific programs. Various legislative options are available to Congress, including foreign relations authorization measures and annual appropriations bills, to enact new laws or amend existing ones in this area. The 115th Congress is considering authorization bills for FY2018 that could address personnel issues at the Department of State, such as staffing levels, diversity, and Senate approval for senior positions. The Department of State Authorities Act, Fiscal Year 2017, provided new authorities for security training, compensation, Civil Service opportunities, and lateral entry into the Foreign Service. The authorization bills for FY2018 (S. 1631 in the Senate and H.R. 5592 in the House) would address additional personnel matters if enacted."
