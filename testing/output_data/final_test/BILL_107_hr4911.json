It also defines key terms for the Act. SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n(1) \"wildland-urban restoration charter forest demonstration project\" and \"demonstration project\" refer to the project required for National Forest System lands in Colorado.\n(2) \"community management council\" and \"council\" are the appointed councils under section 5.\n(3) \"covered National Forest System lands\" include Pike and San Isabel National Forests and Cimarron and Comanche National Grasslands.\n(4) \"independent scientific panel\" and \"panel\" are assembled by the Secretary under section 4.\n(5) \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Agriculture, acting through the Chief of the Forest Service. SEC. 3. WILDLAND-URBAN RESTORATION CHARTER FOREST DEMONSTRATION PROJECT FOR PIKE AND SAN ISABEL NATIONAL FORESTS AND CIMARRON AND COMANCHE NATIONAL GRASSLANDS. The Secretary of Agriculture will conduct a wildland-urban restoration charter forest demonstration project for specified national forests and grasslands to increase community involvement in decision-making and evaluate methods to improve forest management. The project will start after an initial report and last for 10 years. During the demonstration project, the Secretary will manage the covered National Forest System lands according to all applicable laws and regulations. SEC. 4. INDEPENDENT SCIENTIFIC REVIEW AND MONITORING. The Secretary will assemble a scientific panel to assess the sustainability of National Forest System lands, considering factors like forest health and economic productivity. The panel will submit a report to the Secretary and Congress within one year. Additionally, the panel will prepare a monitoring plan for a demonstration project. The panel will prepare a monitoring plan to track the implementation of the wildland-urban restoration charter forest demonstration project. After five years and completion of the project, the panel will revise the assessment and evaluate the impacts on ecological, social, and economic sustainability of National Forest System lands. SEC. 5. COMMUNITY MANAGEMENT COUNCIL. The Secretary will establish a community management council for the wildland-urban restoration project to advise on environmental, economic, and social issues related to National Forest System lands. The council will assist in setting management priorities and developing environmental impact statements. The council for the wildland-urban restoration project will consist of 13 members appointed by the Secretary. Five members will be appointed from nominations by the Governor of Colorado, four from the senior Senator, and four from the junior Senator. Members should be from nearby communities and represent various interests like conservation, forest products, and local government. They should have the ability to work collaboratively on complex land management issues. The council for the wildland-urban restoration project consists of 13 members appointed by the Secretary, representing diverse interests like conservation and local government. The Forest Supervisor serves as an ex officio member, vacancies are filled in the same manner as the original appointment, and non-Federal employees serve without compensation. The council may request staff assistance from the Secretary, meetings must be announced in advance and open to the public, and records must be maintained. The council for the wildland-urban restoration project maintains meeting records available for public inspection and is exempt from the Federal Advisory Committee Act. SEC. 6. RELATION TO NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT OF 1969. The Secretary will develop a programmatic environmental impact statement for the wildland-urban restoration charter forest project with the advice of the community management council. The statement will address land and resource management goals for the National Forest System lands. The programmatic environmental impact statement for the wildland-urban restoration charter forest project will include desired landscape conditions, management outcomes, standards, guidelines, and a monitoring plan to ensure consistency with goals and objectives. Legal requirements mandate compliance with Federal environmental statutes. The Resources Planning Act of 1974 requires the Secretary to only carry out projects on National Forest System lands that comply with the Act and the programmatic environmental impact statement. The statement becomes operative upon approval by the Secretary and the council, and if a project is consistent with the Act and statement, additional analysis under the National Environmental Policy Act is not required. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 allows for projects or activities to proceed under certain conditions, even if they are not consistent with other regulations. If a project is found to be inconsistent, it must be revised to align with the environmental impact statement or the statement must be amended to comply with the Act. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act of 1974 require projects to be compatible with the programmatic environmental impact statement. Individuals or entities can challenge the Secretary's determination by filing a predecisional objection. If the Secretary agrees with the appellant, the project can proceed if it is not incompatible with the environmental impact statement. The Secretary may not conduct a project or activity if it is not compatible with the programmatic environmental impact statement, unless the project is revised or the statement is amended. SEC. 7. PREDECISIONAL REVIEW PROCESS FOR DEMONSTRATION PROJECT. The Secretary will establish a predecisional review process for site-specific projects in the wildland-urban restoration charter forest demonstration project on National Forest System lands. This process will not replace required environmental analysis and will include notice and the right to request review before final decisions are made. The Secretary will establish a predecisional review process for site-specific projects in the wildland-urban restoration charter forest demonstration project on National Forest System lands. This process allows individuals or entities who submitted written comments during the project preparation stage to request a review of a proposed decision within 30 days. The review must be completed before the final decision is issued, and there is an exemption for decisions responding to unexpected or serious events. The predecisional review process for site-specific projects in the wildland-urban restoration charter forest demonstration project on National Forest System lands requires individuals or entities to exhaust this process before challenging a project in court. The Secretary's expert judgment on scientific data related to management activities is given deference during the review, and there is a relation to Forest Service decision-making and appeals. The demonstration project activities are exempt from the predecisional review process outlined in the Department of the Interior Appropriations Act, which relates to Forest Service decision-making and appeals. SEC. 8. STEWARDSHIP CONTRACTING AUTHORITY. The Secretary may enter into stewardship contracts for National Forest lands to achieve land management goals. These contracts are in addition to other authorized contracts. SEC. 9. RETENTION AND USE OF RECEIPTS. During the wildland-urban restoration charter forest demonstration project, the Secretary retains proceeds from timber sales and permits for National Forest lands. These funds are used for projects prioritizing forest health, restoration, and invasive species control. The Secretary consults with the council in selecting projects. Authorization of appropriations is also provided. Authorization of appropriations is provided for the Secretary to receive $1,000,000 annually from 2003 to 2005 to implement the Act."
