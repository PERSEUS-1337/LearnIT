    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Earned Income Credit Public Awareness Campaign Act\". The Congress finds that the earned income credit provided significant tax relief to low-income taxpayers, assisting millions of individuals and children to rise above the poverty line. However, a significant percentage of eligible individuals do not claim the credit due to lack of awareness or assistance. The Taxpayer Advocate's Fiscal Year 2002 Annual Report highlights the complexity of tax laws for low-income families, leading them to rely on paid tax preparers for claiming credits like the Earned Income Tax Credit. Data from 2002 IRS shows that 68 percent of EITC recipients pay for tax preparation services. According to the Taxpayer Advocate's Fiscal Year 2002 Annual Report, nearly 68 percent of Earned Income Credit recipients pay for tax preparation services, with an estimated $994 million in refunds paid directly to tax preparers. Low-income families face challenges in affording tax preparation services and products, highlighting the need for consumer education campaigns. Increasing public awareness about the earned income credit can help low-income families and individuals utilize the credit more effectively when making tax-related decisions. SEC. 3. EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT AWARENESS CAMPAIGN. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue will establish a national public awareness campaign to educate Americans about the earned income credit. Special efforts will be made to reach out to low-income families, students, single parents, businesses, limited English proficient individuals, transient workers, and military personnel. The Commissioner will distribute educational materials nationwide, conduct a media campaign on the earned income tax credit, encourage businesses to share materials with employees, and make materials available in public locations. Annual reports detailing these efforts will be submitted to Congress. The Commissioner will submit a report to Congress detailing activities and recommendations for amendments to the Act. SEC. 4. EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT STATE GRANT PROGRAM. The Commissioner will provide grants to State agencies for earned income credit public awareness campaigns. Each State will receive an allotment based on the number of earned income credit claims. States must provide matching funds to be eligible for the grant. Applications are required to receive an allotment. To receive funding under this Act, States must submit an application to the Commissioner with required information. Within 180 days of receiving funding, States must report on steps taken to implement the Act. Funding for this section will range from 25% to 50% of the total appropriation. Authorization of Funds: $15,000,000 authorized annually for the Internal Revenue Service from 2004 to 2014. Administrative expenses limited to 3% of funds appropriated."
