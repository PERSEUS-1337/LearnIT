    "content": "In FY2018, SNAP provided food assistance to 40.3 million people in 20.1 million households, costing $60.6 billion. Participation and costs increased due to recession responses from FY2007 to FY2013, but declined in FY2014. States also adopted more expansive eligibility rules during this period. This report discusses categorical eligibility for SNAP, including traditional, narrow, and broad-based categories. States have the option to implement broad-based eligibility, which may impact states differently. State practices and potential changes are outlined to gauge impacts. SNAP is typically reauthorized in omnibus farm bills, with recent bills not including changes to eligibility. The 2014 and 2018 Farm Bills did not make changes to SNAP categorical eligibility rules, despite initial proposals to limit or eliminate broad-based eligibility. The Trump administration has not altered the statute on categorical eligibility in recent years. The Trump Administration plans to change SNAP eligibility rules via regulation, as discussed in \"Recent Proposals to Change Categorical Eligibility.\" Federal law outlines two pathways for SNAP eligibility: meeting income and resource criteria or being categorically eligible through other low-income assistance programs. SNAP provides eligibility based on low income and limited assets, with households needing to meet specific income thresholds. In FY2019, households with an elderly or disabled member must have monthly gross income below 130% of the federal poverty guidelines, with a limit of $2,252 for a household of three. Liquid assets must be below $2,250 for regular households and $3,500 for households with elderly or disabled members. Certain assets like the home and some vehicles are excluded from the asset limit. States have the option to further exclude vehicle value from the limit. States have the option to exclude vehicle value from the asset limit for SNAP benefits. Categorically eligible households, who receive benefits from specific programs, bypass income and resource tests for SNAP eligibility. Their benefits are determined based on household size and net countable income. The SNAP benefit amount is based on household size and net countable income after deductions. Eligible households of one or two persons receive a minimum monthly benefit of $15. Special rules for expedited eligibility of cash assistance recipients were reinstated in the 1980s through 1990 to simplify administration and ease entry into the program. The Food Security Act of 1985 established categorical eligibility for households receiving cash aid from AFDC, SSI, or state-run GA programs to streamline eligibility for food stamps. This was further shaped by the 1996 welfare reform law, replacing AFDC with TANF. TANF is a cash welfare program with broad flexibility for states to use funds. It aims to assist needy families, promote work and marriage, reduce out-of-wedlock pregnancies, and support two-parent families. States have authority to use TANF funds to achieve these goals. TANF funds a variety of benefits and services to help needy families with children, beyond traditional cash assistance programs. States have flexibility in determining income thresholds for these need-tested benefits, which can be available to families with higher income levels without an asset test. TANF services are available to all individuals in a state, not just families with children, and do not require a need test. The 1996 welfare reform law did not change SNAP law significantly regarding categorical eligibility, but replaced AFDC with TANF, giving states broader authority to offer different benefits and services. This expansion allowed states to convey categorical eligibility based on receipt. The 2000 USDA regulations allow states to convey SNAP categorical eligibility based on a wide range of human services instead of just cash welfare. States must make households categorically eligible for SNAP if all members receive cash assistance funded by TANF or noncash aid funded at least 50% by TANF. Restrictions apply if the benefit is aimed at specific TANF goals. The state can choose a program with an income limit of 200% of the federal poverty guideline to promote two-parent families. States have the option to make households categorically eligible for SNAP if they receive noncash assistance funded by TANF or MOE. SNAP applicants can be eligible based on benefits from other means-tested programs like TANF. States have the option to include a long list of benefits/services that can convey SNAP eligibility, based on the 1996 welfare reform law. The USDA categorizes states into three groups based on their practices on categorical eligibility for SNAP. Households receiving need-tested cash aid from SSI, GA, or TANF are automatically eligible for SNAP. States have varying income and asset eligibility rules for TANF and GA, while SSI sets a federal income floor. Some states have expanded categorical eligibility for SNAP through cash and certain noncash benefits. States have broad-based categorical eligibility policies for SNAP, making most low-income households categorically eligible. This includes receipt of TANF-funded services aimed at reducing out-of-wedlock pregnancies or promoting two-parent families. 40 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, and the Virgin Islands have implemented these policies. The Department of Agriculture tracks states using broad-based categorical eligibility for SNAP, where households below a certain income threshold are automatically eligible. This policy requires receiving or being authorized for a minimal TANF- or MOE-funded benefit or service. As of February 2018, 42 jurisdictions have implemented this policy. As of February 2018, 42 jurisdictions have broad-based categorical eligibility for SNAP, making most households eligible. Table 1 shows the states using this eligibility as of October 2018. 41 states make all family types eligible, with 37 having no asset test. 13 states require households with elderly or disabled members above 200% of the poverty guidelines to meet asset tests. Six states apply asset tests for all households, and 33 have a gross income limit above 130% of the poverty guidelines. According to USDA policy, states administer broad-based categorical eligibility for SNAP applicants by collecting basic income information. If the income is below the limit specified, a TANF-funded benefit is provided, making the household SNAP eligible. In the District of Columbia, applicants with gross income below 200% of poverty receive a brochure for a program. Broad-based categorical eligibility for SNAP allows households with gross incomes up to 200% of poverty to qualify for the program. Concerns about potential program expansion have not been realized, as only a small percentage of households exceed the 130% of poverty income limit. Table 3 displays the number and percentage of households without elderly or disabled members with incomes above 130% of poverty by state under SNAP's broad-based categorical eligibility in FY2016. Current state practices may differ from those in FY2016. Broad-based categorical eligibility eliminates the asset test in many states, making it difficult to determine if households with assets above the usual limit are receiving benefits. No changes to categorical eligibility rules were included in the 2014 Farm Bill. The 2014 Farm Bill did not change categorical eligibility rules. The 2018 Farm Bill also did not make changes, although the House-passed bill proposed some limitations. The Senate-passed bill did not make any changes to categorical eligibility. The House-passed bill proposed changes to broad-based categorical eligibility, including new criteria for households to qualify. This would have included specific income limits based on household composition. The House-passed bill proposed changes to broad-based categorical eligibility, including new income limits for qualifying households. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that these changes would reduce SNAP spending by $5.035 billion over 10 years and result in 400,000 households losing eligibility, affecting 265,000 children's access to free meals. H.Amdt. 606 amended the bill to delay implementation until October 1, 2020. The Trump Administration plans to change regulations regarding categorical eligibility for TANF households, potentially limiting it to those receiving cash TANF or substantial assistance. The proposed rule has not been published yet, and the definition of substantial assistance remains a question. The Trump Administration plans to change regulations for categorical eligibility in TANF households, limiting it to those receiving cash TANF or substantial assistance. The rule would not affect categorical eligibility for SSI or GA households."
