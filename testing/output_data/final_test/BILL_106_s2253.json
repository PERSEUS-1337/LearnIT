    "content": "The \"Rails to Resources Act of 2000\" may be cited as the official title of this legislation. Key findings are outlined in the Act. Congress finds that rail transportation is vital to the North American intermodal transportation system. Government policies have historically supported the development of integrated rail systems in the western United States and Canada. However, federal support for completing rail connections to Alaska, the Yukon Territory, and northern British Columbia was halted prematurely. The territory and northern British Columbia have valuable resources like oil, gas, coal, and minerals, as well as forest products. Developing an efficient transportation system could benefit local communities and both nations. Rail transportation in isolated areas reduces environmental impact. Extending the continental rail system to Alaska would benefit the visitor industries in the US and Canada. Ongoing research and development efforts in the rail industry aim to increase efficiency, ensure safety, and reduce environmental impact. The President is authorized to establish a joint commission with Canada to study linking Alaska's rail system to the North American continental rail system. The Agreement should provide for a Commission composed of 20 members, with 10 appointed by the President and 10 by the Government of Canada. The Commission's membership should represent the interests of local communities, aboriginal peoples, and businesses affected by the rail connection, with expertise in relevant areas of knowledge. The Commission, if established by an agreement between the United States and Canada, will have members appointed by the President and the Government of Canada. The Commission's membership will include representatives of local communities, aboriginal peoples, and businesses with expertise in various fields such as economics, engineering, social sciences, and environmental sciences. The United States members will include individuals representing Alaskan communities, local governments, Native Alaskans, and the State of Alaska. The Commission's membership, if established by an agreement between the United States and Canada, will include representatives from various sectors such as commercial activities in Alaska, engineering expertise in subarctic transportation, and broad categories of interests in Canada as determined by the Government of Canada. SEC. 5. GOVERNANCE AND STAFFING OF COMMISSION. The Agreement should provide for the Chairman of the Commission to be elected by majority vote. Compensation for members appointed by the President varies based on government status. The Commission appointed by the President will receive travel expenses and per diem. The Agreement should include the appointment of a staff and an executive director, with compensation set by the Commission. The Commission appointed by the President will receive travel expenses and per diem. The Agreement should provide for the office of the Commission to be located in a mutually agreed location within the impacted areas of Alaska, the Yukon Territory, and northern British Columbia. Meetings should be held at least biannually to review progress and provide guidance. The Agreement should authorize and encourage the Commission to procure services by contract. The Commission appointed by the President will receive travel expenses and per diem. The Agreement should provide for the office of the Commission to be located in a mutually agreed location within the impacted areas of Alaska, the Yukon Territory, and northern British Columbia. Meetings should be held at least biannually to review progress and provide guidance. The Agreement should authorize and encourage the Commission to procure services by contract, including any necessary services determined by the Commission. Funds for individual services cannot exceed the daily equivalent of the annual rate of basic pay for level V of the Executive Schedule. SEC. 6. DUTIES. The Agreement should provide for a study to assess the feasibility of linking the rail system in Alaska to the North American continental rail system, considering railroad engineering, land ownership, geology, proximity to resources, market outlook, and environmental factors. The Agreement should provide for the Commission to determine recommended routes for linking the rail system in Alaska, considering cost, distance, access to freight markets, environmental factors, and other relevant considerations. Additionally, the Commission should evaluate the feasibility of combining the power transmission corridor. The Agreement should require the Commission to submit a report on the feasibility and advisability of linking the rail system in Alaska with a rail extension, including recommendations for preferred and alternative routes. SEC. 7. The Commission will start functioning when all members are appointed as per the Agreement and will terminate 90 days after submitting its report under section 6. SEC. 8. Funding. The Agreement establishes the \"Rails to Resources Fund\" for Commission activities, with contributions from the US and Canada. Upon termination of the Commission, remaining funds will be distributed between the two countries. $6,000,000 is authorized for appropriation to the Fund. SEC. 9. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines \"Agreement\" as an agreement described in section 2 and \"Commission\" as a commission established pursuant to any Agreement. The Act authorizes the establishment of a joint US-Canada commission to study connecting the rail system in Alaska to the North American continental rail system."
