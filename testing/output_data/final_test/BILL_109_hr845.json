OMB EMERGENCY CRITERIA. The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 defines an \"emergency\" as a sudden and urgent situation requiring new budget authority for the prevention or response to loss of life, property, or national security threats. An \"emergency\" is defined as a compelling need requiring immediate action, unforeseen, and temporary in nature. SEC. 203. Development of guidelines for application of emergency definition. The chairmen of the Committees on the Budget, in consultation with the President, shall publish guidelines for the definition of emergency within 5 months of the Act's enactment. SEC. 204. Reserve fund for emergencies in President's budget. SEC. 204. Reserve fund for emergencies in President's budget requires budget submissions to comply with specific requirements and provide detailed justification for emergency budget authority. SEC. 205. Budgeting for emergencies introduces new section on emergencies in the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. Sec. 316 outlines the process for adjusting budget authority for emergencies identified in a bill or joint resolution, with the chairman of the Committee on the Budget determining the portion for emergency purposes and making necessary adjustments. The adjustments to allocations in the budget resolution for emergencies are limited to the amount reserved for emergencies. A reserve fund for nonmilitary emergencies is set based on past budget authority and outlays for emergencies. The budget resolution allows for adjustments to allocations for emergencies based on past outlays and budget authority. The Committee on Appropriations can provide budget authority for emergencies related to national security and military operations authorized by a declaration of war or joint resolution. The budget resolution allows adjustments for emergencies based on past outlays and budget authority. Any provision increasing outlays for emergencies exceeding the budget year's total amount must be referred to the Committee on the Budget for prompt reporting. The bill or joint resolution shall be automatically discharged from further consideration if an amendment exempts budget authority for emergencies, as determined by the committee. The Committee on the Budget of the House of Representatives or the Senate can exclude budget authority and outlays from determinations under section 302(f) or 311(a) for any bill if specified in an amendment. Committees must notify emergency budget authority provisions in bills or joint resolutions. The Committee on the Budget can exclude emergency budget authority and outlays from determinations under certain sections.
