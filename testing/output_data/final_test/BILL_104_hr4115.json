    "content": "The Act titled \"Residential Windstorm Insurance Plan Act of 1996\" is cited as the short title. Congressional findings are outlined in the Act. Congress finds that insurance against windstorm damage has been difficult to obtain at reasonable rates since Hurricane Hugo in 1989. Catastrophic events like Hurricane Andrew and earthquakes have strained the reinsurance market, limiting local insurance companies' ability to meet coverage demands. Major hurricanes and earthquakes have significant long-term consequences for the country. Private sector insurance protection against wind damage is scarce in coastal States, leading to insurers pulling out of the market or increasing premiums. New programs are needed to provide limited property insurance coverage for windstorms. The Residential Windstorm Insurance Program is established to provide limited property insurance coverage for windstorms in coastal States where private sector insurance protection is scarce. The Director of FEMA will study the feasibility of a Residential Windstorm Insurance Program to provide coverage for residential property owners in wind-exposed areas. The program aims to supplement standard homeowners insurance with federally subsidized insurance against windstorm peril. The Residential Windstorm Insurance Program aims to provide coverage for residents in communities that follow flood plain management provisions. It encourages private insurance companies to handle windstorm claims and outlines requirements for their involvement. The program is designed to supplement federal disaster relief and emergency assistance. The Residential Windstorm Insurance Program aims to provide affordable insurance coverage for wind damage caused by hurricanes to protect residential structures. It includes premium rates affordable to homeowners in at-risk areas and building requirements for wind damage mitigation. The Residential Windstorm Insurance Program aims to provide affordable coverage for wind damage caused by hurricanes, including building requirements and coverage schedules for residential structures. It incentivizes private insurers to reenter markets and encourages other financial sector companies to offer hazard insurance. The program involves private industry participation and defines eligible areas for coverage. The Residential Windstorm Insurance Program aims to provide affordable coverage for wind damage caused by hurricanes, including building requirements and coverage schedules for residential structures. It establishes premium rates based on risk and offers community-based mitigation initiatives for participation. The Director consults with federal agencies, state executives, and territories affected by windstorms for program development. The Director of the Residential Windstorm Insurance Program will submit a study to congressional committees within 180 days of the enactment of the Act, containing a written plan, disaster assistance amount statement, and collaboration details with insurance entities and advocacy groups. The Director of the Residential Windstorm Insurance Program will submit a study to congressional committees within 180 days of the enactment of the Act, including a statement of disaster assistance provided for property damage caused by winds from hurricanes, tornadoes, and other windstorms, estimates of the cost of the Residential Windstorm Insurance Program for residential structures, and overall program costs. The Residential Windstorm Insurance Program provides coverage for residential structures, public infrastructure, State and local government properties, residential, business, agricultural properties, and properties owned by private nonprofit organizations. The study will also estimate the impact on disaster assistance, the private insurance industry, and the availability of property insurance. The study on the Residential Windstorm Insurance Program includes estimating the impact on disaster assistance, private insurance industry, and property insurance availability. It also involves describing necessary amendments to laws related to disaster assistance and any other relevant information deemed appropriate by the Director. SEC. 4. EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE STUDY. The Director will arrange a study with the National Academy of Sciences to explore the feasibility of a Federal earthquake insurance program similar to the National Flood Insurance Program's \"Write Your Own\" Program. The study will involve experts from various fields and the results will be transmitted upon completion. The National Academy of Sciences will transmit a report with recommendations to the Director and Congress within 18 months of the enactment of this Act. SEC. 5. STUDY ON TAX TREATMENT OF CATASTROPHIC RESERVES. The Comptroller General, Secretary of the Treasury, and Secretary of Commerce will conduct a joint study to evaluate the public policy issues related to providing favorable Federal tax treatment to multiyear insurance reserves for catastrophic natural disasters. The study will assess the financial capacity of insurers to respond to disasters, their ability to provide coverage post-disaster, and the impact on U.S. business competitiveness globally. The study will assess the impact of favorable tax treatment on catastrophic reserves, including limitations on tax exemptions and the use of reserves for statewide mitigation efforts. Consultation will be done with the Comptroller General, Secretary of the Treasury, and Secretary of Commerce. The Secretary of Commerce will consult with experts from various fields for a study on catastrophic reserves' tax treatment impact. The results and recommendations will be reported to Congress within 180 days of the Act's enactment."
