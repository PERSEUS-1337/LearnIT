    "content": "The Act titled \"Increasing Transparency and Accountability in Oil Prices Act of 2008\" is referenced. Additionally, there is a section discussing the House's sense on providing additional emergency funding for a commission. The House of Representatives finds that excessive speculation in energy commodities, lack of oversight in overseas exchange transactions, and understaffing at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission are contributing to price increases. It is recommended that the President request emergency appropriations for fiscal year 2008. The House of Representatives recommends emergency appropriations for fiscal year 2008 for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to restore public confidence in energy commodities markets, impose limits on speculation driving up prices, enhance IT capabilities for market regulation, and hire 100 new staff to oversee and enforce regulations. The Commodity Exchange Act is amended to appoint 100 new full-time employees to increase transparency, enforce regulations, and oversee energy futures markets. SEC. 4. SPECULATIVE LIMITS AND TRANSPARENCY FOR OFF-SHORE OIL TRADING. Section 4 of the Commodity Exchange Act is amended to include regulations for foreign boards of trade regarding energy commodities physically delivered in the United States. The Commission must ensure that these boards apply similar principles for trading information publication before granting relief from registration requirements. The Commission must ensure that trading information and position limits for speculators trading energy commodities physically delivered in the United States are provided and comparable to the information necessary for a Commitment of Traders report. The Commission will determine whether to continue granting relief to foreign boards of trade for commodities physically delivered in the United States. SEC. 5. DISAGGREGATION OF INDEX FUNDS AND OTHER DATA IN ENERGY MARKETS. The Commission will disaggregate and make public monthly the number of positions and total value of index funds and other passive, long-only positions in energy markets, along with data on speculative positions relative to bona fide physical hedgers in those markets."
