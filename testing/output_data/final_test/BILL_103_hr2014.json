    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Value Engineering Better Transportation Act of 1993\" and it amends Title 23 of the United States Code. Section 120 of title 23, United States Code, is amended to increase the Federal share for projects with an estimated cost of $2,000,000 or more by 5 percentage points if value engineering is applied before 35 percent completion of project design and if the State complies with specific Federal regulations. The Federal share for projects with an estimated cost of $2,000,000 or more can be increased by applying value engineering before 35 percent completion of project design. The State needs to submit a value engineering analysis signed by a certified specialist, showing savings of 5 percent or more in project costs to qualify for the increase. The Federal share for projects can be increased by 5 percentage points if value engineering reduces project costs by 15 percent or more. The Federal share payable for any project cannot exceed 100 percent of the project cost. Value engineering is a systematic process of reviewing and analyzing a project to reduce costs while maintaining quality. Federal funds cannot be used for training in value engineering. The Federal share for projects cannot exceed 100 percent of the project cost. Value engineering involves reviewing and analyzing a project to reduce costs while maintaining quality. Suggestions may include eliminating inefficient or expensive parts of the original design and using different technologies, materials, or methods to achieve the project's purpose. The Federal Transit Act is discussed in Section 3. The Federal Transit Act (49 U.S.C. App. 1608) is amended to increase the Federal grant by 5% of the net project cost for projects with estimated costs of $2,000,000 or more, where value engineering is applied before 35% completion of project design, and the grant recipient complies with specific Federal acquisition regulations. The Federal Transit Act is amended to increase the Federal grant by 5% of the net project cost for projects with estimated costs of $2,000,000 or more, where value engineering is applied before 35% completion of project design, and the grant recipient complies with specific Federal acquisition regulations, including submitting a value engineering analysis signed by a certified specialist showing a 5% or more reduction in project cost. The Federal Transit Act allows for an increase in the Federal grant by 5% of the net project cost for projects with estimated costs of $2,000,000 or more, if value engineering is applied before 35% completion of project design. The grant recipient must comply with specific Federal acquisition regulations, including submitting a value engineering analysis signed by a certified specialist showing a 5% or more reduction in project cost. Additionally, there are limitations on the maximum Federal percentage and maximum Federal dollars that can be expended under a Federal grant for projects assisted under the Act. Value engineering is a systematic process of reviewing and analyzing a project during its design phase to reduce costs and improve quality. Federal funds cannot be used for training in value engineering under the Act. Value engineering involves reviewing and analyzing a project to reduce costs and improve quality by using different technologies, materials, or methods to achieve the project's original purpose."
