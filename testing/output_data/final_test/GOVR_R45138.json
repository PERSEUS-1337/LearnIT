    "content": "The mission of HHS is to enhance the health and well-being of Americans by providing effective health and human services and fostering advances in medicine, public health, and social services. HHS is organized into 11 main agencies responsible for a variety of health and human services. Additionally, there are staff divisions within the Office of the Secretary that support the department. Eight of the operating divisions are part of the U.S. Public Health Service and have diverse missions in support of public health. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) consists of 11 main agencies, including three operating divisions that are not part of the U.S. Public Health Service. These divisions focus on human services programs for vulnerable populations and administering Medicare and Medicaid. The President's budget request for FY2019 was released in February 2018 amidst uncertainties regarding FY2018 appropriations. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (P.L. 115-123) impacted FY2018 and FY2019 funding levels by increasing discretionary spending, extending temporary funding, providing new supplemental appropriations, and extending funding for HHS mandatory spending programs. This affected the budget request materials from the Office of Management and Budget and the HHS Budget in Brief. Discretionary funding for FY2018 was provided through temporary continuing resolutions. The OMB and HHS budget materials for FY2018 used estimates from temporary continuing resolutions for discretionary spending programs and criteria outlined in authorizing law for mandatory spending programs. These estimates may have influenced FY2019 budget negotiations within the Administration. The FY2018 CRs influenced FY2019 budget negotiations within the Administration. BBA 2018 contains provisions affecting discretionary and mandatory spending levels for FY2018, including full-year supplemental appropriations for disaster relief and extensions of mandatory spending programs through FY2019. These amounts were not included in the FY2018 estimates presented in HHS or OMB budget materials. During the formulation of the President's budget request for FY2019, policymakers had not yet agreed to changes in discretionary spending limits for FY2018 and FY2019. The limits were increased by BBA 2018 three days before the FY2019 budget submission, with a $63 billion increase in FY2018 and a $68 billion increase in FY2019 for nondefense spending. HHS discretionary spending is mostly subject to the nondefense limit, and OMB and HHS materials handled this increase differently in the FY2019 budget submission. The OMB budget materials were not revised to reflect the additional spending allowed by BBA 2018. An addendum was released alongside the budget submission to outline proposed changes in response to the increased spending limits. HHS budget amounts in the FY2019 BIB were adjusted ahead of their release to accommodate the outlined increases in the OMB addendum. This resulted in discrepancies between the amounts listed in OMB budget materials and the HHS BIB for FY2019. The OMB budget addendum proposed significant changes to the Administration's discretionary request for HHS in FY2019, showing a 10% increase in budget authority compared to FY2017. The FY2019 mandatory spending in BBA 2018 was not included in the HHS BIB or OMB budget materials. The HHS budget request for FY2019 includes an estimated $1.216 trillion in outlays, $48 billion more than FY2018. HHS has historically accounted for at least 20% of federal outlays since FY1995, with 28% in FY2017. Medicare and Medicaid are expected to make up 86% of HHS spending in FY2019. The HHS budget for FY2019 includes mandatory payments based on criteria in authorizing law. Discretionary spending accounts for 8% of HHS outlays, with HHS receiving more discretionary money than most federal departments. HHS accounted for 7.2% of all discretionary budget authority in FY2017, second only to the Department of Defense. The HHS budget includes a broader set of resources than annual appropriations. The FY2019 HHS budget includes mandatory payments based on authorizing laws, with discretionary spending controlled by annual appropriations acts. Some mandatory programs, like Medicaid, require funding through the appropriations process despite being controlled by authorizing statutes. The HHS budget request includes mandatory payments and discretionary funding through annual appropriations acts. HHS funding is divided across three different appropriations bills, with certain agencies and activities funded through separate bills. Administration's estimates for HHS programs may differ from congressional scorekeepers. The HHS budget materials may show different estimates for mandatory spending programs in FY2019, including proposed law and current law estimates. Proposed law estimates consider changes in mandatory spending proposed in the FY2018 HHS budget request, while current law estimates assume no policy changes. Transfers of funding between HHS agencies or other federal agencies may be accounted for in Administration estimates but not necessarily in congressional documents. The HHS budget estimates in this report reflect proposed law estimates for mandatory spending programs, but other estimates may reflect current law. Discretionary funding in appropriations bills may not cover all available budgetary resources, as agencies within HHS can use user fees and transfers from other sources. The HHS budget includes mandatory trust funds established by the ACA. Budgetary totals at the \"program level\" account for these resources. HHS agencies like the FDA and AHRQ have differences between appropriations and program level amounts due to user fees and transfers. Table 3 shows budget totals for each HHS division, inclusive of mandatory and discretionary funding. The FY2018 estimate and FY2019 request figures are sourced from the HHS BIB for FY2019, while the FY2016 actual figures are from the FY2018 BIB. This section summarizes the mission of each operating division, the FY2019 budget request, and provides links to additional resources. Budget authority (BA) and outlays are explained, with outlays occurring when funds are expended from the Treasury. The FDA's mission includes regulating the safety of human foods, drugs, and medical devices, as well as tobacco products. The HRSA focuses on improving access to healthcare for the uninsured and vulnerable. The FY2019 budget request for FDA is $3.257 billion in budget authority and $3.092 billion in outlays. The National Health Service Corps and federal health centers program provide grants for primary care services to those facing barriers to healthcare. The Indian Health Service focuses on improving health for American Indians and Alaska Natives, serving approximately 2.2 million eligible individuals. The CDC's mission is disease prevention, environmental health, and health promotion. The FY2019 budget request for the IHS is $5.433 billion in budget authority and $5.410 billion in outlays. The CDC is organized into centers, institutes, and offices focused on prevention, control, environmental health, and health promotion. The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) is under the CDC director and focuses on mitigating adverse effects from hazardous substances. The combined FY2019 budget request for CDC and ATSDR is $6.078 billion in budget authority and $7.530 billion in outlays. The NIH's mission is to support research on diseases and disseminate medical knowledge. It is organized into 27 research institutes and centers. The FY2019 budget request for NIH is $33.888 billion in budget authority and $35.082 billion in outlays. SAMHSA focuses on reducing the impact of substance abuse and mental illness on communities. The AHRQ focuses on research to improve healthcare quality and affordability, with a proposed consolidation of functions within NIH. The CMS supports innovative approaches to enhance Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, and private insurance accessibility and quality. The President's budget estimates that over 143 million Americans will rely on programs administered by CMS, including Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP, and Health Insurance Exchanges. The ACF focuses on promoting the economic and social well-being of children, youth, families, and communities through programs like TANF, Head Start, and child welfare programs. The ACL aims to maximize independence, well-being, and health. Relevant Appropriations Bill for LHHS FY2019 Request: BA $1,122.804 billion Outlays $1,092.541 billion for CMS and BA $47.247 billion Outlays $48.971 billion for ACF. The ACL mission focuses on maximizing independence, well-being, and health of older adults and people with disabilities. ACL administers programs for older Americans and the disabled, including Home and Community-Based Supportive Services.
