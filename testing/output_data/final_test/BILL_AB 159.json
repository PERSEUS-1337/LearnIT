    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Right to Try Act, known as Article 4.5, outlines definitions such as \"consulting physician\" and \"eligible patient\" for individuals seeking experimental treatments. An \"eligible patient\" under the Right to Try Act must have a life-threatening disease, exhausted all FDA-approved treatment options, not able to participate in a clinical trial, and have recommendations from primary and consulting physicians for an investigational treatment. The Right to Try Act defines an \"eligible patient\" as someone with a life-threatening disease, who has exhausted all FDA-approved treatment options, unable to participate in a clinical trial, and has recommendations from primary and consulting physicians for an investigational treatment. The Act also requires written informed consent for the use of investigational drugs or devices, documentation from physicians confirming eligibility, and defines \"health benefit plan\" as a program that covers health benefits. Additionally, it defines \"immediately life-threatening disease or condition\" as a stage of disease where death is likely within months. The Right to Try Act defines an \"investigational drug, biological product, or device\" as a product that has completed phase one of an FDA-approved clinical trial but is still under investigation. It also defines \"primary physician\" as a licensed physician and surgeon, and \"state regulatory board\" as either the Medical Board of California or the Osteopathic Medical Board of California. Written, informed consent is a document approved by the primary physician's institutional review board, signed by the patient or their representative, and attested to by the physician and a witness. It explains approved treatments for the patient's life-threatening condition and confirms agreement that conventional treatments are unlikely to prolong life. The patient seeking to use an investigational drug must be informed of the potential outcomes, including new symptoms or hastened death. It should be clear that their health plan and provider are not obligated to cover the costs associated with the treatment. The patient's eligibility for hospice care may be withdrawn if curative treatment begins, and in-home health care may be denied. The patient is liable for expenses related to investigational drugs, with consent following the Protection of Human Subjects in Medical Experimentation Act. Manufacturers can provide investigational drugs to eligible patients without compensation or may require patients to pay associated costs. This article does not expand coverage provided by specific codes. The article does not mandate health benefit plans to cover costs for investigational drugs, biological products, or devices. Plans may choose to cover these items. If a clinical trial is closed due to lack of efficacy or toxicity, the investigational item cannot be offered. Manufacturers and physicians must inform patients if a trial is closed for an investigational item taken outside of a trial. If an eligible patient dies during treatment with an investigational drug, their heirs are not responsible for any related debt. State regulatory boards cannot penalize a physician solely for recommending or prescribing investigational treatments approved by an institutional review board. The physician's institutional review board must report biannually to state health departments and medical boards on requests for investigational treatments, treatment status, duration, costs, treatment outcomes, and any adverse events. Any adverse events related to investigational drugs, biological products, or devices must be reported. State agencies cannot change recommendations to Medicare or Medicaid based solely on a healthcare provider's suggestion for a patient to access investigational treatments. Violations of this rule are not subject to a specific chapter. This article prohibits using actions under it as a basis for legal claims against manufacturers or others involved in care for harm caused by investigational drugs, products, or devices if reasonable care was exercised."
