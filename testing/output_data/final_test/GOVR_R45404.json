    "content": "Four decades after the first trans-oceanic supersonic passenger flight in 1976, interest in restarting supersonic air travel has been expressed by aviation enthusiasts, manufacturers, and airlines. U.S. startup companies are developing supersonic jets, facing challenges similar to the Concorde era in making the technology economically viable and acceptable to regulators and the public. Gaining international approvals to fly supersonically over other countries is a critical element for the future of supersonic aircraft. The market viability of future civil supersonic aircraft designs depends on gaining international approvals for supersonic flight operations over other countries. International agreements would also need to address permissible conditions for supersonic flight operations over water and polar regions. Supersonic flight is faster than the speed of sound, with the speed of sound varying depending on atmospheric conditions. All current commercial aircraft are subsonic, with a Mach number less than 1. Supersonic flight is faster than Mach 1, with the Concorde cruising at Mach 2.02. Some military aircraft fly at even higher speeds. Hypersonic flight, faster than Mach 5, is limited to experimental aircraft and missiles. Aircraft disturb the air as they move, creating pressure waves perceived as sound. In supersonic flight, aircraft create shock waves instead of sound waves, resulting in a sonic boom perceived on the ground. Efforts are being made to design aircraft that produce a quieter \"thump\" by spreading out the shock waves. Flying faster than the speed of sound is not a new concept, with the first manned supersonic flight occurring in 1947. In 1947, a U.S. Air Force experimental aircraft broke the sound barrier, marking a significant milestone in aviation history. This led to fierce international competition for speed and prestige, with notable developments including the Concorde and Lockheed SR-71. The Soviet Union flew the first supersonic passenger plane, the Tupolev TU-144, in 1968, but a fatal crash in 1973 ended their supersonic passenger ambitions. The Soviet Union's supersonic passenger aircraft program faced challenges due to high development costs, lack of airline interest, and environmental concerns. The FAA program was terminated in 1971, leading to the development of the Franco-British Concorde. The Franco-British Concorde was a costly joint project of the British and French governments, with the first trans-oceanic supersonic passenger flight in 1976. It flew over 2.5 million passengers before being retired in 2003 due to high costs and environmental concerns. The Concorde was a symbol of national prestige but was not a commercial success. The Concorde project was very costly, with estimated costs reaching nearly \u00a34.26 billion. Operating the Concorde was expensive due to high fuel consumption, leading to increased operating costs. Concerns over noise levels and sonic booms led to many countries banning Concorde flights from their airspace. The Concorde faced limitations in its utilization due to U.S. regulations prohibiting overland supersonic flights. This led to limited flights on oceanic routes between major cities like London and New York. Despite efforts to offer premium air travel, the Concorde struggled to attract airlines, with only 14 out of 20 aircraft sold to state-owned carriers. The high development costs were written off by the British and French governments, but the Concorde failed to become a sustainable business. Filling seats on Concorde flights was challenging due to high ticket prices, limited capacity, and impracticality for carrying cargo or mail. Airlines struggled to generate additional revenue, leading to flights often operating below capacity. During the first five years of Concorde operations, British Airways and Air France incurred losses. The occasional profitability was due to government absorption of development costs. On July 25, 2000, Air France flight 4590 experienced a fatal accident during take-off. On July 25, 2000, Air France flight 4590 crashed into a hotel in Gonesse, killing all 100 passengers, nine crew members, and four hotel employees. The incident damaged the Concorde's safety reputation, leading to safety modifications. The first test flight of a modified aircraft was successful in July 2001, with the first regular passenger flight following on September 11, 2001. The 9/11 terrorist attacks further impacted air travel demand, including premium air travel. The Concorde's discontinuation in 2003 highlighted the challenges of supersonic passenger travel in a global economic downturn. A new SST must offer competitive prices and reduced travel time to be commercially viable. The \"speed dividend\" advantage can only be realized with high load factors and efficient maintenance. A supersonic airplane for commercial passenger service would compete with subsonic planes like the Airbus A350 and Boeing 787, which can fly long distances nonstop. Airlines offering SST service need to find profitable routes with enough passengers willing to pay higher fares for faster travel. Despite the comfort of premium cabins on subsonic flights, there may be demand for higher-priced flights offering shorter travel times. Supersonic flights offer unique differentiation in the increasingly commoditized air travel market. There is potential for a separate market for supersonic business jets, appealing to corporations for security and time-saving benefits. Fractional ownership models could make supersonic flights more accessible at lower costs. The main attraction of supersonic flight is speed, with meaningful time savings expected for flights over 800 nautical miles. Supersonic flights could save travelers about one hour on a flight between New York and Los Angeles. Companies developing supersonic jets aim for flight ranges of 4,000 to 6,000 nautical miles, allowing for time savings of around two hours on flights between the east coast of the United States and key European destinations like London and Paris. Some routes may require refueling stops for longer flights to destinations in Africa or the Middle East. Developers are working on supersonic aircraft that could cut about one-third off total travel time, with plans to test a 2-seat demonstrator by the end of 2019. Boom Technology aims to deliver its first supersonic aircraft by 2025, with Virgin Group and Japan Airlines already showing interest in purchasing these Mach 2.2 planes. In December 2017, Aerion Supersonic announced a joint venture with Lockheed Martin and GE Aviation to develop the AS2 supersonic business jet. Regulatory uncertainty and lack of international standards are key challenges for the development of supersonic aircraft for passenger service. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) is working on developing international noise and emissions standards for future supersonic aircraft, aiming to have a certification standard in place by 2020-2025. Current noise standards for civil aircraft do not apply to next-generation supersonic aircraft, as they are based on outdated Concorde-type designs. Operational standards, including restrictions on supersonic flight over land, are also being considered. Regulatory uncertainty and lack of international standards are challenges for the development of supersonic aircraft for passenger service. The FAA and Japanese laws prohibit supersonic flights over land and densely populated areas without specific permission. International aviation authorities are working on operational parameters for supersonic flight over water and polar regions. The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 requires the FAA to submit a report to Congress with recommended regulatory changes for overland supersonic flights within one year of the bill's enactment. The FAA is tasked with creating policies and regulations for certifying safe civil supersonic aircraft operations in U.S. airspace. This includes consulting with industry stakeholders on noise-certification issues and modernizing regulations for operating civil aircraft at supersonic speeds. Additionally, the FAA must develop noise standards for sonic booms and publish the final rule within 18 months after the public comment period closes. The FAA must issue an NPRM within 18 months if an application for Part 21 certification of a supersonic aircraft is received before the final rule is promulgated. Starting December 31, 2020, FAA must review aircraft noise and performance measurements every two years to consider amending regulations on civil supersonic flight over land due to concerns about the sonic boom. Sonic booms are caused by sudden pressure changes when supersonic aircraft reach the ground. The intensity of the boom depends on various factors like the aircraft's shape, size, and atmospheric conditions. Overpressures above 1 pound per square foot may be considered objectionable by humans. Supersonic aircraft typically produce overpressures of 1 to 2 pounds at the surface during flight at altitudes of 30,000 to 50,000 feet. Current regulations prohibit civil aircraft from operating at speeds greater than the speed of sound in U.S. airspace. Exceptions can be authorized on a case-by-case basis for flight testing of military aircraft types. Manufacturers of certain civilian aircraft may petition FAA for authorization to exceed the speed of sound in flight testing over sparsely populated lands. Manufacturers may seek FAA approval for supersonic flights over land to demonstrate compliance with certification requirements, determine sonic boom characteristics, or establish parameters to prevent sonic boom impacts on the ground. Authorization may be granted if the aircraft can show no measurable sonic boom overpressures will reach the ground. Aerion Supersonic is developing a supersonic aircraft capable of flying at Mach cut-off speeds with significantly reduced sonic boom impact on the ground. The company claims its plane will have a \"boomless cruise\" at speeds up to Mach 1.2, with subsonic cruise speeds of Mach 0.95 over land and Mach 1.4 over water, faster than current commercial jets. Spike Aerospace and Boom Technology are also developing supersonic aircraft with cruise speeds of Mach 1.6 and Mach 2.2 respectively. NASA is working on the X-59 QueSST for low boom flights, expected in 2021. The X-59 Quiet Supersonic Transport (QueSST) is set for delivery in 2021, with test flights planned for 2022. It is designed to fly at Mach 1.42, producing a sonic boom with a perceived loudness of 75 dB, much quieter than the Concorde's 105 dB. The aircraft's components are positioned to spread out shock waves, creating a longer but quieter \"thump.\" NASA researchers suggest a ground-level sonic boom measurement of 75 dB as potentially acceptable for unrestricted supersonic flight over land. No standard has been established yet. The FAA is reviewing restrictions on supersonic flight over land every two years starting December 31, 2020. Design tradeoffs exist in controlling noise from supersonic jets, impacting speed and efficiency. Applying subsonic noise standards to supersonic aircraft could affect speed, range, and emissions during supersonic flight phases. The FAA granted the Concorde special noise certification consideration, requiring subsonic noise levels to be economically reasonable and technologically practicable. The Concorde was louder during takeoff and landing than aircraft meeting ICAO's Stage 2 standards. Only Concorde planes with flight time before January 1, 1980, were eligible for this exception, but no Concorde aircraft were produced after 1979. In 1976, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey tried to ban the Concorde from JFK Airport, but this was preempted by the FAA. The court allowed limited Concorde operations in the US, with a curfew on flights between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. Stage 2 jets were phased out in 2015, requiring quieter engines to meet Stage 3 or Stage 4 standards. New aircraft after Dec 31, 2017, must meet Stage 5 standards. Stage 5 standards require aircraft to be 7 dB quieter than Stage 4, or 17 dB less than Stage 3, across three noise measurements. New aircraft must meet Stage 5 standards, making them significantly quieter than those from the 1970s. Some argue that complying with stringent Stage 5 noise standards for supersonic aircraft may require significant design changes that could limit aircraft characteristics. Critics believe this could disadvantage supersonic designs without much impact on reducing community noise around airports. Aircraft manufacturers are currently using higher bypass engines to meet Stage 5 standards, but these engines may increase drag and reduce fuel efficiency during supersonic flight. Higher bypass engine designs for supersonic aircraft could increase drag and reduce fuel efficiency by about 20%, leading to higher fuel consumption and carbon emissions. The FAA reauthorization language proposed in the Senate aimed to apply less stringent noise certification standards for supersonic aircraft, but this was not included in the enacted FAA Reauthorization Act. This leaves the FAA to establish appropriate noise limits for supersonic aircraft through rulemaking activities. The FAA established noise limits for supersonic aircraft as part of its rulemaking activities to address noise certification. U.S.-registered civil aircraft must meet airworthiness requirements, including FAA noise standards in 14 C.F.R. Part 36. The Control and Abatement of Aircraft Noise and Sonic Boom Act of 1968 mandated the FAA to create standards to protect the public from unnecessary aircraft noise and sonic boom. Supersonic flights over land were prohibited in 1973 due to sonic boom concerns, but in 1989, the FAA allowed supersonic flights in designated test areas for sonic boom research. The FAA updated its policy on noise limits for future civil supersonic aircraft in 2008, acknowledging the need for research before considering changes to operational restrictions. Public involvement will be essential in defining any regulatory decisions. The FAA's updated policy on noise limits for future civil supersonic aircraft emphasizes the importance of public involvement in defining acceptable sonic boom requirements and potential rulemaking processes. The guidance currently aligns noise certification limits for supersonic aircraft with those for subsonic aircraft. Future noise standards for supersonic operation will be developed based on the unique operational characteristics of supersonic designs and their noise impacts. FAA initiated rulemakings in 2018 to amend noise certification standards and update operating standards for supersonic flights. The proposals aim to streamline procedures for FAA authorization without rescinding the prohibition of flight in excess. The FAA initiated rulemakings in 2018 to amend noise certification standards and update operating standards for supersonic flights. The potential success of supersonic aircraft depends on U.S. and international certification and operational acceptance. There are concerns about noise certification standards and sonic boom differences between the United States and Europe. International pressure is likely to develop consensus sonic boom standards through ICAO. Efforts to establish international noise standards for supersonic aircraft face resistance from European nations, potentially impacting engine options and design characteristics. Delays in setting standards could hinder development progress, with the FAA urging prompt agreement for manufacturers' certification certainty. International consensus and approvals for supersonic flight over other countries are crucial for the market viability of future civil supersonic aircraft designs. Agreements must address conditions for supersonic flight over water and polar regions. Polar flights could be a starting point if land supersonic flight is not immediately authorized. Polar airspace has gained importance for aviation, offering shorter routes between the US and Asia. Approvals for supersonic speeds on polar and transoceanic routes fall under countries' authority, following ICAO standards. Access to international routes over polar regions is crucial for the success of future civil supersonic aircraft. The United States, Canada, Iceland, and Russia have authority over airspace in these regions, following ICAO standards. Speed is a key selling point for supersonic flight, making approval for supersonic speeds on polar routes essential for commercial viability."
