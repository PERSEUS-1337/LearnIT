    "content": "The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 (P.L. 110-161) combined the FY2008 agriculture appropriations bill with 10 other bills. It was passed by the House on December 17, 2007, the Senate on December 18, 2007, and signed by the President on December 26, 2007. The act allocated $90.8 billion for agriculture and related agencies, with $18.1 billion in discretionary appropriations and $72.7 billion in mandatory funds. Discretionary funds increased by 1.6% from FY2007, while mandatory spending decreased by $7 billion. Mandatory transfers for farm commodity programs decreased by $10 billion, and food stamp benefits rose by $2.2 billion. The 2008 farm bill extension allocates about $2.2 billion, extending provisions of the 2002 farm bill until March 15, 2008. The extension allows for conference negotiations to resolve differences between House and Senate-passed farm bills. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) oversees various responsibilities through internal agencies and offices, with USDA spending not solely related to farm program spending. Agriculture appropriations bills also include programs like the Food and Drug Administration and the Commodity Futures Trading. The USDA estimated its outlays in FY2007 at $93 billion, with food and nutrition programs comprising the largest mission area at $55 billion (60% of total). The second-largest mission area, with an expected $21 billion (23%) in outlays, is farm and foreign agricultural services. Other USDA activities include natural resource and environmental programs (9%), rural development (3%), research and education programs (3%), and marketing and regulatory programs (2%). The USDA's outlays in FY2007 totaled $93 billion, with food and nutrition programs accounting for $55 billion (60%). The second-largest area was farm and foreign agricultural services at $21 billion (23%). Other activities included natural resource and environmental programs (9%), rural development (3%), research and education programs (3%), marketing and regulatory programs (2%), and food safety (1%). The Forest Service received the majority of funding for natural resources programs, around $5.4 billion, and is funded through the Interior appropriations bill. USDA's programs are categorized into different \"mission areas\" that may not align with the categories in the agriculture appropriations bill. The agriculture appropriations bill includes funding for USDA agencies, FDA, and CFTC, with historical ties to food and agriculture. However, FDA and CFTC focus more on medical/drug issues and non-agricultural markets. Their combined share of the overall agriculture appropriations bill is usually less than 2%. The agriculture appropriations bill includes funding for USDA agencies, FDA, and CFTC, with historical ties to food and agriculture. FDA and CFTC focus more on medical/drug issues and non-agricultural markets. Their combined share of the overall agriculture appropriations bill is usually less than 2%. Mandatory and discretionary spending are treated differently in the budget process, with Congress controlling spending on mandatory programs through eligibility rules and benefit formulas written into authorizing law. The 2002 farm bill and its successor, the 2007/08 farm bill, determine parameters for mandatory spending, while discretionary programs are funded through annual appropriations acts. Approximately 80% of total agriculture and related agencies spending is classified as mandatory, which occurs independently of annual appropriations. USDA's mandatory spending is mainly for programs like food stamps, child nutrition, farm commodity support, crop insurance, and agricultural conservation. Mandatory spending is influenced by program participation rates, economic conditions, and weather patterns. Some mandatory programs receive funding in the annual agriculture appropriations act. The agriculture and related agencies appropriations bill funds programs like food stamps, child nutrition, conservation, rural development, research, and international food aid. Approximately 80% of the spending is mandatory, while the remaining 20% is for discretionary programs. The agriculture appropriations bill, part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, includes USDA, FDA, and CFTC. It passed in December 2007 without controversy, with the main focus on funding for the war in Iraq. Certain provisions of the 2002 farm bill were extended until March 15, 2008. The extension of the 2002 farm bill until March 15, 2008 includes funding for conservation programs, dairy and sugar programs, and price support loan programs for wool and mohair. The extension is expected to allow for conference negotiations to resolve differences between the House and Senate-passed farm bills. The extension of the 2002 farm bill until March 15, 2008 includes funding for conservation programs, dairy and sugar programs, and price support loan programs for wool and mohair. Other programs not extended include direct, counter-cyclical, and marketing loan programs for the 2008 crop year for supported commodities, peanut storage payments, and various other agricultural assistance programs. The FY2008 agriculture appropriations bill (H.R. 3161, H.Rept. 110-258) was passed on August 2, 2007, by a vote of 237-18. The bill faced controversy over floor procedures, leading to minority party members not casting votes. The bill was initially under an open rule with only two amendments adopted before being pulled from the floor. It was later returned under a more restrictive rule (H.Res. 599). The FY2008 agriculture appropriations bill (H.R. 3161) faced controversy over floor procedures and was passed by the House with a vote of 237-18. The bill was initially under an open rule, but returned two days later under a more restrictive rule (H.Res. 599). A manager's amendment with six non-monetary amendments was adopted, while twelve other amendments were considered but not adopted. A motion to recommit the bill to committee failed, leading to some Members changing their votes. The House passed H.R. 3161 by a vote of 237-18. The House passed H.R. 3161 by a vote of 237-18 as a show of protest. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported its version of the bill (S. 1859, S.Rept. 110-134) on July 19, 2007, by a vote of 29-0. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, provides $90.8 billion in total funds for agriculture and related agencies, with $18.1 billion in official \"net\" discretionary appropriations and $72.7 billion in mandatory funds. In FY2008, mandatory spending decreased by $7 billion overall, with farm bill appropriations for commodity programs decreasing by $10 billion. Food stamp program benefits rose by $2.2 billion. The House and Senate versions had about $1 billion more in discretionary spending than FY2007. The enacted appropriation for FY2008 included notable increases for conservation, meat and poultry inspection, and agricultural research. In FY2008, agricultural funding saw increases in meat and poultry inspection, agricultural research, animal and plant health programs, agricultural statistics, and the Food and Drug Administration. Rural development funding decreased, but remained higher than the Administration's request. The law required country-of-origin labeling for meat to begin by September 2008. The \"common computing environment\" received no funding for FY2008. The Senate bill allocated more funds for various agricultural programs compared to the House bill. The FY2008 agricultural funding increased for meat and poultry inspection, research, animal and plant health programs, statistics, and FDA. The Senate bill allocated more funds for agricultural programs compared to the House bill. The Administration's FY2008 budget request sought $17.8 billion in discretionary spending for agencies funded through the agriculture appropriations bill. Both the House and Senate passed a concurrent FY2008 budget resolution to guide spending. The House and Senate passed a concurrent FY2008 budget resolution to guide spending. The House Appropriations Committee approved $18.817 billion for the agriculture bill, while the Senate approved $18.709 billion. The 302(b) allocations for agriculture and FDA programs are nearly identical in both bills. Earmark disclosure rules were adopted in 2007 for the FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act. The FY2008 agriculture appropriations law includes 623 earmarks totaling $400 million, self-identified by Congress. Earmarks specified in a conference report may not have the same legal force as if they were in the law itself, but executive branch agencies typically follow these directives to avoid explaining to appropriators why they were not followed. President Bush issued Executive Order 13457 in January 2008, instructing agencies to only honor earmarks that are in the text of the law. The appropriations bill for agriculture covers most of USDA's funding, excluding the Forest Service. The Farm Service Agency administers farm commodity income support and disaster assistance programs, as well as USDA's farm loan programs. The Farm Service Agency (FSA) administers USDA's farm loan programs, conservation programs, and international food assistance programs. The FY2008 enacted appropriation for FSA is $1.430 billion, $93 million more than in FY2007. The House-passed bill provides $1.440 billion and the Senate-reported bill $1.478 billion. The appropriation prohibits USDA from closing any FSA county office. The appropriation prohibits USDA from closing any FSA county office before a new farm bill is enacted, reflecting restrictions in stand-alone bills. USDA serves as a lender of last resort for family farmers through FSA farm loan programs. The FSA guarantees timely repayment of loans to farmers for real estate, operating expenses, and disaster recovery. Loans may have subsidized interest rates. An annual appropriation covers the federal cost of direct and guaranteed loans, including loan subsidies. In FY2008, $148.6 million was allocated to subsidize $3.427 billion in FSA loans, an 8.6% decrease from the previous year. In FY2008, there was an 8.6% decrease in loan authority compared to FY2007. Direct loan authority decreased by 5.6%, with a decrease in direct operating loans but an increase in direct farm ownership loans. Guaranteed loan authority decreased by 9.7%, with decreases in guaranteed ownership and unsubsidized operating loans. No new funds were provided for emergency loans, as Congress cited sufficient carryover funds from previous supplementals. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) is the funding mechanism for payments to farmers, authorized by the 2002 farm bill. It can borrow up to $30 billion from the U.S. Treasury to finance farm commodity price and income subsidies, conservation, trade, and rural development programs. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) borrows funds from the Treasury to support various agricultural programs, including emergency spending for farm disaster payments and disease eradication. The CCC must repay the borrowed funds and relies on periodic congressional appropriations to replenish its losses. Funding needs can be challenging to estimate due to fluctuating economic and weather conditions. In recent years, the CCC has received an indefinite appropriation to cover necessary expenses during the fiscal year. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) receives an indefinite appropriation for necessary expenses during the fiscal year, estimated at $12.983 billion for FY2008. Outlays in FY2008 will be funded through CCC's borrowing authority and reimbursed to the Treasury. The decrease in net expenditures to $10.7 billion is attributed to reduced need for farm commodity subsidies due to high market prices. The federal crop insurance program, administered by USDA's Risk Management Agency, offers free catastrophic insurance to producers growing insurable crops. Producers can purchase additional insurance at a subsidized rate through approved private insurance companies. The annual agriculture appropriations bill provides funding for RMA salaries and expenses, as well as the Federal Crop Insurance Fund for premium subsidies and indemnity payments. In FY2008, $76.12 million was allocated for RMA expenses. The FY2008 omnibus appropriations act provides $76.12 million for RMA expenses, slightly below the FY2007 appropriation. The funding includes a provision allowing RMA to use up to $11.166 million in mandatory funds to combat waste, fraud, and abuse in the crop insurance program. The House-passed farm bill would permanently fund these activities. The pending farm bill (H.R. 2419) includes mandatory funding of $11 million in FY2008 and $7 million in FY2009 for crop insurance activities. Appropriators agreed on an FY2008 appropriation of $4.818 billion for the Federal Crop Insurance Fund. Additionally, Congress approved $2.8 billion in emergency agricultural disaster assistance in the FY2007 Iraq war supplemental appropriations act. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 (P.L. 110-161) authorizes $2.8 billion in emergency agricultural disaster assistance for crop and livestock losses in 2005, 2006, or early 2007. Producers can now receive assistance for all 2007 losses, with an extension of eligibility to December 31, 2007. The total estimated assistance for 2005-2007 is $3.4 billion, including $2.14 billion for crop loss and $1.24 billion for livestock. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 authorizes $3.4 billion in emergency agricultural disaster assistance, with $2.14 billion for crop loss and $1.24 billion for livestock. Additional funds are available if estimates fall short, considered emergency spending without budgetary offsets. USDA's REE function is carried out by four agencies, including the Agricultural Research Service and the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service. The USDA provides economic analysis of agriculture issues through the Economic Research Service and National Agricultural Statistics Service. The research, education, and extension budget remained flat from FY1972 to FY1991, then increased by 25% from FY1992 to FY2000. Funding for USDA research decreased after FY2003. State appropriations for agricultural research and extension programs can fluctuate, impacting program levels even when federal funding is stable. Legislation in 1998 and 2002 aimed to increase competitive grants in the REE mission area by tapping into USDA's budget, but subsequent appropriations acts prohibited the use of those funds for this purpose. In FY1999-FY2006, appropriations conferees provided more funding for ongoing REE programs than in House or Senate bills. However, adjusted for inflation, the increases are not seen as significant. Concerns are raised by agricultural scientists, stakeholders, and partners about long-term funding. The FY2008 appropriations bill compromises between House and Senate levels, providing $2.59 billion for USDA's research, extension, and economics mission area, a $57 million increase from FY2007. This increase mainly restores funding for designated research grants and construction projects suspended in FY2007. The enacted bill provides $1.17 billion for USDA's Agricultural Research Service (ARS) in FY2008, with $1.12 billion allocated for research projects and $46.7 million for construction and renovation. Approximately 150 research projects suspended in FY2007 will be reinstated, with savings from terminated projects directed towards higher priority research areas like food safety and renewable energy. The enacted bill provides $1.184 billion for the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service (CSREES) in FY2008, with funding allocated for various programs including extramural research, education, educational outreach, integrated research, tribal land grant colleges, and outreach for socially disadvantaged farmers. The FY2008 appropriations bill provides roughly $130 million for Special Research grants and Federal Administration research and extension grants. In FY2007, funds were redirected to state research programs and competitive research under P.L. 110-5. The National Research Initiative received $190.9 million in FY2008. The bill also includes $77.4 million for USDA's Economic Research Service, a 3% increase from FY2007. The FY2008 appropriations bill provides funding for various USDA agencies, including $162.2 million for the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) and $930.1 million for the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS). FSIS inspection programs are exempt from across-the-board reductions and will be supplemented by an estimated $135 million in user fees. The FY2008 appropriations bill provides funding for USDA agencies, including $930.1 million for FSIS. The final measure does not assume new user fees, seeking $96 million in fees for FY2009. The House report mentions $6.5 million to fill inspector vacancies, while the Senate report enables hiring 78 inspectors and 13 investigative staff in FY2008. Both reports allocate funds for enforcement of humane slaughter rules and provide positions for this purpose. The legislation includes $3 million for the tracking system for humane slaughter. Section 736 of the bill prohibits the implementation of a risk-based inspection system. The enacted bill prohibits the use of funds to implement rules allowing poultry product imports from China, citing concerns about avian flu outbreaks in the country. The prohibition will remain until data is reviewed by the USDA Office of Inspector General and any issues addressed by FSIS. The enacted bill prohibits the use of funds for inspecting horses prior to slaughter for human food and transporting horses for slaughter. This ban also includes companies paying fees for USDA inspection services. The prohibition aims to prevent horse meat from entering commerce. The FY2008 appropriation seeks to close the funding source for horse slaughter by prohibiting USDA inspection of horses for human food. The largest appropriation for USDA marketing and regulatory programs goes to APHIS, which is responsible for protecting U.S. agriculture from pests and diseases. The FY2008 appropriation for APHIS is $867.6 million, lower than proposed amounts but higher than FY2007. No funding is provided for buildings and facilities. $156.1 million is allocated for foreign pest and disease exclusion programs. The FY2008 appropriation for APHIS is $867.6 million, with $156.1 million allocated for foreign pest and disease exclusion programs. The total APHIS appropriation includes $236.9 million for plant and animal health monitoring and surveillance activities, and $367.2 million for pest and disease management. Additionally, $113.6 million is provided for animal care, scientific and technical services, and management. User fees and trust funds will contribute over $200 million in FY2008. The FY2008 appropriation for APHIS is $867.6 million, with $156.1 million allocated for foreign pest and disease exclusion programs. The total APHIS appropriation includes $236.9 million for plant and animal health monitoring and surveillance activities, and $367.2 million for pest and disease management. User fees and trust funds will contribute over $200 million in FY2008. The enacted bill does not allow new user fees proposed by the Administration. The bill provides $127.9 million for the emerging plant pests account, with allocations for specific pest control programs. In FY2008, the APHIS received a total appropriation of $867.6 million, with $156.1 million allocated for foreign pest and disease exclusion programs. Specific allocations include $35.6 million for citrus health, $23.2 million for glassy-winged sharpshooter, $9.6 million for potato cyst nematode, $30.7 million for emerald ash borer, $5.3 million for sudden oak death, $1.5 million for Karnal bunt, $371,000 for hydrilla control in Virginia, $234,000 for olive fruit fly in California, $1.0 million for light brown apple moth, and $423,000 for miscellaneous pests. Total EPP appropriations for FY2008 exceed the Senate proposal but fall below the House proposal and the Administration request. The committees urge APHIS to ensure adequate funding for Asian long-horned beetle activities in New York and assist states with new emerald ash borer initiatives. The committees urge APHIS to provide funding for Asian long-horned beetle activities in New York and assist states with new emerald ash borer outbreaks. They also request funding for sudden oak death research, development, and testing, as well as for inspection and regulation programs. Additionally, a report is requested to assess the effectiveness of current regulatory efforts and the risks associated with infected plant material. The enacted bill allocates $67.4 million for avian flu activities in APHIS. The enacted bill allocates $67.4 million for avian flu activities in APHIS, with $51.7 million designated for the highly pathogenic avian influenza program. The House committee report requests a report on the spending of $118.7 million provided for HPAI since 2006. Additionally, $15.7 million is provided for low pathogen avian influenza, including $750,000 for preparedness activities in Connecticut. The House and Senate committee reports question USDA's progress in implementing a national animal identification system (NAIS) despite $117.8 million spent. The House requests a detailed strategic plan for the program, while the enacted bill provides $9.8 million for NAIS, below the Administration's request of $33.2 million for FY2008. The conference report expresses concerns about the lack of information provided on full costs and the use of funds for the National Animal Identification System (NAIS). It highlights issues with reaching the 48-hour traceback goal, funding allocation for cooperative agreements, and program management. The Government Accountability Office's report also identifies hindrances to effective implementation of NAIS. The GAO-07-592 report identifies problems hindering the implementation of animal ID, such as lack of prioritization of species, integration plan with existing requirements, and data requirements. The GIPSA branch sets U.S. standards for grain inspection and ensures fair trading in livestock markets. The enacted bill allocates $38.5 million for GIPSA salaries, lower than proposed amounts. The FY2008 budget includes a $730 million increase for increased enforcement of the Packers and Stockyards Act. The House report requested a detailed spending plan from GIPSA on how the increase will be used, while the Administration proposed offsetting some activities with user fees. GIPSA was criticized for deficiencies in oversight and enforcement by USDA's OIG and Senators in 2006. The agency released a consultant's report on livestock marketing practices funded by a congressional appropriation. Members of the Senate Agriculture Committee are interested in addressing competition concerns in the livestock industry. AMS is responsible for promoting U.S. agricultural products in domestic and international markets, with user fees covering a substantial portion of spending. The enacted bill provides $114.7 million in federal funds for programs such as process verification, commodity grading, and specialty crop block grants under the AMS account. This includes $8.4 million for specialty crop block grants to promote the consumption and competitiveness of fruits, vegetables, tree nuts, and nursery crops. The total funding level reflects a 0.7% reduction in USDA discretionary programs, with an increase of approximately $2 million from the FY2007 enacted level. The FY2008 enacted amount for the AMS-administered Federal-State Marketing Improvement Program is $3.8 million. $1.86 million is designated as a marketing grant to Wisconsin. $9.9 million is allocated for the Web-based supply chain management system. Section 32 funding, derived from U.S. Customs receipts, supports various programs like child nutrition and surplus farm commodity purchases. AMS maintains a Section 32 contingency reserve for unprogrammed funds. The USDA maintains a Section 32 contingency reserve with unprogrammed funds from the prior year, up to $500 million can be carried over. This reserve is used for emergency surplus removals of various food commodities to provide price support during market downturns. The USDA has flexibility in using this reserve, which can also be tapped for farm disaster assistance. Commodities removed from the market are distributed to domestic food assistance programs as a bonus. The USDA maintains a Section 32 contingency reserve with unprogrammed funds for emergency surplus removals of food commodities. The enacted bill for FY2008 aims to limit AMS's discretionary use of Section 32 monies by rescinding $684 million. Despite the rescission, $297 million will still be provided for estimated future needs in FY2008. The House committee report on the FY2008 appropriation provides an increase of $2 million for AMS to implement COOL for fresh produce, red meats, peanuts, and seafood by September 30, 2008. Provisions in the farm bills aim to maintain the current implementation deadline, extend coverage to additional commodities, and ease compliance requirements. The 2008 Farm Bill provides increased funding for discretionary NRCS programs, rejecting some proposed reductions. It makes few changes to mandatory programs and allocates $937.5 million for FY2008 discretionary NRCS programs, a 10% increase from FY2007. The bill provides $834.4 million for Conservation Operations, below House and Senate proposals but above the Administration's. The enacted bill for FY2008 provides funding for NRCS programs, including Conservation Operations, which is below House and Senate proposals but above the Administration's request. It includes a $20 million reduction in total Conservation Operations spending for various activities. Additionally, the bill specifies funding for alterations and improvements to buildings and other public improvements, while not providing funding for Watersheds Surveys and Planning as proposed by the House. The enacted bill for FY2008 provides funding for NRCS programs, including Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations, Watershed Rehabilitation Program, and Resource and Conservation Development. The bill allocates $29.8 million for Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations, $19.9 million for Watershed Rehabilitation Program, and $50.7 million for Resource and Conservation Development. These amounts differ from the House and Senate proposals as well as the Administration's request. The enacted bill for FY2008 provides funding for NRCS programs, including Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations, Watershed Rehabilitation Program, and Resource and Conservation Development. The bill allocates funding for various programs, with increases in funding for NRCS and CRP programs. The bill also places a limit on Environmental Quality Incentives Program spending. The EQIP program is authorized $1.27 billion in mandatory funds for FY2008. The Consolidated Appropriations Act extends three conservation programs with specified annual funding levels through March 15, 2008. Three agencies are responsible for USDA's rural development mission area: the Rural Housing Service, the Rural Business-Cooperative Service, and the Rural Utilities Service. The Rural Development mission area of USDA includes the Rural Housing Service, Rural Business-Cooperative Service, and Rural Utilities Service. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2008 authorizes $2.33 billion in discretionary budget authority for rural development loan and grant programs. This represents a decrease in budget authority compared to FY2007, but an increase in loan authority. The FY2008 Consolidated bill authorized $714.2 million for the Rural Community Facilities, Rural Business, and Rural Water and Waste Disposal programs, down from $737 million in FY2007. The Senate recommended $704.1 million, while the House suggested $728.8 million. The RCAP accounts are now reported under RHS, RBS, and RUS program accounts. The FY2008 Consolidated bill authorizes $1.33 billion for RHS loans and grants, with $68.5 million for Rural Community Facilities. This is a 12% decrease from FY2007. Loan authority for FY2008 is $6.1 billion, a 9.4% increase from FY2007. The Rural Community Facilities budget for FY2008 includes $20.4 million in grants, despite the Administration's request to terminate the grants portion of the program. Additionally, $8.2 million is allocated for the Rural Community Development Initiative and $13.9 million for Economic Impact Initiative grants. The consolidated bill authorizes $5.31 billion in loan authorization for direct and guaranteed loans under the single-family housing program, with loan guarantees representing the larger portion of the authorization level. Budget authority for Section 502 loans is authorized at $155.9 million. The bill also authorizes $34.4 million in loan authority for housing repair loans and $9.7 million in loan subsidies. For multi-family loan guarantees, the bill authorizes loan levels of $129.1 million and $69.5 million for Section 515 rental housing loans. The consolidated bill authorizes $472.7 million for the rental assistance program (Section 521), $38.7 million for mutual and self-help housing grants, $21.8 million for the farm labor account (Section 514/516), $5.0 million for the rural housing voucher program, and $177.9 million for RBS for FY2008. The Rural Business Program account is authorized $87.1 million in budget authority, including appropriations for grants and loan subsidies. The total budget authority for this account is $2.7 million more than FY2007, with increases in loan subsidies for the Business and Industry loan program. Additionally, the bill authorizes funding for the rural Empowerment Zone/Enterprise Communities grants programs and the Renewable Energy Program. The consolidated bill authorizes $655.3 million in budget authority for FY2008, an increase of $8 million from FY2007, and $9.18 billion in loan authorization. This includes $35.7 million for loan subsidies and grants under the Renewable Energy Program, which is almost $13 million more than FY2007. Additionally, $1.5 million is provided for grants to assist minority producers, and $97.4 million in budget authority will support $7.78 billion in electric and telecommunication loans for FY2008. The budget authority for FY2008 includes $7.78 billion for electric and telecommunication loans, $1.7 billion more than FY2007. The Rural Water and Waste Disposal Program receives the largest share of spending among the three RCAP programs. The bill authorizes $555.0 million for Water/Waste Water loan and grants programs, up $3.6 million from FY2007. Additionally, $34.7 million is authorized for the Distance Learning/Telemedicine program, $5 million more than FY2007. The bill authorizes $34.7 million in grant support, $5 million more than FY2007, and recommends $297.0 million in loan authority for broadband loans, $197 million less than FY2007. $6.4 million in loan subsidies and $13.4 million in grants are authorized for broadband programs. Funding for domestic food assistance, including child nutrition and food stamp programs, represents over half of USDA's budget and is mostly mandatory entitlements. For FY2007, Congress allocated $57 billion for domestic food assistance programs, including child nutrition and food stamp programs. However, actual spending is expected to be around $54.1 billion, with the difference due to unused contingency appropriations and lower costs than anticipated. The main discretionary budget items include the WIC program, the CSFP, and federal nutrition program administration. The enacted appropriation for FY2008 for domestic food assistance totaled $60 billion, exceeding the $59.3 billion requested. The difference from the Administration's request was primarily due to added funding for the WIC program and the CSFP. The House and Senate bills for FY2008 would have appropriated $59.7 billion for domestic food assistance, about $400 million more than requested, with disagreements over WIC and CSFP funding. The Administration proposed $59.3 billion for domestic food assistance in FY2008, with disagreements over WIC and CSFP funding. The enacted appropriations law included changes to food stamp and child nutrition programs, as well as increased funding for free fruits and vegetables in schools. The enacted appropriation for FY2008 did not adopt most of the Administration's proposed changes in program rules or its recommendation to terminate the CSFP. It includes funding for various food assistance programs under the Food Stamp Act, totaling $39.8 billion, up from $38.2 billion in FY2007. This funding covers the regular Food Stamp program, Nutrition Assistance Block Grants, the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations, The Emergency Food Assistance Program, and Community Food Projects. The FY2008 enacted appropriation for food assistance programs under the Food Stamp Act totaled $39.8 billion, including a $3 billion contingency reserve. Actual estimated spending for FY2008 is between $36.8 and $36.9 billion, with the Administration requesting $37.978 billion for the regular Food Stamp program. The FY2008 enacted appropriation for food assistance programs under the Food Stamp Act totaled $39.8 billion, including a $3 billion contingency reserve. The appropriation also included $60-$70 million to cover new food stamp costs related to the termination of the CSFP. The Administration's request was mostly adopted, except for the proposal to end the CSFP, resulting in a slight reduction in the food stamp appropriation to $37.916 billion. Additionally, nutrition assistance grants for Puerto Rico, American Samoa, and the Northern Marianas were included in the FY2008 request. The FY2008 enacted appropriation for food assistance programs included small increases for Puerto Rico and American Samoa, with the figure for the Northern Marianas remaining the same as FY2007. The total amount for the FDPIR program was $88 million, including $6 million for administrative expenses. $140 million was allocated for the acquisition of commodities for TEFAP, with no increase from FY2007. The enacted appropriation for food assistance programs in FY2008 includes funding for Community Food Projects and food stamp access grants at $5 million each. The Child Nutrition budget account funds various programs like School Lunch and Breakfast programs, CACFP, Summer Food Service program, Special Milk program, and food safety education initiatives. Funding also supports a program offering free fresh fruits and vegetables in schools in 14 states. The Administration proposed an FY2008 appropriation of $13.897 billion for child nutrition programs, with increases for School Lunch, School Breakfast, CACFP, Summer Food Service, State administrative expenses, Commodity procurement, Special Milk program, and Coordinated Reviews. The enacted appropriation for FY2008 provides a total of $13.901 billion for child nutrition programs, including $6.020 billion for the WIC program, which is $816 million more than FY2007 and $633 million more than the Administration's request.
