    "content": "The New Starts program provides federal funds for the construction and expansion of fixed-guideway transit systems, primarily focusing on transit rail systems such as subway/elevated rail, light rail, and commuter rail. Many cities have benefited from federal support to open new transit rail systems or expand existing ones, leading to a significant increase in rail transit route-mileage between 1985 and 2008. The New Starts program, administered by the Federal Transit Administration, is part of the federal transit program authorized by SAFETEA. It provides funds for transit rail systems like subway, light rail, and commuter rail. The program has been extended multiple times since SAFETEA expired in 2009. During SAFETEA (FY2005-FY2009), New Starts Program received 18% of transit funding. Other major programs included Urbanized Area Formula (43%), Fixed-Guideway Modernization (16%), and Bus Capital (9%). New Starts grants are crucial for project advancement due to competitive funding process. Rail transit systems, with long lifespans, heavily rely on New Starts funding for future implications on transit policy. Transit systems, particularly rail transit, rely heavily on New Starts funding for long-term operation and maintenance. The report discusses potential changes for Congress to consider in a long-term reauthorization, including funding distribution, eligible transit modes, project evaluation process, and private sector involvement. It also reflects on the future relevance of New Starts for public transit. Since SAFETEA, New Starts has been split into Small Starts for smaller projects and major New Starts for larger initiatives. Small Starts receive $200 million annually for projects costing $250 million or less, while major New Starts projects secure federal funding through a Full Funding Grant Agreement. To obtain federal funding through a Full Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA), a project must go through the New Starts approval process, which includes regional planning, systems planning, and alternatives analysis. The process culminates in the selection of a locally preferred alternative for addressing transportation needs in a specific corridor or subarea. The conclusion of the alternatives analysis is the selection of a locally preferred alternative (LPA), which is submitted to FTA for evaluation and approval for entry into preliminary engineering. New Starts projects must fulfill NEPA requirements before entering preliminary engineering, involving identifying alternatives and significant environmental issues. Preliminary engineering refines the project by examining costs, benefits, impacts, and completing an environmental impact analysis as required by NEPA. After preliminary engineering, FTA may approve the project for final design, which includes preparing construction plans and cost estimates. FTA retains oversight during construction and requests funding from Congress annually. FTA may provide assurance of funding through a Letter of Intent or Early Systems Work Agreement. An Early Systems Work Agreement provides funding for work to begin before an FFGA is awarded. FTA computes an overall project rating based on project justification and local financial commitment criteria to advance through each stage of development. The local financial commitment rating is derived from capital finance, operating finance, and non-New Starts funding share, while the project justification rating considers cost effectiveness. The FTA evaluates project justification criteria with weights for cost effectiveness, mobility improvements, economic development effects, public transportation supportive land use policies, environmental benefits, and operating efficiencies. The Obama Administration no longer requires projects to receive a medium rating on cost effectiveness to be recommended. Now, a project only needs an overall medium rating, with local financial commitment and project justification also rated medium or better. This change aims to address criticism that focusing on time savings overlooks other transit benefits. The Small Starts project process under the New Starts program in SAFETEA involves a simplified version for projects costing $250 million or less seeking $75 million or less in federal funds. It includes systems planning, alternatives analysis, and combines preliminary engineering and final design into project development phase. FTA approval is required for entry into project development, with potential recommendation for a Project Construction Grant Agreement. The Small Starts project process under the New Starts program in SAFETEA involves a simplified version for projects costing $250 million or less seeking $75 million or less in federal funds. The project rating is based on project justification summary rating and local financial commitment rating, with different criteria and weights. A project must receive at least a medium rating to be approved. Very Small Starts projects costing less than $50 million have a simplified approval process. The New Starts program, part of the Capital Investment Grants program, evolved from the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964. Projects costing $25 million or less are exempt from the Small Starts evaluation process until a final regulation is issued. In the 1970s, the Department of Transportation began issuing policy statements on distributing federal funding for \"new starts.\" The New Starts program, part of the Capital Investment Grants program, evolved from the Urban Mass Transportation Act of 1964. In the 1970s, the Department of Transportation issued policy statements on distributing federal funding for \"new starts,\" which introduced principles later written into federal law. These principles were enacted in the Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of 1987, establishing criteria for New Starts projects to be eligible for federal funding. The STURAA, ISTEA, and TEA-21 Acts established criteria for New Starts projects to be eligible for federal funding, including cost-effectiveness, local financial commitment, mobility improvements, environmental benefits, and operating efficiencies. Additional considerations were added in ISTEA and TEA-21, such as congestion relief, energy consumption, transit supportive land use policies, and economic development. TEA-21 and SAFETEA introduced new considerations for transit projects, such as costs of sprawl and technical capacity. FTA ratings changed from a three-point to a five-point scale, with added emphasis on economic development and land use policies. SAFETEA also created the Small Starts program. SAFETEA introduced the Small Starts program and emphasized cost effectiveness in project funding. A proposed rule required a medium rating for project recommendation, with cost effectiveness weighted at 50%. Other criteria included land use and economic development (20%), mobility benefits (20%), environmental benefits (5%), and benefits to transit-dependent riders (5%). Concerns were raised about the proposal not aligning with SAFETEA's intent. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 and SAFETEA-LU Technical Corrections Act of 2008 addressed concerns about the emphasis on cost effectiveness in transit project evaluation. FTA withdrew the 2007 NPRM and issued final guidance in July 2009, implementing the use of cost effectiveness. In January 2010, FTA announced the withdrawal of the policy of only recommending medium-rated projects for funding. FTA is changing its policy to recommend projects with an overall rating of medium or better, instead of just focusing on cost-effectiveness. They are also planning to issue a new NPRM for changes to the evaluation process for New Starts and Small Starts projects. The reauthorization of the New Starts program will address funding allocation for projects. The American Public Transportation Association (APTA) recommends authorizing the New Starts program at about $21.2 billion over a six-year period, more than double the previous funding. APTA also suggests a total federal transit funding of $123 billion over six years to address population growth, transit demand, congestion, and environmental concerns. Increasing New Starts funding by raising transit program funding overall may be challenging without raising federal taxes. Currently, New Starts funding comes from the U.S. Treasury, while the rest of the transit program is funded from the Mass Transit Account of the Highway Trust Fund. Congress could increase New Starts funding by reducing other parts of the transit program, but this may impact federal funding for existing transit services. APTA's proposal aims to maintain New Starts funding at 40% of the Capital Investment Grants program, with 40% for Rail Modernization and 20% for Bus and Bus-Related Facilities. Increasing transit funding through legislation aimed at dealing with climate change is a possible avenue. The Clean, Low Emission, Affordable, New Transportation Efficiency Act proposes establishing a Low Greenhouse Gas Transportation Fund funded by auctioning greenhouse gas emissions allowances. This fund would support states and Metropolitan Planning Organizations in developing plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transportation and fund related projects. Expanding transit capacity is seen as a potential solution. Expanding transit capacity to reduce GHG emissions is a proposed solution, but not everyone supports more funding for New Starts. Critics argue that federal resources should focus on highways for interstate commerce and congestion mitigation. They also believe that many cities lack the population or density to make rail systems viable, and extending them into low-density suburbs is not desirable. President Obama's transit administrator questions the use of federal funds for expanding transit rail systems when existing systems are underfunded. The suggestion is to redirect New Starts program funding towards rehabilitating and improving existing transit rail systems for long-term sustainability. President Obama's transit administrator questions the use of federal funds for expanding transit rail systems when existing systems are underfunded. Research by FTA estimates that bringing transit assets to a good state of repair would cost $78 billion, with $59 billion needed for rail systems. Current spending for rehabilitation is $12 to $13 billion per year, while eliminating the backlog would require $18 billion annually over 20 years. Congress may consider increasing funding for rehabilitating transit rail systems. Congress may choose to increase funding for rehabilitating transit rail systems through the Rail Modernization program, or in other ways. Concern with the condition of the subway system in the Washington, DC, region prompted Congress in 2008 to authorize an additional $1.5 billion over 10 years for the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). Increasing the total amount of New Starts funding or placing a limit on federal participation in projects are options to address funding constraints. Some argue for a transition to enhancing existing transit systems in various settings rather than creating new rail systems. Concerns exist that a size limit on grants may reduce the effectiveness of the New Starts program, which aims to address issues like highway congestion and air quality. One suggestion is to allocate more New Starts funding to the Small Starts program, which received $200 million in FY2009 out of $1.8 billion. Some argue for lowering the federal share in the New Starts program to allow more funding for worthwhile projects and encourage stronger project selection by states and localities. This could lead to more economic analysis according to the Government Accountability Office. Some advocate reducing the federal share for both highways and transit to 50% to encourage states and localities to focus on the most productive projects. Prior to 2005, projects seeking more than 60% federal assistance were rated \"low\" by the FTA, but this policy has changed since FY2007. Since FY2002, the Senate Appropriations Committee has directed the FTA not to sign any FFGAs with more than a 60% federal share. New Starts projects typically have less than a 60% federal share. Funding for projects is limited by contingent commitment authority, which includes currently authorized funding and expected future funding. The FTA has contingent commitment authority for New Starts and Small Starts projects, calculated differently for each. In the New Starts program, it is equivalent to the last three fiscal years of funding authorized, while in the Small Starts program, it is equivalent to the last fiscal year of funding authorized. The amount and calculation of contingent commitment authority were revised in TEA-21. The FY2001 DOT Appropriations Act increased the contingent commitment authority for New Starts projects to the last three years of authorized funding. SAFETEA also added a provision for Small Starts projects, allowing for contingent commitment authority equivalent to the last one year of authorized funding. When the maximum commitment authority is reached, FTA may have to wait for more funds to be authorized before entering into new commitments. The authorization of funds for FTA projects is typically part of surface transportation reauthorization. In some cases, funds may be provided through other legislation, such as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Congress could potentially change the formula for calculating contingent commitment authority to avoid the need for ad hoc funding. The current discussion involves increasing commitment authority for future fiscal years in the federal transit program, with a potential 10% annual growth. There is a concern that increasing funding expectations may hinder funding for projects in earlier stages. Additionally, there is a debate between supporters of rail transit and bus/bus rapid transit within the program. Advocates of federal funding for fixed-guideway transit, particularly rail transit, argue that it offers higher-quality service to attract discretionary transit users and can help alleviate highway congestion, parking issues, air pollution, and energy use. They also believe that rail transit has the potential for positive land use effects and economic development. Rail stations promote compact, mixed-use development, counteracting urban sprawl and reducing motor vehicle travel. Supporters argue that rail has lower per-passenger operating costs than buses in high-demand areas, making it a cost-effective option. Additionally, gaining local public support for rail projects is easier compared to bus improvements. Critics argue that rail systems are expensive to build and maintain, less flexible than buses, and may only be beneficial in high-density corridors. Critics argue that building new rail systems for suburban commuters has disadvantaged bus-dependent populations in the central city. They claim that the shift from buses to rail has not significantly increased transit patronage and has come at a higher cost. Environmental benefits of new rail lines are also questioned, as the energy use and greenhouse gas emissions may not be lower than buses or cars they replace. Critics highlight the energy-intensive construction of rail systems and the need for bus or car transportation to reach rail stations. Critics argue that building new rail systems may not significantly reduce energy consumption or emissions, suggesting better alternatives like promoting alternatively powered vehicles and improving fuel efficiency. Shifting federal support to buses or BRT is seen as a cost-effective solution compared to new rail systems. Capital costs for Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) vary depending on the infrastructure, with BRT being 39% cheaper than light rail on exclusive busways, 26% cheaper in HOV lanes, and 2% cheaper on city streets. Operational costs show no consistent advantage for light rail over BRT. BRT is praised for its flexibility in design and easier service modifications, but critics argue that economic development benefits may be lower compared to fixed rail systems. The economic development benefits of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) may be lower compared to transit rail systems. Limited experience with BRT makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions about its economic benefits. Funding for BRT projects has been limited due to the preference for larger, capital-intensive rail projects under the New Starts program. SAFETEA broadened the definition of fixed guideway to include more BRT projects, encouraging proposals for BRT projects under the New Starts program. SAFETEA broadened the definition of fixed guideway to include more BRT projects, encouraging proposals for BRT projects under the New Starts program. BRT projects in the funding pipeline include the New Britain-Hartford Busway in Connecticut, phase 3 of the Silver Line in Boston, Massachusetts, and the Mason Corridor BRT in Fort Collins, Colorado. Some suggest including express toll lanes as part of a BRT network for New Starts funding. Detractors argue that BRT projects, though cheaper than rail systems, are still more expensive and less effective than conventional bus service. Some analysts argue that basic bus services with attractive fares can increase ridership more than capital-intensive BRT or light rail projects. Streetcars are seen as a cheaper and quicker alternative to light rail, providing high service levels for walkable cities. The Obama Administration's guidelines de-emphasize cost effectiveness in evaluating transit projects. The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) announced $130 million in unallocated New Starts funding for \"urban circulator\" projects like streetcars in December 2009. In July 2010, the FTA awarded the $130 million to five streetcar projects and one Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) project. The New Starts program faces challenges due to the complexity, length, and expense of the federal funding approval process, requiring extensive data and detailed reports for project approval. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) suggests using the New Starts evaluation process as a model for other federal programs to ensure effective use of funds. Many in the transportation industry find federal requirements for funding approval time-consuming and costly. GAO's study found insufficient data to assess if the New Starts process has become longer. Only 9 out of 40 projects had complete data, with the shortest completion time being unclear. The completion time of the New Starts process varies, with the shortest being 4 years 7 months and the longest 14 years 2 months. Project delays are often due to local actions, such as changes in scope or financing mechanisms. Legislative changes and administrative actions have been made to address delays, including the creation of the Small Starts program and the Public-Private Partnership Pilot Program. SAFETEA created the Public-Private Partnership Pilot Program (Penta-P) to increase private participation in project development. FTA offers training workshops and project delivery tools to accelerate program approvals. Congress may need to simplify the New Starts process by reducing steps and moving up federal funding decisions. A proposal suggests replacing preliminary engineering approval with entry into the New Starts program. APTA suggests simplifying the New Starts program by eliminating the need for FTA approval in final design and implementing Project Development Agreements to streamline project delivery. This could significantly reduce project delivery times by expediting federal funding approval. Some argue for quick federal funding approval to shorten project delivery times, especially for low-risk projects with high benefits relative to costs. Critics fear this may lower evaluation rigor and lead to support for less beneficial projects. Simplifying the process could result in a flood of project proposals, potentially overwhelming FTA's evaluation capacity and leading to approval of more projects than can be financially supported. The Small Starts program aims to fast-track low-risk projects with a small share of federal funds, potentially speeding up project delivery. However, this approach may lead to problems being overlooked, accusations of favoritism, and inexperienced sponsors facing challenges in project development. The Federal Transit Administration already has the authority to make management changes to improve the New Starts approval process. The Federal Transit Administration aims to speed up and improve the New Starts approval process by addressing issues identified in a 2007 study. These issues include unclear project requirements, organizational conflicts, and inefficient technology use. GAO noted in 2008 that progress on these recommendations is unclear, suggesting Congress may need to oversee implementation. Increasing staff dedicated to reviewing proposals could help reduce project evaluation times. FTA aims to improve the New Starts approval process by addressing issues identified in a 2007 study. Congress may need to provide more funds for New Starts administration, but this could be challenging in the current fiscal environment. Frequent policy changes by FTA lead to project delays and additional costs. Some suggest applying changes to future projects to avoid delays, but this may impact oversight on existing projects. Major changes to the approval process are expected to be part of surface transportation reauthorization legislation. The Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 2009 (STAA) has been introduced in the 111th Congress, lacking funding details. The bill, marked up by the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Subcommittee on Highways and Transit, aims to streamline the approval process for the New Starts program, eliminating the alternatives analysis and reducing approval steps to one for the approval of a Full Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA). The Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 2009 aims to streamline the approval process for the New Starts program by allowing fast-tracking of projects, raising the break point for major projects to $100 million, exempting projects requesting $25 million or less, and creating an Office of Expedited Project Delivery within FTA. The Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 2009 aims to streamline the approval process for the New Starts program by allowing fast-tracking of projects, raising the break point for major projects to $100 million, exempting projects requesting $25 million or less, and creating an Office of Expedited Project Delivery within FTA. Congress might consider further modifications to the way New Starts projects are evaluated, with a focus on economic development and land use criteria. Congress may support FTA with additional resources for data development and travel modeling. There is a possibility that Congress may find FTA's weighting scheme inappropriate and revise the justification factors in the statute to include more specific details. This could allow Congress to include factors like energy reduction and greenhouse gas emissions. Alternatively, Congress might simplify the criteria by focusing on mobility benefits, rather than economic development. Some believe that the key criteria for New Starts projects should prioritize transporting more travelers at a lower cost and reducing highway congestion. The STAA proposes to replace current project justification criteria with an evaluation of benefits including mobility, accessibility, congestion relief, energy, environmental benefits, economic development, and public transportation supportive land use policies. It would prohibit the use of a cost-effectiveness index and limit transportation system user benefit calculation to mobility evaluation. GAO suggests monetizing all benefits and costs for New Starts projects in a 2008 report. One option for evaluating New Starts projects is to monetize all benefits and costs using benefit-cost analysis, providing comprehensive comparisons. Critics argue that some benefits are hard to monetize and current law limits considering mobility improvements. Another approach is to evaluate projects based on local goals, offering flexibility but making funding decisions more contentious. However, prioritizing local goals may hinder projects serving national priorities. Alternatively, making the New Starts program a formula program is suggested. The New Starts program is associated with the traditional \"design-bid-build\" method of developing infrastructure projects. Design-bid-build projects follow a sequential order of project delivery steps, and the New Starts program aligns with this process. The New Starts program aligns with the design-bid-build method of project delivery. However, the program's alignment with this traditional approach has hindered private sector involvement through public-private partnerships (PPPs). PPPs offer benefits such as private financing, cost savings, quicker project completion, and risk transfer from the public to the private sector. Congress has previously addressed concerns by promoting the use of PPPs in transit projects. The New Starts program explores the use of Design-Build (DB) and Design-Build-Operate-Maintain (DBOM) contracts, with a focus on PPPs. ISTEA and SAFETEA directed FTA to issue guidance on DB/DBOM and establish the Public-Private Partnership Pilot Program (Penta-P). Three project sponsors, including BART, RTD, and Houston Metro, are involved in Penta-P. In a recent report by GAO on private sector involvement in New Starts projects, changes in project delivery were noted, but not in project finance. Seven projects since 2000 used alternative approaches, with five using DB and two using DBOM. The Penta-P program has not had a significant impact so far. FTA has the authority to streamline the process for Penta-P projects but has not done so due to concerns about risk transfer to the private sector, especially in project financing. Congress could simplify the program to increase private sector participation. The report suggests simplifying the program by reducing steps, such as combining evaluations for entry into the New Starts program. Congress could encourage more early approvals from FTA and provide guidance for PPPs. FHWA has an office for highway PPPs, and FTA could do the same for transit PPPs. The STAA proposes creating an Office of Expedited Project Delivery in FTA for technical assistance. The Office of Expedited Project Delivery in FTA would provide technical assistance and coordination for the New Starts program, focusing on streamlining the environmental review process. Transit supporters believe in future growth in demand due to concerns over the financial and environmental costs of automobiles and highways. Transit advocates believe that the spike in gas prices in 2008 and concerns over climate change indicate a growing importance of public transportation. They argue that with the projected population growth in large metropolitan areas, more investment in high-capacity and electrified rail transit is necessary. However, transit skeptics point out that despite recent increases in ridership, per capita ridership is lower than in the 1980s. Despite increased supply of transit, per capita ridership remains lower than in the 1980s due to factors like population decentralization, income growth, and personal vehicle availability. Critics argue that new rail systems may be underused and costly, while advancements in fuel efficiency could mitigate automobile expenses. The future of surface transportation may not change much in terms of travel by automobiles and transit. New automotive technologies like all-electric vehicles could shift the debate on costs from transportation to energy generation. These new technologies are expected to provide choice and flexibility in fuel sources without drastically altering the use of personal vehicles and public transit, despite population growth in urban areas. According to one perspective, urban areas may need alternatives to personal vehicles due to congestion. While automobiles will likely remain dominant, new fixed guideway transit systems could be necessary in certain situations. Extensive rail systems will likely remain rare, with buses continuing as the main form of transit service in most places."
