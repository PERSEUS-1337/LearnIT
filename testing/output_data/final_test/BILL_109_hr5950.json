The \"Family Farm Energy Relief Act of 2006\" repeals provisions of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 related to temporary expensing for equipment used in refining of liquid fuels, pass through deductions for small refiner cooperatives, treatment of natural gas distribution and gathering lines as property, small refiner exceptions to oil depletion deduction, and amortization of geological and geophysical expenditures. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall be applied and administered as if the provisions specified in subsection (a) had never been enacted. SEC. 25E. FARM DIESEL EXPENSES CREDIT is a new section added to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, providing a credit for farm diesel purchases. A credit of 10 percent of farm diesel expenses paid or incurred by a qualified farmer is allowed against the tax. A qualified farmer is defined as an individual actively engaged in farming, with farming income at least 75 percent of total income. The section defines farm diesel expenses as amounts paid for diesel fuel intended for farming purposes. This section does not apply to expenses incurred after December 31, 2009. A clerical amendment is made to the tax code. The section introduces a Farm diesel expenses credit and an increase in the small agri-biodiesel producer credit for qualified farmers. The amendments apply to farm diesel expenses paid or incurred in taxable years beginning after the enactment of the Act. The amendment introduces an increase in the small agri-biodiesel producer credit for qualified farmers, substituting '20 cents' for '10 cents' for eligible small agri-biodiesel producers who are qualified farmers actively engaged in farming. The amendment increases the small agri-biodiesel producer credit for qualified farmers actively engaged in farming. The amendments apply to qualified agri-biodiesel production after December 31, 2006, in taxable years beginning after that date. SEC. 5. ALLOWANCE OF SMALL BIODIESEL PRODUCER CREDIT FOR QUALIFIED FARMERS. The small biodiesel producer credit is amended to provide 10 cents for each gallon of qualified biodiesel production by eligible small biodiesel producers. The small biodiesel producer credit is amended to provide 10 cents for each gallon of qualified biodiesel production by eligible small biodiesel producers, which includes biodiesel sold for use in production or as fuel in a trade or business. The small biodiesel producer credit is amended to provide 10 cents for each gallon of qualified biodiesel production by eligible small biodiesel producers, with a limit of 15,000,000 gallons per year. Definitions and special rules apply for small biodiesel producers. The small biodiesel producer credit provides 10 cents per gallon for eligible small biodiesel producers with a limit of 60,000,000 gallons per year. A qualified farmer must be actively engaged in farming and have gross income from farming. The small biodiesel producer credit requires that a qualified farmer's gross income from farming for the taxable year is at least 75 percent of their total gross income from all sources. Special rules apply to the credit, and it is effective for qualified biodiesel production after December 31, 2006."
