    "content": "Marijuana is the most commonly used illicit drug in the United States, with an estimated 19.8 million individuals aged 12 or older being current users in 2013. Youth perceptions of risk related to marijuana use have declined, and availability has increased due to factors like rising production in Mexico and cultivation in the US by criminal networks. The cultivation of marijuana in the United States is led by criminal networks, including Mexican drug trafficking organizations. Public attitudes towards marijuana have shifted, with over half of surveyed adults supporting legalization. Currently listed as a Schedule I controlled substance, federal laws prohibiting marijuana use are being questioned. The federal government's position on marijuana as a Schedule I controlled substance has sparked debates among policymakers, law enforcement, and the public. Despite federal laws, states have varying views on marijuana, with over half allowing for medical use. Some states have also legalized recreational use, as seen in Washington State and Colorado in 2012. In November 2014, Washington State, Colorado, District of Columbia, Oregon, and Alaska legalized small amounts of marijuana for recreational use. This has raised questions about federal law enforcement and drug policies. The report discusses federal marijuana policy, state trends in decriminalization and legalization, and issues for law enforcement and criminal organizations involved in the black market. Congress may face related policy questions. Until 1937, marijuana was legal under federal law, but the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 imposed strict regulations. The Controlled Substances Act of 1970 placed marijuana under federal jurisdiction as a Schedule I controlled substance, prohibiting its use. The Controlled Substances Act of 1970 classified marijuana as a Schedule I controlled substance, leading to its prohibition. The Shafer Commission was established to study various aspects of marijuana in the United States. The Shafer Commission produced two reports on marijuana, recommending a social control policy to discourage use and questioning the constitutionality of criminalizing personal use. Despite these recommendations, federal prohibition of marijuana remained unchanged. The Shafer Commission reviewed drug use in the US and recommended social policy changes. They found that marijuana use does not lead to aggressive behavior and has low risk compared to other substances. Despite this, federal prohibition of marijuana remained unchanged. The Shafer Commission recommended reexamining drug policies in the US, including marijuana. While some states have moved towards decriminalization and legalization of marijuana, federal policy remains unchanged. There is ongoing debate about the need for a comprehensive review of federal drug policy. Marijuana decriminalization involves removing criminal penalties for possession of small amounts, making it a civil offense with civil penalties. This differs from legalization, as possession is still illegal but not subject to criminal prosecution. Decriminalization initiatives focus on possession, not distribution, and do not conflict with federal law enforcement priorities. Decriminalization initiatives for marijuana focus on possession, not distribution, and do not conflict with federal law enforcement priorities. States like Massachusetts have decriminalized possession of small amounts, but individuals are still in violation of both federal and state laws. Penalties under the CSA can include imprisonment and fines, while state laws like in Massachusetts impose civil penalties. In New York, possession of small amounts of marijuana is still considered a crime when in \"open to public view.\" In 2010, nearly 55,000 individuals in New York State were arrested for possession of marijuana. In November 2014, NYC changed its marijuana enforcement policy to issue summons instead of arrests for possession of 25 grams or less. California was the first state to allow medicinal use of marijuana in 1996, and as of November 2014, over half of all states and the District of Columbia allow medicinal use in various ways. Some states allow medicinal use of marijuana in various ways, but federal law does not distinguish between medical and recreational use. Despite states' authorization, federal law enforcement has prosecuted individuals for medical marijuana-related offenses. Enforcement priorities focus on growers and dispensers over individual users. In 2012, Colorado and Washington legalized recreational marijuana use, followed by Alaska, Oregon, and the District of Columbia in 2014. These initiatives removed state penalties for specified marijuana activities, creating disparities with federal law. In 2012, Colorado and Washington legalized recreational marijuana use, followed by Alaska, Oregon, and the District of Columbia in 2014. These initiatives allow individuals aged 21 and over to possess specific quantities of marijuana and set up state-administered regulatory schemes for its sale. Differences exist among the initiatives, such as allowing personal cultivation in some states but not in others. Various actions involving marijuana remain crimes, like operating a vehicle under the influence. Legalization initiatives in states show increasing public support for marijuana legalization. In 1970, only 12% of adults believed in legalizing marijuana, but by 2014, over half (52%) supported it. Federal law enforcement focuses on targeting criminal networks rather than individual drug offenders. The Department of Justice reaffirmed its stance after some states legalized medical marijuana, emphasizing efforts against traffickers and distributors rather than low-level users. The Department of Justice (DOJ) enforces federal marijuana laws despite state legalization of medical use. Federal agents arrest and prosecute marijuana producers and distributors, following memos providing guidance for U.S. Attorneys in states allowing medical marijuana. The focus remains on combating major drug traffickers rather than individual users. The Department of Justice continues to prioritize combating illegal drug manufacturing and trafficking, focusing on major drug traffickers rather than individual users. Federal enforcement of marijuana laws remains a core priority, even in states that have legalized medical marijuana. Deputy Attorney General James Cole clarified that activities purporting to comply with state law are not shielded from federal enforcement action. Deputy Attorney General Cole warned that individuals assisting medical marijuana dispensaries are in violation of the Controlled Substances Act, regardless of state law. This includes building owners and managers allowing dispensaries to operate. He also cautioned that engaging in transactions involving marijuana proceeds may violate federal money laundering statutes, leading to difficulties accessing bank services for dispensaries. The Deputy Attorney General's memorandum in August 2013 outlined enforcement priorities for the Department of Justice regarding marijuana distribution, revenue, diversion, illegal activity, violence, and firearms. This has led to difficulties for medical marijuana dispensaries in accessing bank services. The Deputy Attorney General's memorandum in August 2013 outlined enforcement priorities for the Department of Justice regarding marijuana distribution, revenue, diversion, illegal activity, violence, and firearms. These priorities guide U.S. Attorneys and federal law enforcement to focus on preventing drugged driving, public safety and environmental dangers, and marijuana possession or use on federal property. President Obama emphasized the need to prioritize resources on those who interfere with these priorities, regardless of state law. State laws conflicting with federal law are generally void, but the relationship between state and federal marijuana laws is not viewed in the same way. Congress did not intend for the Controlled Substances Act to override all state laws on controlled substances. The Department of Justice's tracking of marijuana legalization compliance is unclear, but the DEA collaborates with state and local law enforcement on trafficking issues. DEA Administrator Michele Leonhart noted increased marijuana trafficking in states neighboring Colorado since its legalization for recreational use. The DOJ focuses on large drug trafficking organizations in its counterdrug efforts. The HIDTA program collaborates with federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies to counter drug trafficking and criminal networks in critical regions of the United States. It aims to reduce drug production and trafficking through coordination and information sharing. The HIDTA program aims to promote coordination and intelligence sharing among federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies to reduce illegal drug supplies. There are 28 designated HIDTAs in the United States and its territories, administered by the Office of National Drug Control Policy. Executive Boards in each HIDTA region have discretion to design and implement initiatives to combat drug trafficking. In May 2013, 21 individuals were arrested for their alleged roles in drug trafficking rings distributing marijuana, powder, and crack cocaine. The investigation was conducted by the FBI, Madison-Morgan County HIDTA Task Force, and other law enforcement agencies. The OCDETF program targets major drug trafficking and money laundering organizations, involving federal agencies like the DEA, FBI, ATF, U.S. Marshals, IRS, and ICE. The OCDETF program collaborates with various federal agencies and state/local law enforcement to target drug trafficking and money laundering organizations. They focus on organizations listed on the CPOT list. In FY2013, 16% of active investigations were linked to CPOTs and 5% to RPOTs. An operation in Dallas-Fort Worth led to the indictment of 20 individuals for a marijuana trafficking conspiracy. The OCDETF investigation resulted in the arrest of individuals involved in a marijuana trafficking conspiracy, including distribution, sales, and money laundering. Over 600 marijuana plants, 25 pounds of hydroponic marijuana, 10 vehicles, and 5 firearms were seized. The leader of the conspiracy was sentenced to federal prison in April 2014. The DEA funds the DCE/SP program to target marijuana cultivation by drug trafficking organizations, leading to the eradication of millions of cannabis plants in 2013. In 2013, the DEA and Arizona Department of Public Safety eradicated over 4,500 marijuana plants across four grow sites in Arizona. The Border Enforcement Security Task Force (BEST) initiative aims to disrupt criminal organizations along the northern and southwest borders. The BEST initiative targets criminal networks along the U.S.-Mexican border, focusing on underground tunnels used for smuggling marijuana. The first tunnel task force was established in San Diego in 2003, involving ICE, DEA, U.S. Border Patrol, state law enforcement, and Mexican counterparts. Over 150 tunneling attempts have been discovered since 1990, with two sophisticated cross-border tunnels uncovered in April 2014. Federal law enforcement, in collaboration with Mexican authorities, discovered two advanced cross-border tunnels connecting buildings in Otay Mesa, CA, to warehouses in Tijuana, Mexico. The tunnels, measuring 600 and 700 yards in length, were equipped with lighting, ventilation, and electric rail cars. These were among seven underground tunnels found in the San Diego area in less than four years. In drug-related investigations, law enforcement has focused on criminal networks and traffickers rather than individuals for simple drug possession. Data from U.S. Attorneys' case filings show that 21% of drug cases in FY2013 were OCDETF cases, with the rest categorized as drug dealing cases. In FY2013, U.S. Attorneys prioritized drug trafficking cases over drug possession cases, with 99% of non-OCDETF cases involving drug dealing. The U.S. Sentencing Commission data revealed that 32% of cases were drug-related, with 93% of these cases involving drug offenses. The data did not specify trends in investigations and prosecutions for specific drug types like marijuana. In FY2013, U.S. Attorneys prioritized drug trafficking cases, with 93% involving drug offenses. Marijuana was the primary drug in 22% of cases, mostly leading to drug trafficking sentences. The disparity between federal and state drug laws may impact collaborative law enforcement efforts. Law enforcement task forces and fusion centers involve federal, state, and local agencies. Concerns arise if priorities differ, but most task forces focus on apprehending criminal network members. Collaborative efforts are unlikely to be affected by state legalization initiatives. Task forces responding to medical marijuana legalization initiatives may offer insight into their approach to recreational marijuana legalization. Federal law enforcement prioritizes targeting drug trafficking organizations over low-level users, focusing on individuals involved in commercial marijuana activities. Investigations do not typically target individuals using marijuana for medical purposes in accordance with state laws. In January 2013, the owner of two medical marijuana dispensaries in San Diego, CA, was sentenced for distributing marijuana and laundering proceeds. The investigation revealed the dispensaries were grossing about $3.5 million annually. In May 2013, the owner of a Sacramento dispensary was sentenced for growing marijuana and operating the business. If federal law enforcement priorities for recreational marijuana follow those for medical marijuana, there may be a focus on investigating growers and sellers. Officials are focusing on investigating marijuana growers and commercial sellers, with less emphasis on individual users of recreational marijuana. Synthetic cannabinoids, marketed as legal alternatives to marijuana, mimic THC and produce similar psychoactive effects. These substances are often sold as herbal incense under brand names like \"Spice\" and \"K2.\" Legislation has been passed in at least 41 states and Puerto Rico to ban chemical substances in synthetic cannabinoids. Congress also passed the Synthetic Drug Abuse Prevention Act of 2012 to address this issue. The American Association of Poison Control Centers reported a significant increase in calls related to synthetic cannabinoid substances in 2013 and 2014. It is uncertain if synthetic alternatives will continue to be developed to bypass marijuana laws. Policy makers may want to monitor trends in sales, arrests, poison control calls, and emergency department visits in states that have legalized marijuana. The impact of state decriminalization and legalization initiatives remains unclear. The impact of state decriminalization and legalization initiatives on the use of synthetic substances, particularly marijuana, is currently unclear. Mexican drug trafficking organizations control a significant portion of the wholesale distribution of marijuana in the United States, forming relationships with U.S. street gangs, prison gangs, and outlaw motorcycle gangs for retail distribution. Barrio Azteca, a prominent U.S. prison gang with ties to Mexican drug trafficking organizations, is involved in smuggling marijuana, heroin, and cocaine across the Southwest border. They also engage in crimes like extortion, kidnapping, and alien smuggling. These gangs facilitate the movement of illicit drugs to various areas in the United States, providing warehousing, security, and transportation services. The former National Drug Intelligence Center estimated that illicit drug sales in the United States generate billions in proceeds for Colombian and Mexican drug trafficking organizations annually. The impact of marijuana sales on these organizations remains uncertain. Estimates on the impact of marijuana legalization on drug trafficking organizations are speculative. Marijuana proceeds are generated at various points in the supply chain. Experts debate which aspects would be most affected by legalization, especially in states with varying legal frameworks. The Organization of American States suggested that Mexican drug trafficking organizations could lose 20 to 25 percent of their drug export income due to legalization in Washington and Colorado. Drug trafficking organizations could lose 20 to 25 percent of their drug export income and a smaller percentage of their total revenues if the United States were to legalize marijuana production. Large drug trafficking organizations generate a majority of their marijuana-related income from exporting the drug to the United States, which could be jeopardized by legalization. The potential impact of U.S. marijuana legalization on drug revenues and violence in Mexico is uncertain. Some argue it could increase competition and violence, while others believe it could reduce profit motives for drug trafficking. Any changes in cannabis markets will take time to develop. The diversification of drug trafficking organizations' activities in Mexico could mitigate the impacts of marijuana legalization in the United States. Mexican criminal networks control a significant portion of wholesale cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine distribution. They have expanded their operations to include crimes like kidnapping and extortion. Mexican criminal networks have diversified their operations to include crimes like kidnapping and extortion, in addition to drug trafficking. Profits from these activities may supplement their income from drug trafficking. Congress may choose to address state legalization of marijuana in various ways, including affirming federal policy or incentivizing state policies. Alternatively, Congress may opt not to address the policy conflict with state legalization of marijuana. The federal government has maintained marijuana as a Schedule I controlled substance for over 40 years, citing its dangerous nature and lack of medical use. Congress could either maintain this stance or reconsider marijuana's classification. This could involve establishing a commission to study marijuana's impacts and current laws, similar to past efforts. Congress could direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Attorney General to reevaluate marijuana's classification under controlled substances laws. Options include keeping marijuana as a Schedule I substance with caveats, moving it to a different schedule, or removing it from the schedule altogether. Policymakers could also consider amending the Controlled Substances Act to provide more flexibility. Congress could amend the Controlled Substances Act to provide more flexibility, such as making exceptions for individuals following state marijuana laws. If marijuana no longer meets Schedule I criteria, Congress could remove it from the schedule or regulate and tax it instead. This would address the policy conflict with states that have legalized recreational use. Congress may consider transferring jurisdiction over marijuana from the DEA to the ATF for regulation if they choose to legalize and regulate marijuana. They should also examine how state initiatives to decriminalize or legalize marijuana could impact federal law enforcement missions. Policy makers may need to review the priorities of federal law enforcement agencies involved in enforcing drug laws and how state-level policies on marijuana could influence their investigations. Policy makers may question the consistency of priorities across states with different marijuana policies and whether federal law enforcement priorities have shifted in states with altered marijuana laws. They may debate how to incentivize coordinating bodies to combat drug-related crimes and consider the effectiveness of task forces if state marijuana policies conflict with federal laws. Policy makers may need to assess the sustainability of drug task forces in states with conflicting marijuana policies, such as those that have decriminalized or legalized marijuana. It is unclear how the Department of Justice is monitoring enforcement priorities in states with legal marijuana, and the metrics for evaluating these priorities are unknown. The Department of Justice's enforcement priorities in states with legal marijuana are unclear, and it is unknown how increased trafficking might trigger federal action against state marijuana laws. Congress may oversee DOJ's priorities and use funding as a means to influence states' drug policies. Congress could potentially use federal grant funds as leverage to influence states' drug policies, similar to how they enforced compliance with the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act by withholding funding. This could involve establishing financial penalties for states that do not align with federal marijuana policy. Congress could potentially use federal grant funds as leverage to influence states' drug policies by establishing financial penalties for non-compliance. The effectiveness of linking funding to state-level compliance with federal drug policy standards is uncertain, as it is unclear if withholding money from programs like JAG would incentivize states to adhere to federal drug policy requirements. States that legalize and tax marijuana may generate enough revenue to offset any losses from grant program funding that Congress might impose. Additionally, states could potentially save money in criminal justice expenditures by not prosecuting low-level marijuana offenders, which could help compensate for any financial penalties imposed by Congress."
