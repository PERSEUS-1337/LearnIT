    "content": "The \"Drive to Stay Alive Act of 2011\" requires states to establish penalties for using a cell phone while driving with a minor in the vehicle or face withholding of federal-aid highway funds. The Secretary will withhold 5 percent of funds from states that do not have a law prohibiting cell phone use while driving with a minor in the vehicle as a primary offense, with minimum fines for violations. The law mandates minimum fines for first violations and increased fines for repeat violations related to using a personal wireless communications device while driving. It also imposes higher civil and criminal penalties for accidents caused by such behavior. Exceptions may be made for hands-free devices allowing drivers to make calls without holding the device. The law imposes fines and penalties for using a personal wireless communications device while driving, with exceptions for emergency services personnel and certain commercial drivers. Noncompliance with the law regarding the use of personal wireless devices while driving can result in funds being withheld until the end of the fiscal year. If a state complies with the law before the fiscal year ends, the withheld funds will be apportioned back to the state. Failure to comply by the end of the fiscal year will result in the funds being unavailable for apportionment. If a state fails to enact and enforce a law meeting the requirements, funds will lapse. Definitions include 'driving' as operating a vehicle on a public road, 'hands-free device' as allowing phone use without holding it, and 'minor' as an individual. The term 'minor' refers to an individual under 18 years old. 'Personal wireless communications device' is a device for transmitting personal wireless services, excluding GPS receivers. 'Primary offense' is an offense that allows a law enforcement officer to stop a vehicle solely for issuing a citation. 'Text' means reading from or entering data into a personal wireless communications device. Entering data into a personal wireless communications device for SMS texting, emailing, instant messaging, or any electronic data communication is prohibited.
