    "content": "There is no relevant information provided in the prev_chunk to summarize the curr_chunk. Section 501 of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to include a new subsection (n) regarding charitable risk pools. A qualified charitable risk pool is treated as an organization for charitable purposes and is exempt from certain tax regulations. A qualified charitable risk pool is an organization that pools insurable risks of its members. A qualified charitable risk pool is an organization that pools insurable risks of its members, provides information on loss control and risk management, and is comprised solely of tax-exempt organizations. The organization must meet specific organizational requirements to qualify as a risk pool. A qualified charitable risk pool must meet specific organizational requirements, including being organized as a nonprofit under state law, exempt from state income tax, having at least $1,000,000 in startup capital from nonmember charitable organizations, being controlled by a board of directors elected by members, and having organizational documents that require compliance with certain conditions. The qualified charitable risk pool requires that each member be a tax-exempt organization, notify the pool if they no longer qualify, and have insurance policies that do not cover events after a final determination. The qualified charitable risk pool mandates that members must be tax-exempt organizations, notify the pool if they no longer qualify, and have insurance policies that do not cover events after a final determination. Additionally, the organization can still qualify even if a member no longer meets the tax-exempt criteria, as long as the pool takes necessary action to remove them within a reasonable period. Startup capital refers to contributions and program-related investments made before the pool starts operations. The amendment defines a nonmember charitable organization as tax-exempt under subsection (c)(3) and not benefiting from the pool's insurance coverage. Effective starting from taxable years after December 31, 1991."
