    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 905.2 of the Government Code is amended to apply to claims against the state filed with the Department of General Services. Claims for money or damages against the state must be presented in accordance with the specified chapters, including claims for reissuance of warrants. Claims can be made for express contracts or injuries for which the state is liable. Claimants filing a claim against the state must pay a $25 filing fee, except for certain types of claims. The fee is deposited into the Service Revolving Fund for the Department of General Services' support. The fee does not apply to specific individuals. The $25 filing fee for state claims does not apply to individuals receiving certain benefits or whose income is 125 percent or less of the current monthly poverty line. Persons sentenced to imprisonment or confined in a state institution with a balance of $100 or less in their trust account within 90 days prior to filing a claim may request a fee waiver. An affidavit and financial information must be provided. No hearing is allowed for fee waiver denials. The Department of General Services will begin processing the claim when the filing fee is submitted or the fee waiver is granted. Upon approval of the claim by the Department of General Services, the filing fee shall be reimbursed to the claimant, except for claims for expired warrants. The state entity against which the claim was filed will reimburse the fee. If a fee waiver was granted, the state entity will pay the fee to the department. Payment will be made when the claim is paid by the state entity or added to an equity claims bill. The Department of General Services may assess a surcharge of up to 15% on approved claims, excluding refunded filing fees. The surcharge is deposited into the Service Revolving Fund for department support. The surcharge does not apply to reissued expired warrants. The Controller transfers fees from the state entity's appropriation to support the department upon request. The department cannot request an amount needing legislative approval. The filing fee and surcharge apply to claims filed after June 30, 2004. The section does not apply to claims under the California Whistleblower Protection Act. Comprehensive services include shelter, hotline, and temporary housing. The Human Trafficking Victims Assistance Fund provides temporary housing, psychological support, referrals to community services, and emergency transportation. The Director of the Office of Emergency Services oversees the Fund, and a qualified nonprofit organization must meet specific criteria to provide assistance. The Human Trafficking Victims Assistance Fund offers services to victims, including housing and counseling. Victims are defined as those trafficked in or fleeing to the state. Participating counties must contribute at least 10% to adult local criminal justice facilities, with exceptions for smaller populations. The BSCC determines funding and scoring criteria for counties eligible for financing programs. Counties must show documentation of pretrial inmate percentages and risk assessment programs. Preference is given to counties prepared to proceed with financing in a timely manner. Counties must provide a resolution authorizing matching funds for financing approved by the BSCC, compatible with state lease-revenue bond financing. Counties seeking funding for housing capacity must provide documentation of CEQA compliance, including a final Notice of Determination or Notice of Exemption and a letter from county counsel certifying statute of limitations expiration and resolution of any challenges. Funding priority will be given to counties replacing outdated housing with treatment space or renovating/building facilities for treatment and rehabilitation services. (d) A participating county may replace existing housing capacity with minimal increase if a deficiency is documented. The county must certify not leasing capacity for 10 years beyond completion. Locked facilities funded by the state must include onsite visitation meeting or exceeding state regulations. The County of Napa is awarded $20 million for its adult local criminal justice facility without the need for further proposals. This amount can be used in conjunction with a partial award previously granted. The maximum state contribution for the facility in Napa is represented by these awards. Additionally, Section 37001.5 of the Health and Safety Code is amended.
