    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Humanitarian Exports Leading to Peace Act of 2001\". The Congress acknowledges the suffering of the Iraqi people under a repressive regime and economic sanctions. The sanctions have caused hardship and failed to weaken the leadership of Iraq. The Oil-for-Food program has also been ineffective in meeting the needs of the Iraqi people. Iraq is seen as a potential market for $1 billion in agricultural products from the United States. The economic sanctions on Iraq have had devastating effects, leading to malnutrition and disease, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of children under the age of 5 since 1991. The economic sanctions on Iraq have led to malnutrition and disease, causing the deaths of hundreds of thousands of children under 5 since 1991. UNICEF reported that the embargo hinders food security, and despite the Oil-for-Food Program, infant mortality rates have significantly increased over the years. The United Nations Security Council report in 1999 highlighted the severe humanitarian crisis in Iraq, attributing it to prolonged sanctions and the effects of war. UNICEF and the World Food Program found that 1 in 4 young Iraqi children are malnourished, with over 750,000 children suffering from malnutrition. The Iraq Sanctions Act of 1990 limits trade restrictions on Iraq to allow for the export of food, medicines, and certain other products. The Secretary of Commerce administers these provisions. The Secretary of Commerce administers the Export Administration Act of 1979 to carry out section 3, allowing exports without a license but requiring notification. Regulations will be issued as necessary. Additionally, a conforming amendment excludes Iraq from certain trade restrictions under the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000. Sense of Congress is to end suffering in Iraq by allowing humanitarian aid without prosecution, including lifting sanctions and recommending a ban on weapons transfers. The President must report to Congress within 6 months of this Act on sales of food, agricultural products, medicines, and medical supplies to Iraq, their impact on food security, types of goods exported, and any diversion of medical supplies by the Iraqi government or third parties. The President must report to Congress within 6 months on sales of food, agricultural products, medicines, and medical supplies to Iraq, their impact on food security, types of goods exported, and any diversion of medical supplies by the Iraqi government or third parties. Steps taken by the United States through the United Nations to lift nonmilitary sanctions on Iraq or impose a regional arms control regime are also to be reported."
