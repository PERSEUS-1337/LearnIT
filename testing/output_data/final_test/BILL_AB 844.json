Additionally, any corporate agent must comply with Section 1505 before being designated for service of process. Section 17708.02 of the Corporations Code is amended to allow foreign limited liability companies to apply for a certificate of registration to do business in California by submitting an application to the Secretary of State.

The foreign limited liability company must provide the street address of its principal office and business office in California, along with the name and address of its initial agent for service of process in the state. Consent for service of process in California extends to search warrants for records possessed by a foreign limited liability company, whether inside or outside the state. Proper service includes delivery by hand, mail, overnight delivery, facsimile, email, or submission via designated web portal. The Secretary of State can act as the agent for service of process for a foreign limited liability company if the appointed agent resigns, cannot be found, or replaced. The foreign LLC must provide a mailing address if different from the principal office address. Additionally, a certificate of existence or good standing signed by the Secretary of State or relevant official must be submitted with the application. The Secretary of State provides instructional materials for foreign LLC registration, including a notice about annual tax obligations. Section 1524.2 of the Penal Code is amended to define terms related to electronic communication services. An \"adverse result\" from a search warrant includes danger to individuals, flight from prosecution, evidence tampering, witness intimidation, or jeopardizing an investigation. An \"applicant\" is the peace officer receiving the warrant, a \"California corporation\" is subject to specific laws, and a \"foreign corporation\" is qualified to do business in the state. Properly served search warrant means delivery by hand or through mail, delivery service, facsimile, or other specified means to a person or entity listed in the Corporations Code. When a search warrant is issued to a foreign corporation providing electronic communication services, they must provide requested records within five business days, even if the records are located outside California. The warrant may require production of records within less than five business days if failure to do so would cause an adverse result. The court can extend the time for production if the foreign corporation shows good cause. The foreign corporation must seek relief from the issuing court within the required time for production of records and the court must decide on the motion within five court days. The foreign corporation must verify records with an affidavit complying with Section 1561 of the Evidence Code. These records are admissible under Section 1562. A California corporation providing electronic services must comply with out-of-state warrants for customer data as if issued by a California court. No legal action can be taken against foreign or California corporations, their officers, employees, or agents for providing records or assistance in response to a warrant issued under this chapter."
