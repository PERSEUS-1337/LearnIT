    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Cancer-Free Label Act of 2012\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings section. Congress finds that approximately 1.5 million Americans are diagnosed with cancer annually, with over 500,000 deaths each year. Less than 5 percent of cancers are due to genetic factors, and cancer is the leading cause of disease-related death for American children. Children are more susceptible to environmental carcinogens, and reducing exposure can lower cancer risk. Consumers lack easy ways to identify products without carcinogens, and additional information on product health impacts is beneficial when making purchasing decisions for families. The 2008-2009 Annual Report of the President's Cancer Panel urges action to prevent environmental and occupational exposure to carcinogens by allowing manufacturers to affix a Cancer-Free label to products that do not contain known or probable carcinogens through a voluntary process. The President's Cancer Panel recommends allowing manufacturers to use a Cancer-Free label on products free of known or probable carcinogens. The President's Cancer Panel recommends that Federal departments establish a program for labeling products free of carcinogens as \"Cancer-Free\". The label must be easily recognizable and include a notice stating the product does not contain known or likely carcinogens. It is unlawful to introduce a product with this label into interstate commerce without premarket approval. The President's Cancer Panel recommends establishing a program for labeling products free of carcinogens as \"Cancer-Free\". Any person can submit an application for this label, including a list of product substances. Approval is required from the relevant Federal department or agency. The relevant Federal department or agency will approve the application for the \"Cancer-Free\" label if the product accurately lists all substances, does not contain carcinogens, substances displaying carcinogenicity upon degradation or interactions, and complies with guidance on manufacture, storage, and transportation. The information provided for the \"Cancer-Free\" label application must be kept confidential, treated as trade secrets, and used only for approval purposes. It cannot be disclosed without the applicant's consent. The head of each agency must conduct random testing and audits to ensure accurate listing of substances in products and compliance with agency guidance. The head of each Federal department or agency may charge a reasonable fee for application submission and approval under subsection (e). Violators of subsection (c)(1) may face a civil penalty of up to $100,000. Guidance is provided to prevent the indirect introduction of carcinogens. The head of each Federal department or agency may charge a reasonable fee for application submission and approval. Violators of regulations may face a civil penalty of up to $100,000. Guidance is provided to prevent the introduction of carcinogens into covered products. A national list of approved \"Cancer-Free\" products is to be posted on department websites. Definitions include carcinogens listed in the National Toxicology Program Report. The term \"covered product\" refers to products regulated by certain agencies and intended for individual or residential use. It includes substances identified as carcinogenic by the Environmental Protection Agency."
