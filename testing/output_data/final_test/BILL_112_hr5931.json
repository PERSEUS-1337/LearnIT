    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Mitigation Fisheries Coordination Act\" and includes findings. Congress finds that the operation of dams and water diversion projects benefits the American public by providing energy, flood control, water storage, and recreational opportunities. The construction and operation of these projects have impacted water systems and fish populations, necessitating the building and operation of fish hatcheries to mitigate these effects. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service has established policy to mitigate for fish, wildlife, and habitats from the effects of land and water developments. The Service operates fish hatcheries involved in mitigation fishery activities related to Federal water resources projects, funded by various mechanisms. The Service uses its appropriations to fund mitigation fishery costs for water development projects. Water development agencies should bear the financial responsibility for these costs and negotiate reimbursement funding or goods and services with the Service. The Service funds mitigation fishery costs for water development projects, and water development agencies are responsible for ongoing maintenance and operating costs. SEC. 3. MITIGATION FISHERY ACTIVITIES. The Service funds mitigation fishery costs for water development projects, and water development agencies are responsible for ongoing maintenance and operating costs. The Director of the Service imposes charges for mitigation fishery activities, to be paid by water development agencies according to approved fishery mitigation plans. These plans outline goals, targets, and charges for conducting the activities. The fishery mitigation plan must involve cooperation with affected States and Indian tribes. Plans are to be renegotiated every 3 years to adjust for changing costs. Charges for mitigation activities must be reasonably related to the associated costs. Payment of charges is required on the first day of each fiscal year. A water development agency must make annual payments to the Service as part of a fishery mitigation plan. The funds will be credited to the Service's appropriation, available for expenditure specified in appropriations Acts, and remain available until expended. If no mitigation plan is in place, the Service may conduct projects. If no fishery mitigation plan is in place, the Service can conduct mitigation fishery activities and receive funding from a water development agency. The agency may also include the costs of fishery mitigation activities in ongoing costs for maintaining and operating a Federal water resources development project. Mitigation fishery activities involve rearing and stocking fish to replace or maintain fishery resources. Mitigation fishery costs refer to expenses for operating and maintaining facilities, conducting activities, and evaluating fish health. Mitigation fishery facilities involve activities like population assessment, genetic monitoring, and broodstock development. Mitigation fishery facilities, owned and operated by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, conduct activities for fish population assessment and genetic monitoring. Water development agencies include the Army Corps of Engineers, Bureau of Reclamation, and Tennessee Valley Authority. Specific facilities listed for mitigation fishery activities include Greers Ferry and Norfork National Fish Hatcheries in Arkansas, and others in California. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service operates various fish hatcheries and health centers across different states, including California, Colorado, Georgia, Kentucky, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, and North Dakota. These facilities play a crucial role in fish population assessment and genetic monitoring. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service operates fish hatcheries and health centers in various states, including Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming."
