    "content": "The TEACH Grant program provides grants to students pursuing teaching careers. Recipients must teach for four years in a high-need field at a qualifying school. Failure to fulfill this obligation results in the grant converting to a loan. Over 300,000 grants totaling nearly $938 million have been disbursed since 2008. The program has faced challenges in recent years. The TEACH Grant program faces challenges with loan conversions when recipients fail to submit paperwork on time, leading to a high expected failure rate. The Department of Education is working to address administrative issues, but concerns remain about the program's efficacy and design. Congressional attention may focus on these issues. The TEACH Grant program faces challenges with loan conversions due to paperwork delays, leading to a high failure rate. Lawmakers may need to address issues related to program implementation, teacher preparation program quality, and the definition of a \"highly qualified teacher.\" Other proposed changes since the program's authorization should also be considered. The TEACH Grant program, authorized in 2007, aims to address the shortage of qualified teachers in public schools. Concerns about the demand for high-quality teachers in low-income schools led to its creation. Bills introduced in 2005 highlighted the need for 2 million new teachers over the next decade. The TEACH Grant program, established in 2007, aims to attract high-achieving individuals into teaching to meet the demand in low-income schools. It addresses concerns about teacher shortages driven by retirements and minimum standards set by the No Child Left Behind Act. The program provides financial incentives to help subsidize college costs for individuals entering the teaching profession. The TEACH Grant program aims to attract high-achieving individuals into teaching by providing financial incentives to offset college costs. It distinguishes between upfront grants for students starting studies and assistance for teachers already in the field. The program focuses on incentivizing individuals to teach in schools and subjects that struggle to attract staff, particularly in low-income areas. The TEACH Grant program aims to attract high-achieving individuals into teaching by providing financial incentives to offset college costs, particularly in low-income schools. Opponents argue that the program is poorly targeted and places a financial burden on taxpayers, lacking focus on increasing access to higher education for students in need. Changes have been made to the program under the Higher Education Opportunity Act, including the development of a plain-language disclosure form for recipients. The Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA) included provisions for TEACH Grants, such as service requirements, consequences for non-compliance, and waivers for extenuating circumstances. Recipients in fields no longer designated as \"high need\" could still fulfill their service requirement by teaching in that field. The HEOA mandated ED to report on TEACH Grant recipients, schools, and students served every two years. The Paul Douglas Teacher Scholarships program, authorized in 1986, provided financial assistance to college students preparing to be teachers. Eligible students could receive $5,000 per year for up to $20,000 in exchange for teaching one to two years for every year of scholarship receipt. The Paul Douglas Teacher Scholarships program, authorized in 1986, provided financial assistance to college students preparing to be teachers. It granted states the responsibility of selecting scholarship recipients, verifying their service requirements, and submitting performance reports to ED. The program was repealed in 1998 due to being duplicative of other teacher training programs and costly to administer. Another similar program is the National Science Foundation's Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program.

The program was repealed in 1998 due to being duplicative of other teacher training programs and costly to administer. Another similar program is the National Science Foundation's Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program. P.L. 107-368 makes awards to institutions of higher education to provide scholarships of $10,000 per year to undergraduate STEM majors, starting in their junior year, and graduate STEM students. Recipients are expected to obtain teaching certification in a STEM subject and serve as a teacher in a high-need LEA for at least two years for each year of scholarship receipt. If recipients do not complete their required service, they must pay back all or a portion of their scholarships in the form of a loan. Boren Scholarships and Fellowships offer financial aid for students studying less commonly taught languages in critical international regions in exchange for federal government work post-graduation. The NIH Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Awards provide support for biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research training in exchange for one year of related work after program completion. The program structure includes TEACH Grant recipient eligibility, award amounts, service requirements, and conditions for grant conversion to loans. TEACH Grants convert to loans, institutional eligibility to disburse TEACH Grants, and program administration. To be eligible for a TEACH Grant, a student must meet basic eligibility criteria for federal student aid programs, including enrollment in an eligible program at an institution, citizenship requirements, and maintaining satisfactory academic progress. To be eligible for a TEACH Grant, a student must meet specific criteria including maintaining satisfactory academic progress, not being in default on a Title IV student loan, and not having a federal or state drug conviction while receiving aid. As an undergraduate, post-baccalaureate, or graduate student at an IHE participating in the TEACH Grant program, you must be in a TEACH Grant-eligible program of study within the IHE. Academic achievement requirements include scoring above the 75th percentile on admissions tests or having a GPA of at least 3.25 on a 4.0 scale. The TEACH Grant program is the only HEA Title IV program with an academic merit requirement. The TEACH Grant program is the only HEA Title IV program with an academic merit requirement. Students must be current or prospective teachers with expertise in a field with a teacher shortage or using an alternative certification route. Full-time students can receive up to $16,000 for a bachelor's degree and post-baccalaureate program combined, and up to $8,000 for a Master's degree. The TEACH Grant program offers up to $4,000 per year for a Master's degree, with a maximum of $8,000 for graduate studies. Students enrolled less than full-time can receive a prorated award based on their attendance intensity. The grant amount, when combined with other financial aid, cannot exceed the cost of attendance. Recipients must undergo counseling and meet service obligations. Recipients of the TEACH Grant must sign an agreement to serve as full-time teachers for at least four years within an eight-year period after completing their program of study. They must meet the requirements of a \"highly qualified teacher\" and teach at a school serving low-income students. Recipients of the TEACH Grant must teach at a school serving low-income students and meet the requirements of a \"highly qualified teacher.\" They can also teach at an educational service agency with a high poverty rate. Schools operated by the Bureau of Indian Education or on Indian reservations also qualify. Qualifying schools are listed in the Teacher Cancellation Low-Income Directory. Once a recipient finds a vacancy in a high-need field at a qualifying school, they must apply for and accept a qualifying position to fulfill their service obligation. A TEACH Grant recipient can fulfill their service obligation by teaching in a school serving low-income students in high-need fields such as bilingual education, mathematics, science, and special education. The fields identified as high-need are listed in the annual Teacher Shortage Area Nationwide Listing approved by the Department of Education. Recipients may need to declare a major and take coursework in a high-need field based on their program of study. Recipients of the TEACH Grant must declare a major in a high-need field and provide certification to the loan servicer within 120 days of completing their program. They can still fulfill their service obligation by teaching in a field that was designated as high-need when they received the grant, even if it is no longer on the list. Recipients of the TEACH Grant must verify their employment as a full-time teacher or their intention to be employed in a qualifying position. They need to provide annual certification to the loan servicer, demonstrating completion of a full year of teaching service or their commitment to fulfilling the service obligation. The loan servicer notifies recipients of the certification requirements and deadlines. The certification date for TEACH Grants was standardized to October 31, 2018. Grants convert to a loan if recipients do not teach in a qualifying school, fail to provide documentation, or complete the required service within eight years. The TEACH Grants have an eight-year period for recipients to complete their teaching service obligation. If recipients stop their eligible program before completion, the grant converts to a loan unless they qualify for a suspension. The eight-year period starts after program completion, but recipients can request a suspension for various reasons, like enrolling in another TEACH Grant-eligible program or a state-required certification program. TEACH Grants have an eight-year period for recipients to fulfill their teaching service obligation. Recipients can request a suspension for specific reasons, such as enrolling in a state-required certification program or being called to active military duty for over 30 days. Service obligations can be canceled in case of death or total disability. Recipients may also be discharged from part or all of their obligation if called to military duty for more than three years. Multiple TEACH Grants for different programs of study are possible. TEACH Grants recipients must complete four years of teaching service for each program of study. Creditable teaching service, approved suspensions, and service discharge due to military duty may apply to multiple service obligations. Institutions must meet general Title IV eligibility requirements and program-specific criteria to disburse TEACH Grants. The HEA mandates high-quality teacher preparation, financial responsibility, pedagogical coursework, and clinical experience for IHEs. To be eligible for a TEACH Grant, an institution must meet financial responsibility standards, offer a high-quality teacher preparation program accredited by an ED-recognized agency or approved by a state, provide at least 10 weeks of pre-service clinical experience, and offer pedagogical coursework and support services to teachers. The institution must offer services to teachers, such as providing information on effective teaching skills and strategies, supervision practices, and mentoring. It should also provide a program of study acceptable for a bachelor's teacher preparation degree or a degree in a high-need field at another TEACH Grant-eligible institution. Additionally, it should offer a bachelor's degree that prepares students to teach in a high-need field and have an agreement with another institution offering teacher preparation programs. A post-baccalaureate program is not TEACH Grant-eligible if offered by an IHE with a bachelor's degree in education. TEACH Grant-eligible programs prepare individuals to teach in high-need fields and lead to a bachelor's or Master's degree. Students can receive subsequent TEACH Grants to complete their program even if it is no longer TEACH Grant-eligible. The TEACH Grant program administration responsibilities are divided among IHEs, the ED-contracted loan servicer, and ED. IHEs determine program eligibility, award and disburse grants, while the loan servicer manages day-to-day tasks like tracking service obligations and loan repayment. ED sets policy, provides guidance, and monitors compliance. IHEs decide whether to participate in the program and select eligible programs of study. The IHE determines which programs are eligible for TEACH Grants and oversees grant administration through the financial aid office. Responsibilities include evaluating student eligibility, providing counseling, disseminating information, and disbursing grants. Teacher preparation program staff support in evaluating eligibility, raising awareness, and assisting students in finding qualifying job placements. The TEACH Grant program allows IHEs to administer grants with flexibility, such as targeting upperclassmen or students in teacher preparation programs. Unlike other Title IV grant programs, the TEACH Grant program is mainly administered by an ED-contracted loan servicer post-disbursement due to its unique service payback structure. The loan servicer tracks recipients to ensure they fulfill their service obligations. The ED-contracted loan servicer tracks recipients to ensure they fulfill their service obligations by processing annual certification paperwork, reminding grant recipients of deadlines, sending quarterly notices on potential loan conversion, tracking loan repayment, providing billing services, and responding to customer inquiries. The ED-contracted loan servicer manages the day-to-day administration of TEACH Grants, while ED sets program policy, provides guidance, oversight, and monitors compliance. This includes ensuring the loan servicer communicates with recipients, tracks progress, and converts grants to loans if requirements are not met. ED also monitors compliance through reports and program reviews. The Department of Education (ED) oversees the administration of TEACH Grants, including addressing recipient complaints and settling disputes. The TEACH Grant program is treated as a federal credit program, with costs estimated annually according to the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990. The budgetary cost of TEACH Grants is measured based on their long-term cost to the government, excluding administrative costs. It represents the present value of cash flows from the government minus cash flows to the government, accounting for loan terms and conditions. A positive loan subsidy cost indicates that TEACH Grants are estimated to collectively result in... The cost for a cohort of TEACH Grants can result in a cost to the government, while a negative loan subsidy cost can lead to budgetary savings. Subsidy costs for TEACH Grants made since the program's inception are large and positive, funded through permanent budget authority. Administrative costs are funded separately through annual appropriations. The TEACH Grant program is not exempt from sequestration, which involves automatic spending reductions to reduce the federal budget deficit. The TEACH Grant program is subject to sequestration, resulting in annual reductions in award amounts. Since its inception, over 300,000 grants totaling nearly $938 million have been disbursed. The program experienced a surge in awards in recent years, with sequestration scheduled to continue through FY2029. In recent years, analyses of the TEACH Grant program have revealed low benefit take-up rates and high grant-to-loan conversion rates. The Government Accountability Office estimated that only 19% of eligible individuals received grants in 2013-2014. An American Institutes for Research study found that 63% of recipients had their grants converted to loans by July 2016. The Department of Education estimates that 66% of students will fail to complete their service obligation, leading to grant conversion to loans. Issues have arisen regarding the TEACH Grant program, focusing on program design and implementation. Legislative proposals have been introduced to address these issues, including concerns about program structure, identifying committed teachers, benefit size, finding qualifying positions, program quality, and teacher qualifications. One key question is the effectiveness of the TEACH Grant program. The TEACH Grant program faces challenges in identifying committed teachers, as some recipients opt to convert their grants to loans due to a lack of intention to teach. Grant availability from freshman year may attract individuals not fully committed to teaching in high-need schools. Some institutions restrict TEACH Grants to upperclassmen and graduate students to increase commitment to teaching. Data suggests that limiting grant availability to juniors and seniors reduces grant-to-loan conversion rates. The TEACH Grants are typically given to upperclassmen and graduate students due to the challenges faced by underclassmen in maintaining the required GPA. Data shows no significant difference in grant-to-loan conversion rates based on undergraduate class or graduate school year, except for juniors and first-year graduate students. Loan conversion rates are also similar regardless of acceptance into a teacher preparation program before or after receiving the grant. The Noyce Scholarship tends to attract candidates already committed to teaching. The Noyce Scholarship attracts candidates committed to teaching, especially in high-need schools. Teaching service payback programs like TEACH Grants may influence individuals to teach in high-need schools rather than enter the teaching profession in general. 44% of recipients found the grant influential in their decision to teach. The TEACH Grants are influential in recipients' decisions to teach, especially in high-need schools. A legislative proposal suggests limiting eligibility to upperclassmen and graduate students to ensure commitment to teaching. However, this may limit recruitment of individuals considering teaching as a career. Some evidence suggests that TEACH Grants are marketed more as a means to fund education rather than to enter teaching. The TEACH Grant program provides up to $4,000 per year to students for education funding, but some recipients may not intend to fulfill the required teaching service. An AIR study found that 42% of grant recipients would have exceeded their federal loan limit if the grants were loans. This suggests that some students may be using the grant solely for education funding without the intention of teaching. The TEACH Grant program provides up to $4,000 per year for eligible students at different academic levels. The low take-up rate of TEACH Grants may indicate that some students are unable to meet academic requirements or are hesitant about the grant converting to a loan. It could also suggest that the financial benefit may not be enough to incentivize students to pursue teaching. Teacher scholarship programs like the Noyce Scholarship provide significant financial incentives to recruit and retain teachers in high-need schools. The Noyce Scholarship offers $10,000 per year for undergraduate or graduate studies, with 90% of recipients teaching in high-need districts. In contrast, the TEACH Grant program, which offers $4,000 per year, has a low take-up rate due to insufficient financial benefits. A legislative proposal aims to triple the TEACH Grant award to $12,000 but would also increase the length of service required. The legislative proposal aims to increase the TEACH Grant award amount from $4,000 to $12,000, doubling the service requirement to eight years within 10 years of program completion. This change may attract more participants, but failure to complete the service obligation could result in larger loan repayments. The impact on government costs is uncertain, as more participants may increase costs, but if grant-to-loan conversion rates remain the same, many grants may convert to larger loan amounts. The TEACH Grant recipient must teach at a school serving low-income students in a high-need field. Despite many schools meeting this criteria, finding qualifying employment can be challenging, as vacancies in high-need fields may be limited. For example, elementary school teachers may not qualify if they teach all subjects instead of focusing on math or science. The AIR study found that 39% of TEACH Grant recipients whose grants were converted to loans did not fulfill their service requirement because they were teaching in positions that did not qualify for TEACH Grant service. Reasons included not finding a job in a high-need field and school, not wanting to teach in a high-need field and school, not being offered a qualifying job, or finding a higher-paying teaching position at a non-qualifying school. Other reasons included school losing its Title I designation, previously qualifying positions being eliminated, confusion about qualification, and teaching students from low-income families. The GAO study found that finding and keeping an eligible teaching position can be challenging for TEACH Grant recipients due to limited hiring by school districts and the time it takes to find a qualifying position. Promotions to non-teaching administrative positions in eligible schools do not fulfill TEACH Grant service requirements. Legislative proposals aim to expand high-need fields to attract more individuals, including early childhood education, technology, engineering, career and technical education, and writing specialist. This change could provide more options for securing a qualifying position. The HEA defines an early childhood education program as a Head Start or Early Head Start program; a state licensed or regulated child care program; or a program that addresses the cognitive, social, emotional, and physical development of children from birth through age six, and is a state prekindergarten program, a preschool or infant/toddler program authorized under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), or a program operated by an LEA. Not all recipients receive support from their institutions to find and secure qualifying teaching placements. The AIR study found that 70% of IHEs do not provide assistance in this regard. The AIR study found that 70% of IHEs provide some placement services for identifying TEACH Grant-qualifying positions, but these practices are not correlated with lower grant-to-loan conversion rates. There is a lack of a central job search tool for TEACH Grant-qualifying vacancies. Expanding the types of schools eligible for teaching placements could improve retention rates and grant-to-loan conversion rates. The Paul Douglas Teacher Scholarships Program, precursor to TEACH Grants, did not require high-need schools for recipients. A study showed 63% completed teacher certification, with 67% teaching by 1992-1993. 6% repaid scholarships as loans. North Carolina Teaching Fellows Program, like TEACH Grants, mandates teaching in NC public schools. The TEACH Grants program aims to produce teachers who stay in public schools for at least five years, but recipients tend to teach more advantaged students. Expanding the types of schools for service could go against supporting low-income schools. To qualify for TEACH Grants, institutions must offer accredited teacher preparation programs with clinical experience and pedagogical coursework. The Higher Education Act (HEA) requires teacher preparation programs to provide pedagogical coursework, supervision, and support services to teachers. States and institutions must publish report cards on program quality, develop criteria to assess quality, and identify low-performing programs. In 2014, 12 states identified 45 programs as low-performing or at risk, with 28 based in institutions disbursing TEACH Grants. Twenty-two states have never identified low-performing programs. In 2016, regulations linking the definition of \"high-quality teacher preparation program\" to program ratings were overturned under P.L. 115-14. The regulations required states to identify effective programs and report on specific indicators, including student learning outcomes. IHEs with low-performing programs risked losing eligibility. One argument for limiting TEACH Grant eligibility to effective programs was to increase likelihood of service obligation fulfillment. However, concerns were raised about fewer IHEs being eligible, impacting low-income students entering teaching. A legislative proposal suggests qualifying programs should not be low-performing or at risk. The legislative proposal suggests that qualifying programs for the TEACH Grant should not be identified as low-performing or at risk. This change could set a minimum standard tied to existing statute without affecting many programs. However, it may limit the number of institutions eligible for the grant, potentially impacting low-income students entering the teaching profession. The ESSA repealed the HQT definition under ESEA, removing teacher quality standards for states receiving grant funds. TEACH Grant recipients may need to meet both state and federal requirements, with uncertainty on HQT application for service in private schools. The TEACH Grant program requires recipients to fulfill service obligations in qualifying private schools. A negotiated rulemaking resulted in a new HQT definition with additional requirements for private school teachers. Implementation challenges include certification issues and the lack of a formal appeals process. Recipients must provide initial certification of their teaching employment within 120 days of program completion. The TEACH Grant program requires recipients to provide annual certification of completed or intended qualifying teaching service, including teaching in a low-income school, high-need field, and meeting HQT requirements. Issues with submitting annual certification paperwork have been reported by 64% of recipients. The AIR study found that 41% of TEACH Grant recipients whose grants were converted to loans did not fulfill service requirements due to challenges with annual certification. Many recipients did not certify due to lack of awareness or difficulties with the process. The GAO study revealed that students may not fully understand the paperwork requirements despite counseling. Additionally, the ED-contracted loan servicer mistakenly converted 2,252 grants to loans, with 19% being due to recipients not understanding grant terms and certification requirements. The lack of understanding and misinformation about certification requirements for TEACH Grants can lead to recipients having their grants converted to loans. Recipients may fail to certify on time for various reasons, such as submitting the certification late or forgetting to submit it. This issue has been highlighted in recent news coverage, where qualified teachers had their grants converted to loans due to certification failures. The certification process for TEACH Grants can lead to grants being converted to loans if not completed on time. Recently, the Education Department established a standardized annual certification date of October 31 to address issues with certification. Some legislative proposals aim to simplify the certification process for TEACH Grants by requiring recipients to certify their qualified teaching experience within specific timeframes. Recipients would be considered compliant unless they request their grants to be converted to loans. Other bills suggest collaboration between the Education Department and states to streamline certification. One bill proposes setting October 31 as the annual certification date for TEACH Grants. Errors in grant-to-loan conversions can lead to financial disruptions and job changes for recipients. GAO found that 2,252 recipients had their grants mistakenly converted to loans from 2013 to 2014. The Department of Education (ED) and the ED-contracted loan servicer discovered 2,252 recipients had their grants converted to loans in error. Changes have been implemented to prevent these errors, including system checks and manual reviews of accounts flagged for conversion. The loan servicer now has the authority to reconvert loans to grants in certain circumstances without needing to involve ED. Starting in January 2019, the Department of Education (ED) established a reconsideration process for recipients whose grants were mistakenly converted to loans due to missing certification paperwork. Recipients eligible for reconsideration were notified via email, and those not contacted could request reconsideration through the ED-contracted loan servicer. The servicer determines if a request is accepted and can convert loans back to grants, but it is unclear if further actions, such as credit repair, are taken. The Department of Education established a reconsideration process for recipients whose grants were mistakenly converted to loans. As of May 2019, about 38% of applicants were approved for reconversion. Proposed changes include crediting teaching service, suspending service obligation period, and providing credit repair support for recipients affected by grant-to-loan conversion. Several bills aim to formalize these actions. Several bills propose to codify a formal appeals process for TEACH Grants wrongfully converted to loans, allowing grants to be reinstated if an error occurred. One bill suggests extending the service obligation period for recipients whose grants were wrongly converted. Additional proposals aim to retain and amend the TEACH Grant program, including allowing partial payback based on completed service length for recipients who do not fulfill their full service obligation. The Noyce Scholarship and Paul Douglas Teacher Scholarship programs implement a practice of allowing partial payback based on completed service length for recipients who do not fulfill their full service obligation. This may encourage more students to participate in the program and enter teaching, while reducing the financial burden on those who have completed part of their service. However, there is concern that this concession could detract from the goal of retaining teachers in low-income classrooms and high-need fields. In the 115th Congress, an amendment was proposed to allow teachers whose roles change to continue fulfilling their required service with new duties. Under current regulations, teachers must teach a majority of classes in a high-need field to meet service requirements for TEACH Grants. There are proposals to allow recipients in leadership roles to support other teachers instead of teaching, which may improve retention rates. However, allowing non-teaching positions to qualify for the grant could detract from the goal of recruiting and retaining high-quality individuals in the teaching profession. There have been suggestions to replace TEACH Grants and other financial assistance programs for teachers. One proposal suggests replacing TEACH Grants and other teacher financial assistance programs with a new program offering larger loan repayment amounts based on years in a qualifying position. The current approaches have not effectively incentivized high-quality candidates to enter and stay in teaching. However, implementing such a program would increase costs for the federal government. Several bills propose eliminating the TEACH Grant program due to concerns that most recipients will not fulfill service requirements, leading to increased debt for students."
