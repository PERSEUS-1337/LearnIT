    "content": "The \"Handgun Control Act of 1993\" acknowledges the significant increase in the number of handguns in private hands since 1978, highlighting their role in violent crimes like homicide and armed robbery. It also notes that restrictions on new handgun sales may not effectively reduce handgun-related crimes. The \"Handgun Control Act of 1993\" emphasizes that handguns in private homes are not necessary for sporting or recreational purposes, can be adequately replaced for self-defense, contribute to violent crimes that interfere with commerce and threaten national security, and that restricting handgun availability will reduce violent crime and deaths in the United States. Title 18, United States Code, amended to include new chapter after chapter 50, focusing on handgun control. CHAPTER 50A.--HANDGUNS CHAPTER 50A.--HANDGUNS\n\nSec. 1091. Unlawful acts. It is unlawful for any person to import, manufacture, sell, buy, transfer, receive, or transport any handgun, except as provided in certain exemptions. The Secretary may exempt certain individuals or entities from this prohibition for reasons of public safety and necessity. Under this chapter, pistol clubs must apply for a license with the Secretary, with a fee of $25 per year. Importers, manufacturers, or dealers must also apply for a license. Applications must meet certain criteria, including all members being 21 years or older and not prohibited from handling firearms or ammunition. Pistol clubs applying for a license must meet specific criteria, including members not violating firearm laws, disclosing all required information truthfully, and maintaining possession and control of handguns used by members on club premises. Pistol clubs must have secure facilities for handguns when not in use, and the Secretary must approve or deny license applications within 45 days. Licenses can be revoked for violations of firearm laws. The Secretary may revoke a license if there is a violation of firearm laws, and the aggrieved party can request a hearing for review. Upon request, the Secretary can stay the revocation of a license. A hearing will be held at a convenient location for the aggrieved party. If the Secretary decides not to reverse the denial or revocation after a hearing, the aggrieved party can file a petition for judicial review within sixty days. The court may consider evidence submitted by the parties, and if it finds the Secretary's decision unauthorized, the denial or revocation will be overturned. The court can order the Secretary to comply with its judgment if not authorized to deny an application or revoke a license. Licensed pistol clubs must maintain records of handgun transactions as prescribed by the Secretary and allow inspections by submitting reports as required. The Secretary can inspect club premises for compliance with record-keeping regulations. The Secretary may provide information to States or political subdivisions regarding pistol club members and their handguns. Licenses issued under subsection (c) must be posted for inspection. Penalties apply for violations or false statements in this chapter. Any false statement or representation related to information required by this chapter for pistol club records or license applications may result in a fine of up to $5,000, imprisonment for up to five years, or both. Handguns involved in violations of this chapter or other laws may be seized and forfeited. Exceptions may apply. Sec. 1094 of this chapter outlines exceptions where the provisions do not apply to certain handguns intended for specific uses. Sec. 1095 discusses voluntary delivery to law enforcement agencies with potential reimbursement. Sec. 1095 allows individuals to voluntarily deliver handguns to designated law enforcement agencies for transfer, destruction, or disposal. Owners may receive payment equal to the fair market value of the handgun or $25, upon proof of lawful acquisition and ownership. Sec. 1096 authorizes the Secretary to establish rules and regulations for the implementation of the chapter, including licensing requirements and the issuance of certified copies of licenses at a reasonable cost. Fees collected under section 1092(a) will fund authorized amounts, with any remaining costs covered by general revenues. The Secretary can establish rules for licensing and provide certified copies at a reasonable cost. Public notice and hearings are required before rules are set. The chapter does not override state laws unless there is a direct conflict. If any part of the chapter is invalid, the rest remains intact. Sec. 1099 states that if any part of the chapter is held invalid, the rest remains unaffected. Sec. 1100 defines terms like 'person' and 'importer' for the purposes of the chapter. The terms 'manufacturer', 'licensed manufacturer', 'dealer', 'licensed dealer', and 'collector' are defined in chapter 44 of this title for the regulation of handguns. The term 'handgun' refers to a weapon designed to be fired with one hand, having a barrel less than ten inches in length, and using explosive energy to expel projectiles. The term 'pistol club' refers to a club organized for target shooting with handguns or for recreational purposes, maintaining possession and control of the handguns used by its members. A licensed pistol club is one that is licensed under this chapter. The enforcement and administration of this amendment shall be vested in the Secretary of the Treasury. The provisions of this Act do not affect the National Firearms Act, the Mutual Security Act relating to munitions control, or the nonmailable firearms section of the United States Code. The Act will take effect one year after enactment."
