    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Get the Lead Out of Schools Act\" and includes provisions for school testing, notification, and a grant program. The Safe Drinking Water Act is amended to include testing and notification requirements for lead contamination in school drinking water. Public water systems serving schools must sample drinking water for lead regularly and notify the school if lead levels exceed the action level set by the Administrator. The Administrator must notify the local educational agency, health agencies, municipality, and State within five business days of receiving lead test results from the public water system. A grant program will be established to fund testing and remediation of lead contamination in school drinking water. Eligible entities can use grant funds to cover incurred costs. The grant program will fund testing and replacing lead pipes in schools with lead-free alternatives if lead levels in drinking water exceed set limits. The grant program limits administrative costs to 5% of funds and requires compliance with EPA guidance or state regulations for lead contamination remediation. The eligible entity must comply with state regulations for reducing lead in school drinking water, make test results public, and notify relevant organizations. The term 'eligible entity' in this subsection refers to a local educational agency or a State agency running a program to address lead contamination in drinking water. Section 1465 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300j-25) is repealed."
