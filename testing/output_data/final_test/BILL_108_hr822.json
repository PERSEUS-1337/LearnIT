    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Wild Sky Wilderness Act of 2003\" and includes findings and a statement of policy. Congress finds that Americans value diverse wilderness ecosystems and wildlife on Federal lands, feeling a moral responsibility to protect this heritage for future generations. The benefits of wilderness areas are maximized when they are varied in topography, ecosystems, and recreational opportunities. Large blocks of wildlands with diverse ecosystems are essential for preserving these values. Certain wildlands in the Skykomish River valley of Washington represent the original forested landscape with diverse ecosystems, including high alpine meadows, rugged peaks, and old-growth forests with large trees. These areas harbor a variety of wildlife and fish species from the 19th century. The Skykomish River valley in Washington is home to diverse ecosystems and wildlife, including mountain goats, bald eagles, black bear, and endangered species like northern spotted owls and wild salmon. This wilderness area is accessible year-round for hikers, hunters, anglers, and educational groups who appreciate clean water, clean air, and pristine scenery. Congress declares it a policy to protect and serve the diverse wilderness in the United States. The policy of the United States is to grant wilderness protection to lower elevation wildlands in the Skykomish River valley of Washington and protect additional lands adjacent to the Henry M. Jackson Wilderness. This is in tribute to the ecologically enlightened vision of a former Senator from Washington.
