    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Fair Telephone Billing Act of 2013\". Congress finds that unauthorized third-party charges on wireline telephone bills, known as \"cramming\", have been a problem since the 1990s. Multiple enforcement actions have been taken against individuals and companies for engaging in cramming, affecting millions of users. The problem of unauthorized third-party charges on wireline telephone bills has affected millions of users, costing them billions of dollars over the past decade. Many companies engaged in illegitimate third-party billing to exploit weaknesses in the system. Millions of consumers have transitioned from wireline telephone services. Millions of residential consumers have switched from wireline telephone service to interconnected VoIP service, using it as their primary telephone line. More users are expected to migrate to VoIP as traditional voice networks evolve to IP-based networks. Users with VoIP telephone numbers should be protected from vulnerabilities that affected third-party billing through wireline numbers. SEC. 3. UNAUTHORIZED THIRD-PARTY CHARGES. Section 258 of the Communications Act of 1934 is amended to prevent illegal changes in subscriber carrier selections and unauthorized third-party charges. It prohibits local exchange carriers and providers of interconnected VoIP services from placing unauthorized third-party charges on a customer's bill unless certain conditions are met. The amended Section 258 of the Communications Act of 1934 prohibits local exchange carriers and interconnected VoIP service providers from placing unauthorized third-party charges on a customer's bill without clear disclosure, affirmative consent, and reasonable procedures to ensure customer-requested products or services. Violators may face civil penalties. Any violation of paragraph (1) may result in a civil forfeiture double the usual penalty amount under section 503 of the Act. Additionally, the carrier or VoIP provider must refund the customer for all charges related to the violation. These remedies are in addition to any other legal remedies available. In addition to any other legal remedies, subsection (4) provides definitions for terms like affirmative consent, contracted third-party vendor, and third-party charge. The Federal Communications Commission, in consultation with the Federal Trade Commission, must establish rules within 90 days of this Act's enactment to implement regulations for local exchange carriers and providers of interconnected VoIP service to obtain consumer consent for third-party charges. These rules must ensure consumers are fully informed about the charges they are agreeing to. The Federal Communications Commission will establish rules for local exchange carriers and VoIP providers to obtain consumer consent for third-party charges, including recordkeeping requirements. The rules will become effective within 180 days of the enactment of this Act or when the carrier's contractual obligation expires. SEC. 4. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER LAWS: This Act does not preempt State laws, but State laws cannot override requirements of this Act. It also does not affect the Federal Trade Commission Act or any other laws enforced by the FTC. SEC. 5. SEVERABILITY: If any part of this Act is deemed invalid, the rest of the Act remains unaffected."
