    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Middle School Technical Education Program Act\" or the \"Middle School STEP Act\". Congress finds that career and technical education prepares students to be college and career ready by providing core academic, technical, and employability skills. 80% of students taking a college preparatory academic curriculum with rigorous career and technical education courses met college and career readiness goals, compared to 63% of students taking the same academic core without such courses. Students concentrating in career and technical education improved their 12th-grade National Assessment of Educational Progress scores significantly in reading and mathematics, while those who did not take such courses showed minimal improvement in reading and no increase in mathematics scores. Partnerships between businesses and educators help adults develop academic, technical, and employability skills through education and on-the-job training, with a high school graduation rate of 90% for students in career and technical education programs in 2008, compared to the national average of 75%. The purpose and definitions of partnerships between businesses and educators are outlined in Section 3. The Act aims to support middle school career exploration programs linked to career and technical education programs of study.
