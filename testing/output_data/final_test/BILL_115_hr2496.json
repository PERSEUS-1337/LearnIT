    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Defunding the Corrupt and Incompetent United Nations Act\". Congress finds that the United States pays significantly more than other nations for United Nations operations, despite treaties often conflicting with U.S. interests. There is a lack of accountability and incompetence within the UN, leading to atrocities occurring under its watch. Additionally, a disproportionate amount of time and resources are spent targeting Israel. The United States will no longer provide funds to the United Nations unless significant changes are made due to unfair budget burden and lack of accountability. The US pays more than other nations for UN operations, with a disproportionate focus on targeting Israel. The United States contributes a significant portion of the world GDP and pays a higher regular assessment to the United Nations budget compared to 176 other member states combined. Many member states pay less than $1,000,000 annually, while some even receive travel subsidies from the UN. In 2016, the United Nations assessed approximately $559,000,000 from member states for its regular and peacekeeping budgets. The Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) countries, including top oil producers, paid around $406,000,000. The other permanent members of the UN Security Council paid a combined $2,734,000,000, with the US contributing $2,959,000,000. The United Nations regular budget requires approval from two-thirds of member states, allowing minimal contributors to override objections from major contributors like the United States. Additionally, the US is assessed 28.4691 percent of the UN peacekeeping budget for 2017, exceeding the 25 percent limit set by a previous law. The United States contributes over 25 percent of the UN peacekeeping budget, exceeding the limit set by law. This amounts to $275 million, more than the combined contributions of the 185 least assessed UN member states. Additionally, the US separately contributes over $5 billion annually to other UN programs, with no comprehensive report to Congress since 2010. Congress is concerned about treaties like the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) that could impose international environmental mandates on the US. The United States opposes international environmental and financial mandates that could harm US businesses. Efforts to regulate global warming and arms trade are not in US interests. Congress criticizes the UN for lack of accountability in investigating war crimes. The United Nations failed to investigate war crimes and protect civilians, resulting in thousands being killed in \"safe zones\". They also delayed recognizing the new government in Cambodia after millions were killed by the Khmer Rouge. In Rwanda, UN troops abandoned Tutsis to be killed by Hutus, leading to a genocide that claimed a million lives. The United Nations faced various failures in peacekeeping missions, including withdrawing troops from Somalia after casualties, failing to prevent mass killings in Bosnia, not intervening in Sudan despite attacks, revealing mismanagement in audits, causing a cholera outbreak in Haiti, and ranking low in agency performance. The United Nations agencies rank low in effectiveness compared to other aid agencies, with issues in transparency, specialization, selectivity, aid channels, and overhead costs. The Security Council's attempt to impose sanctions in Syria was blocked by Russia and China, leading to civilian deaths and displacement. UN peacekeeping missions often avoid using force for protection. United Nations peacekeeping missions frequently refrain from using force to protect civilians, intervening in only 20% of cases despite authorization from the Security Council. Peacekeepers have been reported to abuse the populations they are meant to assist, with instances of failure to prevent murder and rape in South Sudan in 2016. The United Nations is criticized for its disproportionate focus on harassing Israel, as seen in the passing of Resolution 2324 condemning Israeli settlements. This action was viewed as detrimental to peace efforts in the region, with concerns raised about the UN's one-sided approach. The United Nations has been criticized for its disproportionate focus on condemning Israel, with the UNHRC often singling out Israel for condemnation more than any other country. This includes Agenda Item 7, which criticizes Israel's human rights situation in Palestine and other occupied territories. The UNRWA defines Palestinian refugee status as hereditary, failed to stop Hamas from stockpiling missiles in schools, and did not report this violation to the UN Security Council. The Durban Declaration singled out only Israel for condemnation for racist policies. Twenty Arab countries vote against US interests at the UN but receive foreign assistance from the US. For example, Egypt is set to receive $1.5 billion in 2017. In 2017, Egypt is set to receive $1.5 billion in assistance, Jordan $1 billion, and Iraq $500 million from the United States. The Palestinian Authority also receives over $350 million annually in humanitarian aid from the US. Despite being the only democracy in the Middle East, Israel faces UN anti-Israel activity. Israel has traded land for peace with nongovernmental organizations, but Hamas remains dedicated to its destruction. After Israel withdrew from Gaza, Hamas took control and launched regular attacks on Israel. Prohibition on assessed and voluntary contributions to the United Nations. Prohibition on funding United Nations contributions until specific criteria are met, including approval by a majority of member states with assessed contributions totaling 67% of the regular budget. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget must submit a report to Congress on US contributions to the United Nations. The Secretary of State must also submit a report analyzing US interests supported by international organizations and recommending which organizations merit US support. The Office of Inspector General of the Department of... The Office of Inspector General of the Department of State establishes an office to inspect and audit US contributions to international organizations. The Secretary of State evaluates UN peacekeeping missions to determine their necessity and alignment with US interests. The United Nations is required to revise its pay structure. The United Nations implements reforms to align salaries with US civil service levels, conducts regular reviews of mandates, reinstates the Procurement Task Force, enhances independence of oversight offices, and ensures peacekeepers prioritize civilian protection. The United Nations implements reforms to align salaries with US civil service levels, conducts regular reviews of mandates, reinstates the Procurement Task Force, enhances independence of oversight offices, and ensures peacekeepers prioritize civilian protection by proactively punishing those who fail to follow their duties or commit crimes. SEC. 4. Further limitation on assessed and peacekeeping contributions to the United Nations: Funds for assessed contributions to the UN regular budget cannot exceed 18% of the total, and funds for assessed contributions to the UN peacekeeping budget cannot exceed 25% of the total."
