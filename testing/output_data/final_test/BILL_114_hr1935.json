    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Restoring the 10th Amendment Act\". The 10th Amendment to the Constitution limits the powers of the Federal Government to those delegated by the Constitution and protects the freedom of the States. It reflects the Founding Fathers' opposition to a Federal Government with expansive powers and their intention for the States to act as a check on the Federal Government. The 10th Amendment limits Federal Government powers to those delegated by the Constitution, reflecting the Founding Fathers' concerns about federal overreach. Madison emphasized the few and defined powers of the federal government, with numerous and indefinite powers remaining with the States. The Supreme Court affirmed in various cases that powers not granted to the United States are reserved for the States or the people. The 10th Amendment prohibits Congress from infringing on states' rights and their ability to function effectively in a federal system. Executive departments sometimes create regulations that go against the 10th Amendment, which safeguards the rights of the people and states from federal government interference. Congress must uphold and protect the 10th Amendment as it remains crucial today as it was when ratified. Certain state officials have special standing to challenge federal rulemaking as a violation of the 10th Amendment. In this section, definitions are provided for terms such as \"agency,\" \"designated State official,\" \"legislative leader,\" and \"rule.\" The section also mentions the submission of a legal brief during the public comment period for a proposed rule under chapter 5 of title 5. The proposed rule is open for public comment, and any designated State official may submit a legal brief challenging its constitutionality under the 10th Amendment. The head of the agency proposing the rule must post a link to each submitted brief on the agency's website. Within 15 days of posting the link, the agency head must certify in writing that the rule does not violate the 10th Amendment. The agency must certify in writing that the rule does not violate the 10th Amendment and post the certification on their website. Within 15 days of a State official submitting a brief challenging the rule, the agency must notify all designated State officials. Designated State officials can take civil action against an agency if they believe a rule violates the 10th Amendment. They can file the action in the district court where their place of business is located. An expedited appeal process is available for such cases. \"In cases where designated State officials challenge a rule violating the 10th Amendment in district court, the appropriate court of appeals must expedite the review process.\""
