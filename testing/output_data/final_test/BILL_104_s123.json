    "content": "The Act titled \"Environmental Risk Evaluation Act of 1995\" is cited as such. It includes findings and policy provisions. Definitions in this section include the Administrator as the head of the EPA, adverse effects on human health encompassing various illnesses, risks as the likelihood of harm to health or the environment, and sources of pollution as activities that change the natural environment. Congress acknowledges that cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment are valuable tools for developing environmental regulations and programs, setting priorities, and evaluating the success of environmental protection programs. However, it is important to consider factors beyond cost and risk, such as values and equity. Further development is needed for valuing ecological resources and assessing intergenerational effects of pollution sources. Methods to assess risks of adverse human health effects, other than cancer, need further development for integrated rankings of pollution sources based on health risks. Periodic reports by the Administrator on costs and benefits of regulations will provide insight into national environmental priorities and expenditures for achieving reductions. The Administrator will provide periodic reports on the costs and benefits of environmental regulations to enhance understanding of cost-benefit analysis and risk assessment, assisting in evaluating regulations and programs impacting human health, the environment, and public welfare. The Administrator will rank sources of pollution based on the relative risk of adverse effects on human health, the environment, and public welfare, considering the extent and duration of the risk. The Administrator will rank sources of pollution based on the relative risk of adverse effects on human health, the environment, and public welfare. Additionally, the Administrator will evaluate the private and public costs associated with each source of pollution, compliance costs with regulations, and the costs and benefits of other Federal actions impacting human health, the environment, or public welfare. The Administrator will assess risks, costs, and benefits related to environmental regulations and Federal actions impacting human health, the environment, or public welfare. Opportunities for significant risk reduction through modifications in regulations and programs will be identified, along with uncertainties in evaluating risks. The Administrator will identify uncertainties associated with risks, explain their meaning, determine research needed to reduce uncertainties, and estimate the benefits of reducing risk to human health and the environment, including avoiding premature mortality. The Administrator will identify uncertainties associated with risks, explain their meaning, determine research needed to reduce uncertainties, and estimate the benefits of reducing risk to human health and the environment, including avoiding premature mortality, cancer, noncancer diseases, preserving biological diversity, maintaining an aesthetically pleasing environment, valuing ecosystem services, avoiding other risks, and considering benefits even if their monetary value cannot be estimated. The Administrator will provide reports to Congress on pollution sources, Federal actions, and methodologies for rankings and evaluations under the Act. The reports will also assess the need for developing ranking methodologies. The Administrator shall report findings of rankings and evaluations to Congress every 3 years, evaluating risk management decisions under Federal environmental laws. The Administrator shall report findings of rankings and evaluations to Congress every 3 years, evaluating risk management decisions under Federal environmental laws, including choices between controlling microbial versus disinfection contaminants in drinking water. Periodic reports will address the policy on weighing and analyzing risks based on severity, certainty, timing of adverse effects, and associated burdens. In implementing this section, the Administrator will consult with officials from various levels of government, academia, industry, and citizen groups to assess whether adverse effects are disproportionately affecting certain populations and if alternative technologies can mitigate these effects. The Administrator will consult with industry, citizen groups, and experts to develop and interpret scientific and economic information, make it public, and establish methods for evaluating costs and benefits of environmental regulations. The Science Advisory Board will review reports before submission to Congress."
