Congress finds that perchlorate, a chemical used in rockets and fireworks, has been widely produced and disposed of in the United States since the 1940s. It is a persistent contaminant in water sources, primarily originating from blasting agents, military munitions, and fireworks. Perchlorate contamination has been detected in water and soil at almost 400 sites in the United States, with limited EPA data showing it in 35 states and the District of Columbia. It is primarily produced for use by the Department of Defense and NASA. Perchlorate contamination has been found in water and soil at nearly 400 sites in the United States, with concentrations ranging from 4 to over 420 parts per billion. The California Department of Health Services discovered perchlorate in 276 drinking water sources and 77 systems in California. Perchlorate has also been detected in various foods and human breast milk. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found widespread perchlorate exposure in the US population. The National Academy of Sciences recommended a perchlorate reference dose of 0.0007 milligrams per kilogram per day. The EPA set a drinking water equivalent level of 24.5 parts per billion for perchlorate in 2005. In 2003, the EPA issued interim assessment guidance for perchlorate in groundwater, recommending cleanup levels ranging from 4 to 18 parts per billion. In 2006, the EPA increased the provisional cleanup levels to 24.5 parts per billion. The Children's Health Protection Advisory Committee advised the EPA on the preliminary remediation goal for perchlorate in March 2006. The Agency's preliminary remediation goal for perchlorate is not protective of children's health, leading to higher infant exposure levels. Perchlorate inhibits iodine uptake by the thyroid gland, posing risks to vulnerable populations like pregnant women and children. CDC found changes in thyroid hormone levels in humans exposed to perchlorate, especially affecting hormone production in women with low iodine levels. About 36 percent of women in the United States have lower iodine levels, leading to concerns about the impact of perchlorate on hormone production by the thyroid. California and Massachusetts have set drinking water standards for perchlorate at 6 and 2 parts per billion respectively, while other states have issued guidance ranging from 1 to 18 parts per billion. Perchlorate has also been found in soil and surface water. Perchlorate has been detected in soil, surface waters, and groundwater at 55 Department of Defense facilities across the country, with off-site migration occurring at some facilities. The Department of Defense policy on perchlorate requires sampling only where a release is suspected and a human exposure pathway is likely. The Department of Defense is deferring remedial action on perchlorate contamination until a Federal drinking water standard is adopted. The Environmental Protection Agency has historically failed to enforce its authority under environmental response laws. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) is being used to address perchlorate contamination at Department of Defense facilities listed on the Superfund National Priorities List. The Environmental Protection Agency has set site-specific cleanup levels for groundwater remediation of 22 contaminants without Federal drinking water standards. Enforcement action has not been taken against the Department of Defense for perchlorate contamination at the Aberdeen Proving Ground. Contamination from Aberdeen Proving Ground has affected Aberdeen, Maryland's drinking water supply. Since 2002, the Department of Defense has sought exemptions from public health and environmental laws to protect against chemical constituents in military munitions, including perchlorate. SEC. 3. NATIONAL PRIMARY DRINKING WATER REGULATION FOR PERCHLORATE. The Safe Drinking Water Act is amended to include a national primary drinking water regulation for perchlorate, with specific deadlines for promulgation and publication of proposed regulations. The Safe Drinking Water Act is amended to include a national primary drinking water regulation for perchlorate, with specific deadlines for promulgation and publication of proposed regulations within 18 months."
