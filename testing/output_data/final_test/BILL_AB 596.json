The association's annual budget report must include a summary of insurance policies covering property, liability, earthquake, flood, and fidelity. Details such as insurer name, policy type, limit, and deductible amount should be provided. The information can be included by distributing copies of the insurance policy declaration page with the report. The summary must include a statement in boldface type. The association's insurance policies summary, as required by Section 5300 of the Civil Code, is provided for review by members upon request.
