The Congress acknowledges the need for an effective stimulus plan that focuses on job creation, fiscal responsibility, fairness, targeting unmet needs, tax reform, and revenue sharing. The current tax structure hinders growth and job creation, leading to economic distortions. Taxpayers spend five billion hours and $200 billion on compliance. The tax code's inefficiency in revenue raising contributes to inadequate public education, healthcare, infrastructure, and a high national debt. Implementing a transaction fee could help maintain defense-related expenditures. The Department of the Treasury will prepare a comprehensive analytical report to achieve economic prosperity through restructuring the tax code with a transaction fee, allowing for financial security, educational opportunities, and affordable healthcare for all. The Department of the Treasury will prepare a comprehensive analytical report to achieve economic prosperity through restructuring the tax code with a transaction fee, allowing for financial security, educational opportunities, and affordable healthcare for all. The Department of the Treasury will conduct a study on the implementation of a transaction fee. The Secretary of the Treasury will conduct a study on implementing a transaction fee in the United States. The fee would apply to non-cash transactions and high-dollar cash transactions, excluding certain transactions like cash transactions under $500 and individual savings. The proposed transaction fee in the United States would apply to cash withdrawals from financial institutions at a rate double or higher than the standard transaction fee. The fee rate is set to generate revenues equal to those under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and could potentially be used for a national debt reduction plan. The proposal includes a plan to reduce a $7.7 trillion debt over 10 years with equal annual payments, a Federal revenue sharing program for education costs, and meeting provisions of the National Security Intelligence Reform Act of 2004. The proposal aims to reduce a $7.7 trillion debt over 10 years with equal annual payments, establish a Federal revenue sharing program for education costs, and meet provisions of the National Security Intelligence Reform Act of 2004. Additionally, it includes creating dedicated funding for port security, increasing first responder grant programs, providing health insurance for the uninsured, and raising military basic pay rates to match Federal civilian pay levels. The curr_chunk discusses criteria for civilian pay, a Federal revenue sharing program for community and economic development, increasing pay for National Guard and Reserve soldiers during extended deployments abroad, and a plan for Social Security and Medicare solvency. The solvency plan aims to ensure that revenues exceed outlays, with a base transaction fee capped at 1 percent for noncash transactions under $500. Additional revenues may be generated through higher fees for transactions over $500 and a progressive fee schedule. Liabilities for the fee arise when control is exercised over transactions. The transaction fee is imposed when control is exercised over property or services, collected by the seller or financial institution. A study report detailing the fee rate calculation methodology and factors considered will be submitted to Congress by the Secretary of the Treasury. The study will calculate fees for various programs, including revenue generation, revenue neutrality, national debt reduction, and inflation adjustments. The study will analyze the impact of transaction fees on economic behavior, including job creation, economic growth, consumption, investments, and savings levels. It will also examine all types of transactions, their frequency, and value, as well as the impact of exempting cash transactions under $500. The study will analyze the impact of transaction fees on economic behavior, including job creation, economic growth, consumption, investments, and savings levels. It will also examine program operations, distortions among economic sectors, and the feasibility of temporarily reducing the fee rate for cash transactions under $500. The study will assess the transaction fee as a tool of Federal fiscal policy, including its impact on existing tax expenditures, incentives, penalties, and credits. It will also explore options for rebating citizens not subject to Federal income taxes and analyze the fee's impact on different income levels. The study will assess the impact of the transaction fee on quartile income levels and include a detailed implementation plan for the fee in the United States, including agency reform and congressional action needed. It will also examine the Internal Revenue Service's role in administering the fee and the feasibility of modifying its mission and jurisdiction. The study will assess the impact of a transaction fee on income levels and propose an implementation plan for the fee in the United States. It will also evaluate the Internal Revenue Service's role in administering the fee and consider modifying its mission and jurisdiction to focus on uncovering waste, fraud, and abuse in the Federal Government. The report is due to Congress within one year of the enactment of this Act."
