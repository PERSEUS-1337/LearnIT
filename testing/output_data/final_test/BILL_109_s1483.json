    "content": "The curr_chunk is a section defining the Indian student count. The Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act of 1998 is amended to define the Indian student count as the total number of Indian students enrolled in tribally-controlled postsecondary vocational institutions. The count is determined based on enrollments at the end of each academic year. The Indian student count for a tribally-controlled postsecondary vocational and technical institution is calculated by dividing the sum of credit-hours of all Indian students enrolled by the total number of Indian students. This count is determined at the end of each academic year, with specific weeks identified for fall and spring terms. The Indian student count at a tribally-controlled postsecondary vocational and technical institution includes credits earned during a summer term and by students without secondary school degrees. Credits earned by Indian students without a high school diploma count towards the total. The Indian student count at a tribally-controlled postsecondary vocational and technical institution includes credits earned by students without a high school diploma if the institution has admission criteria based on the student's ability to benefit from education. Admission procedures that include such criteria are presumed to be established by the institution. The institution's procedures involve counseling or testing to assess a student's aptitude for completing a course. Credits earned by Indian students for a secondary school degree cannot be counted towards the Indian student count. Continuing education programs are also included. Indian students in continuing education programs at tribally-controlled postsecondary institutions can earn credits that count towards their total credit hours, as long as the credits are converted to a credit-hour basis according to the institution's system. The bill was passed by the Senate on July 26, 2005. Attest: EMILY J. REYNOLDS, Secretary."
