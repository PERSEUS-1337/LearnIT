The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to allow for alternate academic achievement standards for students with significant cognitive disabilities. The State's accountability system must align alternate academic achievement standards for students with significant cognitive disabilities with challenging academic content standards, provide access to the general curriculum, and ensure vertical alignment for student achievement. The student's progress towards postsecondary education or competitive employment is indicated by being on the on-target or advanced level. This progress is supported by evidence-based learning progressions in the individualized education program.

It includes 2 levels of high achievement (on-target and advanced) indicating that the student meets or exceeds the State's proficient level of academic achievement. The academic achievement standard for students with significant cognitive disabilities includes three levels: on-target, advanced, and catch-up, measuring progress towards meeting the State's proficient level of academic achievement.

The State must certify that academic assessments are accessible to all students, including those with disabilities, and ensure that alternate assessments are peer-reviewed and evidence-based.
