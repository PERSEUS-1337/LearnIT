    "content": "The \"Working Families Flexibility Act of 1996\" may be cited as the short title. It includes provisions for compensatory time. The \"Working Families Flexibility Act of 1996\" allows employees to receive compensatory time off in lieu of monetary overtime compensation, at a rate of one and a half hours for each hour of overtime worked. Employers can provide compensatory time only under certain conditions, such as through collective bargaining agreements. The \"Working Families Flexibility Act of 1996\" allows employees to receive compensatory time off instead of overtime pay under specific conditions, including agreements made before work, employee affirmation in writing, and not exceeding the limit on accrued compensatory time. The \"Working Families Flexibility Act of 1996\" allows employees to receive compensatory time off instead of overtime pay under specific conditions, including agreements made before work, employee affirmation in writing, and not exceeding the limit on accrued compensatory time. For employees of a public agency hired before April 15, 1986, compensatory time off practices in effect on that date apply, except for hours worked after April 14, 1986, which must follow the provisions of the Act. Non-public agency employers can provide compensatory time off to employees only if it was not a condition of employment. The \"Working Families Flexibility Act of 1996\" allows employees to receive compensatory time off instead of overtime pay under specific conditions. Non-public agency employers can provide compensatory time off to employees, but cannot intimidate or coerce employees regarding the use of compensatory time. Employees who are not public agency employees can accrue up to 240 hours of compensatory time and must be compensated for any unused time by January 31 of each year. An employer can designate a 12-month period other than the calendar year for compensatory time off. They can provide monetary compensation for unused compensatory time over 80 hours with 30 days notice. Employers offering compensatory time can end the policy with 30 days notice, and employees can withdraw from agreements at any time. Employees can also request monetary compensation in writing. Employees can request monetary compensation for unused compensatory time at any time. If the work involves public safety, emergency response, or seasonal activities, they can accrue up to 480 hours of compensatory time. For other types of work, the limit is 240 hours. Employees can request compensation for unused compensatory time at termination, paid at the average or final regular rate received, whichever is higher. Employees of public agencies who have accrued compensatory time off are entitled to be paid for unused time upon termination at a rate not less than the average or final regular rate received in the last 3 years of employment. This payment is considered unpaid overtime compensation. Employees with accrued compensatory time off can request to use it within a reasonable period without disrupting the employer's operations. SEC. 3. REMEDIES. Amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act include liability for employers violating section 7(o)(3) regarding compensatory time. An employer not a public agency shall compensate affected employees for accrued compensatory time and pay liquidated damages for its misuse. SEC. 4. NOTICE TO EMPLOYEES. The Secretary of Labor must update materials provided to employers within 30 days of this Act's enactment to reflect amendments to the Fair Labor Standards Act. Passed by the House of Representatives on July 30, 1996."
