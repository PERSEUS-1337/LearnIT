    "content": "In Roe v. Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution protects a woman's right to choose whether or not to have an abortion. The companion case, Doe v. Bolton, further stated that states cannot overly restrict access to abortion. These decisions sparked debate and led to various government actions at different levels. This report provides an overview of abortion law development from 1973 to the present, including Supreme Court decisions and resulting legal challenges. The report analyzes key Supreme Court decisions on abortion over the past 34 years, including landmark cases like Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton. It also discusses the Court's shift in direction in cases like Webster v. Reproductive Health Services and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, as well as the most recent decision in Carhart v. Gonzales. The historical background of abortion laws in mid-19th century America is also examined, showing a shift towards anti-abortion legislation by the time of the Civil War. In 1967, forty-nine states and the District of Columbia classified abortion as a felony, with varying exceptions for therapeutic abortions. Quickening was no longer used to determine criminal liability, but some states retained it for setting punishment. Nontherapeutic abortions were essentially unlawful, with 42 states permitting abortions only to save the mother's life. Three states had more lenient standards for abortions. This marked the peak of restrictive abortion laws in the United States. In 1967, the peak of restrictive abortion laws in the United States was reached, with forty-nine states and the District of Columbia classifying abortion as a felony. However, this year also saw the first victory of an abortion reform movement with the passage of liberalizing legislation in Colorado. The movement, which began in the early 1950s, focused on a proposed criminal abortion statute that would allow abortions in cases of grave danger to the woman's health, fetal abnormality, or pregnancy resulting from rape or incest. By the end of 1970, four states had repealed criminal penalties for abortions. In 1971, the U.S. Supreme Court denied a vagueness challenge to the District of Columbia abortion statute, expanding the availability of abortions. Between 1968 and 1972, the constitutionality of restrictive abortion statutes in many states was challenged. In 1973, the Supreme Court issued rulings in Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton, finding that... In Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton, the Court ruled that Texas and Georgia statutes regulating abortion were unconstitutional as they interfered with a woman's right to decide on terminating her pregnancy. The Texas statute only allowed abortions to save the mother's life, while the Georgia statute permitted abortions in cases of serious threats to the woman's life or health, severe birth defects, or rape, but with strict requirements. The Court's decisions were delivered by Justice Blackmun, with Justices White and Rehnquist dissenting. The Court determined that states cannot outright ban abortions by criminalizing the procedure. The Supreme Court ruled in Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton that states cannot ban abortions by criminalizing the procedure, citing the Fourteenth Amendment's right to personal privacy. The Court emphasized that this right includes fundamental personal rights and extends to activities related to marriage and procreation. The Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton established that the right to personal privacy includes the decision to terminate a pregnancy. State interference is only justified by a \"compelling state interest,\" which was found lacking in the case of absolute bans on abortions. The Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton established that state interference in abortion is only justified by a \"compelling state interest.\" The High Court determined that the state's interests in maternal health and potential life of the fetus are compelling at different stages of pregnancy. Abortion can only be curtailed or prohibited during specified stages, with the state's interest in protecting maternal health becoming sufficient after the first trimester and the interest in the potential life of the fetus becoming compelling at viability. The Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton established that state interference in abortion is only justified by a \"compelling state interest.\" Abortion can be regulated and even prohibited at different stages of pregnancy, with the state's interest in maternal health becoming sufficient after the first trimester and the interest in the potential life of the fetus becoming compelling at viability. In Doe v. Bolton, the Court extended Roe v. Wade by stating that states cannot make abortions unreasonably difficult to obtain through procedural barriers. The Court struck down requirements for abortions to be performed in licensed hospitals, approved by a hospital committee, and approved by two physicians. Religious or moral beliefs of denominational hospitals and employees may be protected under certain statutes. The Court in Roe v. Wade addressed the question of fetal personhood under the Fourteenth Amendment, concluding that the word \"person\" does not include the unborn. The Court did not determine when life begins but introduced the concept of \"viability.\" The Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade introduced the concept of \"viability,\" defined as the point at which the fetus can potentially live outside the womb with artificial aid. Post-Roe litigation addressed many unanswered questions, including public funding cases for nontherapeutic and therapeutic abortions. The 1977 Trilogy ruled on Medicaid funding for nontherapeutic abortions for indigent women. The Supreme Court rulings in Beal v. Doe and Maher v. Roe clarified that states are not obligated to fund nontherapeutic abortions under Title XIX of the Social Security Act (Medicaid) or the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution. States have the freedom to choose whether or not to cover nontherapeutic abortions under their Medicaid programs. The Supreme Court rulings clarified that states are not required to fund nontherapeutic abortions under Title XIX of the Social Security Act or the Equal Protection Clause. Connecticut's policy of favoring childbirth over abortion was found not to violate the right of privacy recognized in Roe. The Court also upheld a municipal regulation denying indigent pregnant women nontherapeutic abortions at public hospitals. Staffing hospitals with personnel opposed to abortions was deemed not to violate the Equal Protection Clause. The question of private hospitals' authority to prohibit abortion services was not addressed. The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the Hyde Amendment's abortion funding restrictions were constitutional, upholding the right of states to fund only medically necessary abortions under Medicaid. The Court also found that a State of Illinois statutory funding restriction similar to the Hyde Amendment did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. In Planned Parenthood v. Danforth, the Supreme Court ruled that informed consent statutes for abortions are constitutional if related to maternal health and not overbearing. The requirements must be narrowly drawn to avoid interfering with the physician-patient relationship. In City of Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., similar issues were addressed. The Court in City of Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc. struck down the informed written consent section of the ordinance, which required the attending doctor to provide specific information to the woman seeking an abortion. This requirement was deemed constitutionally unacceptable as it gave the government unreviewable authority over the information given to the woman before she decided. The Supreme Court invalidated the 24-hour waiting period in City of Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., stating that it did not serve any legitimate state interest. In Danforth, the Court found spousal consent statutes unconstitutional if they allowed the husband to unilaterally prohibit abortion in the first trimester. In Gerstein, the Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional a spousal consent law regardless of pregnancy stage. Danforth held parental consent statutes unconstitutional if they allowed a parent to prohibit abortion on a minor. Bellotti v. Baird required states to provide alternative procedures if parental consent is denied for a minor seeking abortion. City of Akron invalidated a provision in an ordinance prohibiting doctors from performing abortions. The Akron ordinance prohibited doctors from performing abortions on unemancipated minors without parental consent or a court order. The Supreme Court ruled that the ordinance did not provide for case-by-case evaluations of maturity, leading to its invalidation. In Planned Parenthood Association of Kansas City, Missouri Inc. v. Ashcroft, the Supreme Court upheld Missouri's parental consent requirement for pregnant minors, which allowed for case-by-case evaluations of maturity. This requirement differed from the Akron ordinance, as it provided an alternative procedure for minors to demonstrate maturity or the best interests of having an abortion. The Supreme Court upheld Missouri's parental consent requirement for pregnant minors, allowing for case-by-case evaluations of maturity. The Court emphasized the importance of informing parents before a minor daughter undergoes an abortion, without giving them veto power over the decision. The Court rejected the argument that abortion was being treated differently from other surgical procedures. The Supreme Court upheld Missouri's parental consent requirement for pregnant minors, allowing for case-by-case evaluations of maturity. In a tie vote, the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals decision invalidated an Illinois law requiring parental notification for teenage abortions. Other states have similar laws. In previous cases, the Court ruled on the constitutionality of parental notification laws, including a Minnesota law deemed unconstitutional without a judicial bypass and an Ohio law upheld with a bypass procedure. The Supreme Court upheld Ohio's parental notification statute, stating that a judicial bypass procedure is consistent with previous rulings. The Court did not address whether all parental notification laws must include a bypass procedure. This has led to disagreement among U.S. Courts of Appeals. The Supreme Court ruled that reporting requirements for abortion facilities must relate to maternal health, remain confidential, and not be overbearing. In Ashcroft, the Court upheld the pathology report requirement as it aligns with medical standards and state health concerns. Additionally, the Court allowed advertising of abortion services across state lines in Bigelow v. Virginia, stating that Virginia's minimal interest in health practices does not justify restricting such advertisements. The Supreme Court rulings on abortion laws include upholding reporting requirements related to maternal health, allowing advertising of abortion services across state lines, and prohibiting nonphysicians from performing abortions. The Court also invalidated an Akron ordinance provision regarding where abortions can be performed. The Supreme Court invalidated an Akron ordinance provision that required second trimester abortions to be performed in full-service hospitals, citing financial expense and added health risks for women. The Court found the hospitalization requirement imposed an unreasonable burden on a woman's right to abortion. In Simopoulos v. Virginia, the Supreme Court upheld Virginia's second trimester abortion hospitalization requirement, distinguishing it from previous cases where similar requirements were invalidated. The decision hinged on the definition of \"hospital\" and allowed outpatient surgical hospitals to qualify for licensing. The Supreme Court's articulation of viability in second-trimester abortions emphasizes the fetus's potential to live outside the womb with artificial aid for a meaningful life. The decision leaves flexibility for advancements in medical skill and highlights the pregnant woman's doctor's central role in the abortion decision. The Supreme Court emphasized that the abortion decision is primarily a medical decision, with viability being a matter of medical judgment and technical ability. The Court upheld a Missouri law defining viability and rejected attempts to advance the point of viability earlier in gestation, stating that it is not the role of the legislature or courts to specify a specific point of viability. The determination of fetal viability is the responsibility of the attending physician, as reaffirmed by the Court in Colautti v. Franklin and Danforth. Fetal protection statutes must only apply to viable fetuses, with precise standards for determining viability outlined in the law. The Court emphasized the importance of medical judgment in the abortion decision, rejecting legislative or judicial interference in defining viability. In Colautti, fetal protection laws must define a doctor's duty to the patient or balance danger against fetal survival. In Ashcroft, the Court upheld a second-physician requirement in the third trimester. In City of Akron, a vague ordinance on disposing of fetal remains was deemed void. The 1983 Supreme Court decisions in City of Akron, Ashcroft, and... The 1983 Supreme Court decisions in City of Akron, Ashcroft, and Simopoulos clarified hospital requirements for second trimester abortions, informed consent, waiting periods, parental notification, and disposal of fetal remains. The Court reaffirmed Roe v. Wade and the trimester framework, balancing a woman's right to choose with the State's interest in protecting potential life, which becomes compelling at viability. Roe was reaffirmed again in 1986 and 1989 in Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. In 1989, the Supreme Court upheld Missouri's abortion statute in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, indicating a willingness to apply a less stringent standard of review to state restrictions on abortion. The decision allowed state legislatures considerable discretion to pass restrictive legislation, with the likelihood of such laws passing constitutional muster. Key provisions in the Missouri law included restrictions on public employees and buildings for abortions. The Supreme Court upheld Missouri's abortion statute in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services in 1989. The ruling allowed states more flexibility in passing restrictive abortion laws, including restrictions on public employees and buildings for abortions. The Court did not rule on the Preamble language stating life begins at conception, emphasizing a value judgment favoring childbirth over abortion. The decision did not impact private doctors' offices or clinics where most abortions are performed. The 1989 Webster v. Reproductive Health Services decision upheld Missouri's abortion statute, allowing states more flexibility in passing restrictive laws. The Court did not rule on the Preamble language stating life begins at conception, emphasizing a value judgment favoring childbirth over abortion. The decision did not impact private doctors' offices or clinics where most abortions are performed. In Webster, the five justices reviewed a Missouri provision on viability testing at 20 weeks, with differing opinions on its constitutionality. The 1989 Webster v. Reproductive Health Services decision upheld Missouri's abortion statute, allowing states more flexibility in passing restrictive laws. Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices White and Kennedy proposed a new standard of review for state abortion restrictions based on protecting potential human life. They found the Missouri law's viability testing requirements constitutional, questioning the concept of \"viability\" as the basis for regulating abortion. The 1989 Webster v. Reproductive Health Services decision upheld Missouri's abortion statute, allowing states more flexibility in passing restrictive laws. Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices White and Kennedy proposed a new standard of review for state abortion restrictions based on protecting potential human life. They found the Missouri law's viability testing requirements constitutional, questioning the concept of \"viability\" as the basis for regulating abortion. The plurality in the case believed that life should only come into existence at viability, allowing state regulation after viability but prohibiting it before. The Missouri law did not limit abortions before viability, so the plurality did not consider overruling Roe. Chief Justice Rehnquist noted the differences between the Missouri and Texas statutes, with the former being a criminal abortion law. The plurality modified and narrowed Roe for future cases involving challenges to state abortion restrictions. Justice Scalia would have explicitly overruled Roe, while Justice O'Connor, part of the majority, wrote a separate concurrence with different reasons, not ready to go as far as Justice Scalia. In the 1991 Rust v. Sullivan case, Justice O'Connor concurred with the decision upholding HHS' Title X regulations restricting recipients of Federal family planning funding from counseling. She applied a standard of \"undue burden\" and found the restriction to be constitutional, stating that it did not impose an undue burden on a woman's abortion decision. The Rust v. Sullivan case upheld HHS' Title X regulations restricting Federal family planning funding recipients from counseling about abortion. The Court viewed it as a challenge to free speech rights rather than the right to abortion, citing previous cases as precedent. Legislative activity was sparked at both Federal and state levels following the rulings. Some state legislative proposals have been challenged in courts, such as in Pennsylvania, Guam, Louisiana, and Utah. The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey reaffirmed the constitutional right to abortion with new restrictions. Justices O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter wrote the opinion, joined by Justices Stevens and Blackmun, while Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices White, Scalia, and Thomas dissented. The Court upheld Roe v. Wade and emphasized the importance of following precedent. The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey reaffirmed the constitutional right to abortion with new restrictions. The Court adopted a new analysis called \"undue burden\" to determine if state abortion restrictions impose a substantial obstacle on a woman's right to obtain an abortion. The Court upheld some provisions of the Pennsylvania statute, including the 24-hour waiting period and informed consent. The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey upheld key provisions of the Pennsylvania statute, including the 24-hour waiting period, informed consent, parental consent with judicial bypass, and reporting requirements. The \"undue burden\" test struck down the spousal notification provision as unconstitutional. Justices Stevens and Blackmun joined in holding the spousal notification provision unconstitutional, with Justice Blackmun indicating a stricter application of the \"undue burden\" analysis. The Court's decision in Casey introduced a new standard of review allowing more state restrictions on abortion. It emphasized the state's interest in protecting human life throughout pregnancy, even favoring childbirth over abortion. Under Roe, abortion was considered a fundamental right with strict scrutiny, allowing minimal state involvement in the first trimester. The Court's decision in Casey introduced a new standard of review allowing more state restrictions on abortion, emphasizing the state's interest in protecting human life throughout pregnancy. This led to the Court upholding regulations like 24-hour waiting periods and informed consent provisions under the \"undue burden\" standard, in contrast to earlier decisions following Roe's strict scrutiny. The Court also showed reluctance to review more abortion cases after Casey, declining appeals in three cases between 1992 and 1993. The Court's decision in Casey introduced a new standard of review allowing more state restrictions on abortion. The term \"partial-birth abortion\" refers to a method involving the intact removal of the fetal body, except for the skull. The procedure is a variation of the common D & E method, involving induced dilation of the cervix and collapsing the skull if the fetus presents head first. The intact D & E procedure, also known as D & X, involves extracting the fetal body through the cervix, collapsing the skull, and removing the fetus. Concerns have been raised that state partial-birth abortion bans may prohibit both methods. In Stenberg, a Nebraska physician challenged the state's ban on partial-birth abortion, arguing it violated the U.S. Constitution. The statute prohibits partial birth abortion in the state, except when necessary to save the mother's life due to a physical disorder, illness, or injury. The term is defined as delivering a living unborn child vaginally before killing it. Violation carries a prison term of up to 20 years. Dr. Carhart argued that the Nebraska statute's unclear definition of \"substantial portion\" could include common D & E procedures in its ban on partial-birth abortions. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit interpreted the statute to prohibit both D & X and D & E procedures, stating that if \"substantial portion\" means an arm or a leg, then the ban encompasses both procedures. The physician performs a procedure where a part of the living fetus is pulled into the vagina, violating the statute. The state argued that the statute only applied to deliberate partial birth abortions, but the Eighth Circuit found that the D & E procedure also falls under the ban as it involves similar steps. The Supreme Court affirmed the Eighth Circuit's decision that the Nebraska statute lacks a health exception and imposes an undue burden on the right to choose abortion. The state argued that safe alternatives exist, but the Court found that the ban on partial-birth abortions creates a risk to women's health. The Supreme Court affirmed that the Nebraska statute banning D & X abortions lacked a health exception, creating a risk to women's health. The Court emphasized the need for a health exception due to the potential safety of the procedure in certain circumstances. It rejected the Attorney General's interpretation that differentiated between D & X and D & E procedures, holding that the statute's language covered both. The Court held that state statutes prohibiting partial-birth abortions must include a health exception and be narrowly tailored to target the D & X procedure. Justice O'Connor's concurrence suggested that statutes in Kansas, Utah, and Montana appropriately differentiate between D & X and other procedures. In 2007, the Court revisited the issue of partial-birth abortion statutes. The federal Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 prohibits physicians from performing a partial-birth abortion except to save the life of a mother. Violators face fines, imprisonment, or both. In Gonzales v. Carhart, the Court upheld the act as not unconstitutionally vague or imposing an undue burden on a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy. The federal statute on partial-birth abortion was upheld by the Court in Gonzales v. Carhart as not unconstitutionally vague. It includes anatomical landmarks to identify when the act's prohibitions apply, and a knowledge requirement alleviates vagueness concerns. The act only applies when a doctor deliberately delivers the fetus to an anatomical landmark. The Court upheld the federal statute on partial-birth abortion in Gonzales v. Carhart, stating that a doctor would not face criminal liability if a fetus is delivered beyond prohibited points by mistake. The Court considered whether the statute is overbroad and lacks a health exception, determining that it does not encompass the D & E procedure. The Court in Gonzales v. Carhart upheld the federal statute on partial-birth abortion, stating that it does not encompass the D&E procedure due to the specific requirement of an \"overt act\" that kills the fetus. The absence of a health exception was also deemed not to impose an undue burden on a woman's ability to terminate her pregnancy. In Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, the Court upheld the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 without a health exception, citing medical uncertainty as a basis for not imposing an undue burden. The Court acknowledged that there may be specific cases where the prohibited procedure is necessary. In an as-applied challenge, exceptions to the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act should be considered for individual plaintiffs. Justice Ginsburg dissented in Gonzales, questioning the decision to uphold the statute without a health exception, citing safety advantages for certain medical conditions. Justice Ginsburg criticized the decision to uphold the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 without a health exception, citing the Court's precedent and the necessity of considering medical uncertainty. She found the refusal to invalidate the law on facial grounds perplexing, noting a previous ruling that a similar statute lacking a health exception was unconstitutional. Ginsburg argued that the decision seemed to undermine women's rights and was an attempt to erode established legal protections. Justice Ginsburg criticized the Court's hostility towards the right secured by Roe and Casey, particularly in their language referring to \"abortion doctors.\" She argued that when a statute burdens constitutional rights as a vehicle for expressing hostility, it constitutes an undue burden."
