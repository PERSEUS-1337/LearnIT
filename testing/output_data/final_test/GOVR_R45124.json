    "content": "The child tax credit, created in 1997 by the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, has evolved over the past 20 years to become a partially refundable credit accessible to more low-income families. Legislative changes have modified the credit, initially a $500-per-child nonrefundable credit for middle- and upper-middle-income families, to provide tax relief. Recent changes made by P.L. 115-97 have further impacted the credit. Since 1997, laws have expanded the child tax credit, increasing its value to $1,000 per child and making it partially refundable. Subsequent legislation further accelerated these changes, with additional expansions in 2008 and 2009. The Child Tax Credit was expanded through the Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, lowering the refundability threshold to $3,000. This was made permanent by the PATH Act of 2015. In 2017, the credit was temporarily changed by P.L. 115-97, doubling the maximum amount to $1,400 and adjusting income thresholds. The Child Tax Credit underwent legislative changes between 1997 and 2017, including modifications to the refundability threshold and the requirement for Social Security numbers. Initially proposed in 1991, the credit was enacted in 1997 as part of the Taxpayer Relief Act. The President proposed a $1,000 refundable child tax credit for children up to age 18, indexed for inflation. The report highlighted slow wage growth, increasing living costs, and a rising tax burden on families with children. It noted that the dependent exemption in the tax code aimed to provide economic relief by reducing taxable income per dependent, but its real value had declined since 1948. The commission argued against increasing the dependent exemption, stating it favored higher-income families. They proposed a child tax credit in 1994 to assist lower- and middle-income families. The Contract with America proposed a $500-per-child tax credit for children under 18, phasing out for families with AGI above $200,000. President Clinton countered with a $300-per-child tax credit for tax years 1996 through 1998, increasing to $500 per child after 1998, with income phaseouts starting at $60,000. Eligible children were defined in both proposals. President Clinton proposed a $500 nonrefundable child tax credit for children under 13 years of age, costing $35.6 billion over five years. The American Dream Restoration Act suggested a similar credit costing $107 billion. In 1997, Congress revisited the issue, with proposals from the House, Senate, and Clinton Administration. A key difference was how the child tax credit would interact with the EITC, affecting its availability to lower-income taxpayers. Both Senate and House bills suggested applying the credit after the EITC reduced tax liability, while Clinton proposed applying it before. President Clinton proposed applying the child tax credit before the EITC to ensure low- and moderate-income taxpayers could claim the full amount of the child tax credit they were eligible for without affecting the value of their EITC. This allowed families to receive refunds and benefits without reducing their tax liability. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 established a $500 nonrefundable child tax credit, which interacted with the EITC. The details of the child tax credit, including qualifying child age and income phase-out levels, were determined during budget negotiations. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 introduced a $500 nonrefundable child tax credit for families with qualifying children under 17. The credit phased out based on income thresholds and was refundable for taxpayers with three or more qualifying children. The credit amount and phaseout thresholds were not adjusted for inflation, and the refundable portion was reduced by the taxpayer's alternative minimum tax. The Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1999 repealed the provision that reduced the refundable portion of the child tax credit by the alternative minimum tax for tax year 1998. It allowed personal nonrefundable credits, including the child tax credit, to fully offset a taxpayer's regular income tax liability in 1998. The Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 extended this provision for one additional year, through the end of 1999. The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA; P.L. 107-16) made significant changes to the child tax credit, increasing the maximum amount per child and making the credit refundable for families using the earned income formula. The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA) increased the child tax credit amount and made it refundable for families using the earned income formula. The refundability rate was set to increase to 15% for tax years 2005 through 2010, with a $10,000 threshold indexed for inflation from 2002. EGTRRA also allowed the child tax credit to offset AMT tax liability from 2002 to 2010, and temporarily repealed the provision reducing the refundable portion by the AMT amount. The Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (JGTRRA) accelerated the maximum credit amount increase to $1,000 per child for 2003 and 2004. In 2003, families received advance child tax credit payments based on 2002 income tax returns. The Working Families Tax Relief Act of 2004 extended the $1,000 per child credit through 2009 and increased refundability to 15% for 2004. Combat pay was also included in the provisions. The Working Families Tax Relief Act of 2004 extended the child tax credit through 2009 and increased refundability to 15% from 2005 to 2010. Combat pay was included as earned income for calculating the refundable child tax credit, benefiting military families with higher earnings and larger refunds. The child tax credit was extended through 2009 with increased refundability to 15% from 2005 to 2010, benefiting military families with higher earnings. In response to the financial crisis, Congress passed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2009, lowering the refundability threshold for the child tax credit in 2008. Discussions in early 2009 debated changing the refundability threshold, with the House proposing zero refundability for 2009 and 2010, while the Senate proposed $8,100 over the same period. The child tax credit underwent changes in refundability thresholds, with the House proposing zero refundability for 2009 and 2010, and the Senate proposing $8,100 over the same period. The final provision was shaped during meetings between Senate and House conferees, leading to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 reducing the refundability threshold to $3,000 for 2009 and 2010. The cost estimates for these changes varied between $7.2 billion and $18.3 billion over 10 years. The child tax credit was extended through various acts, including the Tax Relief Act of 2010 and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, making EGTRRA changes permanent and extending refundability thresholds. The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015 further impacted the ARRA provisions. The PATH Act of 2015 made the ARRA modification to the child tax credit permanent, requiring a valid Taxpayer Identification Number for each qualifying child claimed on the federal income tax return. Valid TINs include ITINs, SSNs, and ATINs issued by the IRS. The 2017 tax revision (P.L. 115-97) expanded the child tax credit, doubling the maximum amount to $2,000 per qualifying child and increasing the refundable portion to $1,400 per qualifying child. The law also allowed for annual adjustments for inflation using the chained consumer price index. The 2017 tax revision expanded the child tax credit to $2,000 per qualifying child with a refundable portion of $1,400. It lowered the income level for receiving the credit to $2,500 and increased the phase-out income levels. Taxpayers must provide an SSN for each child claimed for the credit, issued before the tax return due date. Failure to provide the SSN could result in denial of the credit. The 2017 tax revision expanded the child tax credit to $2,000 per qualifying child with a refundable portion of $1,400. It also introduced a new temporary \"family credit\" for non-child credit eligible dependents, excluding non-U.S. citizen dependents from Mexico or Canada. The family credit is $500 per eligible dependent and follows the same phaseout parameters as the child credit. These modifications are set to expire in 2025."
