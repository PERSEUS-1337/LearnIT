    "content": "The \"Education Improvement Tax Cut Act\" allows for a credit for contributions to charitable organizations providing elementary or secondary school scholarships under section 25C of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Education Improvement Tax Cut Act\" allows individuals to receive a tax credit for qualified scholarship contributions up to $3,000 ($1,500 for married individuals filing separately). Qualified scholarship contributions are defined as cash donations to school tuition organizations. The term 'school tuition organization' refers to an organization that primarily disburses funds for elementary and secondary school scholarships. These scholarships are for education up to 12th grade and are excluded from gross income. No deduction is allowed for contributions that receive a credit under this section. There is an option to elect for the credit not to apply. Taxpayers can elect to have the credit under this section not apply for any taxable year. The election must be made before the expiration of the 3-year period from the last date for filing the return. Dollar amounts in subsection (b) are adjusted for cost-of-living for taxable years after 2005. The section discusses adjustments to dollar amounts for tax credits, including increasing amounts to the next highest multiple of $10. The Secretary is required to prescribe regulations for claiming the credit on Form 1040EZ. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2004. A new section 25D is added for contributions of instructional materials and materials for extracurricular activities. The new section allows individuals to receive a tax credit for qualified school materials contributions, capped at $3,000 ($1,500 for married individuals filing separately). Qualified contributions include cash donations to elementary or secondary schools designated for specific purposes. The new section allows individuals to receive a tax credit for qualified school materials contributions to elementary or secondary schools. Contributions can be in the form of cash, school materials, or to a school materials organization. Elementary or secondary school refers to organizations providing education up to the 12th grade. The organization raises funds for elementary or secondary schools, with annual disbursements for qualified school materials not less than 90% of its annual income. Qualified school materials include instructional materials, equipment, and computer software. The text discusses deductions for contributions to school-sponsored extracurricular activities and the denial of double benefits. Taxpayers can elect to not apply this section for any taxable year, with a cost-of-living adjustment after 2005. Beginning in a calendar year after 2005, dollar amounts in subsection (b) will be increased by the cost-of-living adjustment for that year. Any increase not a multiple of $10 will be rounded up. For married individuals filing separately, the adjustment is $5 instead of $10. The Secretary will create regulations for claiming the credit on Form 1040EZ. The credit under this section on Form 1040EZ is amended by inserting a new item after section 25C in the table of sections. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2004."
