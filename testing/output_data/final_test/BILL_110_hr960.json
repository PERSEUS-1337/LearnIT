    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Enhancing America's Security through Redeployment from Iraq Act\". The worsening situation in Iraq is a result of ongoing sectarian violence, with the US troops being involved in a civil war. Sending more troops and staying indefinitely will increase Iraq's dependence on the US when they should be taking more responsibility. Failure to engage diplomatically with all regional countries has hindered Iraq's stability. The loss of national treasure in Iraq, with billions of dollars unaccounted for in reconstruction aid, has negatively impacted US military readiness. Continuing in the current direction in Iraq diverts attention and resources needed for more significant security goals in the Global War on Terror and other regional challenges. Maintaining a strong US military presence in the Middle East and Southwest Asia is crucial for protecting US and allied interests in regions like Afghanistan, North Korea, Iran, the Western Pacific, and the Middle East. SEC. 3. DECLARATIONS OF POLICY. Congress declares that the United States must urge Iraqi leaders to take necessary steps to end sectarian violence, promote coalition-building, protect minority rights, balance power between provincial and central governments, and share oil revenues. Additionally, the US must incentivize regional countries to engage positively with Iraq. It is emphasized that these goals cannot be achieved through an indefinite military presence in Iraq, but rather by implementing a deliberate timetable for the withdrawal of US forces. The United States must ensure that Iraqi leaders take necessary steps to end sectarian violence and assume responsibility for their country. SEC. 4. REDEPLOYMENT OF UNITED STATES MILITARY FORCES FROM IRAQ. The text chunk discusses the redeployment of United States Armed Forces from Iraq by December 31, 2007, for global security interests and military readiness. The Secretary of Defense will ensure a deliberate and orderly pace for redeployment to ensure the security of the Armed Forces. Exceptions to the redeployment requirement are also mentioned. Exceptions to the redeployment requirement include special operations forces conducting counter-terrorism operations in Iraq, military liaison teams involved in military-to-military contacts, and Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps members conducting air operations to support Iraqi security forces. Members of the Armed Forces in Iraq are involved in various operations, including combat support, counter-terrorism operations, security for US diplomatic missions, and routine functions of the Office of Defense Attache. SEC. 5. LIMITATION ON USE OF FUNDS. Funds for Operation Iraqi Freedom can only be used for personnel and activities outlined in section 4(b) after December 31, 2007. SEC. 6. DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS BY THE UNITED STATES. The United States should lead diplomatic efforts for regional stability in Iraq, involving countries like Iran and Syria. An international conference should be convened to provide economic aid for Iraq's infrastructure rebuilding and reconstruction efforts."
