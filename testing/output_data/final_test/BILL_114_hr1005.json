The \"Renewable Energy Jobs Act\" establishes a pilot program for competitive grants to train individuals in renewable energy and energy efficiency industries. Grants will be awarded to the top five states with the highest alternative energy power capacity, based on wind, solar, and geothermal facilities. States must submit applications with evidence of their installed alternative energy power capacity. The curr_chunk describes how funds will be used to establish a program for skills training in renewable energy and energy efficiency industries. It also mentions the State's option to coordinate with workforce investment boards and industry councils for program implementation. The curr_chunk outlines the requirements for grant recipients to provide skills training and on-the-job training leading to industry-recognized certificates. It also details how grants will be prioritized and used to support renewable energy job creation programs. Grants will be sufficient in size and last for 3 years, with funds used as specified by the State receiving the grant. The State receiving a grant must use the funds to reimburse employers for on-the-job training, provide skills training through various entities, and conduct outreach to inform eligible parties about the program.
