    "title": "AB 1926",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 1777.5 of the Labor Code is amended to ensure that properly registered apprentices can be employed on public works projects and must be paid the prevailing rate of per diem wages for their trade. When a contractor requests an apprentice for a public works project and requires preemployment activities, the apprentice must be paid prevailing wages for the time spent on those activities. However, if the apprentice fails a drug or alcohol test, they are not entitled to compensation for the time spent on preemployment activities. Only apprentices in training under approved apprenticeship standards and written agreements are eligible for employment at the apprentice wage rate on public works. Their employment and training must adhere to either the apprenticeship standards and agreements or the rules of the California Apprenticeship Council. If a contractor awarded a contract by the state or a political subdivision employs apprentices in an apprenticeable craft, they must adhere to a specific apprentice ratio. The contractor can apply to an apprenticeship program for approval, which can dispatch apprentices to the site. The program's decision can be reviewed by the Administrator of Apprenticeship. The program's standards do not require an additional application for adding more public works contracts. An \"apprenticeable craft or trade\" is determined by the California Apprenticeship Council. The term \"contractor\" includes subcontractors performing public works not excluded by subdivision (o). Before starting work on a public works contract, contractors must provide contract award details to an apprenticeship program, including journeyman hours, number of apprentices, and employment dates. After completing the contract, contractors and subcontractors must submit verified statements of journeyman and apprentice hours to the awarding body and apprenticeship program upon request. This information is public and must be retained by apprenticeship programs for 12 months. The apprenticeship program for public works must ensure equal employment and affirmative action for women and minorities. The ratio of apprentice to journeyman work on the site must adhere to apprenticeship standards, with a minimum of one hour of apprentice work for every five hours of journeyman work. The ratio of apprentice work to journeyman work on the jobsite must adhere to apprenticeship standards. The contractor must employ apprentices for a specific number of hours before the end of the contract. If an hourly apprenticeship ratio is not feasible, the Administrator of Apprenticeship may order a minimum ratio of one apprentice for every five. The contractor must adhere to apprenticeship standards by employing apprentices for a specific number of hours. The Administrator of Apprenticeship may order a minimum ratio of one apprentice for every five journeymen in a craft or trade classification. A contractor covered by this section must employ apprentices according to the apprenticeship standards, with a minimum 1-to-5 ratio of apprentices to journeymen. The Administrator of Apprenticeship may grant an exemption from this ratio if the contractor can show that they employ apprentices for at least one hour for every five hours of labor performed by journeymen. An apprenticeship program can grant a certificate exempting a contractor from the 1-to-5 ratio if certain conditions are met, such as high unemployment, exceeding the apprentice ratio, or replacing journeymen through apprenticeship training. Assignment of an apprentice under a public works contract must not endanger lives or property, or involve tasks that cannot be trained by a journeyman. Exemptions from apprentice ratios for contractor organizations may eliminate the need for individual applications to local committees. A contractor awarded a contract must contribute to the California Apprenticeship Council the prevailing amount for apprenticeship training. Credits can be taken for payments to approved apprenticeship programs. Contributions can be added to bid calculations. The California Apprenticeship Council distributes training contributions to approved apprenticeship programs at the end of each fiscal year. Grants are given to multiemployer programs serving the same craft or trade and geographic area, with funds divided among programs based on the number of apprentices registered in each program from the county where contributions were made. All training contributions not distributed under subparagraphs (A) and (B) are used to cover future expenses of the Department of Industrial Relations for apprenticeship standards. Contributions are deposited in the Apprenticeship Training Contribution Fund and used for administration and enforcement. The contract awarding body must include stipulations in contracts to ensure compliance with apprenticeable occupations. The section does not apply to contracts of general contractors or specialty contractors not bidding for work through a general contractor involving less than $30,000. An awarding body with an approved labor compliance program may assist in enforcement under the director's terms. No reimbursement is required by this act as it pertains to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes or infractions, thus not incurring costs for local agencies or school districts."
