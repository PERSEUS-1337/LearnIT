    "content": "The space industry encompasses economic activities related to manufacturing and delivering components for Earth's orbit and beyond. It is a subset of the U.S. aerospace industry, with a focus on global commercial space manufacturing including launch vehicles, spacecraft, satellites, and equipment. This industry also involves building space ports, ground stations, and infrastructure to support services like satellite telecommunications and remote sensing. It plays a crucial role in the U.S. industrial and technology base. The U.S. space manufacturing industry is vital to the country's industrial and technology base, with a close link to government space programs. The industry includes commercial satellite manufacturing, generating $3.4 billion in revenues and employing 26,611 private sector workers in 2010. Federal policy issues may impact the industry's growth. The U.S. commercial launch industry generated $307 million in revenues and employed 49,195 private-sector workers. Global revenues from satellite-enabled activities in 2010 totaled $101.3 billion, with major products including direct-to-home television, satellite communications, satellite radio, consumer broadband, and Earth observation. Satellite services also generated worldwide sales of ground equipment totaling $51.6 billion. The U.S. government is the largest consumer of space products and services, accounting for 23% of global spending. The commercial space sector overlaps with the government sector, with many manufacturers selling to both. Military and civil space programs provide economies of scale to federal contractors. Industry consolidation has resulted from numerous mergers in the post-Cold War period. The U.S. government is a major consumer of space products and services, accounting for 23% of global spending. Industry consolidation has occurred due to mergers in the post-Cold War period, resulting in fewer firms across multiple sectors. Some large U.S. space companies have focused on government contracts, while smaller private companies have been encouraged to innovate in space activities. Orbital Sciences Corporation and SpaceX are examples of newer American companies successfully competing for commercial and government contracts in the launch industry. The space industry is highly competitive internationally, with companies vying for contracts to provide launch vehicles, spacecraft, and satellites. Some manufacturers specialize in certain products, while others offer a range of aerospace products. The supply chain for launch vehicles is moderately globalized, while satellites vary in globalization levels based on the customer. Major policy issues affecting U.S. space competitiveness are discussed in the report. The competitiveness of the U.S. space manufacturing sector is impacted by various factors such as export controls, spectrum regulations, and increased use of commercial satellites for Department of Defense communications. However, there is a lack of comprehensive statistical data available, with some data being suppressed or aggregated to protect company identities. The U.S. space manufacturing sector faces challenges due to factors like export controls and spectrum regulations. Data is often aggregated, making it difficult to differentiate between industries like space, aviation, and telecommunications. Government sources do not distinguish between missiles, space launch equipment, and spacecraft. The space equipment industry consists of launch vehicles for placing satellites into orbit. Futron Corporation's data is widely used for analyzing the space industry. Commercial launch vehicles are used to place satellites and spacecraft into orbit, with most major companies competing in this sector. In 2010, there were 23 commercial launches carrying a total of 31 commercial payloads and 13 noncommercial payloads. These vehicles can also be adapted for government purposes, both civil and military, and the demand for commercial launch services is directly tied to the demand for commercial launch vehicles. The main driver of commercial launch activity is commercial satellites, with some government-owned satellites also launched using the same vehicles. Commercial customers can contract separately for launch vehicles and services or obtain them from the same provider. Boeing Launch Services and SpaceX were the only U.S. companies conducting commercial launches in 2010. In 2011, there were 84 worldwide orbital launch attempts, with 66 non-commercial and 18 commercial launches. Russia led the international market with 10 commercial launches, followed by Europe, China, and Sea Launch AG. Commercial launch revenues totaled $1.9 billion, with Russia, Europe, China, and Sea Launch AG generating significant revenue. No U.S. commercial launches occurred in 2011. Sea Launch revenues were approximately $200 million in 2011. U.S. companies conducted 18 non-commercial launches with 28 payloads, including military, civil, and non-profit payloads. Russia conducted 31 non-commercial launches with 53 payloads. Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Orbital Sciences, and SpaceX were involved in commercial launch activities. Boeing and Lockheed Martin, along with their joint venture ULA, focused on government launches. In 2010, Boeing launched two non-commercial payloads into orbit using ULA-built Delta launch vehicles. In 2011, U.S. launches were conducted by ULA, United Space Alliance, and Orbital Sciences Corporation. Orbital had revenues of $1.3 billion, with 71% from the U.S. government. 38% of revenues came from the Department of Defense, 33% from NASA, and 29% from commercial sources. SpaceX, a privately owned company founded by Elon Musk, designs and builds launch vehicles. They have launch contracts with NASA and various satellite companies for communication and broadcasting services. The company's newest launch vehicle, the Antares rocket, is set to undergo its first test in summer 2012. SpaceX has a strong commercial order book for its Falcon 9 launch vehicle, with contracts for future launches of communication satellites for various firms including Iridium, ORBCOMM, and foreign companies like SES and Thaicom. SpaceX has a strong commercial order book for its Falcon 9 launch vehicle, with contracts for future launches of communication satellites. The U.S. Air Force, NRO, and NASA have agreed to allow new U.S. companies to compete for space launch missions, with the Air Force reserving two launches for SpaceX, Orbital, Virgin Galactic, or other commercial launch companies. This will provide smaller competitors a chance to enter a market currently dominated by the United Launch Alliance. NASA has cleared SpaceX for a mission to the International Space Station (ISS) under the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program. Orbital is expected to be cleared in 2012. Commercial space transportation is entering a new phase of development, with NASA relying on commercial vehicles for cargo and crew transport to the ISS through 2020. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has raised concerns about the risks associated with relying on new commercial vehicles that are still in development. U.S. spacecraft under development are set to start ferrying cargo to the ISS in 2012 and transporting astronauts in crew vehicles by 2017. The United States government is funding commercial spacecraft development through NASA's Commercial Crew Development (CCDev) Program to stimulate efforts within the private sector to develop safe, reliable, and cost-effective space transportation capabilities. Companies involved in the program include SpaceX, Orbital, and Blue Origin. Joseph Anselmo of Aviation Week and Space Technology highlighted the shift towards a more entrepreneurial private sector-based approach for manned space programs, noting the risks involved in outsourcing astronaut transportation to private companies. Several companies involved in commercial spacecraft development without NASA funding include SpaceX, Orbital, Blue Origin, Boeing, Paragon, United Launch Alliance, and Sierra Nevada. SpaceX successfully tested its Dragon spacecraft in 2010 and is expected to rendezvous with the ISS in 2012. Orbital's Cygnus spacecraft is scheduled for a resupply flight to the ISS in 2012. SpaceX and Orbital will conduct the majority of the scheduled resupply missions through 2016. Christina Chaplain of GAO warned that if commercial vehicle launches do not happen as planned in 2012, the ISS could lose functionality and research capabilities due to a lack of alternative launch options. Lieutenant General Thomas P. Stafford, chairman of the NASA International Space Station Advisory Committee, stated that the commercial vehicle launch schedule was overly optimistic and there was insufficient data to confirm it could be met, as reported by both the NASA Aerospace Advisory Committee and his committee. Commercial cargo contractors Orbital Science Corporation and Space Exploration Corporation are facing significant delays in their operations. NASA's commercial partners, SpaceX and Orbital, are experiencing delays in their space vehicle development. NASA emphasizes safety and milestone completion before payment. Major satellite manufacturers include Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Space Systems/Loral, Thales Alenia Space, and EADS Astrium. Major satellite manufacturers in the United States and Europe include Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Space Systems/Loral, Thales Alenia Space, EADS Astrium, ATK, Ball Aerospace, Northrop Grumman Corporation, and Sierra Nevada Corporation. These manufacturers build government and commercial satellites, which drive space-enabled consumer products such as GPS data and weather-related data for consumer electronics. The demand for mobile devices has also increased the need for commercial communications and broadcast satellites, creating new markets and demand for space equipment. The U.S. satellite industry faces challenges with declining market share and revenues, despite capturing 52% of global satellite revenues in 2010. The time it takes to order, design, build, and launch a satellite can span years due to the complexity of satellite equipment. The decline in market share is attributed to stricter arms export control regulations imposed in 1998. The aerospace and satellite manufacturing industry believes that non-U.S. manufacturers are being sought after for satellites without U.S. parts subject to arms export controls. The U.S. commercial space industry may be relying more on military sales as foreign suppliers aim to replace U.S. manufacturers in the satellite market. Between 2001 and 2010, the U.S. manufactured 38.1% of global satellites, while European and Russian shares remained stable at 18.6% and 21.6% respectively. Other countries accounted for the remaining 21.7% of satellite output. In 2011, 11 U.S.-built commercial communications satellites were manufactured by Orbital Sciences, Space Systems/Loral, Lockheed Martin, and Spacequest. These satellites were launched by various companies including Arianespace, Land Launch, International Launch Services, and International Space Company Kosmotras. The Space Foundation provides estimates of employment in the space industry, using broad categories defined in the NAICs system. Data suppression makes it challenging to compare year-to-year data accurately. The Space Foundation provides estimates of employment in the space industry using NAICS categories. Data suppression makes it difficult to compare year-to-year data accurately. Other NAICS categories are omitted due to lack of information. Some categories involving production of guided missiles and space vehicles are combined, making it impossible to distinguish between workers. The aerospace sector's production workers and engineers earn above-average salaries due to the high skill levels required. The aerospace sector's production workers and engineers earn above-average salaries due to the high skill levels required by the industry. Nonproduction workers, such as engineering managers, engineers, and computer specialists, generally command higher pay because of their advanced education and training. BLS data also indicate that employees in the space sector were somewhat better paid than workers in aircraft and aircraft parts manufacturing, with guided missile and space vehicle manufacturing employees earning an average of $106,830 annually in 2010. Employees in the search, detection, and navigation instruments category earn higher salaries compared to workers in aircraft manufacturing, guided missile propulsion, and space vehicle parts. The industry involves creating sophisticated electronics critical for guided missiles, spacecraft, and consumer navigation equipment. Data on space manufacturing employment are limited to California. In 2010, California had the largest number of workers in the aerospace industry, with 59,580 employees in the space industry. Missile and spacecraft manufacturing had 106,830 employees, with 15,585 in California. Eighteen states employed over 1,000 workers in search, detection, and navigation instrument manufacturing. Federal laws and regulations are crucial for the space equipment manufacturing industry. In 1998, Congress passed the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999, reclassifying all satellites as munitions. This transferred jurisdiction of export licensing approvals for satellites from the Department of Commerce to the State Department under ITAR, subjecting them to higher scrutiny due to national security concerns. Patricia Cooper testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee in February 2012. Patricia Cooper, president of the Satellite Industry Association, testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee in February 2012 about the reclassification of satellites as munitions in the late 1990s. This decision, which imposed unilateral export controls on commercial satellites, caused harm to the U.S. satellite industry by putting them at a competitive disadvantage against foreign competitors like Alcatel, a French company, which started producing \"ITAR-free\" satellites and doubled its market share by 2004. Thales Group, formerly Thomson-CFS, acquired Alcatel's space business in 2007, forming Thales Alenia Space which sells ITAR-free satellites. The State Department has been investigating whether sales of the Spacebus violate U.S. export control laws, with an impasse over sharing the complete design and component list. Thales Group's senior vice-president stated that they could not provide the complete satellite design due to French law restrictions. The number of ITAR-free satellites launched increased from 6 in April 2009 to 13 in February 2012, with more on order. A Department of Defense study estimated lost export sales due to ITAR controls at $2.35 billion between 2003 and 2006. U.S. satellite manufacturers saw a decline in their global market share from 75% in 1995 to 41% in 2005, remaining between 35% and 50% since then. The U.S. satellite market share fell from 75% in 1995 to 41% in 2005 and has since ranged between 35% and 50%. U.S. satellite manufacturers' global revenue share declined from $6.6 billion per year in 1996-1999 to $4.7 billion per year in 2000-2010. In 2009 and 2010, satellite deliveries improved, but it is unclear if this trend will continue. In 2009, the Obama Administration began a review of U.S. export controls, with measures outlined by then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates for reform. The United States participates in various multilateral export control regimes focused on different weapons and security aspects, but none of these regimes control satellites as munitions. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 requires an assessment of national security risks related to removing satellites from the US Munitions List. A report to Congress in 2012 stated that risks could be managed through controls and licensing policies under the Commodity Control List for certain types of satellites and related items. The report recommends relaxed controls on allies and partners for satellites with performance parameters below certain thresholds. It also calls for strict controls on transfers of non-critical space-related items to end-users likely to be used against U.S. national interests. Legislation has been introduced to shift control of satellites from the U.S. Munitions List to the Commodity Control List. Representative Rohrabacher is involved in this effort. Legislation has been introduced to shift control of satellites from the U.S. Munitions List to the Commodity Control List, allowing the President to transfer satellites and related components. This includes a bill that prohibits satellite sales to certain countries and a focus on removing parts and components. The Aerospace Industries Association published a study in 2012 highlighting the challenges faced by U.S. aerospace firms in exporting commercial satellites and components. Congressional action would be needed to remove satellites from the U.S. Munitions List, unlike other items that can be reclassified by the President. Export control legislation for commercial satellites has been difficult to pass. The allocation of spectrum and orbital location is a challenge for the satellite industry, as they are scarce resources regulated by governments. Spectrum allocation aims to prevent signal interference but limits capacity for service providers. Regulatory regimes have limitations in addressing capacity issues, leading operators to seek technological solutions like high-power Ku- and Ka-bands for increased data transmission. The allocation of spectrum and orbital locations is a challenge for the satellite industry, regulated by governments to prevent signal interference and limit capacity. U.S. regulations govern bandwidth allocation and satellite positioning, while international treaties like the Radio Regulations managed by the International Telecommunications Union aim for rational and efficient use of radio-frequency spectrum. Excessive applications for orbital locations are a recognized issue. Some countries file excessive applications for orbital locations and frequency assignments to reserve space, deterring others from expanding services. Conflicts over satellite spectrum and positioning occur, with the ITU lacking enforcement mechanisms for disputes. The rapid evolution of new bandwidth-intensive technologies complicates the allocation process. The increased use of satellite technology threatens existing regulatory regimes by limiting bandwidth allocation and hindering flexibility in transmission. This leads to underutilization of spectrum and capacity, prompting a need for more efficient systems to adapt to growing demand. Fiber optic transmission could help alleviate some issues, but costs remain a concern. Regulators are under pressure to implement more flexible systems to optimize fixed satellite services. European satellite operators are reluctant to give up exclusive frequency bands, citing the Radio Regulations as a barrier to a more liberal regime. Futron forecasts constraints on satellite services due to spectrum allocation debates, but notes that operational efficiencies and fleet optimization strategies have improved service delivery. Technical solutions allow for increased throughput despite limitations on the number of satellites or transponders. The shift to multiband payloads and higher power applications increases satellite throughput, overcoming spectrum scarcity limitations. Futron predicts a slight decline in fixed satellite capacity supply by major operators, while demand for throughput capacity continues to grow. The Department of Defense is transitioning from military-owned satellites to leased commercial capacity for additional bandwidth. The Department of Defense is turning to commercial satellites to handle a significant portion of military communications, preserving capacity on military satellites for high-level intelligence data. Military satellites are more expensive and take longer to build and launch than commercial satellites. Global demand consumed 79% of fixed satellite service capacity in 2011, with spare capacity serving as a reserve in case of satellite loss. The U.S. Department of Defense faces capacity constraints in the Middle East due to a shortage of satellite bandwidth. The increased use of commercial satellite capacity by the military has stimulated private-sector investment in satellites. Short-term sales of satellite bandwidth have allowed operators to command premium prices, but unplanned demand does not provide a stable business model. Satellites are typically built for long-term customers, and operators require contracts for most of the available capacity before launching a satellite. Eutelsat warns investors that sales of short-term capacity to DOD may not increase as rapidly due to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan winding down. Concerns arise over the shift from surge capacity to reliance on commercial satellites for core military communications. Debate ensues on a more integrated approach to acquiring commercial satellite services. The DOD relies heavily on commercial satellite services, with bandwidth usage expected to increase to over 90%. The volume of intelligence data collected in Afghanistan has grown significantly, from 1 terabyte per day to 53 terabytes per day. This high demand for commercial satellite communications is a key concern for the DOD. The General Services Administration (GSA) and the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) established the Future Comsatcom Services Acquisition (FCSA) program in 2009 to meet the high demand for commercial satellite communications by the DOD and other government agencies. The program allows commercial satellite providers to directly access military customers, increasing efficiency and reducing costs. Studies by GAO and DOD found an increase in the cost of acquiring commercial bandwidth from 2003 to 2010. The FCSA program allows for more satellite service vendors to compete for bandwidth, potentially lowering prices. However, the high cost of manufacturing, launching, and insuring satellites is a barrier for new operators entering the market. The United States is a significant user of geosynchronous satellites and could boost competition in the commercial satellite sector by deploying hosted payloads. Hosted payloads allow the military to include specialized equipment on commercial satellites. Concerns have been raised about launching satellites with sensitive military technologies outside the U.S. Despite regulatory challenges, the outlook for the U.S. commercial satellite sector is positive. The United States commercial satellite industry is strong, launching more satellites than Russia or Europe in 2010. The U.S. has a significant advantage in space due to a dynamic private sector. The transition from NASA's Space Shuttle program may delay government procurement of commercial equipment, but military and NASA programs are increasingly relying on the private sector for space transportation. As U.S. programs rely more on the private sector for space transportation, American commercial space equipment manufacturers will have an advantage over foreign competitors. The U.S. space equipment manufacturing industry faces uncertainty in international markets due to new competitors from various countries. U.S. manufacturers have advantages such as a large aerospace industrial base and policies that support competition and innovation in space exploration. The United States is investing in developing launchers and spacecraft for space exploration. Futron's analysis shows the U.S. declining position compared to Russia, China, Japan, and India. The government now relies on the private sector for human spaceflight, leading to competition with Russia and Europe in the launch industry. U.S. industry still leads in space manufacturing. The U.S. space industry maintains a lead in manufacturing, but faces vulnerabilities in critical product sourcing. Public support for government funding of space programs is lacking, potentially impacting competitiveness against other countries."
