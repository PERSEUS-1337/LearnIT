    "content": "The Stafford Act authorizes the President to issue a major disaster declaration for incidents overwhelming state capacities, providing federal support. FEMA grants are available for state, local, and tribal governments, but businesses with uninsured losses are not eligible. Assistance for businesses may be provided through the CDBG program. The CDBG program offers loans and grants to eligible businesses for disaster recovery and attracting new businesses. It is used on a case-by-case basis for large-scale disasters. Other agencies like the USDA and Department of Commerce provide assistance to specific types of businesses. However, these programs have limitations in scope and grant amounts. Most businesses will need to apply for SBA assistance. Most businesses will need to apply for a Small Business Administration (SBA) disaster loan for federal assistance with uninsured loss from a disaster. SBA can provide grants to resource partners for training and technical assistance, but not direct grant assistance to businesses. Federal assistance for uninsured loss is mainly limited to SBA disaster loans, which include Business Physical Disaster Loans and Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL). If Congress were to replace SBA loans with a grant program, it might consider providing grants. If Congress were to replace SBA business disaster loans with a grant program, it might consider providing grants for similar types of loss. Alternatively, Congress might implement a small business disaster grant program and continue to provide loan assistance through the SBA. The Small Business Administration offers Business Physical Disaster Loans up to $2 million for repairing or replacing damaged physical property in declared disaster areas. These loans cover machinery, equipment, inventory, and leasehold improvements not covered by insurance. Business Physical Disaster Loans can cover up to $2 million for repairing or replacing damaged physical property in declared disaster areas. Borrowers can use up to 20% of the verified loss amount for mitigation measures. Interest rates for these loans cannot exceed 8% per annum or 4% per annum if credit cannot be obtained elsewhere. Monthly installments start five months from the loan date, with maturities up to 30 years. EIDLs are available to businesses in declared disaster areas suffering substantial economic injury. Small businesses in declared disaster areas can apply for Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDLs) if they have suffered economic injury and are unable to obtain credit elsewhere. Small agricultural cooperatives, private, and nonprofit organizations are also eligible. Businesses can receive both an EIDL and a Business Physical Disaster loan, with a combined loan amount not exceeding $2 million. Interest rates are capped at 4% per annum, with loan maturities up to 30 years. Arguments for and against implementing a business disaster grant program are discussed. Advocates argue for small business disaster grants to address equity, vulnerability, and economic protection concerns in federal policy. They see current eligibility disparities as unfair and advocate for a more uniform approach across all sectors. Opponents raise objections to the equity implications of providing such grants. Small business disaster grant advocates argue that small businesses are particularly vulnerable to disasters, with studies showing a high failure rate post-disaster. FEMA reports that 40-60% of small businesses fail to reopen after a disaster, highlighting the need for grants to support their recovery. The Institute for Business and Home Safety found that 25% of businesses that close after a disaster never reopen, with smaller businesses having lower reopening probabilities. Businesses recovering from Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans showed that 12% remained closed 26 months after the storm. While the SBA offers low-interest disaster loans with up to 30-year maturities, some view this as a burden to full recovery. Quick recovery and reopening are crucial not only for small businesses but also for local governments relying on them for tax revenue. Advocates suggest using small business disaster grants to help vulnerable businesses rebuild post-disaster. Advocates argue that grant assistance post-disaster could help businesses recover and counteract negative economic outcomes. Major disasters cause damage to public infrastructure and private capital, leading to immediate losses of output, income, and employment. Small businesses are vital to the economy, employing millions and contributing significantly to GDP. Opponents may argue against a small business disaster grant program, but studies suggest its importance in aiding recovery. Studies suggest that market mechanisms may restore economic order without grant assistance after a major disaster. Research on Hurricane Sandy recovery showed that spending on cleanup and repair efforts offset initial economic disruptions. Opponents argue against providing disaster grants to small businesses, citing concerns about encouraging underinsurance, costliness, and the appropriateness of using the Stafford Act for such grants. Opponents argue that providing disaster grants to small businesses could incentivize underinsurance and be costly. They suggest that SBA disaster loans, designed to be repaid, are a more cost-effective option compared to grants. Grants, unlike loans, do not need to be repaid to the federal government. Opponents argue that the Stafford Act is not suitable for providing disaster assistance to businesses, suggesting that grants should be provided under the Small Business Act or another authorization statute. The debate over small business disaster grants will be further explored in \"Policy Considerations and Options for Congress.\" The federal government provides grant assistance to various entities but not to businesses for disaster assistance. The policy on business disaster assistance dates back to the 1930s when there was no federal disaster program in place. During the Great Depression, Congress limited financial assistance for disaster relief to individuals and households, focusing on basic needs like food, clothing, and shelter. They aimed to minimize federal costs and often relied on organizations like the American Red Cross for assistance. The Red Cross sought funding for earthquake assistance in California due to limitations in traditional fundraising efforts. Congress, focused on immediate needs like food and clothing, was hesitant to provide federal assistance for business recovery. The Vice Chairman clarified that the Red Cross did not have a role in business rehabilitation or replacing losses for public corporations and schools. The Red Cross focused on family problems, not business or government issues. Congress authorized disaster loans for nonprofit organizations in 1936, later expanding to corporations, individuals, and municipalities. The RFC provided disaster loans until 1953 when authority was transferred to the SBA. In 1950, the Federal Disaster Relief Act established permanent federal government commitment to specific disaster relief efforts. The Federal Disaster Relief Act established a permanent authority for federal assistance to states and localities following major disasters, excluding businesses. Assistance to businesses remained in the form of loans, while federal assistance to other entities expanded over the years. Recent legislative attempts have been made to establish business disaster grant programs. Recent legislative attempts to establish business disaster grant programs include the Small Business Owner Disaster Relief Act of 2008 (H.R. 6641) and the Hurricane Harvey Small Business Recovery Grants Act (H.R. 3930). H.R. 6641 aimed to provide grants to businesses with 25 or fewer employees for facility repairs, limited to $28,000. Representative Steve King of Iowa highlighted concerns over disparities in disaster assistance during a hearing on H.R. 6641. Representative Steve King of Iowa raised concerns about the lack of federal government relief in grant form for small businesses during a Subcommittee hearing. Chairwoman Eleanor Holmes Norton questioned the justification for providing money to private enterprises in times of deficit, pointing out the assistance given to not-for-profits and political subdivisions. The hearing also highlighted the challenges businesses face in recovering from disasters, such as a lack of capital and revenue. The challenges businesses face in disaster recovery include lack of capital, revenue gaps, and reduced ability to generate revenue. H.R. 3930 in the 115th Congress aimed to establish an \"Office of Hurricane Harvey Small Business Grants\" to provide grants up to $100,000 (potentially $250,000) for businesses affected by Hurricane Harvey. Grants could be used for various recovery activities like property loss, infrastructure damage, overhead costs, wages, relocation, and debris removal. A potential small business disaster grant program, H.R. 3930, introduced in the House of Representatives, aimed to provide grants for various recovery activities such as employee wages, temporary relocation, and debris removal. Congressional considerations for the program include preventing duplication of benefits, selecting authorization statutes, determining eligible businesses, and defining eligible activities for grant assistance. Congress could explore alternative options to a small business disaster grant program, such as loan forgiveness, reduced interest rates, and measures to help businesses develop continuity and disaster recovery plans. Concerns about duplication of administrative functions and benefits could be addressed through program consolidation. Duplication of benefits can occur when compensation from multiple sources exceeds the recovery need. To prevent this, Congress could authorize a new small business disaster grant program by either SBA or FEMA, not both. This decision echoes past debates during FEMA's formation in 1978, where SBA continued to provide disaster loans instead of transferring that function to FEMA. The rationale behind the proposal to establish FEMA in 1978 was to ensure that emergency responsibilities align with the regular missions of federal agencies to avoid duplication of skills and resources. This decision was made to prevent the need for creating duplicate sets of skills and resources between agencies like the Small Business Administration and FEMA. The proposal to transfer the disaster loan function to FEMA would require maintaining separate staffs of loan officers and portfolio managers, potentially leading to duplication of administrative functions and benefits. Congress may need to consider issuing small business disaster grants through either FEMA or SBA to avoid redundancy in skills and resources. The curr_chunk discusses the potential for duplication of benefits in disaster assistance, particularly with businesses receiving loans and grants. Section 312 of the Stafford Act mandates that disaster assistance must be distinct and not duplicative. The curr_chunk discusses how FEMA and SBA use a computer matching agreement to prevent duplication of disaster assistance benefits. Federal agencies are responsible for identifying and rectifying instances of duplicative assistance, with recipients required to repay any duplicated aid. However, some cases of duplication may go unnoticed or take a long time to be identified and recovered. The curr_chunk discusses the potential challenges faced by disaster victims who may have to repay duplicative assistance, which could be a financial and emotional burden. Congress may need to conduct investigations to determine the best authorization statute for a small business disaster grant program. FEMA would likely have sole responsibility for such a program. FEMA may be solely responsible for administering a small business disaster grant program under the Stafford Act. This could streamline operations, reduce duplication with SBA, and utilize the existing Disaster Relief Fund for funding. Congress may need to make statutory changes for SBA's disaster loan account. If a small business disaster grant program is authorized under the Small Business Act, SBA would likely administer it. Congress may need to make statutory changes or authorize a new account for SBA to receive appropriations for disaster grants. This could leverage SBA's existing framework for evaluating business disaster needs and loan eligibility. Congress could consider allowing SBA to draw funds from FEMA's DRF for small business disaster grants, despite potential funding challenges. Declarations under the Stafford Act or SBA trigger federal assistance, with designations influencing the types of aid available for small business disaster grants. If the current declaration framework were applied to a small business disaster grant program, fewer businesses may be eligible for grant assistance under the Stafford Act compared to the Small Business Act. The Stafford Act authorizes major disaster declarations that provide federal assistance in response to incidents, with designations determining available FEMA grants. The designation under the Stafford Act determines available FEMA grants for incidents, including Public Assistance, Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, and Individual Assistance. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate has the authority to designate the types of assistance based on severity and magnitude of the damage. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate may authorize various types of federal assistance requested by the governor based on severity and magnitude of the disaster. FEMA uses factors to evaluate requests for major disaster declarations, which can include Individual Assistance (IA), Public Assistance (PA), and Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) designations. In some cases, only IA and HMGP are designated, while more commonly PA and HMGP are designated. The Stafford Act declarations trigger the SBA Disaster Loan Program, with different loan types available based on the designation. Private businesses may only be eligible for disaster grants under a major disaster declaration with an IA designation, while private nonprofit organizations are eligible for loans under a PA-only declaration. Some may argue that the existing declaration and designation framework should be applied to a small business disaster grant program to ensure eligibility and relevance. A small business disaster grant program could align with the existing declaration and IA designation framework used for the SBA Disaster Loan Program to ensure eligibility and reduce administrative confusion. The SBA Disaster Loan Program could be aligned with a potential small business disaster grant program to streamline administrative processes and reduce costs. Congress could consider a \"business designation\" to determine eligibility for grants or loans based on specific criteria tailored to small businesses. This could potentially provide disaster grants to small businesses through SBA declarations instead of Stafford Act declarations. The SBA Administrator has authority to make physical disaster declarations and Economic Injury Disaster Loan declarations. These declarations could provide assistance to small businesses in the event of a disaster. The criteria for issuing a physical disaster declaration is based on uninsured losses of at least 40% in a county or smaller political subdivision. The SBA Administrator can issue physical disaster declarations for uninsured losses of 40% or more in a county or smaller political subdivision. This allows eligible homeowners, renters, businesses, and nonprofit organizations to access SBA disaster loans. Additionally, the Administrator can make an EIDL declaration based on substantial economic injury to at least five small businesses due to a disaster. The SBA Administrator can issue EIDL declarations for natural disasters or fishery resource disasters. EIDL assistance helps businesses with financial obligations and operating expenses to alleviate economic injury. Loan proceeds are for working capital to resume normal operations for businesses that suffered economic loss, not direct damages. During 2008 to 2017, 2,869 declarations were issued under the Stafford Act and the Small Business Act. Of these, 791 declarations were issued under the Stafford Act, with 194 including IA and PA assistance, and 597 being PA-only. During the period from 2008 to 2017, a total of 2,078 declarations were issued under the Small Business Act, with various types of declarations including SBA physical disaster declarations, EIDL declarations, and declarations based on natural disasters determined by the Secretary of Agriculture. No declarations were issued for fishery resource disasters or commercial fishery failures. If a small business disaster grant program is only triggered by Stafford Act declarations designating IA and PA, then roughly 6.8% of the declarations issued would qualify for disaster grants. If the small business disaster grant program is triggered by SBA Administrator issuing a physical disaster declaration, roughly 17% of the declarations would have made disaster grants available to small businesses. This could potentially make more incidents eligible for grant assistance compared to incidents that did not meet the per capita threshold. The small business disaster grant program could benefit from making grants available through either an SBA Administrator physical declaration or an EIDL declaration. This could potentially make more incidents eligible for grant assistance, with 2,078 declarations during the time period potentially making the grants available. Policymakers could consider applying the existing declaration framework under combined authorities to maximize the number of businesses benefiting from small business disaster grants. By applying the existing declaration framework under combined authorities, small business disaster grants could be made available for physical damages or economic loss, similar to SBA disaster loans. This would expand eligibility for grants in various declarations, except for PA-only Stafford Act declarations. Some may prefer Stafford Act declarations over SBA declarations due to cost implications. The thresholds for SBA declarations are lower, typically based on a certain number of homes or businesses sustaining uninsured losses. The Small Business Administration (SBA) provides disaster loans for incidents with lower thresholds of damage, such as at least 25 homes or businesses sustaining uninsured losses of 40% or more in a specific area. This is in contrast to FEMA's higher thresholds for major disaster declarations. The per capita threshold for public infrastructure damages to qualify for major disaster assistance is $1.43. Applying this threshold to a small business disaster grant program could ensure grants are only given in significant cases. A small business disaster grant program could be more effective if aligned with SBA declaration thresholds and administered by FEMA to ensure grants are only provided in cases of large-scale disasters. Policymakers should consider using criteria similar to FEMA's per capita threshold for major disaster declarations to issue grants. The small business disaster grant program proposed by H.R. 6641 could be administered by FEMA or SBA depending on the declarations used. Congress may need to consider specific damage types and economic loss amounts eligible for grant assistance. Grants could potentially cover economic loss and mitigation measures in addition to structural damages. The SBA EIDL program provides up to $2 million in loans to help businesses meet financial obligations and operating expenses during disasters. Loan amounts are based on economic injury and can be used for working capital. There are differing opinions on whether small business disaster grants should be limited to repairing structural damages or also cover economic losses. H.R. 3930 authorized grants for business interruption, overhead costs, employee wages, rebuilding, and repairs. If Congress authorizes a small business disaster grant program, it may need to decide whether the grants should cover economic loss or be limited to specific types of damage. Businesses with an SBA physical disaster loan can use a portion of the loan amount for mitigation measures to prevent future losses. Congress could limit the use of disaster grants for mitigation purposes to a percentage of the total grant amount or allow the entire grant to be used for such measures. If Congress decides to allow disaster grants for mitigation, they could model it after the Pre-Disaster Mitigation pilot program for small businesses. This program allowed low-interest loans for mitigation measures to protect businesses from future disaster-related damage. Congress may also consider business size as a criterion for receiving small business disaster grants to target assistance effectively. The SBA uses industry-specific size standards or a combination of net worth and net income to determine small business eligibility for grants. The Small Business Investment Company program sets a maximum net worth and income threshold. Subsidiaries, parent companies, and affiliates are included in size standard calculations. Firms must meet industry-specific size standards for contracting purposes. The SBA classifies about 97% of employer firms as small based on industry-specific size standards. Size standards vary by industry and can be based on average annual receipts, number of employees, asset size, or a combination for refineries. Congress may consider limiting disaster grant assistance to small businesses with fewer vulnerable employees. The SBA may limit disaster grant assistance to small businesses with fewer employees, such as \"mom and pop shops.\" H.R. 6641 proposed grants for businesses with 25 or fewer employees. Data from FY2013 to FY2017 suggests that if grants were limited to businesses with 10 or fewer employees, around 10,000 businesses could be eligible over a five-year period. Small businesses could be eligible for disaster grants if they have 25 or fewer employees. Congress may consider verifying employee data for SBA applications to prevent delays in grant receipt. H.R. 6641 proposed capping grants at $35,000 based on FEMA assistance limits. Cost estimates were provided for businesses with 25 or fewer employees applying for disaster loans from FY2013 to FY2017. If disaster grants for small businesses were capped at different amounts such as $35,000, $25,000, or $10,000, the total grant amounts would vary. Congress could consider capping grant amounts based on the Stafford Act and evaluating business recovery costs. A pilot program could be created to assess effectiveness and costs before making the program permanent. A Pre-Disaster Mitigation pilot program administered by SBA during fiscal years 2000-2004 authorized low-interest fixed-rate loans up to $50,000/year for small businesses to implement mitigation measures. Congress could consider a pilot program providing disaster grants to small businesses as a cautious approach. This would allow for evaluation of cost-effectiveness before deciding on permanent implementation. Congress could explore alternative methods for helping small businesses recover from a disaster, such as loan forgiveness, decreased disaster loan interest rates, and providing assistance for continuity and disaster response plans. Loan forgiveness has been used in the past, like after Hurricane Betsy in 1965 when President Lyndon B. Johnson authorized it for businesses in Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi. Congress could consider various options to assist small businesses in recovering from disasters, such as loan forgiveness, reduced interest rates, and support for continuity and disaster response plans. For loans exceeding $500, borrowers have the option to cancel up to $1,800 of the loan or waive interest payments up to $1,800 over three years. Additionally, Congress may provide loans to private schools without requiring financial assistance from other sources and can defer interest and principal payments for the first three years. Interest rate ceilings for business physical disaster loans are set at 8% per annum or 4% per annum if credit is unavailable elsewhere, while the interest rate ceiling for EIDL is 4% per annum. Providing relief to businesses through reduced interest rates or loan forgiveness instead of grants offers flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and reduces duplication of benefits. However, this approach may not provide timely assistance and could be applied arbitrarily. Research indicates that many businesses lack contingency or disaster recovery plans. A survey of CPA firms in Staten Island found that only 7% had a formal plan before Hurricane Sandy, with 42% admitting they never tested it. Over half of the firms had no plan, citing reasons such as unnecessary or time-consuming. Congress could incentivize businesses to develop plans through new programs. Congress could explore developing new programs or utilizing existing ones like FEMA's Ready Business Program to assist businesses in creating contingency and disaster recovery plans. This could involve investigating collaboration between the Ready Business Program and SBA's efforts, as well as considering the pros and cons of providing grants to businesses for disaster preparedness. Providing grants for mitigation could be more costly than mitigation loans but less expensive than a small business disaster grant program. Advocates argue that offering grants for mitigation incentivizes businesses to plan ahead. Advocates argue that providing grants for mitigation incentivizes businesses to plan ahead for disasters, potentially reducing future costs. Congress has historically focused on low-interest loans for disaster assistance to businesses, but there is debate on whether grant assistance should also be considered. Changing the federal government's disaster policy towards businesses would require careful decision-making to avoid duplication of grants and loans. Congress would need to determine the circumstances for implementing a grant program for small businesses, including eligibility requirements and types of businesses eligible. They may also consider using grants for rebuilding, mitigation, or economic loss. Cost implications would need to be investigated. Advocates of no change argue that federal disaster assistance should be supplemental, with private insurance and low-interest loans as primary means of recovery. Access to low-interest loans should remain the primary means of helping small businesses recover after a disaster. FEMA considers estimated cost of assistance as a key factor in evaluating requests for Public Assistance (PA). Two thresholds are used by FEMA to determine eligibility for PA: $1 million in public infrastructure damages and a per capita impact indicator based on the state's population. FEMA recommends a major disaster declaration for Public Assistance (PA) if public infrastructure damages exceed $1 million and meet or exceed $1.43 per capita. The per capita threshold is used to ensure that tax revenues can support a state's disaster response capacity. FEMA also considers impacts to localities and designates specific counties for PA and Individual Assistance (IA) under the Stafford Act. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate has the authority to designate affected areas eligible for federal assistance. The Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate designates areas eligible for federal assistance under the Stafford Act based on a per capita impact indicator. FEMA considers insurance coverage in determining Public Assistance (PA) funding eligibility. FEMA encourages hazard mitigation efforts by considering previous measures that may have decreased damages and costs following an incident. States can prove mitigation efforts through cost-benefit analyses, which FEMA will consider favorably in its recommendation to the President. FEMA may also consider if mitigation work has been financed with previous disaster assistance funding. FEMA considers various factors when recommending Public Assistance (PA) for major disasters, including the impact of recent multiple disasters, availability of other federal assistance programs, and previous mitigation efforts. For example, if a state has responded to multiple disasters in the past year, FEMA may be more inclined to recommend PA. Additionally, FEMA evaluates if other federal programs, such as the Emergency Relief Program of the Federal Highway Administration, are better suited to address specific types of damage. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has a Relief Program for disasters, while other federal programs like the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Health and Human Services (HHS) can also provide assistance. FEMA considers concentrated damages as a greater need for federal assistance compared to widespread damages. The dispersion of damage in rural incidents can make assessing individual and household needs challenging. Congress has addressed the difficulties in providing assistance for rural incidents. FEMA regulations identify three conditions indicating high community trauma: large numbers of injuries and deaths, disruption of community functions, and emergency needs like power or water loss. FEMA considers trauma from injuries and loss of life, disruption of community functions, and emergency needs like power or water loss when evaluating requests for Individual Assistance (IA). Special populations' unique needs are also taken into account. Discretionary judgments play a significant role in assessing IA needs for large-scale disruptions. FEMA considers special populations like low-income, elderly, and tribal groups when evaluating Individual Assistance (IA) requests. Voluntary agency assistance and insurance coverage for private residences are also important factors in determining IA eligibility. FEMA considers insurance coverage for IA eligibility, deducting losses covered by insurance. Homeowner insurance penetration is determined using census data. NFIP administers flood insurance in flood-prone areas. FEMA compares IA cost estimates to average amounts by state. The FEMA compares IA cost estimates to average amounts by state, based on data from 1994 to 1999. Some question the relevance of these averages as they have not been updated since 1999 and are based on 1990 census data."
