    "content": "The Energy Reliability Act of 2018, also known as the \"Coal-Powered Electric Generation Unit Credit,\" introduces a federal tax credit for coal-powered electric generation units under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Energy Reliability Act of 2018 introduces a federal tax credit for coal-powered electric generation units. The credit is equal to 30% of qualified expenses or $13 multiplied by the unit's capacity rating, whichever is lower. A coal-powered electric generation unit must use coal for at least 75% of electricity production and have emissions controls installed. The Environmental Protection Agency has issued several final rules related to reducing interstate transport of fine particulate matter and ozone, including the Clean Air Interstate Rule, the Cross State Air Pollution Rule, and National Emission Standards. The Environmental Protection Agency has issued final rules such as the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards Rule and the Regional Haze regulations to regulate emissions from coal- and oil-fired electric utility steam generating units. The text discusses regulations such as the Regional Haze regulations and outlines qualified expenses for coal-powered electric generation units. It also mentions the transfer of credits to eligible project partners. The taxpayer can transfer a credit to an eligible project partner who can then claim the credit for the taxable year by attaching a statement to their tax return. Eligible project partner refers to individuals involved in operating, maintaining, repairing, providing materials, financing, or leasing a coal-powered electric generation unit. Partnerships can also qualify as eligible project partners for tax credits. The tax credit for coal-powered electric generation units applies to eligible project partners, including partnerships. The credit must be taken in the first taxable year after the taxpayer's determination. The basis of the property is reduced by the amount of the credit allowed. This section is effective for taxable years between January 1, 2018, and December 31, 2022. Beginning after December 31, 2017, and ending before January 1, 2023, coal-powered electric generation units can claim a credit under section 45T of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will assess the reliability and resilience attributes of these units by April 1, 2023, and report the results to Congressional committees by June 1, 2023. The curr_chunk provides definitions for \"applicable reliability coordinator\" and \"relevant congressional committees\" in relation to the credit under section 45T of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The curr_chunk defines \"relevant Congressional committees\" as specific committees in the Senate and House of Representatives. It also includes a conforming amendment and a change to the general business credit under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The curr_chunk amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 by adding a new paragraph related to coal-powered electric generation unit credit and allows the credit against alternative minimum tax. Additionally, a clerical amendment is made to the table of sections. The curr_chunk introduces a new section, Sec. 45T, regarding the coal-powered electric generation unit credit."
