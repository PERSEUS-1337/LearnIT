The effective date for these amendments is for plan years beginning on or after January 1 of the calendar year following the enactment of the Act.

This includes redesignating clauses and introducing criteria for accountants to meet for such engagements.

Amends ERISA to include direct reporting of certain events. Sec. 111 of ERISA requires plan administrators to notify the Secretary and the accountant within 5 business days of suspecting an irregularity in the employee benefit plan. Accountants engaged by administrators must also report irregularities within the same timeframe. Within 5 business days of suspecting an irregularity in the employee benefit plan, the accountant must notify the plan administrator in writing or the Secretary if the irregularity involves a senior official. If the plan administrator fails to notify, the accountant must report the irregularity. The accountant must notify the plan administrator of any irregularity within 5 business days. If the administrator fails to notify the Secretary within the specified period, the accountant must report the irregularity directly to the Secretary. An irregularity includes theft, embezzlement, or violations of specific laws. The curr_chunk discusses various criminal violations related to theft, extortion, bribery, kickbacks, and intentional misstatements in financial documents. The curr_chunk discusses the notification requirement upon termination of an accountant's engagement for auditing services with respect to an employee benefit plan. The plan administrator must notify the Secretary in writing within 5 business days, providing reasons for the termination and furnishing the accountant with a copy of the notification. The accountant must notify the Secretary in writing within 10 business days if they disagree with the reasons for termination of their engagement for auditing services. The determination of the required notification periods is based on the day the act or omission begins. The accountant must notify the Secretary in writing within 10 business days if they disagree with the reasons for termination of their engagement for auditing services. The notification period excludes the day the act or omission begins, Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays. Legal holidays include Federal holidays and any other day designated as a holiday by the President, Congress, or the State where the notification is made. Accountants are immune from liability for good faith notifications made under this Act. The Secretary may assess a civil penalty of up to $100,000 against administrators and accountants who fail to provide required notifications under section 111 of the Act. Additionally, there are clerical amendments to sections of the Act, such as changing \"111\" to \"112\" in section 514(d). The table of contents in section 1 of the Act is amended by changing \"111\" to \"112\". Sec. 111 and Sec. 112 of the Act address the direct reporting of certain events and the repeal and effective date. The amendments made by this section will apply to any irregularity only if the 5-day-period commences after the date of the enactment of this Act."
