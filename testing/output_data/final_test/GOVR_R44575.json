    "content": "Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, was chosen to host the 2016 Olympics, the first time a South American city will host the Games. The city has experience hosting major international events like the Pan-American Games and FIFA World Cup. The Olympics will take place from August 5-21, 2016, with 10,500 athletes from 206 countries participating in 42 sports. Most events will be held in 4 main regions in Rio de Janeiro. The 2016 Rio Games will feature a team of refugees from countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, South Sudan, and Syria. The Refugee Olympic Team (ROT) consists of 10 members selected from 43 athletes, who will receive support from the IOC in terms of uniforms, housing, and technical assistance. The ROT will use the Olympic flag and anthem for official representations. The Olympic anthem will be used for official representations involving ROT at the 2016 Rio Games. Concerns for the event include the Zika virus, public safety threats, security concerns, and environmental conditions. Hosting the Olympics in Brazil also raises issues of doping and other implications. Each candidate city had to address various themes in their bid, but the outbreak of the Zika virus in 2016 was unforeseen. The U.S. Olympic Committee (USOC) has established an Infectious Disease Advisory Group to assist in managing infectious diseases for the 2016 Games. They are providing athletes with mosquito netting, bug repellent, and information on infectious disease management. The Rio 2016 Organising Committee for the Olympic Games highlighted existing health care resources in their candidature file, but shortages of workers and supplies may affect medical services. Public safety concerns include criminal activity in Rio de Janeiro, with recent incidents of theft and robberies. The State Department warns travelers of high crime rates in the city. High crime rates in Rio de Janeiro pose a threat to tourists, with armed robberies being a common occurrence. Security concerns have been raised due to recent terrorist attacks globally, prompting Brazil to revise its security plans for the Olympics. Despite reassurances from USOC officials, there are still concerns about the safety of athletes and spectators. The late awarding of a contract for security screeners has also raised questions about the preparedness for the event. The contract for security screeners at the Olympics was awarded to a small outsourcing firm on July 1, 2016. Hosting the Olympics in Brazil has implications beyond the events, with infrastructure problems in the Olympic Village and the country facing political and economic issues. Hosting the Olympics in Brazil may have positive impacts on the country's prestige and infrastructure, but there are concerns about financial implications and existing issues that could be exacerbated. The water quality in Rio for open water events like sailing and rowing is a concern, despite efforts to improve it. Precautions, such as wearing anti-microbial suits, have been taken by the U.S. rowing team due to high levels of bacterial and viral contaminants. In the year leading up to the Rio Games, revelations about Russia's national governing body for track and field exposed an orchestrated doping scheme. Despite international organizations denouncing the practices and sanctioning individuals involved, questions remain about other Russian Olympic athletes. In late 2015, Brazil saw a spike in infants born with... In late 2015, health officials in Brazil noticed a rise in infants born with microcephaly, linked to prenatal Zika virus infection. Over 1,600 cases of Zika-related microcephaly and other congenital malformations were reported between October 2015 and July 2016. Zika is transmitted through mosquito bites, sexual contact, or blood transfusion. No vaccine or specific treatment is available, with potential serious neurologic disorders and fetal abnormalities in infected pregnant women. Some experts have raised concerns about the potential spread of the Zika virus during the Olympic Games in Brazil. Despite reassurances from officials about fumigation and the dry winter season, 150 health experts urged the WHO to consider postponing or relocating the Games due to uncertainties about Zika's impact. The WHO reaffirmed its support for the Olympic Games in 2016 despite concerns about the Zika virus. Researchers found that the contribution of the Olympics to the spread of Zika was negligible, except for a few countries. The CDC advises travelers to Brazil to take precautions against Zika virus, including pregnant women avoiding travel. The USOC provides delegation members with necessary supplies like repellent spray and condoms. The USOC provides athletes with supplies like repellent spray, protective clothing, and condoms to adhere to CDC guidelines for preventing Zika infection. Some athletes, mostly men, have opted out of the 2016 Games due to concerns about Zika, including risks to their health and future childbearing. Public health officials are focused on protecting pregnant women from Zika, as research shows the virus can persist in semen even after recovery. The CDC has specific recommendations for travel to Zika-affected areas to protect women from sexual transmission of Zika. Olympic and Paralympic athletes, delegation members, families, and spectators are advised to consider the risk of transmitting infection to pregnant women. Brazil offers free healthcare for citizens and visitors, with services provided through a network of Games hospitals and health facilities. Brazil has established Games-specific health services for the Olympics, including designated hospitals, on-site medical teams, and a network of medical stations. Rio has 27 hospitals near the Olympic Village with nearly 5,000 beds, and each host city has its own hospital. Nine hospitals may be designated as Olympic Reference Hospitals. Rio also has emergency services supported by the GSE, SAMU, and 1,500 healthcare professionals. Long waiting times, health worker shortages, and deficits of key health commodities are a concern in public health facilities in Brazil. More Brazilians are buying private health insurance to supplement public care. Visitors can get travel insurance or temporary private health insurance for local coverage. Brazil will have on-site medical teams at all Olympic venues and ambulances stationed at competition and non-competition venues. Disaster response teams are trained for various emergencies, including severe weather. Teams are trained to respond to emergencies at Games venues, including weather conditions and mass casualty situations. Despite assurances from the Brazilian Minister of Health and the International Olympic Committee, reports in January and July 2016 highlighted issues with state hospitals running out of funds for medicines and inadequate space and training for healthcare personnel. Securing venues, athletes' village, and tourist locations against terrorism during the Olympic Games is a significant undertaking. Host countries, with international support, plan extensively to ensure safety for all participants and visitors. Safety concerns also include criminal activity, which could impact the Games and the Brazilian economy. According to the State Department, crime is the main threat to visitors in Brazil. According to the State Department, crime is the main threat to visitors in Brazil, especially during events like the 2014 World Cup. Thieves targeted tourists near stadiums, on public transportation, and in gathering locations, stealing items like wallets, phones, and purses. While thefts were common, more serious crimes like sexual assault, armed robbery, and express kidnapping were also reported. Rio de Janeiro has seen improvements in security over the years, but there was a slight increase in homicides and street robberies in 2016. The U.S. State Department warns that tourists in Rio de Janeiro are vulnerable to street thefts and robberies, especially in the evening and at night near major tourist attractions. Recent increase in crime is linked to the state government's budget cuts, leading to a state of \"public calamity\" declared on June 17. Brazil's national government responded by transferring $885 million to the state government. The national government of Brazil transferred $885 million to the state government to fund security efforts for the Olympic Games. A security presence of 85,000 personnel, including 41,000 military troops, will be deployed, with 67,000 in Rio de Janeiro and 18,000 in other host cities. Security forces will patrol various areas, including airports, roadways, and tourist zones, to prevent potential acts of terrorism during the event. Concerns about terrorism increased after the 1972 Munich Olympics attack by the Palestinian Black September Organization, where 11 Israeli team members were killed. Another terrorist attack occurred during the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, resulting in two deaths and over 100 injuries. In light of previous terrorist attacks at Olympic Games, security officials are closely monitoring potential threats to the 2016 Games. Brazil's Director of Counterterrorism noted an increased threat of terrorism due to attacks in other countries and a rise in Brazilian nationals sympathizing with Islamic State militants. Brazil's Director of Counterterrorism warned of an increased threat of terrorism at the 2016 Games, with Brazilian nationals suspected of sympathizing with Islamic State militants. Recent arrests of 10 individuals planning an attack on the Games have raised concerns about security measures for the event. Brazil planned to devote approximately 85,000 professionals and invest R$750 million in security measures for the 2016 Olympic Games, including mobile police stations, command centers, and aerial monitoring equipment. The United States may provide assistance in case of significant security concerns. The United States may assist its citizens in Rio de Janeiro during the Olympic Games if they face security threats. The Department of State is required to provide threat-related services to Americans abroad, primarily through information distribution. In extreme situations, additional assistance, including advising departure, may be offered. The Consular Information Program serves as a clearinghouse of information on disasters or incidents affecting the health and safety of U.S. citizens abroad. The Department of State provides various services for U.S. citizens abroad, including Country Specific Information, Travel Alerts, and Emergency Messages. They are also responsible for evacuating citizens in dangerous situations, utilizing commercial transportation when possible, and arranging chartered transport when necessary. The Department of State typically requires citizens to make their own way to the departure point during crises. Evacuees may need to arrange their own onward travel, with U.S. military involvement as a last resort. The IOC has a two-phase procedure for awarding Olympic Games to a city, including addressing environmental concerns. The IOC has a two-phase procedure for awarding Olympic Games to a city, which includes evaluating environmental conditions, ongoing projects, and the environmental impact of staging the Games. Candidate cities must provide detailed information on environmental issues in a \"Candidature File\" during the second phase of consideration. The IOC considers environmental factors such as protected areas, public authorities' roles, construction work, and integration of environmental approaches into contracts as essential for developing a \"Green Games.\" The Organising Committee is responsible for implementing these commitments after a city is awarded the Olympic Games, working with government authorities and stakeholders to fulfill environmental policies and programs outlined in the Candidature File. The Rio de Janeiro bid committee developed an agenda for the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games focused on nine environmental issues, including water treatment, renewable energy, carbon neutrality, and waste management. The Organising Committee and IOC monitor progress to ensure fulfillment of environmental commitments. The Rio Olympics Organising Committee pledged to ensure environmental safety and sustainability for the 2016 Summer Games. They developed a Sustainability Management Plan with three strategic objectives, including reducing the environmental impact of transportation through expanding the subway system and using cleaner fuels. The Sustainability Management Plan for the 2016 Rio Olympics included actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in public transportation systems and addressed construction impacts. Waste management objectives focused on avoidance, reduction, reuse, recycling, and energy recovery techniques. In 2007, 76 out of 92 municipalities in Rio de Janeiro discarded waste in uncontrolled dumpsites, with only 1% being recycled. The 2013 Sustainability Plan and Brazilian policy \"Dumpsite Zero\" aimed to close large untreated dumpsites by 2014 and replace them with sanitary landfills. The Sustainability Management Plan also included objectives for environmental conservation and cleanup, focusing on improving water quality for Olympic water events. The plan for the Games includes outdoor water events at three locations in Rio de Janeiro, known as the Copacabana Zone, which are highly polluted with untreated sewage and waste. Concerns about water pollution potentially harming tourists and athletes have been raised due to the city's low wastewater treatment levels. The Copacabana Zone in Rio de Janeiro is highly polluted with untreated sewage and waste, posing health risks to those participating in water events. Despite some treatment facilities existing in the city, lack of collector sewers hinders effective waste transportation. Monitoring during 2007-2012 revealed high levels of pollutants in the waters, exceeding health standards. Concerns were raised about pollution, especially in Guanabara Bay where sailing events will take place. The Guanabara Bay receives various pollutants from sewage, industries, ports, and other economic activities, leading to environmental degradation and public health issues in the region. Population growth and industrial development have caused destruction of ecosystems, water surface embankment, uncontrolled land use, and problems with wastewater and solid waste management. The 2013 Sustainability Management Plan aimed to improve sanitation facilities in the Rio metropolitan area before the 2016 Olympics, with a focus on constructing sewer infrastructure citywide and treating 80% of sewage to secondary levels. Failure to address these issues could pose health risks to athletes and tourists during the games. During the seven-year Rio Olympics project, only one update was issued in September 2014, called \"Embracing Change.\" It detailed progress on sustainability strategies like carbon management, ecosystem impacts, waste management, and water quality improvements. Notably, open dumpsites in Rio were closed in 2012, with efforts to recycle 25% of waste by 2016. Progress towards water quality cleanup plans in Rio de Janeiro has been a topic of public concern. Official estimates show a decrease in the percentage of city sewage receiving treatment, dropping from 80% in 2009 to 30% in early 2016. Governor Luiz Fernando Pezao mentioned that Guanabara Bay will not be ready for the 2016 Games. Governor Luiz Fernando Pezao stated in October 2015 that Guanabara Bay will not be cleaned up until 2035. Around 1,700 athletes are expected to participate in events at the Copacabana Zone sites. Athletes witnessed large amounts of debris in the bay, including dead animals and household items. The Rio de Janeiro state government promised to implement measures like eco-barriers and eco-boats to address the pollution issue. Some athletes fell ill during training and test events in 2015 due to pollutant contamination. In 2015, athletes fell ill during training and test events, with reports of sickness but no definitive link to water contamination. The Associated Press found high levels of viruses and bacteria in Olympic sites, raising concerns about water quality standards. Brazil, WHO, and the United States do not have water quality standards for viruses in recreational waters. While some experts suggest including viral testing, most scientists believe it is not yet feasible. Rio2016\u2122 and IOC officials claim that bacterial testing shows water quality meets international standards, but there are no such standards for viral indicators. There are no international standards for viral indicators in water quality testing for the Olympics. The WHO has taken different positions on viral testing, with FINA and ISAF supporting it. Athletes have mixed responses to potential exposure to contaminated water during the Games. Some athletes are concerned about exposure to contaminated water during the Games, with sailors considering protocols like vaccinations and bleach. Others believe the issue is exaggerated, citing potential health risks in various competition locations. USOC officials allow athletes to decide on participation. Brazilian police are investigating fraud allegations at sewage treatment plants near Guanabara Bay. The ongoing probe is targeting the water and sewage utility for pollution and possible fraud. Hosting the Olympics can accelerate existing plans and urban upgrades, with Rio de Janeiro aiming to improve environmental conditions and sustainability policies. It is believed that hosting cities have an obligation to enhance their environmental conditions. The environmental legacy of Rio2016\u2122 may have positive and negative implications for Brazil, with improvements in public transportation and sewage treatment, but concerns about development pressures harming natural environments and increasing the city's population. Efforts to clean up Rio de Janeiro's waters have been disappointing due to mismanagement and corruption. Activist organizations report that environmental and sanitation goals for the 2016 Olympics will be missed, with major projects incomplete. The promise to plant 24 million trees has been abandoned, and untreated sewage discharge mitigation projects are not finished. None of the major environmental projects linked to the Olympics will be completed before the Games. The environmental legacy of the 2016 Games for Rio de Janeiro remains uncertain, with international pressure to finish projects likely to disappear after the Games start. Brazil's recognition as a global power was highlighted when it was awarded the Olympics in 2009, signaling its ambitions to the world. The Lula Administration's economic policies led to rapid growth, reducing poverty and inequality in Brazil. The country's international influence grew, securing bids for the 2016 Olympics and 2014 World Cup. However, economic and political crises have since damaged Brazil's image, with slowing growth and worsening economic conditions under President Dilma Rousseff. Brazil's economy contracted by 3.8% in 2015 and is projected to contract by 3.3% this year, leading to rising inflation, fiscal deficits, and declining consumer confidence. Unemployment has risen to 11.2%, causing some Brazilians to fall back into poverty. A corruption investigation involving public funds diversion has implicated business leaders and politicians, leading to President Rousseff's impeachment. The impeachment of President Rousseff is seen as a necessary step to address Brazil's economic and political crises. Some view it as an attempt to install a more conservative administration to protect legislators from corruption probes. The country's reputation as a successful democracy has been damaged, but the upcoming Olympics present an opportunity for Brazil to showcase its credibility on the international stage and regain lost prestige. The upcoming Olympics in Rio de Janeiro present an opportunity for Brazil to regain lost prestige on the international stage. The success or failure of the Games could have political implications for Interim President Temer and his administration, potentially affecting domestic and international perceptions of his legitimacy. Any problems that arise during the Olympics may be blamed on Temer and his political party, which controls the city and state. Investments for the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro are expected to total $11.9 billion, with funding from private resources, state, local, and national governments. Many Brazilians criticize the public expenditures on the Olympics as wasteful given the country's financial difficulties. The Temer Administration in Brazil is considering cuts to social services to reduce the budget deficit, while Rio de Janeiro state faces a financial crisis that could lead to the collapse of public services. Critics argue that the Olympics are wasteful, with reports of corruption adding to the controversy. Economic analysts believe the Games may provide a temporary boost in tax revenues for Rio but will have little impact on the broader Brazilian economy. According to Moody's Investors Service, the 2016 Olympics in Rio will bring lasting transport infrastructure improvements, potentially reducing traffic congestion and lowering business costs. However, the sustainability of these projects is uncertain, as efforts to clean up polluted waterways have been ineffective and a legacy bike path collapsed. Critics question the value of these improvements, suggesting funds could have been better spent on upgrading existing infrastructure. Human rights advocates note over 4,100 families displaced due to Olympic projects. According to a July 2016 poll, 63% of Brazilians believe the Olympics will bring more costs than benefits. Concerns about doping in the run-up to the 2016 Rio Games were raised due to revelations of a Russian doping scheme and perceived slow response from the World Anti-Doping Agency. Multiple warnings about Russia and doping over the years raised concerns about possible conflicts of interest in WADA's response. A WADA report in July 2016 confirmed state-orchestrated doping in Russian sports, including tampering with athletes' samples at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. The U.S. government supports WADA financially as a signatory to the Copenhagen Declaration on Anti-Doping in Sport. The United States has paid approximately $25 million to WADA from 2003 to 2016. The Senate and House Committees have raised concerns about Russia's involvement in a government-sanctioned doping scheme and questioned WADA's independence. The IOC and WADA have been commended for their efforts to ensure doping-free sports. The Independent Commission (IC) was formed by WADA to investigate allegations of state-sponsored doping with the All-Russia Athletics Federation (ARAF). The investigation revealed a deeply rooted culture of cheating and exploitation of athletes at all levels. The Independent Commission (IC) found widespread and longstanding levels of exploitation of athletes, leading to unethical behaviors and the systematic use of performance-enhancing drugs by many Russian athletes. The report also highlighted the involvement of doctors, coaches, and laboratory personnel in systematic cheating. The IC noted that doping problems extended beyond Russia and track and field, with other sports also facing orchestrated doping issues. The publication of the report in November 2015 prompted responses from the Council of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). The IAAF provisionally suspended the All-Russia Athletic Federation (ARAF) as an IAAF Member, prohibiting RusAF athletes from international competitions. WADA also suspended the Moscow Antidoping Center and assessed RUSADA's compliance with the World Anti-Doping Code. In June 2016, the IAAF Council reviewed RusAF's reinstatement conditions. The IAAF Taskforce's report recommended against reinstating RusAF due to unmet verification criteria. The decision was supported by the IOC and WADA, with a ban on RusAF personnel in international competitions. The Court of Arbitration for Sport upheld the ban on Russian track and field athletes after arbitration with the IAAF. Allegations of a doping scheme surfaced following WADA's release of the IC's report. Allegations of a doping scheme surfaced after WADA released the IC's report. Professor McLaren led the investigation, implicating the Moscow Anti-Doping Laboratory, the Sochi Laboratory, and Russia's Ministry of Sport in doping activities. The report uncovered a \"urine sample swapping scheme\" and the \"Disappearing Positive Methodology\" used by Russian athletes. The Moscow Anti-Doping Laboratory would review test results and issue SAVE or QUARANTINE orders. SAVE meant stopping the process for negative samples, while QUARANTINE continued processing. The Disappearing Positive Methodology was used from late 2011 to August 2015 for various athletes. The IOC imposed conditions on Russian athletes after the release of reports implicating doping activities. The IOC imposed conditions on Russian athletes for the Rio Games based on their anti-doping record, requiring reliable international tests. International federations must ensure evidence meets IOC's criteria, with sanctions for athletes who fail to comply. The Russian Olympic team for the 2016 Games will have a 30% decrease in size due to athletes not meeting the IOC's criteria. Seven Russian swimmers initially banned are now allowed to compete, with unclear reasons from FINA. The Russian paralympic team is also affected by doping revelations, with the IPC opening suspension proceedings against the Russian Paralympic Committee. The IPC opened suspension proceedings against the Russian Paralympic Committee (RPC) in late July and announced the suspension on August 7, 2016. The RPC is not allowed to enter athletes in the Rio 2016 Paralympic Games. The IOC advised IFs and NOCs to prevent doping in the 2016 Games. The Olympic Summit stated that athletes from Russia and Kenya are not presumed innocent due to non-compliance with anti-doping rules. Kenya has faced doping issues, with officials suspended and the Anti-Doping Agency declared non-compliant with the Code. Athletics Kenya solicited bribes from two Kenyan athletes to reduce their doping suspensions. Kenya's antidoping program lacks evidence of drug-free athletes, with the national agency existing in name only. WADA officials criticize Kenya's lack of political will to address doping, despite encouragement over the past two years. The IOC decided to re-test samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Games. In the re-testing of samples from the 2008 Beijing and 2012 London Games, positive results were found for 30 athletes from various sports and countries in the first round. The second round yielded 30 positive results, with 23 athletes who had won medals in Beijing testing positive. Additionally, re-analysis of samples from the 2012 London Games found positive tests for 23 athletes in the first round and 15 in the second round. In total, 1,243 samples were re-analyzed from both Games. The re-analysis of 1,243 samples from the Beijing and London Games resulted in 98 positive tests. The implications extend beyond Russian sports organizations, involving other athletes and organizations advocating for more actions to protect clean athletes worldwide. The call for expanded investigations into other countries and sports was emphasized to protect clean athletes globally. The IC's report highlighted the implausibility of Russia's doping system being limited to track and field athletes. The suspension of RusAF by the IAAF was supported by the IOC Athletes Commission and WADA Athlete Committee, but athlete confidence in the anti-doping system and sports organizations remains uncertain. The IOC's decision not to impose an outright ban on Russian athletes has received criticism from stakeholders. Efforts to protect clean athletes have been emphasized since late December 2014, with the IOC changing its philosophy on doping. The Olympic Charter now states the IOC's role is to \"protect clean athletes and the integrity of sport\" by leading the fight against doping. The IOC emphasizes protecting clean athletes from doping, match-fixing, and corruption, viewing it as an investment in the future of Olympic Sport. Steps have been taken to enhance athlete protection, including proposing independent testing and considering WADA's responsibility in the process. The IOC proposed that WADA establish an independent entity for testing and results management, including a unit for intelligence collection. They also suggested that sports organizations transfer their doping control operations to this new organization. Additionally, the IOC recommended that CAS be responsible for pronouncing doping sanctions to centralize the system and create a more harmonized anti-doping system. The IOC called for an \"Extraordinary World Conference on Doping\" in 2017."
