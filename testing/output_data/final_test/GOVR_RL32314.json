Several negotiating sessions took place in 2004 and 2005, but Thailand suspended negotiations in 2006 due to political turmoil following a new election. No decision has been made yet to resume the negotiations. The Bush Administration notified Congress in February 2004 of its intention to start free trade agreement negotiations with Thailand. The negotiations were suspended in 2006 due to political turmoil, with potential gains in commercial and foreign policy highlighted by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick. Key issues include trade in automobiles, intellectual property rights, and labor standards. The FTA could benefit U.S. agricultural producers and companies exporting industrial goods and services by reducing Thailand's tariffs and barriers. FTA offers the opportunity to increase export sales to Thailand, benefiting various sectors like information technology, telecommunications, and automotive. In 2005, U.S. exports to Thailand totaled $7.4 billion in goods and over $1 billion in services. The agreement aims to maintain preferential access for U.S. investors in Thailand and strengthen cooperation in bilateral, regional, and multilateral forums. However, due to Thailand's smaller economy compared to the U.S., the FTA's overall impact on the U.S. economy is expected to be limited. The FTA between the United States and Thailand strengthens Thailand's position as a key military ally in the war on terrorism and advances President Bush's Enterprise for ASEAN Initiative. Thailand plays a leadership role in the WTO and an FTA could encourage cooperation with the U.S. in multilateral trade negotiations. Thailand is interested in the FTA to address concerns about losing market share to countries like Mexico and China. An FTA between the United States and Thailand could increase Thai products' competitiveness in the U.S. market and attract U.S. investment. Thailand aims to modernize its economy to compete with lower-wage countries like China and Vietnam. Closer ties with the U.S. could also enhance Thailand's role in Southeast Asia. Opposition to the FTA is expected from workers and companies in import-competing industries. Opposition to trade agreements is expected from workers and companies in import-competing industries due to the adjustment costs they bear. Despite overall welfare gains, industries facing increased competition may struggle to cut costs, wages, and prices, leading to potential business closures and job losses. Stakeholders in Thailand, particularly in agriculture and services sectors, have expressed opposition to trade agreements that accelerate competition and structural changes in the economy. Thailand's banking and financial services industry is cautious about further liberalization after the 1997 financial crisis. Thai stakeholders are concerned about U.S. efforts to secure data exclusivity for patented pharmaceuticals and potential U.S. investment in newly privatized companies. Opposition in the United States may come from groups worried about labor and environmental standards in trade agreements. The debate over trade agreements enhancing social welfare in participating countries raises concerns about transparency, human rights, and market access for Thai agricultural products. Thailand opposes U.S. trade remedy laws and faces opposition to an FTA due to conflicting viewpoints on gains and losses distribution. Congressional oversight examines Thailand's economy, U.S.-Thai commercial relationship, and key negotiation issues. Thailand's economy was severely affected by the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997, leading to a sharp economic downturn. Prior to the crisis, Thailand had been one of the world's fastest-growing economies, with GDP averaging 8.6% between 1990 and 1996. The crisis resulted in a 10.5% GDP drop in 1998, along with bankruptcies, currency depreciation, and stock market declines. Congressional oversight examines the U.S.-Thai commercial relationship and key negotiation issues for a potential FTA. In 1998, Thailand's GDP fell by 10.5% due to a sharp economic downturn caused by the Asian Financial Crisis. The unemployment rate rose to 7.3% and living standards dropped by 11%. The economy was stabilized with a $17.2 billion loan from the IMF. Real GDP grew in the following years, but public dissatisfaction led to the election of a new coalition government in 2001. Thaksin Shinawatra became prime minister and implemented economic initiatives to stabilize the economy and improve rural incomes. Thailand's economy saw strong growth from 2002-2004 with an average real GDP growth of 6.2%. However, in 2005, growth slowed to 4.5% due to various factors including the 2004 tsunami, higher energy prices, inflation, bird flu concerns, and domestic issues. Global Insight forecasts a 4.6% growth in 2006 and 5.2% in 2007. Challenges include reducing corporate debt and non-performing loans. The economy heavily relies on international trade and foreign investment, with exports equal to 63% of GDP in 2005. Foreign direct investment plays a crucial role in exports, employment, and technology access. Thailand's major trading partners in 2005 were ASEAN, Japan, the European Union, the United States, and China. The United States was the second largest export market and fifth largest supplier of imports for Thailand. Major exports included machinery, electrical apparatus, and appliances, while imports consisted of mineral products, electronic parts, and crude oil. Annual FDI flows to Thailand averaged about $1.5 billion from 2002 to 2005. Analysts suggest that China may be diverting FDI away from Thailand and other East Asian countries. Thailand and the United States have strong commercial ties with preferential treatment for the US. Thailand provides preferential treatment to the United States for certain types of investment under the U.S.-Thai Treaty of Amity and Economic Relations of 1966. The United States is the second largest foreign investor in Thailand, with over $21 billion in cumulative investment through 2004. U.S.-invested firms in Thailand employ over 200,000 Thai nationals, with major sectors including petroleum, banking, electronics, and automotive. In 2005, Thailand was the 23rd largest U.S. export market and its 16th largest source of imports. U.S. exports to and imports from Thailand have been steadily increasing. Major U.S. exports to Thailand include semiconductors, computer equipment, basic chemicals, and miscellaneous manufactured products. Major U.S. imports from Thailand include computer equipment, semiconductors, communications equipment, apparel, and miscellaneous manufactured products. Thai-U.S. economic relations are deepening as Thailand reforms its economy and lowers trade barriers. Contentious issues include Thai criticism of U.S. agricultural subsidy programs and participation in WTO dispute resolution cases against the United States. The United States has urged Thailand to liberalize trade and investment regimes, improve protection of intellectual property rights, and phase out barriers in mutual trade. The U.S.-Thailand FTA negotiation covers trade in goods and services, agriculture, investment, intellectual property rights, government procurement, competition policy, and customs. This approach is favored by many Members of Congress. Thailand's high tariffs on various imports, such as autos, fabrics, and electrical appliances, are a major barrier to liberalized trade. The average applied tariff rate is around 13%, with some rates much higher, particularly on goods competing with locally produced items. For example, tariffs on passenger cars, motorcycles, and fabrics are significantly high. Improving market access for U.S. goods could be achieved by reducing these excessive tariffs. Improving market access for U.S. goods in Thailand involves reducing excessive paperwork and processing delays in customs procedures. Import licensing requirements can act as a quantitative restriction. U.S. tariffs on Thai non-agricultural exports are relatively low, but higher on textiles, apparel, and light trucks. Concerns also exist regarding U.S. trade remedy measures. The U.S. is a significant market for Thai agricultural exports, while Thailand is a major supplier of U.S. agricultural imports. Thailand is the fourth largest supplier of U.S. agricultural imports, with a bilateral farm trade value of $1.2 billion in 2002. The U.S. has a $377 million deficit in this trade. Major Thai exports to the U.S. include processed seafood, frozen shrimp, rubber, rice, tapioca, sugar, and fruits and vegetables. Thai imports from the U.S. consist of oil seeds, cotton, cereals (especially wheat), soybean oil, and cake. Agricultural trade between the two countries faces higher tariffs compared to manufactured goods, with Thailand imposing an average MFN applied tariff of about 24% on agricultural products, while the U.S. applies about 7%. Thailand imposes high tariffs on agricultural products, with over 43% of tariff lines exceeding 20%. U.S. fruit growers estimate annual losses of up to $25 million due to Thailand's high tariffs. Other potential U.S. exports that could benefit from tariff reduction include meat, dairy products, sugar, alcoholic beverages, and tobacco. Thailand seeks liberalization of U.S. sugar quotas as well. Thailand, the largest producer of sugar, aims for significant liberalization of U.S. sugar quotas to boost agricultural trade. U.S. farm groups project a potential $300 million increase in agricultural exports to Thailand annually with reduced tariffs. Concerns persist over Thailand's protection of U.S. intellectual property rights, despite some improvements noted in the USTR's 2005 report. The International Intellectual Property Rights Alliance (IIPA) estimates that IPR piracy in Thailand cost U.S. firms $175 million in 2004. U.S. stakeholders lobbied for progress on IPR enforcement before FTA negotiations. Thailand has become a major exporter of pirate discs, with concerns over transshipments of illegal IPR products. Then-U.S. Trade Representative Zoellick recognized deficiencies in Thailand's protection of intellectual property rights. In August 2005, the Thai government implemented new regulations to combat piracy by enforcing restrictions on CD production equipment sales and transfers. Services like commerce, transportation, telecommunications, and finance play a significant role in Thailand's economy, accounting for a large share of GDP and employment. Foreign investment in services, particularly in finance and retail trade, is substantial. Strengthening measures against illegal optical disc production is crucial for successful negotiations. Foreign investment in Thailand's services sector, especially in finance and retail trade, is significant. U.S. negotiating objectives aim to improve access for U.S. providers in various service sectors, including financial and telecommunications services. Negotiators are pushing for greater market access in each other's services sector, following a negative list approach used in the Singapore FTA. Exceptions to market access include sectors requiring government certification or licenses, government institutions, and public services. Thailand's financial sector has undergone deregulation and liberalization post the 1997 Asian financial crisis. Foreign firms now have increased access, with foreign ownership of up to 100% in commercial banks and finance companies for a ten-year period. However, new capital must be provided by domestic investors after this period until foreign-held equity falls to 49%. Restrictions on foreign banks' branches and expatriate professionals may also be raised in negotiations. Thailand's communications market faces limited competition and high prices. Despite commitments to open up telecommunications to foreign competition, the reform process has been slow. The market is still dominated by state-owned companies, with only a few private sector companies holding concessions for wireless and fixed-line services. Pending the establishment of a National Telecommunications Commission as an independent regulator, full liberalization of the telecommunications market in Thailand may be challenging. The United States aims to liberalize other sectors like legal, construction, architecture, engineering, and accounting. Current Thai laws pose obstacles for foreign-owned companies and nationals in these industries. The 1966 Treaty of Amity and Economic Relations between the U.S. and Thailand grants mutual ownership and operation rights, except for professional services and certain sectors like communications and banking. Initially, this treaty had limited benefits for U.S. investors due to Thailand's minimal restrictions on foreign investment. The 1966 Treaty of Amity and Economic Relations between the U.S. and Thailand initially benefited U.S. investors due to minimal restrictions on foreign investment. However, new laws limited foreign nationals' operations, leading to violations of Thailand's WTO obligations. Thailand received a ten-year exemption, which expired in 2005. FTA negotiations may aim to create a WTO-consistent bilateral investment agreement while retaining privileges for U.S. companies. This issue is a top priority for the U.S. business community, with over 1200 U.S. companies currently benefiting from the treaty. U.S. negotiators may prioritize establishing a special investor-state dispute mechanism. Thailand's plans for reforming and privatizing state-owned companies, including telecommunications, energy, and transport, have faced opposition from labor unions, causing delays in share offerings. The sixth round of FTA negotiations between the U.S. and Thailand in 2006 showed some progress but also highlighted major stumbling blocks, such as U.S. proposals on intellectual property rights. The U.S.-Thailand FTA negotiations faced obstacles including disagreements on IPR and liberalization of the services sector. Thai officials sought to reduce U.S. tariffs on light trucks and sugar import restrictions. Political opposition led to the resignation of Thailand's lead negotiator in January 2006. The negotiations were suspended in March 2006 pending the outcome of a general election. The U.S.-Thailand FTA negotiations remain suspended, making it unlikely for an agreement to be completed before the current Trade Promotion Authority statute expires. Congress is interested in the negotiations as they could increase U.S. exports and investment, but political obstacles have hindered progress. The U.S.-Thailand FTA negotiations are seen as beneficial for opening foreign markets to U.S. exports and investment. Some Members have concerns about the criteria for selecting FTA partners, but the Thailand FTA is welcomed due to its potential commercial gains, especially for U.S. agricultural producers. Congressional concerns focus on automotive trade, particularly the impact of reducing the 25% U.S. tariff on pick-up trucks on imports and U.S. jobs. Thailand is the world's second largest producer of pick-up trucks, but none are currently exported to the United States. The United Auto Workers argue that removing the 25% tariff on pick-up trucks could jeopardize 80,000 auto jobs in the United States. Senators Voinovich and Levin urged the retention of the tariff to prevent Japan from exporting trucks from Thailand to the U.S. A group of Senators also sent a similar letter to U.S. trade officials expressing concerns about the impact on jobs. S.Con.Res. 90 and H.Con.Res. 366 were introduced to ensure that negotiations regarding access to the U.S. automotive market should involve all major automobile producing countries. Some members of Congress, like Phil English, expressed concerns about Thailand's trade practices and its potential impact on a U.S.-Thai Free Trade Agreement. The U.S.-Thai FTA could impact U.S. commercial relations in Asia, amidst a trend of bilateral trade agreements in the region. China's economic influence is prompting other Asian countries to pursue FTAs, leading the U.S.-ASEAN Business Council to urge swift completion of FTA talks with Thailand and consideration of future agreements with ASEAN nations. Congressional focus on U.S. trade strategy towards ASEAN, a significant export market, is crucial."
