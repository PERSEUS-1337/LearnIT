    "content": "Congressional awareness of issues related to locally owned and operated levees is growing due to FEMA's nationwide floodplain remapping and the impending reauthorization of the National Flood Insurance Program. Owners of mortgaged structures in areas protected by levees may need to purchase flood insurance if the levees do not meet FEMA's accreditation requirements. Communities and levee owners are struggling with the costs and efforts required for accreditation, seeking assistance from Congress and various federal agencies involved in levee accreditation and assistance. FEMA plays a key role in updating Flood Insurance Rate Maps and issuing levee accreditations. Levees are structures built to prevent water from flooding land. They are found in 22% of U.S. counties, protecting almost half of the population. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers may certify data for levee accreditations. Federal funding for levee operations is limited, with owners responsible for maintenance and improvements. The U.S. population resides in areas protected by levees, with economic damage from floods ranging between $5 billion and $10 billion annually. The National Committee on Levee Safety estimates over 100,000 miles of levees exist, with the Corps operating 2,100 miles of the 15,000 it constructed. Local owners maintain the rest. The estimated investment needed for levee construction and maintenance over five years is $50 billion. Congress is considering changing the current division of levee responsibilities and costs. The debate surrounds federal funding for levee projects and potential changes to FEMA's risk assessment and accreditation timelines in light of climate change and recent floods. The report focuses on the federal role in locally operated levees, excluding federally owned and operated levees along the Mississippi River. The report discusses the role of levees in flood risk reduction in the United States, including the responsibilities of FEMA, the Corps, and NRCS. It also covers federal assistance for levees, flood fighting, repair, and rehabilitation. The debate on levee investments in federal flood mitigation programs is outlined, along with policy options for locally operated levees considered by Congress. Flood-related roles and responsibilities are distributed within a regulatory framework to allow responsible development of floodplains. Local governments shape floodplain development through land use decisions, while federal and state governments also influence flood risk management. State and local governments decide on development in flood-prone areas, with local and private entities maintaining most levees. Federal agencies operate flood control dams, provide crop insurance, support hazard mitigation, and offer disaster aid for flood recovery. Federal government constructs some levees in partnership with local sponsors responsible for maintenance. Many nonfederal levees are maintained by local project sponsors without specific federal regulations. Levees were often built over 50 years ago by local interests forming levee districts to protect land for agriculture. There are no national engineering standards for levee design or level-of-protection standards for different floodplain uses. The Flood Control Act of 1928 expanded federal involvement in flood control, emphasizing local contributions and limiting federal liability for flood damage. Prior to this, municipalities and special levee districts were responsible for flood protection in urban and rural areas. Debate ensued from 1928 to 1936 regarding the need for national planning for flood control and water resources management. The Flood Control Act of 1936 recognized the federal government's role in flood control on navigational waters, declaring it a proper activity in cooperation with states and localities. The Federal Government's role in flood risk management has evolved since the Flood Control Act of 1936, with Congress authorizing the construction of levees and dams. Today, federal actions aim to modify behavior to reduce flood vulnerability, such as through the NFIP and FEMA's hazard mitigation programs established in 1968. The National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 shifted federal policy towards flood control strategies less reliant on structural measures. The NFIP regulates development in flood-prone areas through risk assessment, mapping, insurance, and building regulations. FEMA's hazard mitigation programs fund activities to reduce flood vulnerability. FEMA's hazard mitigation programs fund activities such as elevating properties, acquiring properties for open space, retrofitting buildings, and implementing flood control systems. Federal agencies like FEMA, Corps, and NRCS play various roles in planning, construction, maintenance, and repair of levees. FEMA is responsible for flood risk assessment, mapping, and levee accreditation, while the Corps performs construction and repair with the largest federal appropriations. NRCS provides funds for levee repair through its Small Watershed Program. FEMA is responsible for flood risk assessment, mapping, flood insurance, and federal hazard mitigation. Congressional attention on locally operated levees is due to concerns about insurance expenses under the NFIP. FEMA uses FIRMs to delineate flood risk zones and insurance premiums for properties with federally backed mortgages. Questions have been raised about the accuracy of updated FIRMs and the costs associated with levee accreditation. Questions have been raised about liability in the event of levee failure, especially by engineering firms. FEMA operates flood hazard mitigation grant programs to remove flooded structures and reduce flood impacts. Policy discussions debate whether levee work should be funded by FEMA mitigation funds, as FEMA argues it would duplicate other federal programs and lacks provisions for levee liability. FEMA regulations state hazard mitigation funds cannot replace other federal funding unless there is an extraordinary threat to lives, public health, or property. FEMA officials have determined that other federal programs are more appropriate to fund levee projects due to the primary authority of the Corps or NRCS for flood control works. As a result, FEMA hazard mitigation assistance grants have not been used for levee projects in the last decade, citing program duplication as the reason. However, there have been inconsistencies in applying this standard, as HMGP funds have been used for disaster housing projects eligible for CDBG funding. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is responsible for federal construction of flood control infrastructure, including levees and floodwalls. Congress has authorized the Corps to participate in cost-shared projects, but appropriations have not kept up with authorizations, leading to a backlog of projects. There is interest in expanding the Corps' levee responsibilities, raising questions about how to prioritize federal funds given competing demands for water resources. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has limited involvement in the operation and maintenance of locally operated levees. Congress authorizes the agency to assist during emergencies to protect life and property. The Corps can repair damage at levees in the Rehabilitation and Inspection Program but lacks general authority to help with NFIP levee accreditation packages. Expanding the Corps' role in NFIP data certification and post-construction improvements of locally operated levees is being discussed as part of the policy debate on managing flood risk nationally. NRCS funds levee projects on a smaller scale than the Corps, mainly protecting agricultural areas. NRCS programs are part of the discussion regarding federal assistance for levees, with FEMA often citing these programs as a reason for denying projects under hazard mitigation programs. Liability risks for levee services may limit interest in these projects. Liability risks associated with levee services, stemming from concerns related to Paterno v. State of California, may deter public and private entities from participating in levee projects. Some engineering firms have declined to work on levees due to liability concerns, but owners have found ways to address this issue. The additional cost to cover potential liability is unknown, and federal agency liability for federally funded projects is also a factor to consider. Federal agency liability for federally funded levee projects has been addressed through congressional action, with immunity under the Federal Tort Claims Act and the Flood Control Act of 1928. Questions remain about the extent of immunity for all federal actions and agencies. FEMA's NFIP plays a significant role in federal levee policy and promotes interaction with the Corps on levee accreditation. The Flood Insurance Act established the NFIP to provide federal flood insurance in participating communities. Communities must adopt and enforce regulations to prevent new development from increasing flood risk. Property owners in SFHAs are required to purchase flood insurance for their outstanding mortgage balance. The NFIP provides federal flood insurance for properties in floodplains, with coverage up to $250,000 for single-family homes. Levees can reduce the mandatory purchase requirement for properties in floodplains. FEMA identifies flood hazards, establishes risk zones on FIRMs, and maps high-risk and low-to-moderate risk zones. FIRMs are used for land-use planning, emergency response, insurance rate calculations, and determining mandatory purchase requirements. In 2003, FEMA launched a program to update paper FIRMs to digital DFIRMs, including a nationwide flood insurance study to identify flood hazard risk in levee-impacted areas. The goals were to incorporate flood hazard information, update base flood elevation data, and upgrade FIRMs to a GIS database format as part of the Map Mod program. FEMA implemented a policy requiring verification that all levees on FIRMs meet flood protection standards. Approximately 4,800 levees have been accredited by FEMA, but the total percentage nationwide is unknown. Levee accreditation applications are reviewed at the request of the entity that owns and operates the levee. FEMA accredits levees based on regulatory requirements in Title 44 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Levee owners must provide data to show compliance with these standards. Accreditation exempts development in the area from NFIP requirements and land use restrictions. FEMA does not conduct detailed physical inspections but meets with local officials during the accreditation process. FEMA's regional office works with local officials to create a levee accreditation plan, ensuring the levee meets specific criteria such as withstanding a 1%-annual-chance flood, having proper freeboard, functioning closure devices, maintenance plans, and interior drainage systems. Accreditation does not guarantee levee performance and can be revoked if standards are not met. Owners of locally operated levees are responsible for seeking and maintaining FEMA's levee accreditation, which includes producing necessary information and making improvements to meet accreditation requirements. Data on levee owners' investments in improvements and certification for accreditation are not available, leading to concerns about costs and the accreditation process. The effectiveness of FEMA's accreditation process has not been independently assessed, making it difficult to determine potential improvements. In 2005, FEMA increased information requirements for levee accreditation, leading to challenges for owners in obtaining and paying for reaccreditation due to lack of data on construction and structural integrity. The certification of levee data by professional engineers is complicated by the absence of a national levee design standard, liability concerns for engineering firms, and proposals for immunity to address these concerns. The Corps' RIP inspections were previously accepted by FEMA for levee data certification, but since 2005, they no longer meet FEMA's requirements. The RIP inspections focus on maintenance compliance, not on evaluating a levee's protection and integrity as needed for accreditation. The Corps released new guidance in August 2010 on how NFIP levee data certifications will be conducted. The Corps released new guidance on NFIP levee data certifications, focusing on flood risk evaluation rather than levee protection levels. FEMA can provisionally accredit levees while documentation is collected, reducing time and costs for communities. Accreditation documentation is collected and reviewed for provisionally accredited levees (PALs) on DFIRMs. There are 295 PALs representing over 14% of all levees seeking FEMA accreditation since mid-2006. Communities have 24 months to show compliance with regulations, or the levee is de-accredited. As of November 2009, 687 levees were provisionally accredited but lacked compliance documentation within the required timeframe. FEMA notifies communities before de-accreditation. After the expiration of the PAL designation, FEMA notifies stakeholders of possible de-accreditation. Once the 24-month period ends, the levee system is de-accredited, and FEMA starts a mapping project. The mapping phase lasts about 18 months, with a chance for accreditation if sufficient information is provided before the updated map takes effect. Owners of de-accredited levees seek federal assistance for improvements, with the Corps being the primary agency involved in the process. The Corps is the main federal agency involved in levee study and construction, with limited assistance from NRCS for small-scale levees. FEMA has minimal involvement in levee planning. Congress authorizes the Corps to participate in cost-shared flood damage reduction projects like building levees and floodwalls. Corps involvement depends on national interest criteria and requires separate congressional authorizations for investigation and project construction. The Corps conducts initial reconnaissance and feasibility studies for flood control projects, with local sponsors sharing construction costs. The federal government typically covers 65% of construction costs, which can range from millions to billions of dollars. The Small Watershed Program authorizes NRCS to provide technical and financial assistance for small-scale levee work on private land, with project costs ranging from a few million to over a billion dollars. The program aims to prevent erosion, sedimentation, and flood damage on projects not exceeding 250,000 acres or 12,500 acre-feet of floodwater detention capacity. The Small Watershed Program authorizes NRCS to provide assistance for small-scale levee work on private land to prevent erosion, sedimentation, and flood damage. Projects are the responsibility of the local sponsor for operation, maintenance, and rehabilitation. The Corps and FEMA have programs for flood fighting, including temporary reinforcement measures for existing levees or construction of temporary levees. Congress gave the Corps emergency response authority to fight floods. The Corps was given emergency response authority to fight floods and natural disasters, including disaster preparedness, advance measures, emergency operations, rehabilitation of flood control works, protection of shore protection works, emergency dredging, and flood-related rescue operations. Funding for flood-related programs varies. FEMA may provide funding for flood-fighting activities and emergency repairs to eligible levees under the Public Assistance program when a state receives federal disaster assistance. The Public Assistance program provides funding for flood-fighting activities and emergency repairs to eligible levees. FEMA averages about $1.3 billion in PA program obligations per year, with most levee projects funded under Debris Removal and Water Control Facilities categories. The PA program does not have a funding cap under the Stafford Act, ensuring that eligible projects receive federal funding for at least 75% of the project cost. Regulations establish eligible levee projects, including emergency and permanent repairs, debris removal, flood-fighting measures, and dewatering of areas behind the levee for public safety. The Public Assistance program provides funding for flood-fighting activities and emergency repairs to eligible levees. Ineligible activities include repairing levees in certain programs, dewatering areas behind levees, repairing secondary levees, and increasing levee height. PA funds are limited to restoring structures to pre-disaster condition, not for new construction or enhancements. FEMA uses a decision tree to determine eligibility for levee projects under PA. The FEMA Administrator has discretion in determining levee project eligibility for Public Assistance (PA). Disagreements may arise between FEMA and state officials regarding restoring levees to pre-disaster conditions. Federal disaster assistance is available to restore structures to their pre-disaster state, but it could be more cost-effective to enhance flood protection during repairs. FEMA, the Corps, and NRCS offer programs for emergency levee repairs, with PA limited to restoring structures to pre-disaster conditions. The FEMA Public Assistance program covers repair and rehabilitation activities for flood control works and hurricane protection projects after a flood event. The Rehabilitation and Inspection Program by the Corps provides assistance for damaged levees, including locally constructed and federally authorized structures. Eligibility for rehabilitation assistance is based on the levee's active status at the time of damage. The Rehabilitation and Inspection Program (RIP) by the Corps covers repair and maintenance of levees for flood control and hurricane protection. Levees must meet specific criteria for eligibility and undergo regular inspections to maintain active RIP status. Over 2,000 projects with 14,000 miles of levees participate in RIP, including locally and Corps-constructed levees. The Corps issued a policy in 2009 for the temporary extension of RIP to locally operated levees with deficient conditions undergoing system-wide improvements. Repair costs are shared between the Corps and levee owners, with federal projects entirely funded by the federal government. Rehabilitation assistance is limited to restoring projects to pre-disaster levels, with no betterments allowed. Local sponsors must cover costs for damage due to deficient maintenance. Congress has used supplemental appropriations for significant RIP-funded repairs after natural disasters. The Corps tries to fund smaller RIP repairs within its existing budget, causing delays at times. RIP funds are restricted to repair only, not for improving levees. NRCS can conduct emergency levee work under the Emergency Watershed Program. Under the Emergency Watershed Program, emergency levee work can be conducted to address imminent hazards in the event of a natural disaster. Repair responsibilities for federal structures are divided between the Corps and NRCS based on watershed size. Nonfederal structures are repaired based on a 1986 agreement between the Corps and NRCS. The Emergency Watershed Program provides assistance for flood prevention in small watersheds. If damage is caused by a natural disaster other than a flood, NRCS is responsible. Levees eligible for EWP assistance must have a local sponsor and benefit multiple parties. FEMA hazard mitigation grants fund flood mitigation activities to reduce future disaster costs. Congress has allocated over $135.6 billion for FEMA disaster assistance programs since 1989. Over $8.9 billion has been allocated for hazard mitigation in the last five years through FEMA's Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) and Pre-Disaster Mitigation grant program (PDM). There is debate on using FEMA assistance for levee construction and betterment. FEMA programs cannot duplicate other federal agencies' activities or be part of a larger flood control system. Understanding the funding differences between FEMA, Corps, and NRCS programs is crucial. HMGP aims to reduce loss of life and property damage in future disasters by providing grants for long-term hazard mitigation projects after a major disaster declaration. After a major disaster declaration, hazard mitigation projects can be submitted for assistance with a maximum federal cost share of 75%. Long-term projects include elevating properties, acquiring and converting them to open space, retrofitting buildings, and constructing floodwall systems. Levee repair, maintenance, and enhancement projects may be eligible under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP). Levee projects may be eligible for funding under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP), but historically, they have not been funded unless there is an immediate risk to public safety. Failure to fund levees for FEMA accreditation could be seen as a public safety risk. Reasons for denial of levee projects include concerns about duplication of programs and the low prioritization of levees as effective flood mitigation measures. Levees are considered a last resort for flood protection according to the Association of State Floodplain Managers. Levee projects are considered a last resort for flood protection due to limited effectiveness. Funding competition may prioritize other mitigation measures like property elevation and stormwater management. Buying out properties in floodplains for open space is a more effective mitigation strategy. Property acquisition and relocation projects are funded before levee projects under the HMGP. The PDM program funds both structural and nonstructural mitigation projects before disasters occur. The PDM program funds property acquisition, relocation, and other mitigation projects with a 25% state/local cost-share requirement. This cost-share provision may make the PDM program less viable than HMGP for communities considering levee projects. Table 5 compares federal programs for locally operated levees, showing the Corps as the main partner. The Corps is the main federal partner for locally operated levees, with a lengthy process for obtaining federal construction assistance and competition for funds. There are no general federal authorities for regular operation and maintenance of levees, but multiple authorities for assistance with damaged levees based on the type of event and levee. Congress is debating changes to levee responsibilities and costs. Some stakeholders are debating whether to change the current division of levee responsibilities and costs. Options for congressional consideration include maintaining the status quo, adopting recommendations from the National Committee on Levee Safety, creating a new grant program, supplementing existing programs, or reducing the federal role in funding. There is debate over whether existing federal programs align with the appropriate role and adequately address local levee needs. The National Committee on Levee Safety recommended the creation of a National Levee Safety Commission to advise on national technical standards, risk communication, and coordination. The committee is comprised of members with expertise in levee safety from various sectors. The National Committee on Levee Safety recommended the creation of a National Levee Safety Commission to advise on technical standards, risk communication, and coordination. Legislation is needed to implement 12 of the 20 recommendations nationally. States should have primary authority for implementing a national levee safety program. The National Committee on Levee Safety recommended creating a new commission to establish a national levee safety standard. The proposed investments include a new grant program, a Levee Rehabilitation Fund, and funding for inspections, totaling $1.238 billion annually for the first five years. The draft report proposes annual funding of $1.238 billion for the first five years, with most directed towards new federal activities. Some concerns have been raised about the recommendations, including the potential for creating unfunded mandates and a new bureaucratic entity. Another option suggested is the creation of a new grant program to assist with locally operated levees. The draft report proposes annual funding of $1.238 billion for the first five years, with most directed towards new federal activities. An option suggested is the creation of a new grant program to assist with locally operated levees, addressing issues not covered by current programs. This new program would require policy decisions on eligibility criteria, funding sources, and program administration. Congress could also consider expanding existing programs like FEMA to fund levee projects. Congress may consider supplementing existing FEMA or Corps programs to provide additional funding for locally operated levee projects. The current federal role in locally operated levees should be assessed to determine if it aligns with the national interest. Local governments and states play a significant role in floodplain development decisions, and funding for these projects is limited under existing programs. A memorandum of understanding with appropriate agencies could help prevent duplication of benefits or activities. States influence floodplain development decisions in an oversight role. Local and state governments should bear the cost of flood risk to structures through levee projects. Congress may reduce federal funding for locally operated levees. The 112th Congress has shown interest in FEMA's mapping methodology for updating FIRMs. Members of Congress have introduced legislation to address issues with FIRMs updates. Efforts are being made to address challenges facing locally owned levees through legislation and reauthorization of the NFIP. H.R. 764 would prohibit FEMA from assuming existing levees do not exist when determining flood hazard designations. This raises budgetary considerations due to increased demands on federal fiscal resources. Congress, the Administration, and the public are cautious about expanding federal activities given the current fiscal climate. The bill H.R. 898 would prohibit FEMA from updating floodplain designations or flood risk zones for areas behind deficient levees, as long as certain repair criteria are met and state/local governments have implemented necessary plans. Legislation related to levee accreditation is being considered by Congress, especially in light of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) reauthorization. The focus is on addressing issues with locally operated levees obtaining FEMA accreditation and potential changes to federal assistance for these levees. Congressional action may clarify federal authorities and reduce program duplication, but consensus on policy evolution remains elusive. Two bills on levee accreditation were introduced in the 111th Congress. Senators requested a meeting to discuss levee accreditation and flood mapping processes. The Congressional Levee Caucus made levee certification its chief priority. H.R. 4935, PAL Extension, aimed to grant FEMA regional office directors authority to extend PAL for communities making a \"good faith effort\" to comply with levee accreditation requirements. The Rural Community Flood Protection Act of 2010 (S. 3109) would have authorized the Corps to perform NFIP data certification for levees with a cost-sharing split of 65% federal and 35% local, except for smaller communities and volunteer levee operators. The bill aimed to address concerns about the financial burden of certification by allowing the Corps to cover full or partial expenses. No specific level of appropriations was authorized, and average certification costs are currently unknown. The federal government would cover all costs for certifying rural levees under the NFIP, as these levees are typically run by volunteers in smaller communities. It is uncertain how many rural levees exist or if they pose the greatest risk, but the bill suggests a higher federal investment due to the perceived lower ability of these levee owners to pay for certification. S. 3285 would suspend flood map updates for counties with Corps-built flood protection structures for seven years. H.R. 3415 and S. 3051 propose suspending flood insurance rate map updates for communities with levee design deficiencies and approved repair plans. The repair plan for levees must be based on current design data and have a financing mechanism. It should ensure protection from a 100-year flood. Legislation like H.R. 1746 reauthorized the Pre-Disaster Mitigation Grant Program with increased funding. The Pre-Disaster Mitigation Grant Program (PDM) provides funding to states, with a maximum award of 15% of the fiscal year appropriation. H.R. 3377 proposed $250 million annually for three years but was not considered due to the passage of H.R. 1746. PDM funding has varied from $150 million to $50 million in different fiscal years."
