    "content": "Under the Chicago Convention of 1944, airlines operate international air services based on bilateral or multilateral agreements. Open skies agreements aim to liberalize air service agreements, allowing airlines unlimited access to each other's territories and promoting a flexible pricing regime. These agreements also cover commercial opportunities, safety, and security. The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) introduced the \"open skies\" initiative in August 1992 to liberalize international civil aviation. The initiative includes principles such as open entry on all routes, unrestricted capacity and frequency, flexible fare setting, and the ability to transfer passengers to smaller aircraft at international gateways. The open skies initiative, introduced in 1992, allows carriers to freely enter into commercial transactions related to flight operations and perform their own ground handling in foreign countries. The initiative has led to 114 open skies agreements governing international air passenger and air freight services, granting airlines the freedom to determine routes, frequencies, fares, and aircraft types based on market demand. These agreements typically involve granting various levels of the \"freedoms of the air\" and are based on principles outlined in the Chicago Convention. Aviation agreements, stemming from the Chicago Convention, affirm nations' sovereignty over airspace. The International Air Services Transit Agreement and International Air Transport Agreement, known as the \"five freedoms\" of air transport, are key in international air service negotiations. The Two Freedoms Agreement covers overflight and noncommercial landing rights, while the Five Freedoms Agreement includes transit rights and traffic rights for airlines to expand route networks. After the United States implemented domestic airline deregulation in the late 1970s, it pursued more liberal international agreements. Current U.S. law requires air carriers operating domestically to be owned by U.S. citizens. The U.S. law restricts ownership of domestic airlines to U.S. citizens, with foreign ownership limited to 25%. Foreign airlines are excluded from providing domestic services, and international aviation rights are governed by bilateral agreements. The Assistant Secretary for Aviation and International Affairs, with State Department assistance, negotiates bilateral agreements and grants U.S. airlines rights. Two debates on open skies agreements involve U.S. airlines and unions objecting to foreign carriers' use of rights. Some call for \"fair skies,\" while others accuse them of limiting competition. Major U.S. airlines and labor unions allege carriers from the Persian Gulf region. Airlines and labor unions allege that carriers from the Persian Gulf region have received subsidies that violate open skies agreements. Another case involves Norwegian Air International registering in Ireland to avoid U.S.-EU labor standards. There is also debate over U.S. Customs and Border Patrol preclearance. The presence of a U.S. Customs and Border Patrol preclearance facility at Abu Dhabi International Airport has sparked controversy among U.S. air carriers, labor unions, and Members of Congress. The facility, which benefits Etihad Airways, has raised concerns about competitive disadvantages for other airlines serving Abu Dhabi. The controversy involves state-owned airlines in the Persian Gulf region: Emirates Airline, Etihad Airways, and Qatar Airways. These carriers are among the fastest-growing in the world, with Etihad Airways experiencing rapid growth since its establishment in 2003. Emirates Airline and Qatar Airways are also major players in the international aviation industry. The three state-owned airlines in the Persian Gulf region - Emirates Airline, Etihad Airways, and Qatar Airways - have young fleets and serve about 10 U.S. cities. American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and United Airlines, along with pilot associations, accuse Qatar and the UAE of providing over $40 billion in subsidies to these carriers, distorting the global air transport market. Americans for Fair Skies also raise concerns about this issue. The three state-owned airlines in the Persian Gulf region - Emirates Airline, Etihad Airways, and Qatar Airways - are accused of receiving billions in subsidies, distorting the global air transport market. Americans for Fair Skies, led by former ALPA President Lee Moak, oppose their expansion to the United States. Emirates received $1.6-4 billion in subsidies, Etihad received $6.3 billion in capital injections and loans, and Qatar Airways benefited from fee exemptions and loans. U.S. carriers also accuse their Gulf rivals of excessive capacity growth. The Persian Gulf carriers have significantly increased their capacity on flights to the United States since 2009, prompting calls for restrictions on their access. The opponents advocate for \"fair skies\" to limit foreign carriers' operations and are seeking to renegotiate open skies agreements with Qatar and the UAE. The agreements allow for consultations to resolve disputes but do not permit unilateral changes or capacity restrictions. The European Cockpit Association and airlines like Lufthansa Group and Air France-KLM are pushing for changes to open skies agreements in Europe to address alleged unfair subsidies to Persian Gulf carriers. German and French ministers have asked the European Commission to halt granting additional traffic rights until the issue is resolved, with support from other countries like the Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, and Austria. Belgium, Sweden, and Austria support their position on alleged unfair subsidies to Persian Gulf carriers. British Airways, now owned by International Airlines Group (IAG), left the Association of European Airlines over disagreement with Air France-KLM and Lufthansa. Qatar Airways acquired nearly 10% of IAG's shares in January 2015. Air Berlin, with over a 29% stake held by Etihad, also left the association. All three Persian Gulf carriers denied the subsidy allegations individually. Qatar Airways CEO denies subsidy allegations, compares government involvement to European carriers. Persian Gulf carriers claim US airlines benefited from bankruptcy protection post-9/11. Emirates, Etihad, and Qatar Airways assert they are profitable and offer access to cities ignored by US airlines. The Persian Gulf carriers have presented their case to U.S. government officials regarding subsidies and competition with U.S. airlines. Emirates Airline requested access to materials submitted by Delta, United, and American Airlines to support their allegations. Some trade groups, tourism interests, and consumer advocates support open skies agreements, alleging that U.S. carriers benefit from government subsidies. FedEx Corp. emphasizes the importance of open skies deals with Persian Gulf countries for its cargo business. JetBlue, a U.S. passenger airline, also plays a role in the competition dynamics. Boeing and Airbus support liberalization of international aviation and oppose drastic changes to Qatar and UAE agreements. Persian Gulf carriers are emulating Singapore Airlines' hub model to connect travelers between Asia Pacific and Europe or North America from hubs in Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Doha. Persian Gulf carriers benefit from strategic hubs in Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Doha, connecting 80% of the world's population within an eight-hour flying distance. They are reshaping international aviation by diverting traffic from traditional hubs like Frankfurt, impacting market share for airlines like Lufthansa on routes between Europe and Asia. This shift also affects North American partners such as United Airlines and Air Canada. The Persian Gulf carriers are challenging established global alliances by acquiring stakes in other airlines, impacting market share for airlines like Lufthansa. They are expanding their network through investments in European airlines and partnerships with carriers like Jet Airways and Virgin Australia. This raises concerns over their role in existing network alliances. Air France-KLM. Air Berlin, in which Etihad owns a 29.21% stake, is in the Oneworld alliance with American Airlines, British Airways, and Qatar Airways. Persian Gulf carriers face challenges like limited airspace due to military control and potential staff shortages despite leading in new aircraft orders. Dubai is constructing Al Maktoum International Airport to become the world's largest passenger hub. Dubai is expanding Al Maktoum Airport to become the world's largest passenger hub, with plans to handle 120 million passengers per year and service 100 Airbus 380 jets simultaneously. Emirates is expected to relocate its hub to the new airport, while Dubai International Airport will continue to operate. Norwegian Air International's application for a foreign air carrier permit has sparked controversy. Norwegian Air Shuttle, the third-largest discount carrier in Europe, holds FAA-issued airline certificates under Norwegian license and provides nonstop services to U.S. destinations from European countries. Norwegian Air Shuttle's application for its Irish arm, Norwegian Air International, to operate transatlantic flights to the U.S. has been pending before DOT for over a year, causing controversy due to its plan to use crew members from various countries. Norwegian Air Shuttle's application for its Irish arm, Norwegian Air International, to operate transatlantic flights to the U.S. has sparked controversy over its plan to use crew members from other countries. Opponents argue that this violates the U.S.-EU open skies agreement, while supporters believe it would promote competition and lower fares. On September 2, 2014, DOT dismissed NAI's request for a temporary permit. On September 2, 2014, DOT dismissed Norwegian Air Shuttle's request for a temporary exemption to begin flights to the United States. The EU and Norwegian officials believe the delay in NAI's traffic rights breaches the U.S.-EU open skies agreement. Other low-fare European airlines are also interested in offering transatlantic service, potentially leading to similar controversies in the future. In the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015, Congress included provisions related to the NAI issue, prohibiting funds for foreign air carrier permits that violate the U.S.-EU open skies agreement. The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2015, included a provision on CBP air preclearance operations, restricting funds for new agreements after February 1, 2014. On April 30, 2015, lawmakers expressed concerns about Persian Gulf air carriers and urged consultations with UAE and Qatar governments. Congress lacks authority to alter air service agreements with these countries."
