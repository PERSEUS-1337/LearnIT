    "content": "Congress is concerned about high rates of violent crimes in Central America, particularly in the \"northern triangle\" countries. Gangs, with ties to the United States, are a significant factor in the violence, extortion, and forced recruitment that has led to internal displacement and migration to the U.S. The UNHCR has described the situation as \"refugee-like.\" Governments in the region are working to reduce violence and address the root causes of migration. Recent migration has been driven by various factors, with efforts to reduce violence and illegal emigration. Congress is considering appropriate U.S. assistance to combat gang activity in Central American countries and the impact of U.S. deportations on the gang problem. The evolving relationship between Mexican transnational criminal organizations (TCOs) and gangs is also of interest. Congress is examining government efforts in the region to address gangs without causing human rights abuses. This report discusses the gang issue in Central America, country approaches, and U.S. involvement. Experts debate the definition of gangs and their members, noting that gangs typically have a name and identity shown through symbols like clothing and graffiti. Gang members can range from 12 to 24 years old, with some older adults and forcibly recruited youth. Group criminality and displaying gang symbols are key identifiers of gang activity in the United States. In the United States, gangs display symbols and are involved in criminal activities such as graffiti, theft, robbery, drug trafficking, and murder. Central American gangs are referred to as pandillas and maras, with pandillas more prevalent in Nicaragua and maras dominant in the northern triangle. The major gangs in Central America with ties to the US are the \"18th Street\" gang (M-18) and its rival, Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13). The 18th Street gang and MS-13 are major Central American gangs with ties to the US. The 18th Street gang was formed in the 1960s in Los Angeles, accepting members from all races and recruiting from other states. MS-13 was created in the 1980s by Salvadorans in LA. Both gangs expanded to Central America and the US, with MS-13 present in 46 states and the District of Columbia. Their presence in Central America grew after the US began deporting illegal immigrants back to the region. After the passage of the Illegal Immigrant Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, gang deportees from Los Angeles brought gang culture to Central America. Gangs in the region recruit new members from vulnerable youth in poor neighborhoods and prisons, with forcible recruitment common. Estimates of gang membership in Central America vary, with State Department officials estimating 85,000 MS-13 and 18th Street gang members, while the UNODC estimated 54,000 members in the region. Gang leaders in Central America use prisons to increase discipline and cohesion among their ranks. According to UNODC, there were roughly 20,000 gang members in El Salvador; 22,000 in Guatemala; and 12,000 in Honduras, totaling 54,000 MS-13 and M-18 members in the region. El Salvador had the highest concentration of gang members, with 323 gang members for every 100,000 citizens. Nicaragua has local gangs but fewer MS-13 and M-18 members due to social networks and community policing programs. Costa Rica, Panama, and Belize also have gangs, but to a lesser extent. In recent years, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Panama have reported some MS-13 and M-18 presence in their countries, possibly due to deliberate expansion efforts by the gangs or gang members fleeing from rival gangs. Panamanian police captured MS-13 members in 2016 and deported them to El Salvador. MS-13 and M-18 have evolved from street gangs to more organized groups, with evidence suggesting coordination between cliques in different countries. Law enforcement found evidence of MS-13 leaders ordering retaliatory assassinations in the Washington, DC area and planning to unify their cliques with those in the US. Recent investigations show leaders trying to purchase firearms in Mexico and Guatemala. Some argue that the term transnational criminal organization may not accurately describe the maras, as their focus remains on local issues like extortion and drug distribution. Central American gangs are linked to high homicide rates in the region, with officials attributing many murders to gang activity. Gang-related murders in Central America occur due to discipline within gangs, territorial disputes, confrontations with law enforcement, and targeting of witnesses. The region also faces high rates of child abuse, spousal rape, femicide, and homicides of young victims. Transnational criminal organizations and violent groups are prevalent, with evidence of a decline in homicides after a gang truce in El Salvador in 2012. Gangs in Central America are responsible for a significant percentage of violence, with reductions in homicides possibly due to gang truces. Homicide rates are also high in border regions with various criminal groups active. Gang violence targets women and children, with different initiation rituals for men and women. Women are often forced into sexual acts with gang members and expected to commit crimes after joining. Female gang members are expected to commit crimes and perform household duties, tolerate infidelity, and may face violence if unfaithful. Non-gang affiliated women and girls are also at risk of violence from gangs, including murder. Gangs engage in sex trafficking, leading to youth dropping out of school. Gangs are involved in various criminal activities. Gangs are involved in a wide range of criminal activities such as extortion, money laundering, and smuggling. They extort residents, bus drivers, and business owners in major cities, often resorting to violence if payments are not made. In 2014, numerous transportation operators were assassinated in Guatemala, and in 2015, gangs in El Salvador forced a transportation strike through threats. The Honduran government seized over $1 million from the MS-13 gang in 2016, while the Salvadoran government arrested over 70 people for money laundering. In July 2016, the Salvadoran government arrested over 70 people for laundering gang money through various businesses. Central American gangs may have increased ties with organized criminal groups, but their role in drug trafficking varies by country and area. Some gangs facilitate drug shipments for payment, while MS-13 members have been hired for revenge killings by Mexican criminal organizations. The northern triangle countries have a history of conflict and repression. The northern triangle countries have long histories of armed conflict, political repression, and authoritarian rule, leading to a lack of democratic institutions and the rule of law. Protracted armed conflicts have resulted in widespread illicit firearms and a culture of violence to settle disputes. In Honduras, 80% of homicides between 2008 and 2015 involved firearms, many of which were unlicensed. Gang leaders often grew up in violent environments due to war, authoritarian rule, and emigration, leading to social fabric stress from economic factors like poverty and unemployment. The northern triangle countries face economic challenges such as poverty, inequality, and high youth unemployment rates. Poverty affects 63% of people in Honduras and 59% in Guatemala. Income disparities worsen social exclusion for ethnic minorities and gender discrimination. Lack of social mobility and high youth unemployment rates contribute to the problem. In El Salvador and Honduras, over 25% of youth aged 15-24 are neither working nor studying. High school graduation rates are low, especially among indigenous groups in Guatemala. Gangs target unemployed youth in these countries. Gangs target unemployed youth among indigenous groups, who turn to gangs for support and livelihood. Leaving gangs is difficult due to societal stigmas and lack of support. Former gang members face challenges in offender reentry, with employers often unwilling to hire them, especially tattooed deportees from the US. Some undergo tattoo removal to integrate better. Anti-gang roundups have overwhelmed prisons in Central America. Prisons in Central America are overwhelmed due to anti-gang roundups, leading to severe overcrowding, inadequate conditions, and staffing shortages. Gang members, including those not yet convicted, are filling already overpopulated facilities. Gangs operate criminal activities from behind bars, sometimes with corrupt prison officials' help, contributing to their growth and organization. Central American prisons are described as \"finishing schools\" for first-time offenders, where they often deepen their involvement in illicit gang activities instead of being rehabilitated. Policymakers in the region are concerned that U.S. deportations of individuals with criminal records are worsening gang and citizen security issues. Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador have received the highest numbers of U.S. deportees, with officials requesting complete criminal histories for deportees, including gang affiliations. Obama Administration officials claim a larger proportion of recent deportees were removed for criminal reasons, but a breakdown of criminal versus noncriminal deportations is not publicly available at a country level. The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) may provide some information on a deportee's criminal history, including gang affiliation if it's the primary reason for deportation. A Criminal History Information Sharing (CHIS) program involving Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador was expanded in 2014. Support services for deportees returning to northern triangle countries vary in size and scope. Limited resources for reintegration services and tracking deportees in Central America, with Guatemala offering the most assistance. Governments in the northern triangle have taken aggressive anti-gang approaches, leading to negative consequences. El Salvador's failed gang truce has deterred negotiations with gangs. Experts recommend a shift in government strategies. Experts recommend governments to shift towards \"second-generation\" anti-gang programs, focusing on prevention, intervention, enforcement, and reentry of rehabilitated gang members. Regional cooperation among security and defense ministers and prosecutors from the northern triangle countries is increasing to prosecute gangs. The three presidents have signed an agreement to create a regional task force to address gangs, facilitating intelligence sharing and extraditions. Mano d'ura refers to the initial anti-gang policies in El Salvador and Honduras. Mano dura approaches in El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala involved incarcerating youth for gang-related crimes, with increased penalties. El Salvador's 2003 law was deemed unconstitutional, leading to stricter anti-gang reforms in 2004. Honduras also implemented harsh penalties for gang membership in 2003. The Mano dura reforms in Central America led to harsh penalties for gang membership, including up to 12 years in prison. Joint military and police patrols were used to arrest gang suspects. Despite objections from human rights groups, the tough anti-gang measures were initially supported by the public and media, resulting in the arrest of thousands of suspected gang members. In 2005, Salvadoran officials reported that gang detainees provided intelligence information, but long-term reduction of gangs and crime was not sustained. Many youth arrested under harsh anti-gang policies were released due to lack of evidence, leading some to join gangs in prison. Gang roundups caused prison overcrowding and intergang violence, with reports of extrajudicial youth killings by vigilante groups. Gangs adapted their behavior to avoid detection in response to the crackdown. President Mauricio Funes shifted focus towards crime prevention but faced frustration as crime rates remained high. Minister of Defense David Mungu\u00eda Pay\u00e9s, with backing, brokered a secret truce between MS-13 and 18th Street gangs by transferring leaders to less secure prisons. Homicide rates significantly declined until Mungu\u00eda Pay\u00e9s was removed from his post in May 2013. The Salvadoran government reported a significant decline in homicide rates after gang leaders pledged to stop recruiting children and perpetrating violence against women. They also offered to negotiate and turned in some weapons. The success of the truce led Honduras to consider a similar initiative, but skepticism arose as disappearances increased, and gangs continued illicit activities in prisons. El Salvador's attorney general is investigating officials for allegedly providing funds to gang leaders. The truce in El Salvador, which saw a decline in homicide rates initially, unraveled after the government withdrew support for mediators. Average murder rates rose, gang attacks on police increased, and by 2015, El Salvador had the world's highest homicide rate. Church leaders support dialogue with gangs, but the government opposes negotiations. Gang-police confrontations escalated after gang leaders involved in the truce were returned to maximum-security prisons. The attorney general is investigating police involvement in extrajudicial killings. The Salvadoran government is investigating police involvement in extrajudicial killings during a massacre in March 2015. El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras have deployed military troops to assist their police forces in maintaining public security. Honduran President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez ordered intensive patrols in high-crime neighborhoods with the military and police. Two hybrid forces, including the military police force (PMOP), were established by Hern\u00e1ndez while he was head of the Honduran Congress. The Salvadoran government created battalions to assist police in anti-gang efforts, with military involvement in public security efforts. Guatemalan President Morales extended the mandate of soldiers for domestic security, raising human rights concerns. Deploying the military for public security can be popular but raises issues in Latin America. In Latin America, deploying the military for public security is popular but often leads to human rights violations and fails to improve security conditions sustainably. Reports show security forces' involvement in unlawful killings in El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala. Other Central American countries have implemented programs to address gang issues, like Panama's Barrios Seguros initiative by President Juan Carlos Varela in 2014. Juan Carlos Varela initiated Barrios Seguros in 2014 to offer gang members amnesty and job training to reduce gang violence. Nicaragua has a national youth crime prevention strategy involving police efforts and community interventions. The Nicaraguan National Police's Juvenile Affairs Division conducts anti-gang activities with support from other countries and NGOs. The Ministry of the Interior administers a program targeting at-risk youth in 11 municipalities with support from the Inter-American Development Bank. Central American leaders, including those from the northern triangle countries, are involved in similar initiatives. Central American leaders, including those from the northern triangle countries, have shifted towards more comprehensive anti-gang approaches, creating institutional bodies and police units for prevention efforts. Despite this, government-sponsored gang prevention programs in the northern triangle are small scale, ad hoc, and underfunded. Only 6% of funds from Honduras' security tax were allocated to prevention programs. El Salvador faces similar challenges in funding prevention efforts. Between 2012 and July 2016, only 6% of funds were allocated to prevention programs in El Salvador. The government's security plan, El Salvador Seguro, prioritizes prevention but lacks funding for implementation. Legislative approval for loans is needed, but Congress is hesitant unless the focus is on military and police support. Rehabilitation programs for gang members are mainly funded by church groups or NGOs due to resource constraints and reluctance to work with gangs. Pilot projects based on experiences in other countries have shown some success in Honduras with individual and family therapy for youth. In the mid-2000s, U.S. officials and Members of Congress expressed concerns about gangs and violence in Central America. Projects in Honduras have focused on therapy for at-risk youth, intervention to prevent violence, and rehabilitation for gang members and nonviolent offenders in prisons. The failed truce in El Salvador and escalating gang violence have refocused attention on gangs in Central America. Since 2014, there has been a renewed focus on gangs in Central America, with Congress expressing concern about transnational gangs and the effectiveness of U.S. anti-gang efforts. Funding of roughly $38 million was allocated between FY2008 and FY2013 for anti-gang programs in the region, with oversight conducted on the efficacy of these programs. Members of Congress are also interested in the impact of U.S. deportation policies and mano dura approaches on Central American gangs. Since FY2013, $10 million in CARSI funding has continued specific anti-gang initiatives in Central America. U.S. agencies have been involved in law enforcement and prevention efforts against Central American gangs for over a decade, including creating an MS-13 Task Force in 2004. In 2005, ICE created \"Operation Community Shield\" to combat gangs, while USAID assessed the gang problem in Central America and Mexico. A U.S. Strategy to Combat Criminal Gangs from Central America and Mexico was developed in 2007, emphasizing holistic and regional anti-gang efforts. The U.S. government's anti-gang strategy in Central America involved holistic, regional efforts in diplomacy, repatriation, law enforcement, capacity enhancement, and prevention. A regional gang adviser was sent to El Salvador in 2008 to coordinate programs including training for law enforcement officials and regional coordination efforts. In 2010, the Government Accountability Office reported on the implementation of the interagency anti-gang strategy. The U.S. government has expanded its citizen-security and law-enforcement programs in Central America through CARSI, a regional security initiative with a budget of $1.5 billion from FY2008 to FY2016. CARSI aims to create safe streets, disrupt criminal activities, support accountable governments, enhance security, and promote the rule of law. The interagency anti-gang strategy is recommended to improve coordination and performance measures. The Woodrow Wilson Center for International Scholars published a critical assessment of CARSI in 2015, highlighting concerns about the lack of a comprehensive strategy for improving citizen security, focus on combating drug trafficking over broader law-enforcement reform, and weak program evaluation. The State Department's Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs manages CARSI funding, with the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs implementing most programs, including trainings and technical exchanges for police, prison officers, and justice-sector operators in the region. INL has provided training, equipment, and support to justice-sector operators in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. They have trained police officers and conducted investigations targeting MS-13 leadership. INL is also supporting gang-related research, including a study on gang members leaving gangs safely. WHA has transferred resources to various agencies for this purpose. State Department funding, along with support from Justice, DHS, and USAID, is being used to counter the impact of gangs in the region. USAID implements gang-prevention programs, including rehabilitating public spaces and improving security measures. National-level security and justice-sector reform efforts aim to strengthen institutions and improve victims assistance and juvenile justice. USAID implements programs to improve victims assistance, juvenile justice, and respect for human rights. They use geographic and demographic risk factors to provide interventions to high-risk individuals and communities. Over 200 youth outreach centers have been created in high-violence areas, offering safe spaces for youth to study, engage in recreational activities, and receive job training. USAID has established public-private partnerships with companies like Claro, Tigo, and Microsoft to support these initiatives. The Honduran government has allocated $3 million from its security tax to support USAID's violence-prevention programs. USAID, through Vanderbilt University, conducted a three-year impact evaluation of its crime and violence-prevention programs in high-crime urban communities in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Panama. Results showed lower crime victimization and higher public security perception in USAID's treatment communities. USAID and INL are now collaborating on a \"place-based\" model to coordinate prevention and policing programs in the same locations. USAID and INL are collaborating on a \"place-based\" model to coordinate prevention and policing programs in Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. They are obtaining a waiver to support the rehabilitation of former gang members without violating sanctions. The FBI is implementing programs to improve law enforcement capacity in Central America. Expansion of the model to more locations is planned for the coming year. The FBI, along with other agencies, is conducting investigations and sharing intelligence on gang suspects in Central America. Programs such as the Central American Fingerprinting Exchange (CAF\u00c9) are being implemented to support transnational gang investigations involving U.S.-origin firearms. These efforts are funded by CARSI or other State Department funding and are carried out in collaboration with the International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INL) bureau. The FBI has been integrating fingerprint data from El Salvador, Belize, Honduras, and Guatemala since 2006, accessible to Central American police. Programs like TAG Units and CALEE involve joint efforts with the FBI to investigate gang-related cases with U.S. connections. ICE's Operation Community Shield has led to the arrest of over 32,200 gang members in the U.S. ICE's Operation Community Shield has resulted in the arrest of 32,200 gang members in the U.S., including MS-13 and 18th Street gang members. ICE also formed an anti-gang task force in Honduras and supports Transnational Criminal Investigative Units in several Central American countries. Additionally, a program for sharing criminal history information with Mexico has been expanded to include Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. The Treasury Department designated MS-13 as a significant TCO subject to economic sanctions under E.O. 13581. The designation was based on evidence of the gang's involvement in drug trafficking, kidnapping, human smuggling, sex trafficking, and murder. Eight individuals have been sanctioned as of July 2016. The MS-13 gang has been designated for U.S. sanctions due to their criminal activities. While some collaboration with groups in El Salvador is noted, transnational collaboration is not common. Salvadoran officials were surprised by the designation, with concerns raised about the economic impact. U.S. law enforcement is investigating MS-13 leadership for money-laundering offenses. The evolving gang threat in Central America raises questions about their organization and ties. The text discusses the concerns surrounding gang activities in Central America, including their ties with other criminal organizations and communication with groups in the United States. It questions the effectiveness of U.S. strategies in combating gangs, particularly criticizing the lack of a comprehensive strategy in the CARSI program. The text also raises issues about the coordination of U.S. anti-gang efforts. The text raises questions about the coordination of U.S. anti-gang efforts with other donors and the private sector. It also discusses the use of new tools like asset forfeiture and wiretapping in combating gangs, as well as the implications of El Salvador designating gangs as terrorists."
