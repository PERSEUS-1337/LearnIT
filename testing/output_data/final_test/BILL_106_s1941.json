    "content": "The \"Firefighter Investment and Response Enhancement (FIRE) Act\" aims to address the increased demands on firefighting personnel by providing federal support to ensure their financial resources and protect public safety from fire-related risks. The Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974 is amended to include the \"Firefighter Investment and Response Enhancement\" section. The \"Firefighter Investment and Response Enhancement\" section defines firefighting personnel as individuals involved in firefighting and emergency medical services. The Director may provide grants to fire departments for public and personnel safety against fire hazards and assist with fire prevention programs. An office for administration of assistance must be established before providing aid. The Director will establish an office in FEMA to set criteria for selecting grant recipients and administer assistance. Grants can only be used for hiring firefighting personnel, training in various areas, and creating rapid intervention teams. The funding provided under the grant can be used for various purposes such as creating rapid intervention teams, certifying fire inspectors, establishing wellness and fitness programs for firefighting personnel, funding emergency medical services, acquiring firefighting vehicles and equipment, and obtaining personal protective equipment for firefighting personnel. The funding provided under the grant can be used for various purposes such as modifying fire stations, training facilities, and other facilities to protect firefighting personnel's health and safety, enforcing fire codes, funding fire prevention programs, and educating the public about arson prevention and detection. Additionally, not less than 10 percent of the funds must be used for making grants to fire departments for fire prevention programs. The Director can make grants to organizations recognized for their expertise in fire prevention programs, with priority given to those focusing on preventing injuries to children from fire. The Director may provide assistance to fire departments or organizations under specific conditions, including submitting an application, agreeing to match funds, and maintaining expenditures. The Director may provide assistance to fire departments under specific conditions, including submitting a report on how the funds were used for each fiscal year. Grants are to be distributed to a variety of fire departments, including paid, volunteer, and combination departments. The Director may provide assistance to fire departments, including paid, volunteer, and combination departments in communities of varying sizes and locations. There is a limitation on expenditures for firefighting vehicles to ensure not more than 25% of the assistance is used for this purpose. Authorization of appropriations is set at $1,000,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2000 to 2005 with a limitation on administrative costs. The Director may use up to 10 percent of the funds for administrative costs under paragraph (1) for a fiscal year."
