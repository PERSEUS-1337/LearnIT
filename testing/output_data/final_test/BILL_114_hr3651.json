The Secretary has the authority to extend the deadline for carriers or entities required to submit a Positive Train Control plan for up to 12 months if they demonstrate challenges in implementing the system due to technical, programmatic, or operational issues. The Secretary may grant a one-time extension of up to 12 months for carriers or entities unable to fully implement a positive train control system, if they demonstrate challenges in implementation. Carriers or entities can receive a one-time extension of up to 12 months for implementing a positive train control system if they face challenges beyond their control or technical difficulties. Carriers or entities may receive a one-time extension of up to 12 months for implementing positive train control systems due to technical, programmatic, or operational challenges. They must demonstrate due diligence in their efforts and certify full compliance with the requirements before the extension deadline. The revised plan must show substantial progress in deploying positive train control systems. The revised plan for implementing positive train control systems must ensure interoperability with other carriers, prioritize higher-risk areas, comply with regulations, and provide a detailed schedule for full implementation. The railroad carrier must implement a positive train control system in accordance with a plan and submit progress reports to the Secretary until full implementation is completed. The Secretary will notify Congress of the progress by April 1, 2018. The Secretary will provide progress reports to Congress on the implementation of positive train control systems by railroad carriers. The reports will be made publicly available on the Department of Transportation's website. Additionally, the Secretary may authorize provisional operation of the systems if needed. The Secretary may authorize a railroad carrier to begin operating a positive train control system for safe implementation in phases."
