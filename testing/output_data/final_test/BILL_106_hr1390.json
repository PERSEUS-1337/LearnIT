    "content": "The \"Income Tax Fairness Act of 1999\" may be cited as the official title. Key findings are outlined in the Act. Congress finds that working people contribute the majority of Federal revenue through social security and income taxes on their earnings, while unearned income only accounts for a small portion. Wage and salary income is fully taxed at regular rates, whereas unearned income benefits from special tax provisions, resulting in lower tax rates and tax deferrals. The tax system favors unearned income over earned income, with lower tax rates and deferrals. Working people pay higher combined taxes on their earnings compared to unearned income. The stock market has seen a significant increase in value, resulting in substantial capital gains. Large amounts of capital gains on foreign stocks, real estate, and other assets are not taxed until the asset is sold or transferred. Unrealized capital gains are never taxed if the owner holds the asset for life and bequeaths it to heirs. Owners of nonresidential real estate can deduct the full cost of buildings over 39 years, even though they are intended to stand for 100 years or more. The individual income tax rates are reduced under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, with changes to various percentages. The effective date for these amendments is after December 31, 1999. Additionally, there is a repeal of the increase in basis of property acquired from a decedent. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 repeals Section 1014 relating to the basis of property acquired from a decedent. Section 1015 is amended to determine basis under rules for gifts, defining carryover basis property as acquired from a decedent dying after December 31, 1999. The Income Tax Fairness Act of 1999 modifies the basis of property acquired from a decedent, including adjustments for family farm, closely held business, and estate tax paid. The basis of carryover basis property is determined by a combination of factors, including the basis under subsection (a) and specific adjustments for different types of property. The family farm adjustment is allocated to qualified real property as defined in section 2032A(b). The adjustment does not apply if additional estate tax is imposed by section 2032A(c). The aggregate family farm adjustment is the amount by which the basis of property is adjusted in the case of any estate. The closely held business adjustment is the portion allocated to carryover basis property that is an interest in a closely held business. It is defined in relation to the aggregate closely held business adjustment for any estate. The death tax adjustment is the portion of the aggregate death tax adjustment allocated to carryover basis property, limited by certain conditions. The death tax adjustment for property is limited by the net appreciation of the property multiplied by the Federal marginal estate tax rate. Net appreciation is the difference between the fair market value and the basis determined under subsection (a) with adjustments. The death tax adjustment is calculated by multiplying the aggregate net appreciation of properties with the Federal marginal estate tax rate, limited by the taxable estate. The Federal marginal estate tax rate is the highest rate in the rate schedule set forth in section 2001(c). The executor allocates adjustments among properties on the estate tax return, with a minimum amount subject to $50,000 and a Federal marginal estate tax rate not less than 30 percent. Conforming amendments remove section 1014 from the table of sections and amend the heading of section 1015. The heading of section 1015 of the Code is amended. SEC. 1015 amends the basis of property acquired by gift, from a decedent, or transferred in trust. The effective date for these amendments applies to decedents dying after December 31, 1999. Additionally, SEC. 5 increases the cost recovery period from 39 years to 100 years for nonresidential real property. The cost recovery period for nonresidential real property is increased from 39 years to 100 years for property placed in service after December 31, 1999."
