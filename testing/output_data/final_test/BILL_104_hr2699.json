    "content": "The \"Fans Rights Act of 1995\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. The Congress recognizes the importance of professional sports teams in fostering local identity, providing employment opportunities, and promoting stability among member teams. Public investments in sports facilities are significant, and it is in the public interest to encourage equitable resolutions for disputes related to team relocations. Professional sports teams travel interstate to compete, use materials shipped in interstate commerce, and have games broadcast nationally. The curr_chunk is a section header \"SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\" which is likely part of a legal document or regulation. The prev_chunk mentions professional sports teams engaging in interstate activities. In this Act, \"home territory\" refers to the geographic area where a team operates and plays home games. An \"interested party\" includes local governments providing financial assistance, representatives of the locality where a team's stadium is located, the team itself, and stadium owners. The term \"local government\" refers to a general governmental unit established under State law. The terms \"member team\" and \"team\" refer to professional athletes organized to play major league sports and are members of a professional sports league. The term \"person\" includes individuals, partnerships, corporations, associations, and political subdivisions. The terms \"professional sports league\" and \"league\" refer to associations of professional sports teams. A professional sports association consists of multiple member teams that regulate competitions and have been active in a sport for over 7 years. The terms \"stadium\" and \"arena\" refer to the main facility where a team plays its home games. SEC. 4. CLARIFICATION OF ANTITRUST LAWS RELATED TO RELOCATION AND DETERMINATION CRITERIA. Professional sports leagues are allowed to enforce rules preventing member clubs from relocating without violating antitrust laws. Before approving or disapproving a team's relocation, leagues must consider fan loyalty, support, and good faith negotiations with the community. The factors considered for a team's relocation include games played in the home territory, ownership's contribution to circumstances, public financial support received, stadium adequacy, financial losses, and viability threats. Factors considered for a team's relocation include financial viability, community location, stadium authority opposition, and investor interest in retaining the team in the home territory. SEC. 5. NOTICE OF PROPOSED CHANGE IN HOME TERRITORY AND RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL. Any person seeking to change a member team's home territory must provide notice at least 180 days before the season starts. The notice must be in writing, delivered in person or by certified mail, shared with the news media, published in newspapers, and include the new location and reasons for the change. During the 180-day notice period, a proposal can be made to purchase the team to keep it in the home territory. If successful, the league cannot deny membership based on multiple owners or local government involvement in the new ownership. During the 180-day notice period, local governments, stadium authorities, or individuals can present proposals to keep the team in its home territory. The team owner must respond in writing, stating reasons for refusing any legitimate offers. The professional sports league must determine the team's home territory location before the notice period ends. During the notice period, interested parties can present proposals for a team's home territory. The league conducts hearings for input and considers inducement proposals. When deciding on team relocation, the league considers criteria listed in section 4(b). SEC. 6. JUDICIAL REVIEW. Judicial review allows for civil action to review a professional sports league's decision on team relocation. Venue for the action is determined by district courts with jurisdiction under section 1331 of title 28, United States Code. Transfer of venue can be requested for convenience or justice. No action can be brought in a district court of the State where the team is located. The district court can order additional proceedings for interested parties to present testimony regarding a professional sports league's decision on team relocation. The league must reconsider and resubmit its decision within 30 days for review by the court. This Act does not waive any rights. No legal rights waiver required by this Act. SEC. 7. INAPPLICABILITY TO CERTAIN MATTERS. The Act does not affect antitrust laws, labor laws, or other laws related to employment conditions in professional sports leagues, collective bargaining rights, or broadcasting agreements. The Act does not affect broadcasting agreements for professional sports leagues, stadium contracts, price-fixing agreements for sports contests, predatory practices towards competing leagues, or the applicability of antitrust laws to sports-related activities. The Act does not impact broadcasting agreements, stadium contracts, price-fixing agreements, or predatory practices in professional sports leagues. Antitrust laws apply to activities in football, basketball, hockey, and baseball. SEC. 8 prohibits any person or entity from offering money or other value to influence a decision on relocating a sports team. SEC. 9 states that the Act applies to team relocations after October 1, 1995."
