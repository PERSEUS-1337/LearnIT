    "content": "The \"Rural Health Outreach Grants Amendments Act\" establishes a program of grants for rural health outreach under Title III of the Public Health Service Act. This program aims to improve healthcare access in rural areas through grants. The Secretary may award grants for innovative outreach and healthcare delivery models in rural areas lacking basic services. Projects should target various rural populations, including the poor, farmers, seniors, and individuals with special healthcare needs. This includes enhancing emergency medical services in rural communities. The program aims to provide ambulatory health and mental health services in health professional shortage areas, enhance health and safety for farmers and farm workers, improve healthcare services for seniors, and reduce infant mortality in rural communities. Participation requires forming consortium arrangements among multiple entities for outreach projects. A consortium under paragraph (1) must consist of three or more health care providers or a combination of health care and social service providers. Consortium members can include hospitals, public health agencies, home health providers, mental health centers, and other entities. Both nonprofit and for-profit entities are eligible to participate in the consortium. Grants under subsection (a) will be awarded to eligible consortium arrangements. The grant recipient in a consortium must be a nonprofit or public entity located outside a Metropolitan Statistical Area or in a rural census tract. This provision applies to counties classified as Metropolitan Statistical Areas but with large rural areas. Organizations in rural areas of specified counties are eligible for the program. The review criteria include proposing innovative healthcare approaches, justifying project needs, setting measurable goals, defining consortium roles, and managing activities effectively. The consortium must demonstrate local commitment, feasibility post-grant support, and include an evaluation component. Grantees must allocate 85% of funds to outreach and care services, with 60% spent in rural areas. Grant funds cannot be used for purchases. Grant funds for outreach projects in rural areas cannot be used for real property purchase, construction, or inpatient services. Equipment and vehicles essential to the project can be funded. Individual grants are limited to $300,000 per year for three years. Applicants must show that existing support levels are not reduced by grant availability. $25,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 1994, with additional funding as needed in subsequent years."
