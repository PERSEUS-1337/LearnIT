    "title": "AB 2731",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature declares heavy container corridors connect Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach to warehouses, enhancing port competitiveness. These corridors include designated streets in Los Angeles, Long Beach, Carson, and California state routes, allowing overweight trucks with a gross vehicle weight of 80,000 to 95,000 pounds to operate with permits. The Cities of Long Beach and Carson, along with Los Angeles, have different methods for determining overweight trucks on heavy container corridors. This discrepancy leads to confusion, fines, and noncompliance with safety measures. The Legislature aims to standardize enforcement methods for weight limits on these corridors. The Department of Transportation may issue special permits for vehicles on designated routes in Long Beach and Los Angeles if they meet specific criteria. The Department of Transportation may issue special permits for vehicles transporting intermodal cargo containers in international commerce with a gross weight exceeding the limit but not exceeding 95,000 pounds. The vehicles must conform to axle weight limits specified in Section 35550 and 35551. Vehicles exceeding weight or length limits must conform to weight limits determined by the Department of Transportation. A permit is required for operation, excluding hazardous materials. The permit application must include a description of the loads and vehicles. The permit application must include a description of the loads and vehicles, an agreement to be responsible for any damages, and proof of financial responsibility meeting legal requirements. The permit issued for vehicles must be carried in the vehicle at all times and an indicia must be displayed on the front windshield. The permit is valid for one year and may be canceled for failure to maintain required conditions. The Department of Transportation may cancel a permit if the applicant fails to maintain a satisfactory rating or if the movement of their vehicles jeopardizes safety or causes undue damage to highways. Violating weight limits outside designated corridors will result in permit revocation. The Department may charge a fee for issuing permits. If the City of Carson, Long Beach, and Los Angeles adopt an ordinance, it must comply with weight limits set by the Department of Transportation for permitted vehicles moving on specified routes."
