    "content": "The \"Criminal Alien Notification Act\" is the short title of this Act. It includes definitions for various terms used in the legislation. The Act defines the term \"Department\" as the Department of Homeland Security and \"law enforcement notification system\" as a secure information sharing system used by various law enforcement agencies to notify states about the release of inadmissible or deportable aliens. The term \"protection order\" includes any court-issued order to prevent violent acts or harassment. A protection order can be issued by a civil or criminal court in response to a complaint, petition, or motion filed by a person seeking protection, as long as the court has jurisdiction over the parties and matter, provides notice and opportunity to be heard, and protects the person's right to due process. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the term \"State\" is defined as in section 101(a)(36) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The Secretary of Homeland Security must establish law enforcement and protective order notification systems for every State within 180 days of the enactment of this Act. The Secretary must establish a secure information sharing system for State, tribal, and local courts to notify about protective orders against inadmissible or deportable aliens. The system should not include protection orders for anyone other than those described in the Immigration and Nationality Act. The Secretary is required to submit a report to the Senate and House Judiciary Committees every year, detailing the number of aliens in the US who have been arrested or convicted of a criminal offense, as well as the number of aliens with final removal orders who have been arrested. The Department must report the number of detainers issued and honored, notifications of protective orders received, and offenses notified through the law enforcement system in the previous fiscal year. The Department must report the number of detainers issued and honored, notifications of protective orders received, and offenses notified through the law enforcement system in the previous fiscal year, including a list of offenses, actions taken by the Department, and reasons for not taking action. Additionally, the Department must report the number of times it was notified by a State, tribal, or local law court through the established system, detailing actions taken or reasons for not taking action for each notification."
