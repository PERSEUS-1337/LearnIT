Stafford Relief and Emergency Assistance Act was established to provide aid and coordinate Federal disaster relief in response to major disasters, including the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. These attacks brought new challenges that slowed down and complicated Federal disaster relief efforts, exposing weaknesses in the authorities Federal agencies have to respond to homeland security events. Officials in the Administration and intelligence community believe another attack is inevitable, prompting the need for new authority to address response inadequacies to homeland security events. The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act is amended to include terrorist attacks, cyber-attacks, and other catastrophic events. The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act is amended to include private for-profit telecommunications, phone services, and utilities in the definition of private nonprofit facilities for homeland security events. Additionally, a new section is added to cover losses incurred by for-profit utilities during such events. The President may declare a major disaster as a homeland security event at the request of the Governor if Federal assistance is necessary due to significant risks. In such events, a coordinating office and disaster recovery director can be appointed to work with the Federal coordinating officer. The Federal coordinating officer appointed under section 302 oversees the distribution of Federal compensation, expedites claims for relief, coordinates long-term recovery efforts, and collaborates with Federal agencies. The disaster recovery director, if established, consults with local officials in developing a recovery plan and may appoint an independent claims manager. The Federal coordinating officer oversees Federal compensation distribution, expedites relief claims, and coordinates recovery efforts. An independent claims manager may be appointed to assist. Assistance and reimbursement are provided to State and local governments for expenses related to high security alerts. Grants are given to local governments facing revenue loss, and reimbursement is authorized for school systems providing additional instruction time post-homeland security events.

A report with recommendations will be submitted to the President and Congress. The special commission will provide recommendations on clarifying and enhancing the Environmental Protection Agency's authorities in response to major disasters, including terrorist attacks involving chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons. The Environmental Protection Agency will issue guidelines for health risks from exposure to toxic materials after a major disaster. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will assist with information on biological materials. EPA will also have authorities for environmental monitoring and analysis. The President designates EPA or CDC to coordinate data collection and monitoring of pollutants and contaminants after major disasters. EPA issues guidelines for health risks from toxic materials, while CDC assists with biological materials. EPA also has authorities for environmental monitoring and analysis during public health emergencies. Section 319L of the Public Health Service Act amends data collection during public health emergencies and research on assisting victims. The Secretary may award grants, contracts, and agreements to collect public health data and conduct research for developing medical therapies and public health strategies during and after emergencies.
