    "content": "The Emergency Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 2008 includes provisions for Federal-State agreements, an emergency unemployment compensation account, payments to States, financing provisions, fraud and overpayments regulations, definitions, and applicability. The Emergency Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 2008 allows states to enter agreements with the Secretary of Labor to provide emergency unemployment compensation to individuals who have exhausted all regular benefits. The Emergency Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 2008 allows states to provide emergency unemployment compensation to individuals who have exhausted all regular benefits under state or federal law. An individual is deemed to have exhausted their rights to regular compensation when no more payments can be made or when their rights have been terminated due to the expiration of the benefit year. The Emergency Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 2008 allows states to provide emergency unemployment compensation to individuals who have exhausted all regular benefits under state or federal law. The amount of emergency unemployment compensation payable is equal to the regular compensation under the State law for a week of total unemployment, subject to the terms and conditions of the State law. The Emergency Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 2008 allows states to provide emergency unemployment compensation to individuals who have exhausted all regular benefits. The maximum amount payable to any individual shall not exceed the amount in their account. States in an extended benefit period may pay emergency compensation before extended compensation. Unauthorized aliens are ineligible for this compensation. Aliens receiving compensation must be legally authorized to work in the US. States must follow specific procedures to determine eligibility. SEC. 3. EMERGENCY UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION ACCOUNT. The Emergency Unemployment Compensation Account established by the Act provides eligible individuals with an account based on their benefit year. The amount in the account is determined by the lesser of 50% of total regular compensation or 13 times the individual's average weekly benefit amount. The Emergency Unemployment Compensation Account provides individuals with a weekly benefit amount based on their total regular compensation under State law for total unemployment. During an extended benefit period, the account is augmented by the original amount established. The curr_chunk discusses the conditions under which a period of extended unemployment benefits would be in effect for a state under the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970. It outlines the specific criteria that need to be met for such a period to be applicable. The curr_chunk specifies adjustments to section 203(f) by substituting \"6.0\" for \"6.5\" in paragraph (1)(A)(i) and excluding the requirement in paragraph (1)(A)(ii). SEC. 4. Payments to states with agreements for emergency unemployment compensation. Payments will be made to states with agreements for emergency unemployment compensation, equal to 100 percent of the compensation paid to individuals. States cannot receive payment if they are entitled to reimbursement under other federal laws. The amount payable to states will be determined based on their agreement under this Act. The Secretary will provide payments to states either in advance or as reimbursement, based on estimated entitlements under the Act for each month. Adjustments will be made for over or underestimations in previous months, using agreed-upon methods between the Secretary and the state agency. SEC. 5. FINANCING PROVISIONS. Funds from the extended unemployment compensation account in the Unemployment Trust Fund are used to make payments to States with agreements under this Act. The Secretary certifies payments to States, and the Secretary of the Treasury makes payments to States accordingly. The Unemployment Trust Fund provides funds to assist States in administering agreements under the Social Security Act. Appropriations from the Treasury are made to the extended unemployment compensation account for payments under chapter 85 of title 5, United States Code. Compensation under chapter 85 of title 5, United States Code and based on services under section 3309(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 does not need to be repaid. SEC. 6. FRAUD AND OVERPAYMENTS. Individuals who knowingly make false statements or fail to disclose material facts to receive emergency unemployment compensation they are not entitled to will be ineligible for further benefits and may face prosecution under section 1001 of title 18, United States Code. Repayment may be required for those who have already received benefits. Repayment of emergency unemployment compensation may be required for individuals who received benefits they were not entitled to. The State agency can recover the repayment amount by deducting it from future emergency unemployment compensation or other unemployment benefits. Repayment may be waived if the individual was not at fault and repayment would be unfair. Individuals who received emergency unemployment compensation they were not entitled to may be required to repay it. The State agency can deduct the repayment amount from future benefits, with a maximum deduction of 50 percent of the weekly benefit amount. Repayment cannot be demanded until a fair hearing has been provided and a final determination made. Any determination by a State agency under this section shall be subject to review in the same manner and to the same extent as determinations under the State unemployment compensation law, and only in that manner and to that extent. SEC. 7. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines terms such as \"compensation\", \"benefit year\", and \"week\" according to the Federal-State Extended Unemployment Compensation Act of 1970. SEC. 8. APPLICABILITY. An agreement under this Act applies to unemployment weeks starting after the agreement date and ending on or before March 31, 2009. Emergency unemployment compensation can continue for individuals with remaining account funds after March 31, 2009, if they meet eligibility requirements. Limit on augmentation: If an individual's account is exhausted after the last day of the last week, section 3(c) will not apply, and the account will not be augmented, regardless of the state's extended benefit period. No compensation will be payable after June 30, 2009. The House of Representatives passed the document on June 12, 2008. Attested by Lorraine C. Miller, Clerk, and Robert F. Reeves, Deputy Clerk."
