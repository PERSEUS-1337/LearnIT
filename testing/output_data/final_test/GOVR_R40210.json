    "content": "The home mortgage foreclosure rate in the United States began to rise rapidly around the middle of 2006 and remained elevated for several years. This report discusses the increase in foreclosure rates post-2006, federal initiatives to prevent foreclosures, and challenges in designing such initiatives. Additional foreclosure prevention programs established after 2007 are also mentioned in the Appendix. The report discusses the rise in home mortgage foreclosure rates in the United States post-2006. It focuses on preventing foreclosure completions by outlining the process and requirements for initiating foreclosure proceedings. Home prices began to rise rapidly in some regions of the United States in the early 2000s, leading to a housing boom. When a borrower misses three or more payments, they are considered to be in default, and servicers can start foreclosure proceedings. The foreclosure process varies by state due to state laws. During the housing boom in the early 2000s, rising home prices led to increased home equity access through buying homes, second mortgages, and refinancing. Refinancing surged between 2000 and 2003, with many households taking equity out of their homes. Subprime lending also peaked between 2004 and 2006. However, by 2006 and 2007, home sales started to decline, and home prices stopped rising. Home sales declined, home prices fell, and mortgage delinquencies increased in 2006-2007. Foreclosure rates rose rapidly, with 1% of home loans in foreclosure in Q2 2006, quadrupling to over 4.5% by Q4 2009. The peak was in Q4 2010 at about 4.6%, followed by a decrease in foreclosures. The foreclosure rate for mortgages decreased but remained slightly higher than historical standards by the end of 2016. In Q4 2016, the rate of loans in foreclosure was about 1.5%. Subprime loans consistently had higher foreclosure rates than prime loans, with subprime loans peaking at over 15.5% in Q4 2016. The rate of subprime loans in foreclosure was over 15.5% in Q4 2009, decreasing to just under 7% in Q4 2016. Prime loans in foreclosure increased to over 3% in Q4 2009, dropping to less than 1% in Q4 2016. Additionally, 1.6% of mortgages were 90 or more days delinquent but not yet in foreclosure in Q4 2016. Various reasons could delay the foreclosure process, such as loan modifications or servicer pauses. Losing a home to foreclosure can have significant negative effects on a household, including the loss of wealth, negative impact on creditworthiness, and the loss of intangible benefits like civic engagement and better health outcomes for children. Foreclosure can lead to difficulties in finding affordable rental housing, as landlords may be hesitant to rent to families with damaged credit. This can result in displacement of current renters and increased pressure on local rental markets, potentially contributing to homelessness. High numbers of foreclosures can contribute to homelessness by making it difficult for families to find affordable housing. Lack of data hinders measuring the impact of foreclosures on homelessness. Concentrated foreclosures can negatively affect communities by depressing home values and attracting crime. Delinquent mortgage payments are a common reason for foreclosures. Many households face delinquency on mortgage payments due to various reasons such as changes in personal circumstances like job loss, illness, or family structure changes. This can lead to difficulties in making payments, even for those who initially believed they were acting responsibly when taking out a mortgage. Many households may struggle to make mortgage payments if a household member loses a job or faces a pay cut, or if a two-earner household becomes a single-earner household. Unexpected expenses or a change in circumstances, such as needing to relocate for a job or accommodate a growing family, can also impact a family's ability to stay current on their mortgage. Home price declines have left many households in a negative equity position, limiting their ability to sell their homes for enough money. The fall in home values post-2006 left many homeowners trapped in their mortgages, unable to sell their homes for enough money to pay off their loans. This made families vulnerable to losing their homes due to changing personal circumstances, such as job loss or relocation. The increase in foreclosures was driven by high unemployment and the use of alternative mortgage products with risky features, making it difficult for many families to afford their mortgage payments. Many families faced foreclosure due to high unemployment and risky alternative mortgage products with features that made it hard to afford payments. These products included Adjustable Rate Mortgages (ARMs) with changing interest rates and initial low teaser rates. Adjustable Rate Mortgages (ARMs) offer a low teaser rate initially, but the interest rate can increase significantly after the introductory period. ARMs can be beneficial for borrowers expecting stable or decreasing interest rates, or those anticipating a rise in income. Refinancing before the mortgage resets can help avoid higher rates in a rising property market. Zero- or Low-Down-Payment Loans make it easier for creditworthy homebuyers to purchase a home without a large down payment. These loans can be beneficial in areas where home prices are rising faster than income, allowing borrowers to avoid higher mortgage payments if interest rates rise. Zero- or Low-Down-Payment Loans allow borrowers to enter markets they couldn't afford otherwise, but may result in little equity early on. Interest-Only Loans let borrowers pay only interest for a period, increasing future monthly payments. These loans limit equity building and make it challenging to sell or refinance in changing circumstances. Negative Amortization Loans allow borrowers to pay less than the full interest amount, leading to a growing loan balance. These loans can be beneficial in rising property markets but risky when home prices stagnate or fall. Negative amortization loans and interest-only loans can lead to negative equity when home prices stagnate or fall, making it challenging to refinance or sell the property. Low- or no-documentation loans, which require minimal income and asset documentation, were initially for borrowers with good credit and high incomes but became more common before the foreclosure crisis. These loans may benefit self-employed or commission-based borrowers but are not as rigorously underwritten as traditional mortgages. Loans with features like negative amortization and interest-only options can lead to negative equity when home prices fall, making it difficult to refinance or sell the property. These loans, along with low- or no-documentation loans, were not as rigorously underwritten as traditional mortgages, leading to an increase in foreclosure rates. Borrowers without sufficient equity may struggle to refinance or sell their homes if their financial situation changes. When borrowers fall behind on their mortgage, lenders can offer alternatives to foreclosure. Options like short sales and deed-in-lieu of foreclosure allow homeowners to avoid losing their homes. Repayment plans and loan modifications are methods to help homeowners keep their homes, although they can be costly for lenders. Loan modifications and repayment plans are alternatives to foreclosure for delinquent borrowers. While foreclosure is costly for lenders, loan modifications can reduce the amount repaid or change repayment timing. Repayment plans allow borrowers to catch up on missed payments and late fees, while loan modifications alter loan terms like interest rates. Loan modifications may be less costly than foreclosure in some cases. Repayment plans and loan modifications offer alternatives to foreclosure for delinquent borrowers. Repayment plans can increase monthly payments or extend the loan term, while loan modifications involve lowering the interest rate without the need for refinancing. These options may help homeowners with temporary financial difficulties but may not prevent foreclosure in the long term. Interest rate reductions for mortgage modifications can help troubled borrowers who owe more on their homes than they are worth. Lenders can lower interest rates permanently or for a period before increasing again. This option can be costly for lenders but effective in reducing monthly payments. Extending the loan term is another way to lower monthly mortgage payments, although it increases the total cost of the mortgage. Extending the loan term allows for smaller monthly payments but increases the total cost of the mortgage due to accruing more interest. Principal forbearance reduces monthly payments by removing part of the principal subject to interest, which still needs to be repaid in full later. Principal forgiveness, also known as principal reduction, lowers borrowers' monthly payments by forgiving a portion of the loan's principal balance. This option helps borrowers achieve affordable payments and increase equity in their homes, potentially reducing the risk of foreclosure. Government intervention in preventing foreclosures is debated among policymakers. Proponents argue that it can help households in need and prevent further damage to home values and communities. They also suggest it could stabilize the economy. Opponents believe foreclosure prevention should be handled by lenders and borrowers without government involvement, expressing concerns about misuse of taxpayer money. The federal government implemented various temporary initiatives to address high rates of residential mortgage foreclosures, despite debates over the role of government in foreclosure prevention. Initiatives like the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) provided incentives to mortgage servicers. The federal government implemented various initiatives to address mortgage foreclosures, including HAMP, HARP, Hardest Hit Fund, FHA Short Refinance Program, and housing counseling. State and local governments also implemented foreclosure prevention programs, and the private sector created the HOPE NOW Alliance. The federal government implemented initiatives like HAMP, HARP, and the Hardest Hit Fund to address mortgage foreclosures. The private sector also created the HOPE NOW Alliance in 2007 to engage in outreach efforts for troubled borrowers. This report focuses on federal foreclosure prevention efforts, excluding state, local, and private sector initiatives. President Obama announced the Making Home Affordable (MHA) initiative on February 18, 2009, which included programs like HAMP and HARP to assist troubled borrowers with loan modifications and refinancing. The deadline to apply for HAMP was December 30, 2016, after which the program expired. Applications received before December 30, 2016, can still be considered for modifications made through HAMP, which was administered by the Department of the Treasury. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had their own HAMP requirements for mortgages they owned or guaranteed. The program provided incentives to mortgage servicers to modify troubled borrowers' mortgages, reducing monthly payments to 31% of their income. Servicers that participated in HAMP were bound by program rules to modify eligible mortgages according to guidelines. Under HAMP, servicers reduced borrowers' payments by adjusting interest rates, extending loan terms, and forbearing principal as needed to achieve a 31% target payment ratio. Interest rates could be lowered to as low as 2% and had to remain fixed for five years. Borrowers had to make timely payments during a three-month trial period before the modification could become permanent. The government provides financial incentives to servicers, investors, and borrowers for participating in HAMP. Servicers receive upfront and pay-for-success payments for successful permanent loan modifications. Borrowers can also receive pay-for-success incentives for remaining current on their mortgage after modification. The government incentivizes servicers, investors, and borrowers in the HAMP program. Investors receive a payment cost-share incentive, while servicers get upfront and pay-for-success payments. Treasury made changes to HAMP rules over the years, communicated through Supplemental Directives. The HAMP program underwent changes through Supplemental Directives to assist specific borrower groups. Borrowers had to meet complex eligibility criteria to qualify for a standard HAMP modification, including having a mortgage on a single-family property originated before January 1, 2009, and living in the home as their primary residence. To qualify for a standard HAMP modification, borrowers had to meet specific criteria such as having a mortgage on a single-family property originated before January 1, 2009, living in the home as their primary residence, and meeting financial hardship requirements. The unpaid principal balance on the mortgage had to be below $729,750 for a one-unit property, and borrowers had to be paying more than 31% of their monthly gross income towards mortgage payments. Default did not need to have occurred, but it had to be foreseeable, and a net present value test had to show greater value for the mortgage investor than pursuing foreclosure. Additional details were outlined in the Treasury's Making Home Affordable Handbook. Treasury's Making Home Affordable Handbook outlined program requirements for mortgages not backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Servicers participating in HAMP conducted a net present value test to determine if loan modification was more financially beneficial than foreclosure. If so, borrowers' payments were reduced to 38% of monthly income, with the government sharing half the cost to lower it to 31%. Servicers were not required to modify mortgages with negative net present value results. HAMP Tier 2, an expanded version of HAMP introduced in early 2012, provided an alternative to standard HAMP modification for borrowers who did not qualify. Borrowers still had to meet basic eligibility criteria but could qualify even if they did not meet all requirements, such as having a mortgage payment-to-income ratio below 31% or not living in the home as a primary residence. HAMP Tier 2 offered an alternative to standard HAMP modification for borrowers who did not qualify, with different eligibility requirements and incentive payment structure. Only mortgages not backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac were eligible. The Administration initially estimated HAMP would cost $75 billion, with $50 billion from Troubled Asset Relief. Treasury initially estimated that HAMP would cost $75 billion, with $50 billion from TARP funds and $25 billion from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. However, Treasury later revised the estimate, allocating $38 billion from TARP funds for foreclosure prevention programs. Of this amount, nearly $28 billion was committed to HAMP and related programs. As of December 31, 2016, $16 billion of the $28 billion allocated for HAMP and related programs had been disbursed, with an additional $8 billion committed for future incentives. The Treasury Department releases quarterly reports detailing program progress, including the number of modifications made and their status. The HAMP program had about 1 million active modifications as of the fourth quarter of 2016, with 38,000 in trial status and 962,000 in permanent status. The median HAMP modification reduced borrowers' monthly mortgage payments by nearly $500 before any future interest rate adjustments. Treasury established additional subprograms under HAMP to address barriers to modifications and specific borrower populations. These subprograms had a deadline of December 30, 2016, and included assistance for borrowers with second mortgages, which could complicate loan modifications. The Second Lien Modification Program aimed to address second liens on properties where the first mortgage was modified through HAMP. Participating servicers had to agree to modify the second lien or extinguish it in exchange for a lump sum payment when the first mortgage was modified. The Second Lien Modification Program (2MP) was introduced in August 2009 to modify or extinguish second liens on properties participating in HAMP. Servicers and investors could receive financial incentives for second lien modifications under 2MP. Borrowers who remained current on both their HAMP and 2MP modifications could receive incentive payments for up to five years. Treasury reported around 79,000 active second lien modifications under 2MP as of the fourth quarter of 2016. Additionally, the Home Affordable Foreclosure Alternatives (HAFA) program provided incentives for completing short sales or deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure as alternatives to foreclosure for borrowers who did not qualify for HAMP modifications. The Home Affordable Foreclosure Alternatives (HAFA) program provided incentives for completing short sales or deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure as alternatives to foreclosure. Servicers, borrowers, and investors could receive financial incentive payments for successful transactions. Treasury standardized documentation and processes to streamline the process. HAFA went into effect on April 5, 2010, with about 454,000 completed transactions reported as of the fourth quarter. The Treasury reported that as of the fourth quarter of 2016, approximately 454,000 completed HAFA transactions, with most being short sales (390,000) rather than deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure (64,000). The Home Affordable Unemployment Program (UP) provided forbearance periods to unemployed borrowers applying for HAMP, lowering mortgage payments to 31% of monthly income through principal forbearance. Some borrowers regained employment after the forbearance period, while others qualified for regular assistance. The Home Affordable Unemployment Program (UP) provided forbearance to unemployed borrowers under HAMP, allowing for lower mortgage payments. Approximately 46,000 UP forbearance plans were initiated by the fourth quarter of 2016. The Principal Reduction Alternative (PRA) required servicers to consider reducing principal balances for homeowners who owed at least 115% of their home value, excluding mortgages backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. The FHFA does not allow principal reduction for mortgages owned or guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Under the Principal Reduction Alternative (PRA), servicers conducted net present value tests for borrowers with at least 115% of their home value. If the modification's value was higher with principal reduction, servicers could reduce principal, but it was not mandatory. Principal reduction was initially treated as forbearance, forgiven over three years if the borrower stayed current on payments. The Principal Reduction Alternative (PRA) offered financial incentives for reducing principal on mortgages. About 164,000 PRA modifications were active by 2016, with additional HAMP modifications. Concerns were raised about HAMP's effectiveness, including interest rate adjustments, trial modifications, and servicers' performance. HAMP modified mortgages to achieve a 31% payment-to-income ratio by reducing interest rates to as low as 2%. The interest rate on mortgages was reduced to as low as 2% under the Principal Reduction Alternative (PRA). The modified interest rate remains in effect for five years, with gradual increases until it reaches the market interest rate at the time of modification. For example, if the original rate was 6% and reduced to 3%, it would increase to 4% after five years and 4.5% the following year. After that, there would be no further increases for the borrower. (Average market interest rates fluctuate between 4% and 5% annually from 2009 to 2016.) The interest rates for mortgages between 2009 and 2016 ranged from under 4% to just over 5%. Interest rate increases began in late 2014, affecting 80% of borrowers with a median monthly payment increase of over $200. Concerns were raised about the impact on borrowers' ability to make payments. Homeowners who stay current on payments for six years under HAMP are eligible for a $5,000 incentive in principal reduction. The HAMP program offered up to $1,000 per year in principal reduction for the first five years of modification. Concerns arose about trial modifications not converting to permanent status quickly. Treasury took steps to help borrowers meet documentation requirements and monitor servicers. Since June 1, 2010, additional efforts have been made to facilitate the conversion of trial modifications to permanent ones. Since June 1, 2010, Treasury has required servicers to verify borrowers' income information before offering trial modifications, leading to more accurate evaluations and reducing the risk of denial for permanent modifications. Since June 1, 2010, Treasury has required servicers to verify borrowers' income information before offering trial modifications, leading to more accurate evaluations and reducing the risk of denial for permanent modifications. As of the fourth quarter of 2016, about 116,000 trial modifications had been canceled since the requirement went into effect, compared to 675,000 cancellations prior to June 2010. Concerns have been raised about mortgage servicers wrongly denying eligible borrowers for modifications and not evaluating borrowers for HAMP according to program requirements. Treasury has released results of examinations of the largest servicers participating in HAMP since April 2011. Treasury announced withholding incentive payments to three largest HAMP servicers - Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase, and Wells Fargo - for not meeting performance standards. Payments would resume upon improvement. Remaining servicers needed moderate improvement. Treasury's subsequent assessments showed overall improvement. In the fourth quarter of 2016, seven servicers were assessed for their performance in implementing HAMP. One servicer needed substantial improvement, one needed moderate improvement, and five needed minor improvement. Concerns persist about servicers denying modifications to eligible borrowers without cause. HARP, the refinancing component of Making Home Affordable, applies to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgages and has been extended multiple times, currently available until September 30, 2017. HARP, the refinancing program for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgages, has been extended multiple times and is now available until September 30, 2017. A new refinancing option for high loan-to-value ratio loans will be implemented in October 2017. HARP allows homeowners to refinance their mortgages to benefit from lower interest rates, even if they owe more than 80% of their home's value. HARP is a refinancing program for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgages, aimed at helping qualified borrowers lower their monthly payments by refinancing. It targets homeowners who have kept up with payments but lost equity in their homes. Initially, borrowers could refinance if they owed up to 105% of their home's value, later expanded to 125%, and eventually removed the cap entirely in October 2011 with \"HARP 2.0.\" The HARP 2.0 program aimed to help qualified borrowers lower their monthly payments by refinancing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgages. Changes included removing the LTV cap, reducing fees, waiving lender responsibilities, and promoting automated valuation models. Eligibility criteria required the original mortgage to be owned or guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. HARP is a voluntary refinancing program for single-family homes with mortgages closed on or before May 31, 2009. Borrowers must be current on payments, and lenders are not obligated to participate. The program aims to help homeowners lower monthly payments by refinancing through different lenders. As of December 2016, about 3.4 million loans with loan-to-value ratios above 80% had been refinanced through HARP. The Hardest Hit Fund (HHF) provides funds to selected states for foreclosure prevention programs. 18 states plus the District of Columbia received funds from the HHF, sourced from TARP funds. States must comply with the law that authorized TARP and have their programs approved by Treasury. Funding must be used by December 31, 2017, with an extension granted in 2016. The Hardest Hit Fund (HHF) provided funds to selected states for foreclosure prevention programs. Initially, states had until December 31, 2017, to use the funds, but the deadline was extended to December 31, 2020. Four rounds of funding were allocated to state housing finance agencies based on specific criteria. The first round in 2010 allocated $1.5 billion to five states with the greatest home price declines: California, Arizona, Florida, Nevada, and Michigan. The Hardest Hit Fund (HHF) provided funds to selected states for foreclosure prevention programs. A second round of funding in 2010 allocated $600 million to five states with high unemployment rates: North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Rhode Island, and South Carolina. These states can use the funds for various programs tailored to address foreclosure challenges. In August 2010, a third round of Hardest Hit Fund funding allocated up to $2 billion to 18 states and the District of Columbia with high unemployment rates. Nine states received funding for the first time in this round, focusing on foreclosure prevention programs for the unemployed. In September 2010, Treasury announced an additional $3.5 billion in funding for the Hardest Hit Fund, bringing the total allocated amount to $7.6 billion. The authority to allocate TARP funds expired in October 2010, but in December 2015, an additional $2 billion was authorized for the HHF. Treasury allocated this amount in two phases, with $1 billion distributed based on population and previous utilization. In the first phase of Round Five, $1 billion was allocated to participating states based on population and utilization of previous HHF funds. States had to have used at least 50% of their previous HHF funds to be eligible. Each state, except for Alabama, received additional HHF funding. In the second phase, an additional $1 billion was competitively allocated among participating states, with all but six states receiving additional funding. The total amount committed to the HHF is now $9.6 billion. Five states did not apply for funding in Phase Two (Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Nevada, and South Carolina), and one state (Georgia) applied but was not awarded funding. As of December 2016, states have drawn down over $7 billion, or more than 70%, of Hardest Hit Fund (HHF) funds. States have flexibility in designing programs using their allocations, with percentages drawn from Treasury ranging from 35% to 89%. States must not have more than 5% of their total allocation on hand to draw down additional funds. States have implemented various programs using their Hardest Hit Fund (HHF) funds, approved by Treasury under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. These programs include mortgage modification, principal reduction, reinstatement, assistance for unemployed homeowners, addressing second liens, short sales, blight elimination, and down payment assistance. Some states have used Hardest Hit Fund (HHF) funds for programs to prevent foreclosures, including assisting homeowners with reverse mortgages and paying tax liens. Over 80 HHF programs were operating in 18 states as of Q4 2016, assisting over 290,000 borrowers. The FHA Short Refinance Program, launched in 2010, aimed to help homeowners who owed more on their mortgages than their homes were worth. The FHA Short Refinance Program, active from September 7, 2010, to December 31, 2016, allowed eligible homeowners to refinance into new, FHA-insured mortgages for an amount lower than their home's current value. Homeowners had to be current on their mortgages and reduce the first mortgage balance by at least 10%. The program was voluntary for lenders and borrowers, with borrowers already insured by FHA not eligible. The FHA Short Refinance Program, similar to the Hope for Homeowners program, allowed eligible homeowners to refinance into new, FHA-insured mortgages for less than their home's value. Second liens were allowed to remain in place, with incentives for reducing the balance. Borrowers had to be current on their mortgages to qualify. Hope for Homeowners required extinguishing second liens and accepted both current and delinquent borrowers. The FHA Short Refinance Program allowed eligible homeowners to refinance into new, FHA-insured mortgages without requiring equity sharing. As of December 2016, FHA reported insuring about 7,200 refinanced loans through the program. The program expired on December 31, 2016, with a reduced total maximum spending of just over $100 million. The FHA Short Refinance Program expired in December 2016 with a total maximum spending of just over $100 million. Additional funding for housing counseling was provided by Congress to NeighborWorks America for foreclosure mitigation counseling. NeighborWorks America received funding from Congress for housing counseling through the National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program (NFMCP), established to assist borrowers at risk of foreclosure. The program was awarded funding based on areas with high default rates on subprime mortgages. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 allocated an additional $180 million for NFMCP, with annual appropriations ranging from $40 million to $80 million. In FY2016, $40 million was provided for the program. NeighborWorks America received funding from Congress for housing counseling through the National Foreclosure Mitigation Counseling Program (NFMCP). As of April 30, 2016, over 2 million borrowers received foreclosure prevention counseling through the NFMCP, leading to increased likelihood of loan modifications and mortgage payment consistency. Challenges in designing successful foreclosure prevention programs include practical issues with loan modifications and conceptual concerns regarding fairness and precedent. The text discusses challenges in homeownership following the increase in foreclosure rates since 2006, focusing on loan modification programs and the debate over principal reduction in mortgage modifications. It also explains the practice of securitization in the mortgage industry, involving lenders, servicers, and investors in mortgage-backed securities. Foreclosure prevention programs face challenges regarding servicers' authority to make loan modifications due to contractual obligations with investors, limiting flexibility that could benefit borrowers. Loan modifications may be less costly for investors than foreclosure, but servicers may be hesitant to take such actions. One way to address the issue of mortgage modifications is to provide a safe harbor for servicers, protecting them from lawsuits by investors. The safe harbor provision in the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009 allowed servicers to modify mortgages without fear of legal repercussions until December 31, 2012. The Helping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009 provided a safe harbor for servicers to modify mortgages without legal repercussions until December 31, 2012. The legislation specified that the safe harbor does not protect servicers from liability for fraud. HAMP and other foreclosure prevention programs helped standardize mortgage modifications and the net present value test in programs like HAMP ensures modifications are in the best interest of investors. Loan modification programs have faced challenges due to high delinquencies and limited resources for lenders and servicers. Loan modification programs have faced challenges since 2007 due to high delinquencies and limited resources for lenders and servicers. Contacting borrowers and working out individual loan modifications can overwhelm their capacity, especially with the complexity of mortgage modification programs. Streamlined plans using a formula to modify loans meeting certain criteria may help lenders and servicers assist more borrowers in less time, but they may also encounter contractual issues between servicers and investors. Mortgage servicers may face conflicts with investors over modifying loans or pursuing foreclosure due to compensation structures. Servicers are obligated to act in the best interest of investors but may have restrictions on modifying loans in contracts. Incentives exist for servicers to service mortgages in the best interest of investors. Some suggest that mortgage servicers' compensation structures may incentivize pursuing foreclosure over loan modification, potentially not aligning with investors' best interests. Programs like HAMP offer payments for modifications, but critics argue they may not fully align servicers' incentives. In 2011, FHFA and HUD initiated a joint effort to explore alternative compensation structures for servicers. A joint initiative was announced to consider alternative servicer compensation structures for loan modification programs. Concerns arise over the possibility of homeowners defaulting again in the future despite modifications, impacting lenders, investors, and borrowers. Data from the OCC shows improved redefault rates for modified mortgages. According to the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), redefault rates for modified mortgages have significantly improved over the years. For loans modified in 2008, nearly 45% were delinquent again six months after modification, compared to only about 13% for loans modified in 2012. Factors contributing to this improvement include changes in loan modification types, better responses from mortgage servicers, and a healthier housing market. The report from the Comptroller of the Currency shows redefault rates for modified mortgages based on changes in monthly payments. Loans with reduced payments of 20% or more had a 15% redefault rate after 12 months, compared to 33% for loans with increased payments. Lowering monthly payments seems to result in better performance, but a significant number still become delinquent. Despite lower monthly payments, a significant number of modified loans still become delinquent again. Loan modification programs may incentivize borrowers to intentionally miss payments to qualify for better terms. Proving intention can be challenging, but programs reaching out to distressed borrowers early may reduce this incentive. Opponents argue against helping homeowners who have fallen behind on their mortgages. Some argue against helping homeowners who have fallen behind on their mortgages, citing fairness concerns. Supporters of loan modification plans highlight reasons for foreclosure beyond borrowers' control, such as deceptive lending practices. Foreclosure prevention programs aim to mitigate neighborhood impacts like property value depreciation. Loan modification programs also target borrowers struggling to make payments but not yet delinquent. Some opponents of government loan modification programs argue that changing mortgage terms retroactively could deter lenders from providing loans in the future. Existing programs limit scope by applying only to specific mortgages originated within a certain timeframe. Some policymakers and advocates have urged wider use of principal reduction to assist troubled borrowers, with mortgages not backed by government agencies eligible for this option. About 25% of mortgages modified in the third quarter of 2015 included principal reduction. Advocates of principal reduction argue that increasing its use could prevent foreclosures by aligning borrower debt with home value, giving borrowers more incentive to stay current on their modified mortgage. Reducing principal can benefit mortgage holders and over 3 million homes with mortgages were in negative equity as of the fourth quarter of 2016. Advocates of principal reduction argue that it can prevent foreclosures by aligning borrower debt with home value, giving borrowers more incentive to stay current on their modified mortgage. Some oppose widespread principal reduction, citing concerns about fairness and moral hazard. Programs like HAMP Principal Reduction Alternative offer incentives for reducing mortgage principal, but not all mortgages are eligible for this option. In April 2016, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac announced a limited principal reduction modification for eligible borrowers with mortgages backed by them. Servicers sent letters to eligible borrowers, with a deadline of December 31, 2016. Approximately 33,000 borrowers were estimated to be eligible for this initiative. Several foreclosure prevention initiatives were also introduced in response to the housing market turmoil that began in 2007-2008. In response to the housing market turmoil starting in 2007-2008, various programs were introduced, including the Emergency Homeowners Loan Program, Hope for Homeowners, FHASecure, and others. These initiatives expired between 2008 and 2011, with some borrowers continuing to receive assistance if they enrolled before the program's end date. The Dodd-Frank Act in 2010 allocated up to $1 billion for HUD to administer a program for homeowners. Obama in July 2010 allocated up to $1 billion for HUD to administer the Emergency Homeowners Loan Program (EHLP) to provide short-term loans to troubled borrowers facing income loss. EHLP funds were distributed to 32 states and Puerto Rico not covered by the Hardest Hit Fund. The program offered zero-interest loans up to $50,000 to help with mortgage arrears and payments for up to 24 months. EHLP ended in September 2011. The EHLP program provided short-term loans of up to $50,000 to eligible borrowers facing income loss. Borrowers had to meet specific conditions, including having a household income of 120% or less of the area median income before the financial hardship, being delinquent on mortgage payments, and having a plan to resume full payments within two years. The EHLP program provided short-term loans of up to $50,000 to eligible borrowers facing income loss. Borrowers had to meet specific conditions, including having a household income of 120% or less of the area median income before the financial hardship, being delinquent on mortgage payments, and having a plan to resume full payments within two years. Borrowers were required to contribute 31% of their monthly gross income to monthly payments on the first mortgage and report any changes in income or employment status. Assistance ends when the maximum amount is reached, income level reaches 85% or more of pre-hardship income, homeowner no longer resides in the property, defaults on mortgage payments, or fails to report changes in employment status or income. Borrowers are not required to make payments on EHLP loans for five years as long as they remain in the property. The EHLP program provided short-term loans of up to $50,000 to eligible borrowers facing income loss.

Borrowers are not required to make payments on EHLP loans for five years as long as they remain in the property. The EHLP loans decline by 20% annually until the debt is extinguished at the end of five years, with borrowers responsible for repayment under certain circumstances. HUD has not released final data on participant numbers, but reports suggest between 10,000 and 15,000 borrowers may have been assisted, with only about half of the funding allocated ultimately being spent. Participation may have been lower than anticipated due to program delays and difficulty meeting eligibility criteria. The Hope for Homeowners (H4H) program was created by Congress in 2008 to help certain borrowers refinance into new mortgages insured by FHA. It was voluntary for both borrowers and lenders and ran from October 2008 to September 2011. To qualify, borrowers had to meet specific requirements such as having a mortgage originated before January 1, 2008, mortgage payments exceeding 31% of gross monthly income, not owning another home, and not intentionally defaulting on a mortgage or substantial debt in the last five years. Under the Hope for Homeowners program, eligible borrowers had to meet specific criteria such as not defaulting on a mortgage or substantial debt in the last five years, no fraud convictions in the last 10 years, and not providing false information to obtain the original mortgage. The lender would write down the mortgage to a percentage of the home's appraised value, and the borrower would receive a new FHA-insured loan. The new mortgage was a 30-year fixed-rate loan with no prepayment penalties, capped at $550,440. Homeowners paid mortgage insurance premiums to FHA, and second lien-holders had to release their liens. An exit premium had to be paid to HUD when the home was sold or refinanced, based on the initial equity after the H4H refinance. HUD made changes to the Hope for Homeowners program authorized by Congress, including lowering mortgage insurance premiums, adjusting loan-to-value ratios, offering payments to second lien-holders, and replacing equity sharing with an exit premium. The Hope for Homeowners program underwent changes by HUD, replacing equity sharing with an exit premium and making eligibility limited to borrowers with a certain net worth. The program aimed to help homeowners avoid foreclosure, but only about 760 borrowers refinanced through it. Some suggested that the program's complexity deterred more borrowers and lenders from participating. Additionally, the FHASecure program by the Federal Housing Administration allowed delinquent borrowers with non-FHA ARMs to refinance into FHA-insured fixed-rate mortgages. The FHASecure program by the Federal Housing Administration offered better loan terms to borrowers with non-FHA ARMs, helping them avoid steep payment increases or reduce monthly payments. The program expired on December 31, 2008, and had eligibility criteria including being delinquent due to the loan reset, having sufficient income, and meeting standard FHA underwriting criteria. In July 2008, FHA expanded eligibility to include borrowers delinquent for reasons other than the mortgage reset. FHASecure, a program by the Federal Housing Administration, expired on December 31, 2008. Some advocated for its extension, but HUD officials deemed it too costly. The program helped borrowers avoid foreclosure by offering better loan terms. About 4,000 loans were refinanced through FHASecure before its expiration. The IndyMac loan modification program, established after the closure of IndyMac Federal Savings Bank in 2008, aimed to assist borrowers with seriously delinquent mortgages. The program's criteria were stringent, potentially limiting participation. Many features of this program were later incorporated into the HAMP program. To be eligible for a loan modification under the IndyMac program, the borrower's mortgage must have been for their primary residence and they had to show current income information proving financial hardship. The FDIC conducted a net present value test to determine if modifying the loan would be more beneficial than foreclosure. If eligible, the loan would be modified to achieve a 38% debt-to-income ratio by adjusting the interest rate, extending the loan period, forbearing principal, or a combination. The interest rate would be set at the Freddie Mac survey rate, with a possible reduction for up to five years to reach the 38% ratio. The FDIC completed the sale of IndyMac to OneWest Bank on March 19, 2009, with OneWest agreeing to continue the loan modification program. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac announced a Streamlined Modification Program for troubled borrowers in November 2008. The Streamlined Modification Program (SMP) was introduced by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to assist troubled borrowers through loan modifications. It required borrowers to meet specific criteria such as having a mortgage originated before January 1, 2008, a loan-to-value ratio of at least 90%, and having missed at least three mortgage payments. The SMP was later replaced by the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) in February 2009. The Streamlined Modification Program (SMP) was introduced by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to assist troubled borrowers through loan modifications. Borrowers had to meet specific criteria and could not have filed for bankruptcy. Mortgages insured or guaranteed by the federal government were not eligible for the SMP. Qualified borrowers had their monthly mortgage payments lowered to achieve a 38% mortgage debt-to-income ratio. After a three-month trial period, the loan modification automatically took effect. Servicers followed a specific formula to reach the target DTI ratio. The Streamlined Modification Program (SMP) by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac aimed to help troubled borrowers through loan modifications. Borrowers had to meet specific criteria and could not have filed for bankruptcy. Mortgages insured or guaranteed by the federal government were not eligible. Monthly mortgage payments were lowered to achieve a 38% debt-to-income ratio. If the ratio was still above 38%, options included extending the loan term, adjusting the interest rate, or offering principal forbearance. Principal forgiveness was not allowed. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac paid servicers $800 for each completed modification. If the SMP didn't result in an affordable payment, servicers were to customize solutions for borrowers. Between January 2009 and April 2009, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac completed over 51,000 loan modifications through the Streamlined Modification Program (SMP). However, it is unclear how many of these modifications were specifically done through the SMP before they transitioned to the Making Home Affordable program."
