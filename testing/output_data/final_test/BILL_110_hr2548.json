    "content": "The Act titled \"Marine Vessel Emissions Reduction Act of 2007\" is cited as the short title. Congress finds that emissions from marine vessels significantly contribute to dangerous air pollution in the US. Current control levels are inadequate to protect air quality. Federal intervention is needed to augment state and local efforts. The EPA must establish stricter standards for emission reductions from domestic and international vessels entering US ports. The Environmental Protection Agency must set emission standards for marine vessels to reduce air pollutants and meet air quality standards nationwide. SEC. 3. MARINE VESSEL FUEL SULFUR. Section 211 of the Clean Air Act is amended to require marine vessels to use fuel with no more than 1,000 parts per million of sulfur in their engines by December 31, 2010. Marine vessels entering or leaving US ports must comply with regulations on sulfur content in fuel within specified distances from the coastlines. The Administrator may establish interim requirements for vessels flagged in countries other than the US. Regulations may allow marine vessels to exceed 1,000 parts per million sulfur content in fuel if compliance is not technically feasible by December 31, 2010. If so, the Administrator must create regulations mandating the use of the lowest feasible sulfur quantity in fuel starting from that date. The Administrator may allow marine vessels to exceed 1,000 parts per million sulfur content in fuel if compliance is not technically feasible by December 31, 2010. Alternative compliance mechanisms can be provided if vessels use control technology to reduce emissions to the same degree as sulfur reduction requirements. Compliance with sulfur limits should be achieved at the earliest feasible date. The vessel can exceed 1,000 parts per million sulfur content in fuel if compliance is not technically feasible by December 31, 2010. Emission reductions achieved through compliance with fuel sulfur content limitations are additional to any reductions required for engine emission standards. This subsection does not limit the Administrator's authority to regulate fuels for marine vessels or other nonroad vehicles. SEC. 4. ADVANCED MARINE VESSEL EMISSION CONTROLS. Section 213 of the Clean Air Act is amended to include Advanced Marine Vessel Emission Controls for oceangoing vessels, with regulations for emissions standards of various pollutants from engines. The Clean Air Act is amended to include regulations for emissions standards for engines on oceangoing vessels, with a focus on achieving the greatest emission reduction achievable through technology. Factors considered include whether the engine is newly manufactured or in-use, and the age of the engine. The Clean Air Act is amended to include regulations for emissions standards for engines on oceangoing vessels, focusing on achieving maximum emission reduction through technology. Factors considered include cost, feasibility, benefits, and safety factors associated with applying emission reduction technology. The Clean Air Act is amended to include regulations for emissions standards for engines on oceangoing vessels, focusing on achieving maximum emission reduction through technology transfer and advanced aftertreatment technologies by January 1, 2012. The Administrator must establish emissions standards for oceangoing vessel engines by January 1, 2012, with the maximum achievable control level. Additional standards are required starting January 1, 2016, for further emission reductions. The Administrator must establish emissions standards for oceangoing vessel engines by January 1, 2012, with the maximum achievable control level. If a higher level of control is not technically achievable by January 1, 2016, a lower achievable level will be determined. The emissions standards for marine engines and vessels must be technically achievable by a certain date and will be enforced for vessels entering or leaving US ports, regardless of flag. Enforcement will be carried out according to specified procedures. The EPA can regulate emissions from in-use engines and those who rebuild or maintain them. This does not limit the EPA's authority to regulate marine vessel engines under this Act or other laws."
