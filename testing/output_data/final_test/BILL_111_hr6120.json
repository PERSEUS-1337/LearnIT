The Secretary of Commerce will establish a grant program to support early-stage businesses in targeted industries. Grants will be made to covered business accelerators with limitations on the amount based on non-federal capital availability. The grant program supports early-stage businesses in targeted industries by providing grants to covered business accelerators with a maximum aggregate amount of $5,000,000. Grants can be used for making investments in early-stage businesses in the specified industries. The grant program supports early-stage businesses in targeted industries by providing training, counseling, investments, and support for proof of concept activities. Additionally, it covers purchased services, due diligence activities, and operational expenses. There is a limitation of not more than 40 percent of the grant amount for proof of concept activities. The grant program allows a covered business accelerator to use a percentage of the grant for proof of concept activities, purchased services, due diligence activities, and operational expenses. The covered business accelerator can use a portion of the grant for operational expenses and must specify the percentage allocated for different activities when applying for the grant. Additionally, a designated fund manager is required to administer the grant and provide information to the Secretary. As a condition of receiving a grant under the program, a covered business accelerator must establish an investment review process involving at least 5 individuals to evaluate grant funds usage, provide letters of support to the Secretary, and submit reports on activities. The covered business accelerator must assign a collaborator to each early-stage business assisted with grant amounts. The Federal share of activities shall not exceed 75 percent. The Secretary will assess the effectiveness of accelerators receiving grants under the program.
