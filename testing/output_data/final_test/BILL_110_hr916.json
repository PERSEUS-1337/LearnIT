    "content": "The Act titled \"John R. Justice Prosecutors and Defenders Incentive Act of 2007\" amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to include loan repayment for prosecutors and public defenders. Grant authorization is provided under Section 3111. The purpose of this section is to encourage qualified individuals to enter and continue employment as prosecutors and public defenders. Definitions include a prosecutor as a licensed employee who prosecutes criminal cases, and a public defender as a licensed attorney who provides legal representation as a full-time employee of a State or local agency. The curr_chunk discusses individuals who provide legal representation to indigent persons in criminal or juvenile delinquency cases. This includes attorneys who supervise, educate, or train others in providing such representation. The curr_chunk defines the term 'student loan' as a loan under specific parts of the Higher Education Act of 1965. The Attorney General will establish a program to repay student loans for prosecutors and public defenders who are not in default on their loans. The borrower must agree to remain employed as a prosecutor or public defender for at least 3 years to receive loan repayment benefits. If they voluntarily leave or are separated due to misconduct, they must repay the benefits received. The borrower must agree to remain employed as a prosecutor or public defender for at least 3 years to receive loan repayment benefits. If they voluntarily leave or are separated due to misconduct, they must repay the benefits received. Repayment by the borrower includes recovering the amount owed to the Attorney General, with the Federal Government able to recover the sum from the employee or their estate if not repaid. Any amount repaid or recovered will be credited back to the original appropriation account. The Attorney General may merge credited amounts for the same purposes and period as other sums in the account. Recovery under this subsection may be waived if against equity or public interest. Student loan repayments are subject to availability of appropriations and limitations. The Attorney General may reimburse borrowers up to $10,000 per year or $60,000 in total, subject to mutual agreement. Payments cannot be made for repayments made before the agreement date. On completion of the required service period, the borrower and Attorney General may enter into an additional agreement for less than 3 years. Repayment benefits are subject to availability of funds and fair allocation by the Attorney General. The Attorney General determines fair allocation of repayment benefits among prosecutors, defenders, and employing entities nationwide. Priority is given to borrowers with the least ability to repay their student loans or those who received benefits in the previous fiscal year and completed less than 3 years of service. The Attorney General is authorized to issue regulations for the program. The Inspector General will report on the cost and impact of the program, while the Comptroller General will conduct a study. The Comptroller General will conduct a study and report to Congress on the impact of law school accreditation requirements on the costs and access to law school, including the effects on racial and ethnic minorities. $25,000,000 is authorized for this section annually from 2008 to 2013. The House of Representatives passed the bill on May 15, 2007."
