Congress finds that long-range strike capabilities are crucial for the United States to maintain dominance and credibility. These systems offer a hedge against political restrictions on forward bases, the ability to respond quickly to emergencies, and the capacity to operate beyond enemy anti-access capabilities. Additionally, they allow for imposing significant defensive costs on potential adversaries. The Air Force is developing a new long-range strike capability to be ready by 2018. Secretary of Defense Robert P. Gates has emphasized the need for a next-generation bomber to counter potential threats from China. The Air Force is developing a new long-range strike capability to counter potential threats from China, including investments in cyberwarfare, antisatellite warfare, antiaircraft and antiship weaponry, submarines, and ballistic missiles. This will require shifts to longer-range systems like the next generation bomber. The United States is focusing on its ability to strike from over the horizon and employ missile defenses, especially in response to potential threats from China. Secretary Gates emphasized the importance of investing in cyber and antisatellite warfare, anti-air and anti-ship weaponry, submarines, and ballistic missiles to protect America's ability to project power in the Pacific. This will require a shift to longer-range systems like the next generation bomber. On April 6, 2009, Secretary Gates announced the United States will not pursue a follow-on Air Force bomber development program until better understanding of the need, requirement, and technology. President Obama terminated the next generation bomber program on May 7, 2009, stating there is no urgent need for an expensive new bomber development program. The 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review outlined the need for a new bomber fleet, citing the urgency of a long-range strike capability in future conflicts with heavily defended airspace. General Michael Maples highlighted Russia's role in developing sophisticated air defense systems during a Senate hearing on worldwide threats. The commanders of Pacific Command, Strategic Command, and Joint Forces Command testified in support of the next generation bomber's capability before the Senate Armed Services Committee. Nearly half of the US bomber inventory predates the Cuban Missile Crisis. The US currently only has 16 combat-ready B-2 bombers capable of executing missions over 1,000 nautical miles into enemy territory. The B-2 bomber, designed in the 1980s, is crucial for global power projection. A crash in 2008 highlighted the risk of attrition. The next generation bomber must have the capability to strike targets worldwide with advanced technologies already available. Delaying or canceling this bomber would weaken US global power projection. The United States policy is to develop the next generation bomber in fiscal year 2010 without delays due to other defense reviews or negotiations."
