The December 2004 National Intelligence Council report predicts that global economic growth, especially in China and India, will drive the demand for energy. India's current economic growth rate is around 7% of GDP, and it will need to double its energy consumption in the next 15 years to sustain this growth. The US and India initiated an energy dialogue in 2005 to enhance energy cooperation and promote trade and investment in the sector. India, as the sixth largest energy consumer globally, relies on imports for 70% of its oil demand and has a robust oil and gas exploration program. The country made significant discoveries in natural gas in 2002 and oil in 2003. Under Secretary of Energy David Garman emphasized the importance of US-India collaboration in ensuring stability in global energy markets during his testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 2005. In 2003, the largest oil discovery in the world occurred in Rajasthan, India. External funding is needed to maximize recovery from oil fields, but an improved investment environment is necessary to attract such investment. India is the world's third largest coal producer and relies on coal for energy, but many coal-fired plants lack pollution control equipment. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh emphasized the importance of greater access for developing countries in a speech to the US Congress in 2005. India emphasizes the importance of clean coal technologies and efficient energy use, including plans for a strategic crude oil reserve. US experts stress the need for collaboration on energy technologies and research with other countries. India emphasizes the importance of clean coal technologies, efficient energy use, and plans for a strategic crude oil reserve. The US experts highlight the need for collaboration on energy technologies and research with other countries, as well as expanding the global network of strategic petroleum reserves. The United States policy aims to cooperate with India on energy challenges, promote dialogue on national energy policies, and collaborate on energy research for global energy security. Assistance is provided to support this energy cooperation. The President is authorized to establish programs for energy cooperation between the United States and India, including research on clean coal, alternative fuel sources, energy efficiency, and strategic oil reserves in India. The Government of India has established a strategic oil reserve to manage short-term disruptions in global oil supplies without impacting India's market or the global market.
