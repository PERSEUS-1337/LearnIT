    "content": "The Act titled \"Andean Adjustment Act of 2003\" allows for the adjustment of status for certain Colombian and Peruvian nationals. The Andean Adjustment Act of 2003 allows for the adjustment of status for certain aliens to lawful permanent residence, with specific eligibility criteria and exceptions to inadmissibility grounds. The Andean Adjustment Act of 2003 allows certain aliens in the United States to apply for adjustment of status under specific conditions, regardless of previous exclusion or deportation orders. If approved, the Secretary of Homeland Security will cancel the order; if denied, the order remains in place. The Andean Adjustment Act of 2003 allows nationals of Colombia or Peru present in the US on specific dates to apply for adjustment of status. The Secretary of Homeland Security can provide a stay of removal for those with final deportation orders based on the application. The Andean Adjustment Act of 2003 allows Colombian or Peruvian nationals in the US to apply for adjustment of status. The Secretary of Homeland Security can halt removal proceedings for those in deportation proceedings who are eligible to apply for adjustment of status, and may authorize employment during the application process. The Secretary of Homeland Security can authorize employment for aliens and their spouses during the adjustment of status application process. If the application is pending for over 180 days without denial, employment authorization must be granted. Additionally, spouses, children, and unmarried sons or daughters of aliens whose status is adjusted to permanent residence can also have their status adjusted. An unmarried son or daughter of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence must prove continuous physical presence in the US from December 31, 1999, until the application for adjustment is filed. The application must be submitted within 2 years of the enactment of the Act, while being physically present in the US and meeting all other eligibility requirements for an immigrant visa. For adjustment of status under subsection (a), the alien must prove continuous physical presence in the US, with absences not exceeding 180 days in total. The Secretary of Homeland Security will provide administrative review rights and procedures to applicants. Under subsection (a), aliens have the same right to administrative review as applicants for adjustment of status under section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act or aliens in removal proceedings under section 240. The Secretary of Homeland Security's determination on alien status adjustment is final and not subject to judicial review. When an alien is granted permanent residence status, the Secretary of State is not required to reduce the number of immigrant visas available. The Immigration and Nationality Act provisions apply to the administration of this Act, without affecting the Secretary of Homeland Security's authority. Eligibility for permanent residence status under this Act does not prevent an alien from seeking it under other laws."
