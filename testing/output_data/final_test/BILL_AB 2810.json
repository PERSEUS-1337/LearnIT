    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 1812.82 of the Civil Code is amended to require written contracts for health studio services to be provided to customers at the time of signing. Section 1812.84 limits the duration and payment terms of health studio service contracts, with a maximum term of three years and restrictions on exceeding payment terms. A contract for health studio services must disclose the contract length in a prominent manner. The buyer can cancel the contract in person, via email, or first-class mail. Section 1812.85 of the Civil Code requires health studio contracts to start services within six months. Consumers can cancel and get a refund if facilities are not provided as advertised. If no timeline is specified, cancellation is allowed within six months. If the studio fails to meet the timeline, cancellation is permitted. If services are provided after the timeline, consumers have 10 days to cancel. Every health studio contract must include a prominent statement near the buyer's signature area in 10-point boldface type. \"You, the buyer, may cancel this agreement within five business days by sending a signed notice to the health studio operator.\" The contract for health studio services must include the operator's address, email address for cancellation, and the date signed by the buyer. The contract for health studio services must include a description of services, facilities, and hours of access. If this information is not provided, optional services are considered separate contracts. The buyer can cancel the contract until this information is provided, and any payments made must be refunded within 10 days of cancellation. If the health studio reduces facilities described in the contract, the consumer can cancel and receive a refund. Temporary closures for repairs are exempt. Changes to classes or equipment do not qualify for cancellation. The health studio can make changes to classes or equipment offered as long as it is reasonable, and consumers must be informed in the contract. If a contract for health studio services requires payment between $1,500 to $2,000, the person can cancel within 20 days. For contracts between $2,001 to $2,500, the cancellation period is 30 days. If a contract for health studio services requires payment of $2,501 or more, the person has the right to cancel within 45 days. The right of cancellation must be stated in the membership contract. This right is in addition to any other legal rights and remedies. A health studio is not required to comply with certain cancellation requirements for contracts under $1,500. Upon cancellation, the consumer is only responsible for the portion of the total contract payment that has been used, calculated on a pro rata basis. The health studio must refund the remaining portion of the contract payment to the consumer."
