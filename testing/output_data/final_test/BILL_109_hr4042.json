    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Ambulatory Surgical Center Medicare Payment Modernization Act of 2005\". Medicare payment for ambulatory surgical center services. Payment for facility services in ambulatory surgical centers for outpatient surgical procedures covered under Medicare will be made in accordance with specified amounts, except for procedures designated by the Secretary as posing safety risks or requiring overnight stays in such centers. The Secretary will review and adjust the list of excluded procedures at least once every two years after public input. The payment for facility services in ambulatory surgical centers under Medicare is set at 75% of the fee schedule amount for the same service in hospital outpatient departments, with a 20% beneficiary copayment. This applies to covered services from 2008 to 2012, with adjustments made by the Secretary as necessary. The 2007 ASC payment amount is less than 75% of the hospital OPD fee schedule amount for the same services. Payment for services in 2008 and 2009 is calculated based on a percentage increase in the consumer price index and the payment amount under paragraph (2)(A) for 2008. For services in 2008 and 2009, payment is calculated based on a percentage increase in the consumer price index and the payment amount under paragraph (2)(A) for 2008. For services in 2010, payment is calculated based on a different formula involving the 2007 ASC payment amount and the consumer price index. For services in 2011, payment is calculated based on a formula involving the 2007 ASC payment amount, the consumer price index increase, and the payment amount under paragraph (2)(A) for 2011. Payment for covered ambulatory surgical center services in 2011 is determined by comparing the 2007 ASC payment amount to the hospital OPD fee schedule amount. If the ASC payment amount is between 75% and 100% of the OPD fee schedule amount, the payment will be the greater of the 2007 ASC payment amount or the payment amounts specified for services in 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011 under subparagraph (B). In 2012 and subsequent years, payment for ambulatory surgical center services is capped at the hospital OPD fee schedule amount. If the payment amount exceeds the 2007 hospital OPD fee schedule amount, the payment is determined based on a formula involving the ASC payment amount and the hospital OPD fee schedule amount. In 2012 and beyond, payment for ambulatory surgical center services is limited to the hospital OPD fee schedule amount. Amendments are made to sections of the Act to adjust payment calculations accordingly. Amendments are made to sections of the Act regarding ambulatory surgical center services, including adjustments to payment calculations. The effective date for these changes is January 1, 2008."
