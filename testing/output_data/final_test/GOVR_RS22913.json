Additionally, USAID manages its own bilateral health programs. Since its creation in 1961, USAID has seen increased congressional support for global health programs, with funding rising from $1.4 billion in FY2001 to $2.5 billion in FY2011. The George W. Bush Administration saw significant growth in funding to combat diseases like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, SARS, bird flu, and pandemic flu. Congressional support also followed the launch of presidential health initiatives like PEPFAR. Congressional support for global health programs has increased since USAID's creation in 1961, with funding rising from $1.4 billion in FY2001 to $2.5 billion in FY2011. The George W. Bush Administration saw growth in funding to combat diseases like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, SARS, bird flu, and pandemic flu. Presidential health initiatives like PEPFAR also received congressional support. Congress funds USAID's global health activities through the State-Foreign Operations appropriations, with additional funds provided through other accounts for various global health programs. Congress specifies support for five USAID global health program areas, including Child Survival and Maternal Health. The USAID global health program areas include Child Survival and Maternal Health, Vulnerable Children, HIV/AIDS, Other Infectious Diseases, and Family Planning and Reproductive Health. These programs aim to reduce morbidity and mortality, provide services to vulnerable populations, prevent and treat diseases like HIV/AIDS, address outbreaks, and promote family planning and reproductive health. The Global Health Initiative, announced by President Barack Obama in 2009, aims to increase access to family planning and reproductive health services, improve awareness about birth spacing and contraception, and address infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS, malaria, pandemic influenza, and tuberculosis. Funding for these programs has been increasing, with a focus on balancing efforts to combat infectious diseases with other health challenges such as high maternal and child mortality rates and neglected tropical diseases. President Barack Obama announced the Global Health Initiative in 2009 to increase investments in underfunded health areas, strengthen weak health systems, and improve coordination of health initiatives. Congress has generally supported these efforts and provided $2.5 billion to USAID for global health programs in FY2011. Funding details for FY2011 remain unclear as of June 28, 2011. The bulk of U.S. global health assistance focuses on combating infectious diseases through initiatives like PEPFAR, PMI, and the NTD Program. The Global Health Initiative aims to coordinate existing efforts and improve the effectiveness of U.S. global health programs. USAID plays a key role in implementing and coordinating these initiatives. In January 2003, President Bush announced PEPFAR, a government-wide initiative to combat global HIV/AIDS. PEPFAR supports HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, and care activities with a $15 billion authorization in FY2004 and an additional $48 billion in 2008. PEPFAR is overseen by the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator at the State Department. PEPFAR, overseen by the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator at the State Department, transfers resources to implementing agencies and organizations like the Global Fund and UNAIDS for global HIV/AIDS efforts. USAID accounted for half of PEPFAR obligations from FY2004 to FY2010, supporting HIV treatments for over 3.2 million people and medicine for 600,000 HIV-positive pregnant women. President Bush announced PMI in June 2005 to expand U.S. global malaria efforts with a $1.2 billion budget. The President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) was established as a $1.2 billion effort to reduce malaria-related deaths in sub-Saharan African countries through various prevention and treatment techniques. PMI expanded to include Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, aiming to halve the burden of malaria among at-risk populations in Africa. Led by USAID and CDC, PMI is overseen by the U.S. Malaria Coordinator and an Interagency Steering Group. The President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) is overseen by a group including representatives from USAID, HHS, the Department of State, DOD, NSC, and OMB. From FY2005 to FY2010, USAID allocated $1.4 billion for PMI activities. By December 31, 2011, USAID had provided 45.4 million insecticide-treated nets and 105.6 million malaria treatments. Additional details on PMI results can be found in the Appendix. The USAID launched the NTD Program in 2006 with a $15 million budget to combat seven NTDs. The program aimed to provide 160 million treatments to 40 million people in 15 countries. President Bush and Obama expanded the program to 30 countries, with over 387 million treatments delivered by 2011. President Obama also announced the Global Health Initiative costing $63 billion over six years. GHI aims to develop a comprehensive U.S. global health strategy for existing programs, shifting focus to address various health challenges through strengthening health systems and improving coordination. Eight countries were chosen as \"GHI Plus Countries\" to inform future U.S. global health efforts. Strategic plans are being developed in partnership with national governments to identify duplications, integrate programs, and align with national priorities. The Global Health Initiative (GHI) aims to develop a comprehensive U.S. global health strategy by coordinating with national governments. GHI is currently overseen by an executive director at the Department of State, with plans to transition leadership to USAID in FY2012. The Obama Administration requests $3.1 billion to support USAID's global health efforts. The Obama Administration requested $3.1 billion to support USAID's global health efforts through the GHCS account for FY2012. Congressional discussions and appropriations for global health were dominated by U.S. efforts to address HIV/AIDS after the launch of PEPFAR. Since the announcement of GHI in 2009, there has been a gradual increase in requests for non-HIV/AIDS programs, which Congress has fully funded. This has led to a slight shift in how USAID global health funds are distributed. The majority of USAID's global health programs are funded through the Global Health and Child Survival account, which is also used to fund the coordination of PEPFAR programs by the Department of State. Additional funds used by USAID to support global health programs through other accounts in the State-Foreign Operations appropriations are not included in the figure. The Obama Administration requested a 25% increase in funding for USAID's global health activities in FY2012, with significant increases for child survival, maternal health, neglected tropical diseases, and family planning. These increases align with the Administration's priorities under the Global Health Initiative. The George W. Bush Administration and successive Congresses have consistently funded USAID's global health programs above presidential requests. However, concerns about the U.S. economy have led some Members of Congress to question foreign aid levels, including health assistance. While some argue for cuts to save money, others warn that reducing these programs could harm vulnerable populations. Congressional debates on global health funding are part of broader discussions on foreign aid effectiveness and USAID reform. Some Members of Congress have raised concerns about the impact and effectiveness of U.S. global health investments, highlighting corruption practices in recipient governments. There are debates over the allocation of resources to global health amidst efforts to reduce government spending and the federal budget deficit. USAID is addressing these concerns over aid distribution. USAID is responding to concerns over aid effectiveness by implementing new measures such as creating a suspension and debarment task force and requesting funds for independent project evaluations. Administrator Shah announced a shift towards funding programs based on \"unit cost of impact\" to focus on efficiency and effectiveness."
