    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Midwifery Care Access and Reimbursement Equity Act of 2007\". Congress finds that since 1988, Medicare has reimbursed certified nurse-midwives for maternity-related services to eligible women with disabilities. Since 1993, reimbursements have also been authorized for additional services outside the maternity cycle. In 2002, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission recommended an increase in reimbursement for certified nurse-midwife services due to the high quality of care provided. Certified nurse-midwives are highly educated health professionals who provide high-quality care. They must complete a post-baccalaureate program, obtain state licensure, and pass a national certification exam to practice in the US. While most State Medicaid programs reimburse nurse-midwives and other providers equally, Medicare reimburses nurse-midwives 35% lower. This payment disparity limits women's access to their preferred obstetrical and gynecological providers within the Medicare program. Midwives historically care for at-risk populations with health disparities in areas such as infant mortality, preterm birth, and maternal mortality. Equitable reimbursement for certified nurse-midwives will ensure their services are available to women in need. Medicare payment for certified nurse-midwife and midwife services is addressed in Section 3. Certified midwife services are defined as services provided by a certified midwife who has completed specific education and clinical experience requirements. These services must be within the scope of practice allowed by state law and are reimbursable under Medicare. Certified midwife services must meet guidelines set by the Secretary or be certified by a recognized organization. The heading in the Social Security Act is amended accordingly. Certified Nurse-Midwife and Certified Midwife services must meet specific guidelines or be certified by a recognized organization. The Social Security Act heading is amended to include these services. Certified Midwife services are now included in the Social Security Act, allowing hospitals to provide care under the supervision of a certified midwife. Certified midwife services are now covered under the Social Security Act, allowing for care to be provided by certified midwives in hospitals. This includes amendments to sections regarding payment amounts and benefits under Part B of the Act. The Secretary of Health and Human Services must issue interim regulations within 6 months of this Act's enactment to implement the amendments. These regulations will be effective on an interim basis after public notice and comment."
