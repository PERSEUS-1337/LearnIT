This In Brief addresses Congress's interest in oversight of covert and clandestine activities. Before 1974, Congress had limited oversight of intelligence agencies. In the 1970s, controversy over public disclosure of CIA's covert action programs in Southeast Asia and domestic surveillance of the antiwar movement led Congress to become more involved in intelligence oversight. The Hughes-Ryan amendment of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 provided the first statutory basis for congressional oversight of covert action operations. Investigations by two congressional committees further enhanced oversight. In the 1970s, Congress became more involved in intelligence oversight following controversy over CIA's covert action programs and domestic surveillance. Committees chaired by Senator Frank Church and Representative Otis Pike laid the foundation for oversight, leading to the establishment of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence in 1975. Congress refined its oversight when the executive branch conducted covert operations without prior notification, such as President Carter's decision not to inform Congress about the attempted rescue of American hostages in Iran in 1980. The Reagan Administration covertly diverted funds from arms sales to Iran to support the Contras in Nicaragua without informing Congress. Congress revised procedures through the Intelligence Authorization Acts of 1981 and 1991 to ensure timely notification of covert actions. Congressional oversight of intelligence evolved, focusing on the SSCI and HPSCI, which may have been out of alignment with military and intelligence integration post-9/11. The different notification standards and processes between the intelligence and defense committees in Congress are determined by the statutory authority for intelligence and military activities. This has the potential to artificially define intelligence activities as separate from military activities, leading to uneven information for congressional committees. This could result in some activities posing similar risks in terms of compromise, loss of life, and impact. Covert action is defined as activities of the United States Government to influence conditions abroad without publicly acknowledging the US role. It excludes intelligence acquisition, counterintelligence, operational security, administrative, diplomatic, military, law enforcement, and routine support activities. Covert action aims to influence conditions abroad without overtly acknowledging the US role, focusing on military, economic, or political changes. It requires a presidential finding and notification to Congress, with activities supporting foreign policy objectives. Covert action cannot target domestic influences like political processes, public opinion, policies, or media. Covert action, historically associated with the CIA, can also be authorized for other US government entities like DOD. Offensive cyberspace operations can be considered covert action under Title 50 of the U.S. Code. Examples include the 1953 coup in Iran and support to various groups, showing a mixed record of outcomes. The term clandestine activity is not defined by statute but is defined by DOD doctrine as operations conducted to assure secrecy or concealment, including passive intelligence collection. Unlike covert action, clandestine activities do not require a presidential finding but may require notification of Congress. Clandestine activities involve tactical concealment, while covert activities involve strategic concealment of US-sponsored activities aimed at influencing overseas targets. Clandestine activities involve sensitive military operations and intelligence collection that can risk lives and damage national security. Examples include intelligence recruitment of foreign assets and military site surveillance in denied areas. These activities can be categorized as traditional military operations or support for military activities, operational preparation of the environment, and sensitive military operations. Since 9/11, military and intelligence activities have become increasingly integrated, leading Congress to focus on exceptions to covert action, such as traditional military activities and routine support. These terms were first mentioned in P.L. 102-88, the Intelligence Authorization Act for FY 1991, and have notification requirements that are less stringent than for covert action. The Intelligence Authorization Act for FY 1991, P.L. 102-88, includes exceptions to covert action, such as traditional military activities. These activities involve military personnel under a U.S. military commander's direction preceding hostilities involving U.S. forces. The Intelligence Authorization Act for FY 1991, P.L. 102-88, includes exceptions to covert action, such as traditional military activities involving U.S. military forces under a military commander's direction before hostilities. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) report for the FY1991 Intelligence Authorization Act further defines routine support as unilateral U.S. activities providing logistical or other support for U.S. military forces in publicly acknowledged military operations. The Intelligence Authorization Act for FY 1991, P.L. 102-88, includes exceptions to covert action, such as traditional military activities involving U.S. military forces under a military commander's direction before hostilities. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) report for the FY1991 Intelligence Authorization Act further defines routine support as unilateral U.S. activities providing logistical or other support for U.S. military forces in publicly acknowledged military operations. Other-than-routine support activities involve unacknowledged U.S. actions intended to influence another country's environment before a principal operation, such as clandestine recruitment or training of foreign nationals for potential military support. Operational Preparation of the Environment (OPE) involves clandestine efforts to influence foreign nationals and officials in target and third countries to support U.S. military operations. It includes activities conducted in likely areas of operations to shape the operational environment. OPE is a term frequently used by the Department of Defense (DOD) but is not defined in statute. Operational Preparation of the Environment (OPE) involves activities in potential areas of operations to shape the operational environment for future special operations. This term is frequently used by the Department of Defense (DOD) and includes clandestine efforts to influence foreign nationals and officials to support U.S. military operations. The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence expressed concern about the blurred distinction between CIA intelligence-gathering activities and DOD clandestine operations. DOD often categorizes its clandestine activities as Operational Preparation of the Environment (OPE), but the committee noted that this term has become almost meaningless due to overuse. The determination of whether an operation is classified as an intelligence activity is made case-by-case without clear guidelines. The Director of National Intelligence admits there is no clear distinction between military intelligence missions and CIA operations. Clandestine military intelligence operations, labeled as OPE, pose similar risks as traditional intelligence activities. DOD tends to apply the OPE label liberally, potentially avoiding oversight by intelligence committees. The HPSCI is concerned about the lack of oversight on intelligence activities like OPE, which hinders their ability to fulfill their oversight role as mandated by law. They direct the DOD to ensure proper scrutiny of these activities. The Committee directs DOD to provide insight and access to intelligence activities, including those funded outside the MIP, without withholding information based on technical distinctions. Sensitive military operations are defined as lethal or capture operations conducted outside active armed conflict theaters. Sensitive military operations are defined as operations targeting specific individuals or conducted by armed forces outside declared active conflict zones for self-defense or defense of foreign partners. These operations, often clandestine, have increased post-9/11, involving U.S. military intervention in countries like Yemen, Pakistan, or Somalia. Examples include lethal drone operations and military support missions for foreign security forces. Title 10 of the U.S. Code provides legal framework for DOD and military services, while Title 50 covers intelligence community roles and CIA operations. Congressional notification procedures for covert action are also outlined. Legal experts caution against the misconception that activities under Title 10 and Title 50 authorities are distinctly separate, advocating instead for a view of these authorities as mutually reinforcing. Title 10 is not the exclusive source of legal authority for military operations. Legal experts emphasize that Title 10 is not the sole legal authority for U.S. military operations, citing the President's authority under Article II of the Constitution and laws enacted by Congress. Some argue that Title 10 and Title 50 should be seen as \"mutually reinforcing\" due to the dual role of the Secretary of Defense."
