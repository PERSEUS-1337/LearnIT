Jeannette Rankin was the first woman elected to the House of Representatives in 1916, representing Montana. Her election was significant as it happened before women's suffrage was guaranteed in the United States. Jeannette Rankin contributed to women's suffrage by introducing a resolution in 1919. She remained pacifistic by voting against declarations of World War I and II. Mary Teresa Norton was the first Democratic woman elected to the House of Representatives in 1924. Mary Norton, representing New Jersey's Twelfth Congressional District from 1925 to 1951, chaired the Committee on the District of Columbia from 1931 to 1937. She became the first woman to chair a major political party in a State in 1934. Norton played a key role in passing the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1938 as part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal. Patsy Mink, a pioneering American woman in politics, served in the House of Representatives for Hawaii's Second Congressional District from 1965 to 1977 and again from 1991 until her passing in 2002. She was known for her work on the Committee on Education and Labor, where she introduced bills for child care, bilingual education, student loans, special education, and the Head Start program. Mink also secured legislation in 1965 to support school construction in the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands and established the Democratic Women's Caucus in 1995. Shirley Anita St. Hill Chisholm, the first African-American woman elected to the House of Representatives in 1968, was a fierce advocate for women's rights, democracy, and equal rights. She was a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus and sought the Democratic Party's nomination for President in 1972. There is a need to honor women like Shirley Anita St. Hill Chisholm more often in our Nation's artistic and cultural venues. SEC. 3. SPECIAL POSTAGE STAMP.
