    "content": "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are popular investment vehicles that allow investors to pool money in a fund investing in various financial assets. Introduced in 1993, ETFs have grown significantly, with global ETP assets reaching $4.8 trillion in 2018. U.S. ETFs dominate the market, with 1,832 ETFs totaling $3.4 trillion in assets under management. The growth of ETFs is attributed to their low costs, fee savings, and competitive investment returns. ETFs offer low costs, fee savings, and competitive investment returns compared to mutual funds. They also provide U.S. tax efficiency, exchange-trading advantages, portfolio hedging, and diversification benefits. The report discusses technical aspects of ETFs, policy issues, and comparisons to mutual funds. ETFs and mutual funds are both SEC-registered investment companies that pool money from investors to invest in a portfolio of assets. ETFs can be traded on exchanges, while mutual funds are bought or sold through fund companies or intermediaries. ETFs combine features of mutual funds and stocks, allowing for trading of a basket of assets at once for price transparency. ETF sponsors assemble a collection of securities and divide them into tradable units. ETFs are created by assembling a basket of securities and dividing them into tradable shares. Unlike mutual funds, ETFs involve authorized participants in a unique creation and redemption process. Public investors buy and sell ETF shares, which represent exposure to the underlying securities. The ETF architecture includes a primary market for assembling securities and a secondary market for trading shares. Dealer inventory adds liquidity to the ETF market. In the ETF creation process, authorized participants (APs) assemble and deliver a basket of securities to the ETF sponsor, who then issues new ETF shares to the AP. These shares can be sold on a stock exchange to investors. The redemption process is the reverse, with APs transferring ETF shares to sponsors in exchange for securities. ETF shares are created and redeemed by APs in the primary market, with sponsors issuing shares in large blocks called \"creation units.\" The process often involves the exchange of securities for shares \"in-kind\" rather than cash. ETF shares are exchanged for a basket of securities instead of cash settlements, with only authorized participants able to create or redeem shares. ETF liquidity on exchanges is driven by supply and demand of public secondary market participants, unlike mutual funds. Most ETF shares trade on exchanges in the secondary market, with $2.1 trillion in total U.S. ETFs involved in around $18 trillion of secondary market transactions. In the 12 months ending June 2015, around $18 trillion of secondary market transactions involved $2.1 trillion in total U.S. ETFs. Secondary market liquidity is considered additive, as ETFs' liquidity is as great as their underlying assets without requiring underlying securities transactions. Large broker-dealers serving as market makers assemble their own inventory of ETF shares through direct contacts with APs for price quotes, providing \"nondisplayed\" liquidity. This allows for multiple quotes for investors to transact, with market makers publishing quotes beyond the national best bid and offer quotes to facilitate smoother execution of larger trades. The market-making process in ETFs involves aligning share trading prices with underlying NAV through arbitrage. This process allows for smoother execution of larger trades by capturing price imbalances between primary and secondary markets. Arbitrageurs can profit from these differences without additional risks by buying or selling ETF shares simultaneously. Arbitrageurs use creation units in the primary market and open-market operations in the secondary market to align ETF share prices with underlying assets. They buy underlying securities when ETF prices are high and exchange them for shares, creating new supply and demand dynamics. When ETF shares trade below NAV, arbitrageurs purchase shares and exchange them for securities to bridge the price gap. APs are not obligated to create or redeem shares for arbitrage activities. The APs are not obligated to create or redeem shares for arbitrage activities in ETFs. In times of market stress, ETFs may trade like closed-end funds, which offer secondary-market liquidity but cannot create or redeem shares. This could widen arbitrage opportunities, attracting new APs to resume creation and redemption. The first U.S. ETF was introduced in 1993 to track the S&P 500 index. ETFs were innovative products that did not fit existing regulatory schemes for securities, investment companies, or listing standards. They operate within a \"patchwork\" of regulations, registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. ETFs combine characteristics of mutual funds and stocks but require exemptive reliefs from various statutory provisions to offer. ETFs often obtain exemptions from certain structural and operational requirements under the SEC 1940 Act that are not consistent with their operations. The 1940 Act focuses on disclosure as well as direct regulation and the principle that investment companies should act in the interests of their investors to minimize conflicts of interest. Companies must act in the interests of their investors to minimize conflicts of interest. ETF shares must be registered under the SEC Securities Act and comply with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Broker-dealers recommending ETF purchases are subject to FINRA regulations, including suitability analysis and fair communication. Some ETFs are not registered under the 1940 Act. A small number of ETFs, representing 2% of the U.S. ETF market, are not registered under the 1940 Act. These ETFs primarily invest in commodities, currencies, and futures, and are regulated under securities regulations. Certain commodity pool ETFs could also be subject to the Commodity Exchange Act and be governed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). In 2017, the Department of the Treasury recommended that the SEC adopt a rule for plain-vanilla ETFs to reduce costs and delays for new entrants. The SEC proposed a new ETF approval process on June 28, 2018, aiming to streamline ETF approvals and replace individual exemptive orders with a single rule for index-based and actively managed open-end ETFs. The proposed rule excludes leveraged and inverse ETFs, stating they cannot rely on it. The SEC's proposed new ETF approval process aims to streamline approvals and replace individual exemptive orders with a single rule for index-based and actively managed open-end ETFs. Excluded from the process are leveraged ETFs, as the SEC has not approved new exemptive relief for them since 2009. The proposal also includes conditions for in-scope ETFs, such as daily portfolio transparency and website disclosure of key risk-related data. The SEC anticipates the new rule will create a more efficient approval process and level the playing field for new entrants in the ETF industry. The SEC's proposed new ETF approval process aims to streamline approvals and create a leveled playing field for new entrants in the industry. The ETF proposal may have implications for financial stability concerns, investor protection, and passive versus active investment styles. With U.S. ETFs holding over $3.4 trillion in assets under management, their scale and growth raise financial stability considerations. ETFs' involvement in future financial crises is uncertain, as they could either be affected or amplify the crisis. Their ability to provide liquidity for less-liquid assets allows for higher-risk investment strategies. With a larger market share and more complex instruments than a decade ago, some believe ETFs have not yet faced a severe market downturn. Issues like \"liquidity mismatch\" and market tests are discussed, along with concerns about high-risk products and issuer stability. The curr_chunk discusses liquidity mismatch in ETFs, highlighting the difference between secondary and primary market liquidity. While ETFs generally increase liquidity through secondary-market trading, concerns arise during market downturns when liquidity decreases. This mismatch poses challenges for investors looking to sell illiquid ETF shares for cash. The curr_chunk discusses how liquidity mismatch in ETFs can pose challenges for investors, potentially leading to systemic risks such as contagion risk and fire sales. This risk is more likely to occur in ETFs with less-liquid assets, which can amplify price movements during periods of stress. In ETFs with liquid shares and illiquid/volatile assets, a negative feedback loop risk exists. Selling pressure on illiquid assets during market downturns can worsen liquidity constraints, leading to price drops (\"fire sale\") and triggering more share redemptions. The malfunction of arbitrage mechanisms under illiquid conditions can cause market disruption, even if APs withdraw, turning ETFs into closed-end funds. Price disconnection between ETF shares and underlying assets can occur during market stress. During market stress, price disconnection between ETF shares and underlying assets can be significant. The SEC recognizes that the arbitrage mechanism may work less efficiently, potentially harming secondary market investors due to liquidity and pricing differences. Despite this, the SEC believes investors can weigh the harm against benefits like low cost and intraday trading. Steps have been taken to address disruptions in arbitrage mechanisms, with industry practitioners highlighting liquidity mismatch as a misunderstood aspect of ETF structure. Certain design features aim to mitigate systemic risk. Some argue that ETF design features mitigate systemic risk by avoiding cash redemptions, unlike mutual funds. ETF sponsors do not directly redeem shares from investors, who sell them on the secondary market. This reduces concerns about liquidity mismatches with illiquid assets. The Financial Stability Oversight Council notes that ETFs may not face the same risks as other funds. ETFs, according to the Financial Stability Oversight Council, offer advantages such as transparent pricing and the ability to act as \"emergency brakes\" in market downturns. Their intraday trading allows for continuous monitoring of portfolio value, unlike mutual funds with end-of-the-day pricing. ETF price movements have been effective in signaling market dysfunction and preventing unnoticed market erosion. ETFs, as per IOSCO, are not riskier than mutual funds and have characteristics that make them less susceptible to liquidity events. While there may be a potential liquidity mismatch in certain market conditions, ETFs are not more likely to cause market disruptions compared to similar investment products. The Bank of England recognizes the benefits of ETFs in providing extra secondary-market liquidity and reducing fire sales. ETFs are a type of exchange-traded product (ETP) that offers advantages such as transparent pricing and intraday trading for continuous portfolio monitoring. The ETP market consists of various products traded on exchanges, including controversial and complex ETPs. The majority are plain-vanilla physically backed ETFs, while a smaller portion consists of more complex ETPs. There is no consistent naming convention for ETFs and ETPs, with suggestions to reserve the ETF label for noncomplex funds. The ETP market includes various products, with plain-vanilla physically backed ETFs being the majority. However, concerns arise from higher-risk ETPs like leveraged and inverse ETFs, which use derivatives to amplify gains or losses. These complex ETPs have seen a rapid increase in numbers and assets under management in recent years. Some ETFs are not physically backed, potentially exposing investors to additional risks. Some ETFs, like synthetic and volatility-tracking ETPs, pose counterparty and market risks due to their reliance on derivatives agreements. These higher-risk ETPs have triggered market events and debates on ETF definitions and separate risk considerations. Nontraditional ETPs, such as synthetic and volatility-tracking ETFs, raise concerns due to thinner liquidity and lower transparency. Regulatory bodies like the Financial Stability Board and the Bank for International Settlements warn about the increased complexity and opacity of these products, which can lead to financial risks and information asymmetry for investors. BIS specifically highlights the systemic risk posed by complex ETFs that lengthen the financial intermediation chain through derivatives and counterparties. The growth of complex ETF products, including nontraditional ETFs like cash redemption and leveraged ETFs, could lead to systemic risk build-up. The top three ETF sponsors, BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street, dominate the U.S. ETF market share, raising concerns about concentration risk. While credit risk may be low for traditional ETFs, operational risks and implications of issuer default need to be considered. Some argue that operational risks could arise from issuer default in ETFs, potentially leading to disruptions in unwinding ETF shares. Increased concentration in asset management could result in fewer and larger investment decisions, possibly increasing market volatility. Entry barriers for new competition may be created due to the cost structure benefits of increased scale in ETFs. ETFs' cost structure benefits from increased scale, attracting more investors and creating entry barriers for newer ETFs. ETPs were disproportionately affected by market stress compared to stocks, with abnormal behavior observed in both index-based and complex products during market events. ETPs have a short operating history, gaining scale after the last financial crisis. On May 6, 2010, a \"flash crash\" occurred in U.S. capital markets, affecting ETFs disproportionately due to price volatility. ETFs' liquidity provision capabilities have yet to be tested in a major bear market. On August 24, 2015, the Dow Jones Industrial Average experienced the largest intraday decline in history, leading to substantial price swings in ETFs. Market makers paused trading, automated systems took pauses, and ETF orders hit \"stub-quote\" levels. The SEC later implemented new rules to prevent future flash crashes, including a volatility-based trading pause program and prohibiting market maker stub quotes. Around 40% of ETPs declined by more than 10% in value on that day. ETPs experienced extreme volatility during the market distress of August 24, 2015, with prices deviating significantly from their underlying assets. Factors such as ETP creation and redemption activity, market rules, and processes contributed to this volatility. Concerns about exotic ETPs were not the main issue highlighted in the SEC staff paper. On February 5, 2018, the U.S. stock market experienced a significant correction with a 4% drop and the VIX index increasing by 20 points, the largest one-day move in its history. The event raised concerns about market risk and volatility, leading to a doubling of trading volume in the U.S. ETF market to over $1 trillion. While experts did not blame ETFs for the market event, it deepened worries about exotic ETFs. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell stated that ETFs were not the main cause of the market turmoil. The event raised concerns about exotic ETFs, particularly VIX-tracking ETPs that shorted volatility and lost around $3 billion within a day. Over 99% of ETF assets are passively managed index-based funds designed to track market indexes. This investment style is used by both mutual funds and ETFs. Index-based ETFs have surpassed index-based mutual funds in total assets under management. Actively managed ETFs, representing a small portion of all ETF assets, rely on fund managers to achieve specific investment objectives. The rise of ETFs has sparked a debate on active versus passive investment styles, with some arguing that passively managed funds offer better value through lower costs. Passively managed funds, such as index-based ETFs, have lower costs compared to actively managed funds. Studies show that passive funds often outperform actively managed funds, with examples like Warren Buffett's bet against a hedge fund manager. Critics argue that the rise of ETFs could reduce price discovery and fundamental research by active asset managers. Passive investing could potentially lead to reduced price discovery and fundamental research by active asset managers, creating systemic risk concerns. Some believe that this trend could reshape market functioning, while others argue that actively managed funds may offer more value in less efficient market conditions. The shift towards passive investment may result in market inefficiencies, incentivizing active management to excel and attract capital inflow. However, all Exchange-Traded Products (ETPs) are publicly traded, exposing less-sophisticated retail investors to varying levels of risk they may not fully understand. Certain high-risk ETPs, accessible to all investors, are criticized for their potential to amplify risks and losses. Leveraged funds, likened to gambling, pose challenges for retail investor education due to their ability to multiply gains and losses. Investor protection is a concern even for industry experts promoting these products. Some high-risk ETPs, including synthetic products, pose challenges such as price volatility and counterparty credit risks. Concerns also arise from issuer default and the role of authorized participants, who may have conflicts of interest. To address investor protection, the SEC has issued alerts regarding certain high-risk ETFs. The SEC has issued investor alerts on high-risk ETFs and proposed new rules requiring ETFs to disclose trading information and costs. FINRA also has rules for broker-dealers to protect investors. Industry players suggest a new naming convention and ETF rating system to differentiate risk levels among the 1,800 ETFs in the U.S. market."
