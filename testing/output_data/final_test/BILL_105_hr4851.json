    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Iran Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1998\". The Congress finds that Iran is the world's top sponsor of terrorism, supports groups targeting Israel, and aims to complete nuclear power plants by 2015, including the Bushehr plant. The US opposes this due to concerns about nuclear technology transfer. The construction of the Bushehr nuclear power plant in Iran was halted after the 1979 revolution due to concerns that completing the plant could advance Iran's nuclear weapons program. Former CIA Director James Woolsey stated that operating the plant would provide Iran with expertise relevant to nuclear weapons development. Iran is advancing its offensive military capacity, including testing ballistic missiles capable of reaching strategic targets in Israel. In 1995, Iran signed a contract with Russia to complete a reactor at the Bushehr nuclear power plant, with plans for additional reactors. Iran is receiving substantial assistance from the International Atomic Energy Agency for its nuclear power program, including reactors at the Bushehr nuclear power plant. The United States contributes a significant amount to the Agency's budget annually. The United States provides annual voluntary contributions to the Technical Assistance and Cooperation Fund of the Agency, totaling approximately 32 percent of the program's budget. The US should not fund nuclear power reactors in Iran, as it could enhance Iran's nuclear weapons program. Iran, with vast oil and natural gas reserves, has no need for nuclear energy. The amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 restricts voluntary contributions to the International Atomic Energy Agency for programs in Iran unless approved by the Secretary of State. This aims to prevent Iran from gaining nuclear weapons expertise. The amendment restricts contributions to the International Atomic Energy Agency for programs in Iran without approval from the Secretary of State to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons expertise. The Secretary of State is required to conduct an annual review of International Atomic Energy Agency programs in specific countries to ensure they align with US nuclear nonproliferation goals. A report must be submitted to Congress within a year of the enactment of the Act and annually for 5 years. Additionally, the Secretary must oppose certain programs and projects of the International Atomic Energy Agency. The US representative to the International Atomic Energy Agency must oppose programs deemed inconsistent with US nuclear nonproliferation and safety goals. SEC. 5. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. The Secretary of State, in consultation with the US representative to the International Atomic Energy Agency, must submit an annual report to Congress for 5 years. The report will detail the assistance to Iran from the Agency, list Iranian officials at the Agency, provide updates on nuclear power reactors at the Bushehr plant, and summarize nuclear materials transferred to Iran. Additionally, it will describe all Agency programs and projects in each country. The International Atomic Energy Agency must submit an annual report to Congress detailing assistance to Iran, Iranian officials at the Agency, updates on nuclear power reactors at the Bushehr plant, and nuclear materials transferred to Iran. The report will also cover all Agency programs and projects in each country, including any inconsistencies with US nuclear nonproliferation and safety goals. The report will be unclassified, with a possible classified annex. The Congress believes that the US Government should implement reforms at the International Atomic Energy Agency to ensure that all programs funded by the Technical Cooperation and Assistance Fund align with US nuclear nonproliferation policy and international norms."
