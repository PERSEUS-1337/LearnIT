    "content": "The \"Community Policing Assistance Act of 1993\" is cited as the short title. It amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to include a new part on community policing and grants authorization for this purpose. The Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance may grant projects to local governments and community groups in economically distressed central cities to enhance police-community cooperation. This includes developing neighborhood-oriented policing programs, implementing new technologies to increase officer presence in the community, improving communication between officers and the community, and shifting police focus from reacting to preventing crime. The text chunk discusses various strategies for enhancing police-community cooperation, including creating decentralized police substations, providing training in problem solving and cultural differences, developing community-based crime prevention programs, and addressing gang-related violence in communities. The Director will develop a model project to inform community members on identifying drug or gang houses, available civil remedies, and mediation techniques. The Director will develop a model project to inform community members on identifying drug or gang houses, available civil remedies, and mediation techniques. SEC. 1702. APPLICATION. To be eligible for a grant under this part, a local government chief executive, representative of local governments, or community group must submit an application to the Director. The application must designate one office or agency responsible for coordinating services, include a funding request, describe the areas and populations to be served, and assure proper use of Federal funds. Each application for a grant under this part must include a comprehensive plan addressing crime problems, proposed projects, available resources, gaps in the plan, how the grant will fill those gaps, and a system to prevent and reduce crime. The grant application must include a plan to address crime problems, proposed projects, available resources, gaps in the plan, and how the grant will fill those gaps. It should also include an evaluation component with performance standards and quantifiable goals to measure progress towards meeting project goals. Additionally, a law enforcement agency seeking a grant for a community policing program must propose a project focused on establishing a community-centered police patrol or beat. The curr_chunk discusses the requirements for a law enforcement agency seeking a grant to expand a community policing program, including staffing a neighborhood police substation or establishing a community police patrol. The agency must demonstrate community support or detail a plan for a community/police partnership to target crime. A law enforcement agency seeking a grant to expand a community police program must show community support and how the project aligns with community policing goals. A community group applying for a grant must describe their collaboration with the police and demonstrate police support for the project. \"SEC. 1703. ALLOCATION OF FUNDS; LIMITATIONS ON GRANTS.\" The Director must allocate at least 75% of funds to local government units and up to 20% to community groups. Administrative costs are limited to 5% of funds. Grants can be renewed for up to 2 additional years if funds were used appropriately and progress was made towards goals. The Federal share of a grant under this part cannot exceed 75% of the total project cost described in the application. The Director considers factors like need, community support, and program maintenance when awarding grants to local governments. Geographic distribution of grant awards is also a consideration. Reporting requirements are outlined in Section 1705. \"Recipients of funds must submit progress reports to the Director by March 1 each year. The Director must report to Congress by October 1 on grant awards, recipient activities, and project evaluations. Section 1706 addresses the determination of need adjusted per capita income.\" The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development determines the need adjusted per capita income for cities meeting specific requirements through a formula involving the need index, calculated as the ratio of allotted funds to the city in a fiscal year. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development calculates the need adjusted per capita income for cities based on a formula involving the need index and the amount of funds allocated to eligible cities in a fiscal year under the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974. The term \"P\" in this context refers to the percentage constituted by the ratio of the total population of the city as determined by the Secretary using the most recent data available. The Secretary determines the total population of eligible cities using the most recent census data and estimates changes over time. Eligible cities are those meeting specific requirements. The term \"need adjusted per capita income factor\" is defined as a percentage determined for the city using a specific formula. The curr_chunk mentions a formula for determining a percentage related to per capita income. The formula for determining a percentage related to per capita income involves the terms \"I\" and \"Q\" as defined by the Secretary of Commerce. The formula involves the terms \"I\" and \"Q\", where if the quotient of \"I\" divided by \"Q\" is less than 0.2, it will be considered as 0.2 for that city. SEC. 1707. DEFINITIONS. The curr_chunk defines terms such as 'community group', 'Director', and 'economically distressed central city'. A community group is a nonprofit organization focused on crime prevention, the Director refers to the Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance, and an economically distressed central city meets specific criteria including being eligible for funds under the Housing and Community Development Act. The curr_chunk amends the criteria for a city to qualify as economically distressed, requiring a population of at least 30,000 and a need adjusted per capita income less than 1.25. This definition is crucial for determining eligibility for certain funds under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. The curr_chunk discusses grant authorization for community policing and cop on the beat grants under the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1986. It authorizes $200,000,000 for fiscal year 1994 for part Q."
