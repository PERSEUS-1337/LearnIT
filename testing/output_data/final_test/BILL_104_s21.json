    "content": "The Act of 1995 may be cited as the \"Bosnia and Herzegovina Self-Defense Act.\" The Congress finds that the arms embargo on Bosnia and Herzegovina violates their right to self-defense under international law. The US has not sought multilateral support to lift the embargo since 1995. The UN Security Council has not taken action on this issue. The United Nations Security Council has not effectively maintained peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina since 1992. The Contact Group, including the US, Russia, France, Great Britain, and Germany, has proposed lifting the Bosnian arms embargo if the Bosnian Serbs continue to reject their proposal. The Congress supports the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina in defending its people and territory, preserving sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity, and seeking a peaceful settlement of the conflict. Termination of arms embargo is also discussed. The President shall terminate the US arms embargo on Bosnia and Herzegovina upon request from Bosnia and Herzegovina and submission to the UN Security Council, or if the UN Security Council decides to withdraw UNPROFOR from Bosnia and Herzegovina. The President may implement the termination before a specified date. The President may terminate the US arms embargo on Bosnia and Herzegovina upon request from Bosnia and Herzegovina to the UN Security Council or if the UN Security Council decides to withdraw UNPROFOR from Bosnia and Herzegovina. The President has the authority to implement the termination before a specified date, with the option of a Presidential waiver for an extended period if necessary for the safety and security of UNPROFOR personnel withdrawal. The President may extend the time period for implementing termination of the US arms embargo on Bosnia and Herzegovina for up to 30 days beyond the initial period. The President must report on the status of the UNPROFOR withdrawal from Bosnia and Herzegovina every 14 days, with an estimated completion date included if it exceeds 12 weeks. The President must report on the status of the UNPROFOR withdrawal from Bosnia and Herzegovina every 14 days, with an estimated completion date included if it exceeds 12 weeks. If the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina requests the departure of UNPROFOR or if the Security Council decides to withdraw, the President shall introduce a resolution to terminate the application of UN Security Council resolution 713 to Bosnia and Herzegovina. The United States will push for the termination of UN Security Council resolution 713's applicability to Bosnia and Herzegovina if the Security Council fails to do so due to lack of agreement among permanent members. This would be brought before the General Assembly as per the Uniting for Peace Resolution of 1950. This does not authorize the deployment of US forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The United States aims to end the UN arms embargo on Bosnia and Herzegovina if the Security Council does not act. This would be taken to the General Assembly under the Uniting for Peace Resolution of 1950. This does not permit US military involvement in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The term \"completion of the withdrawal of UNPROFOR personnel from Bosnia and Herzegovina\" refers to the departure of most UNPROFOR personnel and their assistants from Bosnia and Herzegovina within a reasonable time frame, regardless of the initiating party. It does not include personnel remaining based on agreements between Bosnia and Herzegovina and contributing countries. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
