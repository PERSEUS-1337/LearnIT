    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 1367.003 of the Health and Safety Code in California requires health care service plans to provide annual rebates to enrollees if the amount spent on clinical services and quality improvement is less than a certain ratio of total premium revenue. Every health care service plan in California must comply with minimum medical loss ratios for different market segments: 85 percent for large group plans and 80 percent for small group or individual plans. Annual rebates are required if spending on clinical services and quality improvement falls below the specified ratios. The text describes the calculation and payment of rebates owed to enrollees by health care service plans in California based on the medical loss ratio requirements. The director has the authority to adopt necessary regulations to implement the federal Public Health Service Act regarding medical loss ratios. The director has the authority to adopt emergency regulations to implement provisions of the federal Public Health Service Act and address conflicts between state and federal law. The Department of Insurance must be consulted in adopting necessary regulations for implementing this section. The section must comply with federal laws and regulations, specifically Sections 2791 and 2718 of the federal Public Health Service Act. It does not apply to financial provisions covered under Section 1345. The section does not apply to health care service plans or insurance policies related to specific programs like Medi-Cal, Healthy Families Program, Access for Infants and Mothers Program, California Major Risk Medical Insurance Program, or Federal Temporary High Risk Insurance Pool, as long as they are consistent with the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act."
