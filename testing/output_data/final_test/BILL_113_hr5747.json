ISIL threatens to attack US interests and has a vision for a larger confrontation. Approximately 20,000 to 30,000 ISIL fighters operate in Iraq and Syria, with an estimated 3,000 having western passports. ISIL finances itself through various illegal activities. ISIL captured a large number of weapons and vehicles from Iraqi Security Forces and Bashar al-Assad's forces. The humanitarian situation in Iraq caused by ISIL advances has led to 1,500,000 refugees in Iraqi Kurdistan. The Kurdistan Regional Government is facing a humanitarian and budget crisis while defending itself from ISIL. The Kurdish Peshmerga forces are organized under the Ministry of Peshmerga Affairs and commanded by the Minister of Peshmerga. ISIL has positioned its forces along a 650-mile border. The United States airstrikes against ISIL have helped stall the terrorist organization's advance on Kurdish territory, but have not decisively defeated ISIL. The US and its allies have provided small arms and training to Peshmerga forces since June 2014, with resupply efforts coordinated through the Government of Iraq. The Kurdistan Regional Government in Iraq faced constraints and delays in receiving emergency weapons resupply from the Government of Iraq. Peshmerga forces lack armored vehicles and offensive capabilities against ISIL, necessitating requests for assistance. Providing armored vehicles, anti-armor weapons, and artillery aligns with the Kurdistan Regional Government's right to self-defense. A strong Peshmerga force is crucial in countering the ISIL threat to Iraq, the region, and US interests. The longer ISIL remains unchallenged, the more time it will have to plan attacks against United States interests. Sense of Congress: Defeating ISIL is crucial for a unified Iraq with equal rights for all. Kurdistan faces a serious threat from ISIL. Issues between Iraq and Kurdistan should be resolved promptly. ISIL poses a significant danger to Kurdistan, Iraq, the Middle East, and global security. The United States will provide advanced weapons, training, and defense services to the Kurdistan Regional Government to defeat ISIL. The President is authorized to provide military assistance and defense exports directly to the Kurdistan Regional Government to support international coalition efforts against ISIL.
