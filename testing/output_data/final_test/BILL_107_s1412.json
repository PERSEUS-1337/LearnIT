Congress finds that private property ownership is crucial for the nation's well-being, protected by the Constitution, and any government action limiting property use should be compensated. Federal agencies must consider the impact of their actions on private property rights.

The Federal Government's policy is to protect public health, safety, and welfare while minimizing takings of private property. In this Act, \"agency\" refers to any department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States. \"Agency action\" includes any decision made by an agency, and \"owner\" is defined as the person with property rights in affected property. The term \"taking of private property\" refers to any action that requires compensation under the fifth amendment to the United States Constitution. SEC. 5.
