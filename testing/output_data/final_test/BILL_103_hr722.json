    "content": "SECTION 1. INDIAN EDUCATION ASSISTANCE TRUST FUNDS. Establishment of two funds, the Interim Arizona InterTribal Education Assistance Trust Fund and the Navajo fund, in the Treasury of the United States, subject to specific conditions and appropriations. The Interim Navajo Education Assistance Trust Fund is established in the Treasury of the United States, with an aggregate of $34,900,000 authorized for appropriation. This fund will consist of allocated amounts and will not diminish any Indian account. Sums appropriated under paragraph (1) will be allocated to the Arizona and Navajo funds as specified in subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) respectively, following the same allocation process as the Arizona InterTribal Trust Fund and Navajo Trust Fund. If the full amount specified in subsection (b)(1) is appropriated and allocated according to subsection (b) before the first annual payment is due to the Arizona InterTribal Trust Fund and Navajo Trust Fund, Collier will be directed by the Secretary of the Interior to pay any amounts owed to the United States under the Trust Fund Payment Agreement to the Secretary of the Treasury for deposit into the general fund. The Secretary of the Interior will direct Collier to pay any outstanding amounts owed to the United States under the Trust Fund Payment Agreement to the Secretary of the Treasury for deposit into the general fund if less than the specified amount is appropriated before the due date. The Secretary of the Interior will direct Collier to pay any outstanding amounts owed to the United States under the Trust Fund Payment Agreement to the Secretary of the Treasury for deposit into the general fund if less than the specified amount is appropriated before the due date. The funds established in subsection (a) shall terminate on the date of the first Collier payment, with the remaining amount to be deposited into the Arizona InterTribal Trust Fund and Navajo Trust Fund. Upon termination, remaining funds in subsection (a)(1) and (a)(2) will be transferred to the Arizona InterTribal Trust Fund and Navajo Trust Fund, respectively. No funds from this Act will be available to the InterTribal Council in Arizona (ITCA) and Navajo Tribe or deposited into the Interim Trust Funds. The remaining funds will be transferred to the Arizona InterTribal Trust Fund and Navajo Trust Fund upon termination, unless the ITCA and Navajo Tribe provide written consent for an alternative payment method."
