Eligible agencies must have received a grant for signing bonuses and use the funds for mentor programs in schools with bonus-receiving teachers.

The grants aim to support agencies with higher percentages of novice teachers. The mentor teacher program funded by grants must allocate 75% of funds for mentor teacher services and 25% for program development. Training for novice teachers includes teaching techniques, class discipline, and curriculum development. The Federal share of mentor teacher costs is 75%. The non-Federal share of the cost for the mentor teacher program can be provided from State sources in cash or in kind.
