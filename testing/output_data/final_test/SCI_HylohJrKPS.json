    "content": "The Deep 3D-Zoom Net is a novel unsupervised framework for generating arbitrarily 3D-zoomed versions of a single image without requiring a 3D-zoom ground truth. This approach addresses the challenges of obtaining a 3D-zoom dataset of natural scenes due to the need for special equipment and stationary objects during image capture. The Deep 3D-Zoom Net is a novel approach for generating 3D-zoomed images without ground truth. It utilizes transfer learning, a convolutional network architecture, and a discriminator network to improve view synthesis realism. Extensive experiments on KITTI and Cityscapes datasets validate its effectiveness. New view synthesis is a challenging task due to occlusions and complex 3D structures in the scene. Larger baselines make the problem more difficult. Applications include robotics, augmented reality, and image stabilization. Limited research exists on single input image novel view synthesis, which requires a deep understanding of the scene's 3D structure. 3D-zoom is a subset of novel view synthesis that involves positive camera translation in the Z-axis. Generating a 3D-zoom dataset with natural scene imagery is challenging, requiring special devices to restrict translation to the Z-axis and mask moving objects. Existing driving datasets could be used with limitations. The proposed Deep 3D-Zoom Net utilizes a pre-trained disparity estimation network with transfer learning to learn 3D structure of scenes in an unsupervised manner. It includes an adversarial network to penalize unnatural areas and can generate naturally looking 3D-zoomed images quickly. The model's efficacy is demonstrated on KITTI and Cityscapes datasets. Novel view synthesis algorithms can be categorized into multiple view and single view types. Multiple view algorithms rely on correspondences between input views, while single view approaches use depth cues to model 3D structure. Classical methods for novel view synthesis involve optimization techniques. Chaurasia et al. (2013) segment input images into superpixels for depth estimation, while Liu et al. (2009) warps and blends superpixels without depth estimation. Recent deep learning approaches have shown promising results for novel view synthesis, with early work by Flynn et al. (2015) using multiple inputs and small patches to synthesize the target view. Their Deepstereo architecture divides the process efficiently. Deepstereo architecture divides novel view synthesis into two branches: selection volume and image color estimation. Zhou et al. (2016) focused on learning the warping operation to copy pixels from input views for new view synthesis, showing good results for single objects but poor performance for full scene synthesis. The quality of generated views in recent works is linked to the number of input images used. Deep View Morphing by Ji et al. (2017) estimates intermediate views from two input images by rectifying, estimating correspondences, and blending them. Similar approaches by Zhou et al. (2018) and others generate new views from two input images using multiplane images with alpha channels. The curr_chunk discusses the use of multiplane images with alpha channels for synthesizing new views through planar transformations. Previous approaches like Horry et al. (1997) and Hoiem et al. (2005) used depth priors and statistical modeling of geometric classes for view synthesis, but struggled with thin and complex objects. Rematas et al. (2016) introduced a model that aligns a 3D model with input views to estimate output pixels. However, the performance is not real-time and limited. The recent work by Liu et al. (2018) utilizes deep learning approaches for single image novel view synthesis. Four networks are incorporated for disparity, normals, selection volume estimation, and image refinement. Predicted disparaties and normals are combined with a super-pixel oversegmentation mask to create homographies for warped images. The selection volume is estimated from deep features and blended with the warped images. The disparity and normals network follow the UNET architecture. The volume estimation in deep learning for novel view synthesis involves up-scaling deep features from an encoder-like architecture, with the refinement network further enhancing the results. Deep3D algorithm focuses on generating a corresponding right view from a single left input image by producing probabilistic disparity maps. By enforcing geometry constraints, CNNs can learn unsupervised disparity estimation from stereo inputs. Our work focuses on unsupervised 3D-zoom learning for novel view synthesis, building on previous advancements in monocular disparity estimation networks. Gonzalez Bello & Kim (2019) improved unsupervised disparity learning by enabling full disparity estimations in a single pass with fewer parameters. We utilize their pre-trained models to train our 3D-zoom architectures, the first to isolate and solve the 3D-zoom learning problem in an unsupervised manner. Our work focuses on unsupervised 3D-zoom learning for novel view synthesis, utilizing a novel back re-projection reconstruction loss to learn the 3D structure of the scene. 3D-zoom involves positive camera translation in the Z-axis, with depth inversely proportional to disparity \"D\" and directly related to the focal length and world coordinates. The depth in 3D-zoom is inversely proportional to disparity \"D\" and directly related to focal length and camera separation. The projection in the camera plane can be generalized for any camera setup using a normalized disparity map. Changes in world coordinates are projected into the camera plane weighted by the normalized disparity map. Objects closer to the camera have larger disparity values, leading to higher up-scaling in 3D-zoom. In 3D-zoom, disparity values determine up-scaling, with closer objects having higher disparity and more up-scaling. The synthesis problem involves blending multiple upscaled versions of the input image using element-wise multiplication and summation. The proposed network architecture, Deep3D-ZoomNet, includes an auto-encoder synthesis network, a refinement block, and a final blending operation. It takes a single image I, along with zoom-in and zoom-out optical flows f in and f out as input. The synthesis network extracts the 3D structure from the image and generates selection logits, which are expanded and fed into the refinement block to model local relationships between channels. The Deep3D-ZoomNet architecture includes a synthesis network that generates selection logits, which are then expanded and refined to reduce artifacts. A channel-wise softmax is applied to create the final selection volume for blending multi-scale inputs into the 3D-zoomed-in image. This approach differs from previous methods by applying expansion before softmax and using a refinement block to enhance the results. The Deep3D-ZoomNet architecture utilizes a UNET-like structure to extract 3D information from a single image input. Unlike other view synthesis techniques, it allows for novel view generation with arbitrary zoom factors. The use of skip connections in the U-NET helps recover fine details, making it suitable for 3D-zoom tasks. The synthesis network utilizes a U-NET architecture for 3D-zoom, incorporating skip connections for fine detail preservation. Inspired by Gonzalez Bello & Kim (2019), the encoder features 3x3 convolutions and residual blocks. Strided convolutions and residual blocks are used in seven stages to downscale and extract features. The decoder combines local and global information through skip connections. The synthesis network combines local and global information using skip connections and up-scaling techniques to achieve high-resolution selection volumes. The output consists of N channels of selection logits, with N set to 32 for all experiments. A transfer learning strategy with a back re-projection reconstruction loss is adopted for unsupervised learning, allowing the network to learn 3D structure while maintaining a natural appearance. The pre-trained disparity estimation network is used to estimate monocular disparity from a single input image. This disparity is normalized and used to generate a weighted zoom-in optical flow by multiplying it with a uniform zoom-in optical flow. The network is fed with the same input image to estimate a 3D-zoomed version, which is then back-projected into the input image to obtain a zoomed-out image for comparison and error minimization during training. The g(\u00b7) function in Figure 5 is unable to reconstruct image borders, so a dis-occlusion mask is defined to ignore these areas in the loss function calculations. The mask considers the input image height and width to generate the complete zoom-out image Z out. The reconstruction loss combines appearance loss, enforcing similarity between Z out and input image I, and perceptual loss, penalizing deformations and lack of sharpness using pre-trained VGG19 layers. The curr_chunk discusses the use of a discriminator network to address issues with disparity maps obtained from a pre-trained network. The network consists of four stages and helps penalize unnaturally rendered areas. Due to the unavailability of 3D-zoom ground truth, traditional patch-GAN training with mean square error loss was used instead of the recent WGANGP configuration. Our novel approach combines back re-projection reconstruction loss with an adversarial loss in training the Deep 3D-Zoom Net. The generator minimizes the probability of generated images being classified as fake, while the discriminator distinguishes between real and fake images. Real images are sampled from inputs, and fake images from outputs. Results on KITTI2012 / NIQE show visual quality improvements compared to previous work by Liu et al. Our Deep 3D-Zoom Net outperforms geometric-aware networks in natural image generation, with no visible artifacts for zoom factors of 1.6 and 2.4. Extensive experiments on the KITTI2015 dataset validate the effectiveness of our model and training strategy. Ablation study confirms the importance of the refinement block, perceptual loss, and adversarial loss. Testing on the Cityscapes dataset shows the generalization ability of our Deep 3D-Zoom Net to unseen scenes. Our model was trained on the KITTI split dataset using various data augmentations and optimization techniques. The dis-occlusion area increases with the zoom factor, limiting the effective training area. Training on larger zoom factors is necessary for proper network training. To train the network on higher zoom factors, the model is trained more often on large zoom factors than small ones. The zoom factor for each image in the mini-batch is randomly sampled from a normal distribution with a maximum zoom factor of 3. Results are compared with a previous study, showing that the generated images are more natural with fewer artifacts. The Deep 3D-Zoom Net performs fast inference on images, and ablation studies were conducted to validate the model. The refinement block, perceptual loss, and adversarial loss improve image quality on a Titan Xp GPU. Ablation studies show their contributions. Performance is measured using the NIQE metric on the Kitty2015 dataset. Results in Figure 8 demonstrate the impact of each component. Perceptual loss significantly enhances quality, especially in textured areas. Adversarial loss reduces artifacts and deformations, as shown in Figure 9-(b). Our GAN setting effectively reduces ghosting artifacts and deformations, lowering the mean NIQE score from 2.99 to 2.86. The model generalizes well to the Cityscapes dataset, displaying excellent results on unseen data. Compared to forward warping and digital zoom, our Deep 3D-Zoom Net generates natural-looking 3D-zoomed images. The Deep 3D-Zoom Net is a solution for the image synthesis problem of 3D-zoom, using unsupervised learning. It blends multiple upscaled versions of an input image, minimizes a reconstruction loss, and incorporates an adversarial loss to produce natural-looking images. This solution establishes a state-of-the-art approach for single image novel view synthesis, with potential applications in cinematography and 3D visualization. The Deep 3D-Zoom Net is a solution for image synthesis, using unsupervised learning to generate 3D-zoom versions of 2D images.

Results for the KITTI and Cityscapes datasets are shown, along with comparisons with plain forward warping and digital zoom. Additional results for the KITTI2012 dataset are presented, demonstrating the generation of photo-realistic images with different zoom factors. The unsupervised method generates photo-realistic 3D-zoomed images using a selection volume to blend multiple upscaled versions of the input.
