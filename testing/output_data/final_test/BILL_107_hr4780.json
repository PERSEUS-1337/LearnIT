    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Rejection of Social Security Privatization Act of 2002.\" The Congress finds that President Bush appointed a commission to develop three plans to partially privatize Social Security, diverting funds from the Trust Funds and weakening their financial condition, in violation of assurances to current beneficiaries. Plan 1 would worsen the Trust Funds' solvency by 25 percent. Plans 2 and 3 also divert Social Security revenues to private accounts, substantially reducing guaranteed benefits for future retirees, disabled workers, their families, and deceased workers' survivors. These cuts contradict the President's promise to preserve disability and survivor benefits under privatization. The President's privatization plans impose reductions in Social Security benefits for all workers, regardless of individual account choices. Independent analysis shows Plan 1 draining $1.2 trillion from Trust Funds over 10 years. Plan 2 and Plan 3 propose significant reductions in Social Security benefits for future retirees, with Plan 2 cutting benefits by up to 46% and draining $1.5 trillion from Trust Funds in 10 years, while Plan 3 reduces benefits by up to 30%, raises the retirement age, and drains $1.3 trillion. Substituting private accounts for guaranteed benefits increases financial risk and reduces protections for vulnerable groups. The President's plans for privatization of Social Security demonstrate difficult tradeoffs, including cuts in guaranteed benefits, new financial risks for workers, damage to Trust Funds, and the need for massive subsidies. Other privatization proposals also reduce benefits through clawbacks or offsets, shifting responsibility to individual workers. The privatization plans for Social Security require massive Federal subsidies and unprecedented borrowing, making them fiscally unsustainable. The Social Security Guarantee Plus plan would need $3.6 trillion in subsidies over 40 years, while the Social Security Ownership and Guarantee plan would require $20.4 trillion in subsidies over 75 years. The privatization plans for Social Security would result in deep cutbacks in benefits for retirees, disabled workers, and their families, as well as survivors of deceased workers. This would also damage the Social Security Trust Funds and undermine the program's ability to provide guaranteed benefits. The rejection of privatization is crucial to prevent deep cutbacks in Social Security benefits for retirees, disabled workers, and their families, as well as survivors of deceased workers. This decision also protects the Social Security Trust Funds and ensures the program's ability to provide guaranteed benefits. The Congress commits to preserving guaranteed, lifelong, inflation-protected benefits under title II of the Social Security Act for retirees, disabled workers, and their families, as well as rejecting privatization plans that would reduce retirement security and undermine traditional benefits. The Congress commits to preserving guaranteed, lifelong, inflation-protected benefits under the Social Security Act by rejecting proposals that threaten the Trust Funds or establish private accounts diverting resources."
