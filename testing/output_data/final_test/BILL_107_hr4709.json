    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Hormone Disruption Research Act of 2002\". Congress finds that many compounds introduced into the environment can disrupt hormone systems in humans and animals, leading to various health disorders. The United States has seen an increase in diseases like childhood cancers, diabetes, and autism, possibly due to exposure to hormone-disrupting chemicals. The impact of hormone-disrupting chemicals on children's health, particularly prenatal exposures, needs further research. In 2001, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported high levels of certain chemicals in consumer products, with unknown hazards to humans. Wildlife populations have also been affected by hormone-disrupting substances, leading to various health effects among different species. Hormone-disrupting chemicals have various harmful effects on wildlife, including decreased fertility, birth deformities, and compromised immune systems. These effects may also pose hazards to human health, as humans are exposed to the same chemicals found in wildlife. Hormone disruption can occur at low doses, especially during rapid development periods like in the womb or after birth. Studies have identified biological mechanisms explaining these effects. In 1996, Congress acknowledged the vulnerability of infants and children to pesticides and requested the EPA to screen hormone disrupting chemicals. However, the EPA has not yet mandated such screening. In 1998, a research committee highlighted the insufficient scientific knowledge on hormone disrupters and called for a coordinated research effort. The National Academy of Sciences compiled a list of research priorities on hormone disruption, funded by the EPA and Department of the Interior. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences conducts federal research on hormone disruption, with Congress supporting efforts to reduce animal testing. The US Geological Survey is also involved in this research. The US Geological Survey (USGS) has expertise in assessing chemicals in the environment, ecological health, and wildlife hazards. The National Academy of Sciences recognizes USGS's knowledge in food web contamination and water quality assessment, encouraging collaboration with the National Institutes of Health on human health research. The Public Health Services Act is amended to include a national research program on hormone disruption. The Director of the Institute will establish a program to research chemicals impacting human health through hormone disruption, study their occurrence in the environment, coordinate a multi-agency research initiative, and collaborate with other nations on hormone disruption research. The Director of the Institute will establish a program to research hormone disrupting chemicals, focusing on human health effects, especially during critical life stages like prenatal exposures on children's health. The program will collect, compile, and disseminate scientifically valid information on the extent of hormone disruption by chemicals in the environment every 2 years. The program will research hormone disrupting chemicals, focusing on human health effects during critical life stages like prenatal exposures on children's health. Research will also include exposure of wildlife species to these chemicals and mechanisms of interaction with biological systems. Additionally, improved methods for screening and testing hormone disruption will be explored. The Director of the Institute, in consultation with the USGS Director, is responsible for researching hormone disrupting chemicals' effects on human health and the environment. An agreement must be made within 6 months to carry out the research program, and funds can be transferred to other Federal agencies for this purpose. The Director of the Institute, in consultation with the USGS Director, is responsible for researching hormone disrupting chemicals' effects on human health and the environment. An Interagency Commission will be established to advise on research agenda development and reporting findings every 2 years to the public. The Interagency Commission will have 12 members, including the Director of the Institute as Chairperson and the Director of the USGS as Vice-Chairperson. Other members will be from various agencies such as the FDA, CDC, NOAA, NIOSH, and ATSDR. The Interagency Commission, consisting of 12 members from different agencies, will recommend actions to the Director of the Institute and the Director of the USGS within 12 months of the enactment of the Hormone Disruption Research Act of 2002. Each department or agency represented on the Commission must provide staff to support its duties. The Director of the Institute and the Director of the USGS oversee a research program with funding for intramural and extramural research. The Director of the Institute allows public comment on recommendations, and the Interagency Commission will review the program and submit a report. Financial assistance may be provided by the Director of the Institute. The Director of the Institute may provide financial assistance for research activities and establish a Hormone Disruption Research Panel to advise on scientific content and progress of the program. The Hormone Disruption Research Panel will advise on scientific content and progress of the program, with 15 voting members appointed by the President, including representation from environmental protection organizations, public health and consumer organizations, and industry. Nonvoting, ex officio members may also be included as determined by the Director of the Institute. The Hormone Disruption Research Panel will have 15 voting members selected from scientists and environmental health professionals with diverse backgrounds and experience in endocrine disruption research. The Hormone Disruption Research Panel consists of 15 members appointed for 3-year terms, with the option for reappointment for an additional 2 years. The Panel elects a chairperson from among its members and meets at least once a year. Administrative support is provided by the Institute, and conflict of interest provisions are included in all grants and contracts. The Hormone Disruption Research Panel requires disclosure of all funding sources for related projects. Definitions for \"hormone\" and \"hormone disruption\" are provided. Authorization of appropriations is also outlined. Authorization of $500,000,000 for a 5-year period starting in 2003 for specific purposes with restrictions on fund usage. The funds authorized for a 5-year period starting in 2003 can be used for administrative expenses and public outreach activities of the Institute. At least 1 percent, but not more than 5 percent, of the total funds must be allocated for public outreach regarding the program."
