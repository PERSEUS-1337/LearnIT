Non-community systems, like wells for individual homes, schools, or factories, are not subject to the act. Regulated water systems provide drinking water to 97% of Americans, with the majority being small and privately owned. Community water supply systems in the United States serve approximately 97% of Americans. Most systems are small and privately owned, with 70% of customers served by large, publicly owned systems. The smallest systems, serving fewer than 3,300 persons, make up 77% of all systems and often struggle to comply with drinking water regulations. These very small systems have limited access to financial markets and are more sensitive to local economic conditions. Larger systems serving 3,301 to 50,000 persons are more institutionally capable but also face financing challenges. Federal regulations issued by the EPA under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) govern these community water supply systems. Federal regulations issued by the EPA under the Safe Drinking Water Act govern community water supply systems in the United States. These regulations limit levels of contaminants in treated water and require system monitoring, treatment, and reporting. New regulations are being developed that may impose additional compliance burdens in the future. Compliance with existing regulations is estimated to protect millions of people from various contaminants in public water supplies, but many cities and towns must invest in equipment and staff to meet these requirements. Small towns face particularly costly implications from recent regulations such as water filtration, lead control, and arsenic control. Small towns face costly implications for water filtration, lead control, arsenic control, and contaminant control. Small community water systems have funding needs of $64.5 billion, accounting for a disproportionate percentage of the national need. Small communities serve only 8% of the population but make up nearly 83% of systems with funding needs. Wastewater treatment requirements under the Clean Water Act apply to all communities, with 80% of facilities serving small communities. Under the Clean Water Act (CWA), municipalities were required to achieve secondary treatment of municipal sewage by 1988. Small community wastewater systems have higher rates of noncompliance. EPA reported in 2016 that cities nationwide would need $271 billion for wastewater facilities to meet water quality standards, with rural communities needing $68 billion and small communities needing $33 billion. Financing improvements remains a challenge for cities of all sizes. The largest needs in small communities (populations less than 10,000) are for improved wastewater treatment and correction of combined sewer overflows. Five states (Pennsylvania, New York, Kentucky, Texas, and Alabama) account for 30% of the small community needs. Small community facilities constitute a large majority of publicly owned facilities in most states, with some states having over 95% of facilities classified as small community. Small systems lack economies of scale, leading to a heavy financial burden for customers to meet clean water investment needs. The federal government offers programs to assist rural communities with water and waste disposal systems, including the Community Development Block Grant program. Small cities may face the largest percentage increases in user charges and fees for clean water investments. EPA has highlighted the heavy financial burden on customers in small systems to meet these needs. The Community Development Block Grant program provides funding for a variety of activities aimed at improving housing and living environments. Water and waste disposal projects account for 10% to 20% of CDBG obligations, with a focus on benefiting low/moderate-income individuals. Funds are allocated to states and metropolitan areas, with a portion available for rural community projects. The Appalachian Regional Commission also supports economic growth through essential facility projects in the Appalachian regions. The Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) invests in projects to provide basic facilities for economic growth in the Appalachian regions of 13 states. In FY2016, ARC is funded at $146 million for area development assistance, covering infrastructure, business, and human development projects. Environmental projects receive about 5% of ARC funds. The Economic Development Administration (EDA) provides grants for public facility construction to alleviate unemployment in distressed areas and foster long-term employment through infrastructure projects. In FY2016, EDA's public works grants are funded at $100 million, while EPA administers the largest federal program for wastewater treatment assistance under the Clean Water Act with a funding of $1.39 billion. Funds are distributed to states based on a statutory allocation formula to assist qualified projects on a priority list determined by individual states. Federal funds now capitalize state loan programs for project loans according to CWA criteria. The Clean Water Act (CWA) loan programs provide project loans to communities based on specific criteria. The goal is for states to sustain the loan programs through repayment, creating ongoing assistance for other communities. Rural and non-rural areas compete for funding without special priority for rural areas. Some small communities and states with large rural populations have faced challenges with the program due to limited resources and difficulties in qualifying for and repaying loans. Small communities have been participating in the clean water SRF program, with 23% of the $42 billion in SRF assistance since 1989 going to communities with less than 10,000 in population. Congress enacted Safe Drinking Water Act amendments in 1996 to help public water systems finance improvements. $20 billion in appropriations has been provided for the drinking water SRF program, which allows states to provide both loans and grants to assist community water systems. The Safe Drinking Water Act allows states to transfer funds between the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF) and the Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWA SRF) to meet infrastructure needs. Since 1996, 38% of total assistance has gone to systems serving fewer than 10,000 people. Rural development programs of the USDA offer grants and loans for water and wastewater projects to communities with populations of 10,000 or less. Grants are provided when necessary to reduce user charges. USDA provides grants and loans for water and wastewater projects in rural communities with populations of 10,000 or less. Grants are given to reduce user charges, with a split of about 70-30 between loans and grants. Funds are mainly allocated to drinking water projects, with some going to waste disposal projects. Additionally, grants are given to nonprofit organizations for technical assistance and training. In 1996, rural development grant and loan programs were consolidated into three categories for better coordination and local involvement. The USDA consolidated rural development grant and loan programs into three categories under the Rural Community Advancement Program (RCAP). The components include the Rural Utilities Service (RUS), Rural Community Facilities, and Rural Business and Cooperative Development. The key concept of RCAP is to involve state and local stakeholders in strategic planning for more effective federal assistance. The 1996 farm bill did not alter the basic features of the water and waste disposal grant and loan programs administered through state and local offices. The USDA administers grant and loan programs for rural water and wastewater systems through state and local offices. Since 2001, over $10 billion has been provided to benefit more than 6.5 million people. Subsequent farm bills have not significantly changed these programs, with the 2014 law extending authorizations through FY2018. Grants for water supply and waste disposal projects in rural areas are authorized under the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act. Eligible projects must serve rural areas not likely to decline in population. Grants for rural water and wastewater projects must serve areas not likely to decline in population. The grants cover up to 75% of project costs and aim to reduce user costs. Priority is given to projects serving populations in need. Eligible applicants include municipalities, authorities, districts, certain Indian tribes, and similar organizations. RUS provides grants for rural water and wastewater projects, prioritizing areas with populations under 5,500. Funding is available for projects addressing declines in water quality or quantity, with grants ranging from $10,000 to $500,000 for rural areas with populations of 10,000 or less. The funds can be used for new systems, extensions, facilities construction, repairs, or renovations, covering up to 100% of project costs. Grants for repairs or maintenance of existing systems are capped at $150,000. The Rural Development Act of 1972 authorized the Rural Development Insurance Fund under the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act for loans to develop water and waste projects in low-income rural areas. Funding for the program is variable and depends on need, with $14.7 million distributed in FY2014 and $2.5 million in FY2015. Loans are provided by USDA to public bodies, non-profit organizations, and Indian tribes for projects to meet health and sanitary standards, including clean water requirements. Repayment is within 40 years or the facility's useful life. USDA offers direct loans or guarantees up to 90% of loans from third-party lenders. Borrowers must refinance when possible. Interest rates are based on the community's economic and health conditions, categorized as poverty, market, or intermediate rates. The USDA offers loans to public bodies, non-profit organizations, and Indian tribes for projects meeting health and sanitary standards. Repayment is within 40 years or the facility's useful life, with interest rates based on poverty, market, or intermediate rates. The 2014 farm bill encourages private or cooperative lenders to finance projects, with rates set at 60% for poverty, 80% for intermediate, and negotiated for guaranteed loans. The USDA consolidated water and waste disposal grant and loan appropriations into a single Rural Utilities Assistance Program in FY1996. In FY2016, $508 million was allocated for water and waste disposal programs, including $385 million for grants and subsidies for direct and guaranteed loans. EPA's clean water and safe drinking water SRF programs received $2.3 billion in funding in FY2016. In FY2016, USDA's grant and loan programs allocated $508 million for water and waste disposal, while EPA's clean water and safe drinking water SRF programs received $2.3 billion in funding. There is a high demand for funds in rural areas, with a reported $2.4 billion backlog of requests for water and wastewater projects. Policy makers are exploring alternative financing tools beyond federal grants to address water infrastructure needs. Some analysts are concerned that alternative financing approaches like the WIFIA pilot program may favor large communities over rural areas, potentially hindering infrastructure investments in the future. Meeting the funding needs of rural areas efficiently remains a significant congressional interest."
