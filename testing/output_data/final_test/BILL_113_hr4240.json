    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Health Equity and Access under the Law for Immigrant Women and Families Act of 2014\" or as the \"HEAL Immigrant Women and Families Act of 2014\". Congress finds that insurance coverage reduces health disparities by alleviating cost barriers to preventive health services, especially among low-income and underserved populations, including immigrant women who face legal restrictions on obtaining coverage. Lack of insurance contributes to disparities in health outcomes for immigrants and their families, particularly for reproductive-age women who are low-income and uninsured. Barriers to affordable health insurance coverage exacerbate risks of negative sexual, reproductive, and maternal health outcomes for immigrant women, impacting their families and society. Denying coverage hinders immigrants' ability to take responsibility for their health and economic well-being. Access to healthcare, including family planning services, is crucial for immigrants to fully participate in society. The immigrant population in the United States is expected to continue growing, with one in five children being part of an immigrant family. It is important to remove legal barriers to affordable health insurance coverage based on immigration status in the United States, as one in five children is part of an immigrant family. SEC. 3. Removing barriers to health coverage for lawfully present individuals. Medicaid payment for care and services to aliens who meet eligibility requirements and are lawfully present in the United States, regardless of aid or assistance receipt under certain programs. The text chunk discusses amendments to provide medical assistance to aliens under certain conditions and changes in Medicaid payment for care and services to aliens who are lawfully present in the United States. The amendments made by this section regarding medical assistance for lawfully present individuals will take effect upon the enactment of the Act, applying to services provided 90 days after that date, with exceptions for states requiring additional legislation to comply. The State plan must meet additional requirements imposed by amendments, but failure to comply before the first day of the first calendar quarter after the state legislature's session is not considered a violation. Each year of a 2-year legislative session is seen as a separate regular session. SEC. 4. Removing barriers to health coverage for individuals granted deferred action for childhood arrivals. Individuals granted deferred action under the DACA process are considered lawfully present in the US for eligibility under specific provisions, including exchange, reduced cost-sharing, premium subsidy, and Medicaid/CHIP eligibility. Medicaid and CHIP eligibility under Titles XIX and XXI of the Social Security Act, including section 1903(v) of such Act, will take effect upon the enactment of this Act. Individuals granted deferred action under DACA who qualify for subsidies described in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act may transition through a special enrollment period. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a special enrollment period for individuals granted deferred action under DACA to enroll in qualified health plans and qualify for subsidies. This special enrollment period must begin within 90 days of the enactment of the Act and does not affect the Secretary's authority to establish additional special enrollment periods."
