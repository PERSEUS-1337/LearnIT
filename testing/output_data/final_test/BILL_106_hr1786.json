Congress finds that establishing computer literacy programs for students is crucial for their advanced education and future employment opportunities in the 21st century. Computer skills enhance critical thinking, communication, and information gathering, complementing core subjects like reading and mathematics. Research shows that students benefit from using computers for simulations and applications in their studies. Despite schools acquiring modern computer hardware, the importance of computer literacy programs remains paramount. The importance of teachers being trained in the latest educational software applications is highlighted for schools to fully benefit from computer-based learning. A study by the Educational Testing Service showed that students performed better when their teachers received computer training. Schools providing professional development in computers experienced higher staff morale and lower absenteeism rates. Exciting educational technology applications are being developed by both commercial software companies and students, with the potential to benefit elementary and secondary schools. The Computer Literacy Challenge is highlighted as a key initiative to enhance teachers' training in educational software applications for schools to benefit from computer-based learning.
