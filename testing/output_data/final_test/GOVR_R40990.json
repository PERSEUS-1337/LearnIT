    "content": "Both S. 1733 and H.R. 2454 allocate 5% of allowances for REDD activities in developing countries to reduce deforestation. The allowance value can be used to build capacity for countries to participate in international offset credit markets and directly reduce deforestation emissions. This is expected to help the United States reach emission reduction goals, with a target of reducing GHG emissions in developing countries by at least 720 million tons of CO2 in 2020. The bills aim to reduce emissions by 720 million tons of CO2 in 2020 and 6 GtCO2 by 2025, with a focus on international offsets like REDD activities. Some argue that the targets may be unrealistic due to developing countries' readiness, while supporters believe there are ample opportunities for emission reduction funding. The bills aim to reduce emissions through projects like REDD activities, with H.R. 2454 containing more explicit requirements compared to S. 1733. Differences include agency assignment, conditions for developing countries, and activity standards. The bills H.R. 2454 and S. 1733 aim to reduce emissions through REDD activities. H.R. 2454 has more explicit requirements, while S. 1733 could potentially be implemented faster. Different agencies would administer the program under each bill, with EPA for H.R. 2454 and USAID for S. 1733. The EPA and USAID would administer REDD activities under bills H.R. 2454 and S. 1733, respectively. EPA enforces domestic environmental regulations with experience in emissions monitoring and pollution reduction, while USAID focuses on international economic and humanitarian assistance, including forestry projects. EPA has a larger budget of $10 billion annually, compared to USAID's $1 billion. USAID, with an annual budget of about $1 billion, administers over $20 billion in foreign assistance funding for developing countries. S. 1733 directs USAID to develop a program within two years to reduce GHG through REDD activities in developing countries, providing flexibility to establish eligibility criteria. H.R. 2454 includes eligibility criteria for developing countries to participate in the emission reduction program, requiring EPA and USAID to determine deforestation or forest degradation risks. The country must have standing forests at risk of deforestation or degradation and have an agreement with the US for participation. Both bills lack a clear definition of forests, making it challenging to determine eligible forested land for REDD activities. Definitions of forests typically involve tree cover or biomass levels. The bills do not allow emissions reduction activities funded under this section to receive international offset credits. However, projects funded by allowances could later qualify for offsets, incentivizing their permanence. H.R. 2454 specifies eligible REDD activities, while S. 1733 does not. H.R. 2454 specifies activities for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, including mechanisms for providing allowances to address REDD in developing countries. EPA would distribute emission allowances to countries, groups, or international funds. The Administrator of USAID has discretion over allowance distribution for REDD activities under H.R. 2454. The agency responsible for selecting activities must enforce program requirements. H.R. 2454 raises questions about affiliations for receiving support in project countries. National sovereignty issues can arise with U.S. overseas development assistance programs. For example, in Bolivia in 1987, there was a crisis when a conservation organization obtained forested lands. It is unclear if REDD allowances can be used to purchase lands. H.R. 2454 sets standards for implementing REDD activities. H.R. 2454 establishes standards for implementing REDD activities, including setting a national deforestation baseline, achieving zero net deforestation within 20 years, verifying emissions reductions before compensation, using a discount factor for uncertainty, and ensuring collateral benefits like biodiversity improvement and profit sharing with indigenous people. S. 1733 lacks specific standards for REDD activities, potentially excluding indigenous and local communities from benefiting. Concerns include displacement of native people, corruption, and denial of land rights. In contrast, H.R. 2454 involves indigenous and local communities in the implementation process, safeguards human rights, and promotes consultation and equitable profit sharing. EPA would ensure safeguards are enforced to protect community rights and benefits. H.R. 2454 and S. 1733 have similar criteria for REDD activities, but H.R. 2454 includes provisions for reporting and monitoring. It requires an annual report on emissions reductions funded by allowances and activities implemented. EPA and USAID would submit the report to relevant committees every four years. The review of REDD activities every four years should include the effects on carbon stocks, participation in offset markets, and considerations for indigenous rights, biodiversity, and leakage. S. 1733 does not specify report requirements but allows for regulations by USAID. Potential issues for the emission reduction program include lack of implementation capacity in developing countries, oversight of activities, enforcement of rules, and permanence of emissions reductions. Developing countries may lack the capacity to implement REDD activities for emissions reduction. The United Nations REDD Programme is assisting countries in implementing REDD activities, with few countries submitting progress reports. H.R. 2454 requires countries to enter agreements before participating, potentially delaying implementation. Concurrence from the Secretary of State is needed before emission allowances are distributed. Developing countries may lack the capacity for REDD activities. The distribution of emission allowances requires concurrence from the Secretary of State. Countries may need to meet political criteria for evaluation. Compensation for supplemental emissions reductions will only be granted after verification. Developing countries must have the capacity to measure and monitor GHG emissions reductions, which could take time and resources. Some countries may prefer creating offset credits for international carbon markets over accepting allowance funds. The program aims to provide funding for REDD activities in developing countries, but lacks enforcement mechanisms. Monitoring foreign assistance activities is challenging due to jurisdictional limitations. H.R. 2454 includes reporting and reviewing requirements for REDD activities, such as a publicly accessible registry for emissions reductions achieved annually. Enforcement of activities in recipient countries and consequences for non-compliance are not directly addressed. The bills S. 1733 and H.R. 2454 require reporting and scientific reviews of REDD activities and emissions reductions. However, there are no penalties or mechanisms for maintaining project integrity in the program. The bills S. 1733 and H.R. 2454 lack environmental justice mechanisms for disputes or claims. Different U.S. environmental initiatives have varied approaches to enforcement and oversight, such as the TFCA fund overseen by an independent board and the dispute resolution entity in the U.S.-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement. The Trade Promotion Agreement (TPA) requires Parties to enforce environmental laws and address complaints. Permanence of GHG emissions reductions in developing countries through REDD activities faces challenges like economic viability, monitoring accuracy, and government support. Sustained funding incentives could support permanence. Supporters argue that REDD activities, even without guaranteed permanence of reductions, are still valuable. They believe capturing carbon in forests is crucial for short-term carbon emission reduction until technological solutions emerge. Additionally, they suggest that some activities may lead to long-term benefits like implementing new forest governance systems and promoting sustainable forestry management. Both bills include monitoring and reporting requirements for REDD projects, although permanence of GHG reductions is not discussed. International offsets allow entities to offset emissions by purchasing credits for GHG reduction activities in foreign countries. Both H.R. 2454 and S. 1733 include provisions for international offsets, such as REDD activities, with varying conditions and limits on the amount of offsets that can be purchased. The bills differ on guidelines, types of qualifying activities, transparency for indigenous communities, and the level at which offsets can be established. Both bills limit the amount of international offsets, including those from REDD activities, which are expected to provide a majority of the offsets. Both H.R. 2454 and S. 1733 limit total offsets at 2 GtCO2 annually, with different limits on international offsets. H.R. 2454 allows up to 1 GtCO2 from international credits, while S. 1733 allows up to 0.5 GtCO2. Both bills have conditions for modifying these limits based on domestic offset usage. For example, H.R. 2454 can increase international offset credits by up to 0.5 GtCO2 if domestic offset usage falls below 1 GtCO2. Under H.R. 2454 and S. 1733, international offset credits are limited to 1 GtCO2 and 0.5 GtCO2 annually, respectively. Both bills require countries to meet eligibility standards for salable international offsets, including bilateral or multilateral agreements with the United States, developing country status, and other criteria. The bills H.R. 2454 and S. 1733 limit international offset credits to 1 GtCO2 and 0.5 GtCO2 annually, respectively. Requirements include bilateral agreements with the United States, developing country status, and ensuring emissions reductions are realized before credits are issued. Funding for REDD projects must be provided upfront. Additional provisions in S. 1733 require offset projects to be subject to U.S. federal court actions. Both bills, H.R. 2454 and S. 1733, have requirements for offsets, including a land or forest sector strategic plan. S. 1733 has more extensive criteria than H.R. 2454, but both include assessments of deforestation drivers, emissions estimates, and strategies for low-emissions development. S. 1733 also addresses transparency, local participation, and monitoring. Land use plans in both bills would be under the host country's jurisdiction. The bills outline criteria for deforestation baseline calculations on a national scale, aiming for zero net deforestation within 20 years. They also consider significant sources of GHG emissions and allow for adjustments based on changing circumstances. However, it is unclear what circumstances would warrant a change in the baseline. The bills outline criteria for deforestation baseline calculations on a national scale, aiming for zero net deforestation within 20 years. They also consider significant sources of GHG emissions and allow for adjustments based on changing circumstances, such as improved technology for measuring emissions or natural disasters altering forest cover. Any change in the baseline could impact the quantity of offset credits a country could sell. For international offsets associated with REDD, three categories of activities would qualify in both bills. The bills outline criteria for deforestation baseline calculations on a national scale, aiming for zero net deforestation within 20 years. They also consider significant sources of GHG emissions and allow for adjustments based on changing circumstances. Actual REDD activities eligible for international offsets are not listed in either bill, and are left to the discretion of the President under S. 1733 and of the EPA Administrator under H.R. 2454. Project types to be considered include afforestation, reforestation, forest management, reductions in GHG emissions, and changes in carbon stocks. State- or province-level REDD activities could qualify for offsets if the national government is not ready, willing, or able. Both bills also allow EPA to expand the scope of REDD activities to include reductions in forest degradation and losses in soil carbon. The eligibility requirements for REDD activities vary between the bills. Under S. 1733, eligible states or provinces must be affected by deforestation activities and have the technical and institutional capacity to implement REDD. H.R. 2454 emphasizes that the state or province must be a major emitter of GHG from tropical deforestation. Both bills require the creation of a state or province level baseline of carbon emissions from deforestation.Offsets would be issued based on the difference between baseline emissions and actual emissions. Both bills propose eligibility requirements for REDD activities, with a focus on states or provinces affected by deforestation. They both include provisions for offset credits based on emissions reductions and have a phase-out provision after five years. Project and program level activities are authorized to generate REDD offsets, with EPA creating a list of eligible countries for these activities. Countries with less than 1% of global GHG emissions and 3% of global forest sector emissions could participate in REDD project credits. The bills propose eligibility requirements for REDD activities, focusing on states or provinces affected by deforestation. Project and program level activities can generate REDD offsets, with eligible countries needing to make progress towards implementing a national level plan. Countries not interested in a national program can still participate in international REDD offsets. Brazil and Indonesia would not be eligible under the bills. Both S. 1733 and H.R. 2454 propose phasing out project and program level activities after a certain period, with potential extensions if specific criteria are met. Without proper monitoring, activities could lead to \"leakage\" to neighboring areas. Some argue that all REDD activities should be measured against a national baseline to prevent leakage. Concerns include the distribution of funds to wealthier landowners, leaving rural and poor landowners at a disadvantage. Addressing indigenous and local people's rights is a key theme in both bills. The REDD activities could favor those with more resources, displacing local people in developing countries. It may also harm local economies by taking away land used for agriculture and forest products. Both bills aim to protect the rights of local communities, indigenous peoples, and vulnerable groups in the offset program. Establishing a dispute resolution mechanism in offset agreements with host countries could help ensure adherence to provisions for sharing profits with local communities. Concerns about REDD offsets include verifiability, additionality, leakage, and permanence. Some developing countries may lack capacity to address concerns about REDD offsets, such as enforcing laws, preventing illegal activities, and measuring forest carbon levels. Funding for REDD allowances may not be enough to build governance capacity for participation in offset markets. Transitioning from supplemental emissions reductions to offset markets in developing countries is also a concern. The bills anticipate transitioning from supplemental emissions reductions to national REDD offsets, but the pathway for this transition is unclear. Near-term failures in the current program could impact the national deforestation baseline. Developing countries' long-term participation in the REDD offset market may affect their ability to use REDD for domestic development and economic growth. Entities involved in developing offsets for REDD have incentives to minimize pre-existing carbon baselines to maximize carbon sequestration sales. However, there is no independent review of national deforestation baselines for REDD offsets, potentially influenced by political considerations rather than objective standards. This raises doubts about the actual additional carbon sequestration from REDD projects. A portion of allowances from auctions would fund REDD activities, with proceeds used to purchase international offsets. These offsets would be converted back into emissions allowances to refill the strategic reserve. The Market Stability Reserve would use proceeds to purchase domestic or international offset credits, enhancing the domestic offset credit sector. S. 1733 does not limit purchases to international REDD offsets, allowing for other types of international offsets to be bought. The Strategic Reserve under H.R. 2454 and the Market Stability Reserve under S. 1733 could generate funds for REDD offsets at a one-to-one ratio. Both bills aim to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, with H.R. 2454 benefiting REDD activities more by only allowing proceeds to purchase international REDD offsets. Deforestation is a significant source of global CO2 emissions. Both H.R. 2454 and S. 1733 allow international REDD offsets for covered entities in the United States, with a reserve to stabilize carbon offset prices. H.R. 2454 provides more implementation details, using the EPA as the primary administrator, while S. 1733 relies on USAID. Both bills include capacity building and supplemental emissions reductions for REDD activities, with concerns about implementation effectiveness. The bills do not specify how to balance these reductions. Carbon offsets from REDD activities offer a significant opportunity to reduce global CO2 emissions, but concerns persist about their effectiveness. Many developing countries lack the resources to verify avoided deforestation, raising questions about the impact of REDD activities. Capacity building for implementing REDD is crucial for both emissions reductions and offsets, but the specific activities involved are unclear. Many concerns exist regarding the effectiveness and implementation of REDD activities. Questions arise about the displacement of deforestation, the permanence of avoided deforestation in developing countries, and the undefined transition process to national programs. There are also doubts about whether REDD offsets in developing countries could hinder global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and impede the development of low-carbon economies."
