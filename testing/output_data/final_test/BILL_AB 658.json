    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 4011.10 of the Penal Code is amended to provide county sheriffs, chiefs of police, and directors of local detention facilities with an incentive to pay legitimate health care costs for persons in custody and to negotiate service contracts with hospitals in good faith. The law allows county sheriffs, police chiefs, and public agencies to contract with healthcare providers for local law enforcement patients. Hospitals not under contract must provide care at 110% of their actual costs. The law allows county sheriffs, police chiefs, and public agencies to contract with healthcare providers for local law enforcement patients. The hospital must choose an appropriate cost-to-charge ratio and notify the relevant agency of any changes. If the hospital uses the Medicare Program ratio, supporting documentation must be provided. If approval is not granted within 60 days, the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development ratio will be used for payment calculation. A county sheriff or police chief cannot release an inmate for medical care at a hospital and then immediately rearrest them upon discharge, unless the hospital needs to bill a third-party payment source. The California Hospital Association, University of California, California State Sheriffs\u2019 Association, and California Police Chiefs Association will form the Inmate Health Care and Medical Provider Fair Pricing Working Group to address fiscal barriers to timely and affordable inmate health care. The group will consist of members from each organization and meet as needed to resolve industry issues. The Inmate Health Care and Medical Provider Fair Pricing Working Group will address fiscal barriers to inmate health care, including issues like inmates being readmitted after care and any obstacles to hospitals forming fair market contracts with public agencies. The group will also tackle any disparities in local law enforcement patients being treated at specific hospitals. No reimbursement is necessary under this provision. An entity providing ambulance or emergency services to law enforcement agencies must be reimbursed at Medicare rates. Law enforcement departments cannot reimburse providers they have not contracted with at rates exceeding reasonable costs. For the purposes of this section, \"reasonable and allowable costs\" are defined in accordance with federal regulations. In counties where the sheriff does not administer a jail facility, the director or administrator of a local department of corrections may contract for services provided to jail inmates."
