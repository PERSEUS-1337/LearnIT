SCF institutions offer traditional banking services but operate under different principles compared to conventional banks. Islamic banking is seen as a complement to conventional banks according to research from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Key principles of shariah in finance include a ban on interest (riba) which differs from conventional finance. Islamic finance, based on shariah or Islamic law, involves Shariah-compliant financing (SCF) that adheres to Islamic principles. SCF institutions operate under principles that prohibit usurious interest and promote risk-sharing and profit-sharing in financial transactions. Uncertainty in contractual terms is also prohibited, and ethical investments that enhance society are encouraged. Shariah-compliant financing involves shared business risks, ethical investments, and asset-backing tied to tangible assets. Financial institutions offering Islamic products have a shariah supervisory board to ensure compliance with Islamic principles, making them attractive to investors. International institutions promote consistency in Islamic finance. International institutions like AAOIFI and IFSB set international standards for Islamic finance. AAOIFI, founded in 1991 in Bahrain, issues standards on accounting, auditing, and governance with 200 members from 45 countries. IFSB, based in Malaysia since 2003, focuses on supervision and regulation. U.S. federal banking regulators have provided guidance on shariah-compliant products. The OCC issued directives on shariah-compliant mortgage products, including guidance on ijara and murabaha. Standardizing Islamic finance regulations is challenging due to varying interpretations of shariah and differing laws and practices across countries. The maturity of Islamic finance markets also varies, further complicating standardization efforts. The lack of standardization in Islamic finance markets raises legal uncertainty regarding shariah-compliance risk. A recent dispute between Lebanon's Blom Bank and Kuwait's Investment Dar highlighted this issue. Standardization of regulations is seen as crucial for increasing marketability and acceptance of Islamic products. Various initiatives have been made to improve regulatory practices, such as the IFSB publishing guiding principles in 2009. The Islamic finance industry has seen rapid growth, with estimates suggesting assets under Islamic finance management doubled between 2007 and 2010 to reach around $1 trillion. Shariah-compliant assets in the top 500 Islamic financial institutions rose from $822 billion in 2009 to $895 billion in 2010. Islamic finance represents a small proportion of the global finance market (1%-5% of global share) but has experienced double-digit growth rates annually (10%-20%). New standards in risk management and corporate governance are being developed by the AAOIFI. In 2010, Islamic banks showed resilience to the global economic downturn and financial crisis, with assets reaching $895 billion. They avoided speculative investments like derivatives, which contributed to the crisis in conventional banks. Islamic finance is seen as a way to recover from the crisis and attract investors seeking alternative financing sources. However, Islamic banks are not completely immune to global economic shocks. Islamic finance, insulated from recent economic shocks, is considered less risky due to physical asset backing. However, Islamic banks may be vulnerable to mortgage market fluctuations. The industry has expanded beyond Muslim-majority countries, driven by awareness and demand for Islamic-based financial products. The demand for Islamic-based financial products is increasing among both Muslim consumers and non-Muslim businesses and investors. Islamic finance activities are growing in traditional centers like the Middle East and Asia, driven by oil liquidity and investment needs. Countries without large Muslim populations are also interested in Islamic finance to attract new capital and facilitate trade with Muslim-majority countries. Iran accounts for about 40% of global assets in Islamic finance. Iran holds 40% of global Islamic finance assets, but international sanctions may limit its market reach. Major Islamic finance markets include Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Malaysia. Islamic finance is also growing in the UK, with the Islamic Bank of Britain being the first to serve there. The UK has seen growth in Islamic finance, with the licensing of the Islamic Bank of Britain and the European Islamic Investment Bank. Other countries like sub-Saharan African countries, Indonesia, and Thailand are also making strides in Islamic finance. Various countries are revising their frameworks to attract Islamic finance, including addressing taxation issues. European countries like France and Ireland, as well as Asian countries like Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Singapore, are working to allow or attract Islamic finance. Islamic finance has seen significant growth globally, with countries like Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Thailand actively participating. Australia is also involved in these efforts. Islamic banking has expanded from a few institutions in the mid-1970s to hundreds operating in over 40 countries. Islamic finance instruments are used for various financial activities such as credit, savings, investment, and trade. Major international banks like HSBC, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan, and Standard Chartered Bank offer shariah-compliant financial products through \"Islamic windows.\" Islamic banking is prominent in real estate, leasing, and commodities, but has expanded into other areas as well. In the early stages, Islamic finance instruments were limited to sales contracts, leasing, and asset-pooling partnership agreements. However, innovations in Islamic financial products have been witnessed in the past couple of decades. The Dow Jones introduced its first Islamic market index in 1999, which follows shariah-compliant stocks globally. The index is advised by an independent shariah supervisory board consisting of Islamic scholars from various countries. Islamic capital market securities, a fast-growing segment, were introduced in 2001. Practitioners encourage continued innovation in the Islamic finance industry. Practitioners in the Islamic finance industry are urged to innovate, particularly in risk management. The use of securitization and derivatives, if carefully implemented, can help reduce risk for Islamic finance institutions. However, the controversial application of derivatives in Islamic finance has led to the development of shariah-compliant options through consultations between scholars and industry professionals. The growth of Islamic finance has highlighted a need for professionals well-versed in Islamic principles and financial products, as there is a shortage of experts who understand both Islamic and conventional finance. This lack of expertise may hinder the growth of Islamic finance, prompting the introduction of new courses and degree programs. The global market for Islamic bonds, known as sukuk, is estimated to be over $110 billion. Malaysia is the largest sukuk market, accounting for over 40% of global issuances, followed by the UAE. Other major issuers include Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Sudan. Most sukuk from Malaysia are in the oil and gas sector, while those from Gulf countries are focused on real estate. Global issuance of sukuk increased significantly from 2004 to 2007, peaking at around $35 billion. However, sales dropped to $15 billion in 2008 before rising to $20 billion in 2009. The slowdown in sukuk issuance was attributed to the global economic downturn, lower liquidity in the market, and concerns about shariah compliance. Additionally, high-profile defaults of Islamic bonds were reported in 2009. In May 2009, high-profile defaults of Islamic bonds occurred, including Kuwait-based Investment Dar, International Investment Group, and U.S. energy firm East Cameron. Despite challenges, analysts see long-term viability in the Islamic bond market due to growing popularity, government interest, and financial institutions seeking diversification. In the U.S., there is increasing interest in Islamic finance as an alternative to conventional finance facing challenges from the subprime lending crisis and recession concerns. In the United States, shariah-compliant finance, particularly in personal home mortgages, is gaining popularity as an alternative to conventional finance amidst the subprime lending crisis and recession concerns. Guidance Residential, University Islamic Financial, Devon Bank, and American Finance House Lariba are among the financial intermediaries offering Islamic-based home mortgages. HSBC is the only large commercial bank providing U.S. Islamic finance, primarily in New York. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchase shariah-compliant mortgage contracts from intermediaries, with Freddie Mac buying over $250 million in Islamic home loans in 2007. In the United States, Islamic finance is gaining popularity, with various financial intermediaries offering shariah-compliant services such as home mortgages, commercial real estate financing, and mutual funds. Muslim investors from the Gulf Cooperation Council are diversifying their portfolios by investing in U.S. assets, while U.S.-based companies are utilizing Islamic financing abroad. Arcapita Bank from Bahrain has structured shariah-compliant transactions in private equity and real estate in the U.S. General Electric was the first major U.S. company to sell a $500 million Islamic bond in November 2009 to attract international investors. Critics raise concerns about capital adequacy and system risks as Islamic finance activities grow in the U.S. Proponents believe the ban on risk-taking mitigates concerns and see the integration of ethics into finance positively. Investors consider shariah-compliant finance more resilient to global crises, although Islamic financial markets are still tied to the world economy. The growth of Islamic finance in the United States may have implications for congressional oversight regarding the relationship between U.S. banking laws and Islamic finance. Some aspects of Islamic finance may pose unique challenges to U.S. regulations, such as applying rules created for conventional products to Islamic ones. There is debate about the extent to which regulators should apply rules on conventional products to Islamic counterparts, with concerns raised about possible ties to terrorist finance networks by some U.S. financial institutions. Some argue that Islamic banking transactions may fund terrorists, while others believe the risks are not significantly different from conventional finance. Security concerns about Islamic finance may stem from a lack of understanding or stereotyping, with some linking it to hawala, an informal money transfer system. The hawala system is a transfer system used in the Middle East and Muslim countries, based on an honor system with no records of transactions. Some analysts believe it is vulnerable to terrorist financing."
