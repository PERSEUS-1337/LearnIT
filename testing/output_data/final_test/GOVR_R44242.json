    "content": "The effect of marginal tax rates on labor supply is driven by the \"substitution effect,\" which considers the impact of taxes on the relative prices of leisure and consumption. Higher taxes on labor lead to lower after-tax wages, making leisure more attractive. The reduction in labor supply depends on changes in effective marginal tax rates and worker responsiveness (elasticity). Various tax reform proposals suggest limiting itemized deductions to alter effective marginal tax rates. The estimated effects on labor supply due to changes in effective marginal tax rates are calculated by multiplying them with labor supply elasticities of substitution. The calculation does not consider feedback effects from the economy, such as the negligible impact on labor supply from changes in the capital stock. Effective marginal tax rates in the report are calculated using a simplified individual income tax calculator applied to the 2008 IRS Statistics of Income Public Use File. The report estimates tax rates for various options to limit itemized deductions, weighted by income sources for each income group. It then analyzes effective marginal tax rates and changes for different policy options, such as eliminating or capping itemized deductions. These options aim to show potential effects on taxes. The report analyzes effective marginal tax rates for different policy options to limit itemized deductions, weighted by income sources for each income group. The resulting differences reflect the effect of the policy options on itemizers. The report analyzes the effects of policy options on itemizers and economy-wide estimates of labor supply. Table 2 shows the impact of adjusting for non-itemizers, with the option to eliminate all itemized deductions having the largest effect. The percentage point changes in effective marginal tax rates need to be converted into percentage changes in the after-tax share for labor supply calculations. The taxpayer response to policy options on itemized deductions is influenced by the sensitivity of their work decision to changes in the effective marginal tax rate. Elasticities estimate the labor supply response to wage changes, incorporating supply-side effects in dynamic models. The direction of the labor supply response to wage changes is uncertain due to positive substitution elasticity and negative income elasticity. The analysis considers the additional marginal effects from base-broadening on labor supply responses. Recent surveys show that labor supply is largely inelastic, with substitution elasticities ranging from 0.1 to 0.4 for different groups. A 2014 study used a wage-weighted population substitution elasticity of 0.1 to 0.2. The supply-side response to limiting itemized deductions involves calculating the impact on labor supply based on changes in marginal effective tax rates and labor supply substitution elasticity. Higher effective tax rates can lead to individuals working less and supplying less labor to the economy. Estimates show that labor supply responses to base broadening partially offset the positive effects of lower marginal tax rates. For example, a tax reform proposal in 2014 resulted in labor supply increases of 0.4% to 0.8% over a ten-year period. The estimate for labor supply increases from 0.4% to 0.8% for FY2014-FY2023 was for a complex tax reform proposal. Incorporating changes in effective marginal tax rates could reduce growth effects. High elasticity estimates from eliminating itemized deductions for state and local income taxes may offset gains in labor supply. Base-broadening provisions impact savings and investment, with individual income rate increases affecting the return on savings and investment. The effects of base-broadening provisions on savings and investment, including taxes on passive investment returns, are examined. These effects are estimated for investment in equipment, structures, and intangible business assets. The impact on the capital stock is likely to be smaller than on labor, with changes accruing gradually. Capital could also be attracted from abroad. The effective marginal tax rates for investment income are influenced by various factors in the tax code, such as deductions and credits, impacting the share of earnings from investments paid in taxes. Calculated based on after-tax rate of return and economic depreciation, these rates determine the cost of capital and potential effects of revenue-neutral tax reforms. The analysis determines the initial investment needed for after-tax profits to equal the investment outlay. Tax payments and deductions are removed to calculate the pre-tax discount rate matching the flows to the original cost. The user cost of capital formula considers tax provisions to derive an effective tax rate. The analysis uses a formula to calculate effective tax rates for different types of assets, excluding certain provisions like bonus depreciation and research tax credits. Separate estimates are provided for corporate and noncorporate capital stocks, weighted by their asset shares. The curr_chunk discusses the effective tax rate effects of various changes, including capital cost recovery provisions, repeal of production activities deduction, indexation of interest deductions, and elimination of itemized deduction for state and local taxes. These estimates are detailed in Appendix B. The curr_chunk discusses the effective tax rates for equity investments, comparing them to statutory tax rates for corporate and noncorporate firms. Most assets are taxed at rates below the statutory rate, with equipment assets and public utility structures taxed well below the statutory rate. The curr_chunk discusses how various assets are taxed at rates below the statutory rate due to generous tax depreciation rules. Intangibles are taxed at zero, mining structures have low tax rates, and commercial/industrial structures are taxed at a higher rate. Farm buildings and residential rental structures are favored due to shorter depreciation periods. The curr_chunk provides aggregated tax rates for different asset groups, with equipment and public utility structures taxed at lower rates compared to corporations and noncorporate businesses. Bonus depreciation and research tax credits further reduce effective tax rates on equipment and R&D intangibles. The curr_chunk discusses the effects of base broadening achieved by slowing deductions for investments, specifically focusing on the differential effects of capital cost recovery provisions for different assets. It also analyzes the effective tax rates for assets under the alternative depreciation system, which uses a slower depreciation method. The table presented shows the effects of recovering investments in research and development and advertising over a 10-year period using the straight-line method. The alternative depreciation system affects assets differently, with tax rates for certain assets nearing or exceeding the statutory rate. Intangible assets see a significant increase in tax rates, particularly for advertising. Proposed legislation aims to amortize intangibles and make the R&D credit permanent, potentially resulting in an estimated effective tax rate of 4.4%. Table 9 shows effective tax rates after base broadening, with equipment close to statutory rate but slightly lower due to production activities deduction. Rates on structures are slightly lower, except for buildings. Other tax changes do not vary substantially across assets. The overall tax system includes firm-level taxes on equity investment, shareholder-level taxes on dividends and capital gains, and the tax benefits of borrowing. Debt-financed investment can be taxed at negative or very low rates, resulting in an overall tax rate lower than the firm-level rate on equity. Table 10 displays current effective tax rates and the impact of base-broadening provisions, considering taxes paid by stockholders, interest deductibility by the firm, and taxation of interest by creditors. The current effective tax rates for the corporate and noncorporate sectors are reduced from 22.3% to 12.8% and from 20.8% to 11.9%, respectively, due to the taxation of interest by creditors. This results in a 43% reduction in the tax rate. The low total tax rate is attributed to rapid cost recovery for investments and deducting nominal interest at the firm's tax rate, with most of the interest not taxed to creditors. Comparing effective tax rates with and without these benefits shows a significant difference. The overall tax rate for the corporate sector would be 39.7%, reflecting a share of income taxed at the creditor's rate of 22.0%, the rate on equity of 35.0% at the corporate level, and additional taxes on capital gains and dividends resulting in a combined 44.5% tax rate for corporate equity. For the noncorporate sector, the rate would be 25.6%, between the creditor's rate of 22.0% and the firm's rate of 27.0%. These rates are reduced to 30.0% and 21.6% if exclusions of interest, capital gains, and dividends are considered. The base-broadening provisions considered include accelerated cost recovery, deducting inflation portion of interest, and the production activities deduction. These provisions impact the effective tax rate by reducing it for corporate equity and increasing it for debt-financed investment. The most significant provision is the move to the alternative depreciation system, which increases the overall tax rate by 4.6 percentage points. Research and development and advertising create intangible assets with longevity, affecting future income streams. Depreciating research expenses over 10 years increases effective tax rates by 2.8 percentage points, while depreciating advertising expenses over 10 years results in a one-percentage-point increase. The effective tax rate increases for both debt-financed and equity-financed capital due to changes in tax rates. Indexation of interest for inflation raises the overall tax rate by three percentage points, affecting only debt-financed capital. Disallowing state and local tax deductions or itemized deductions has a significant impact on noncorporate equity investment. Adopting the alternative depreciation system also plays a crucial role in affecting tax rates. The itemized deduction limits increase the overall tax rate by 0.6 to 0.7 percentage points, smaller than other provisions but larger than the production activities deduction. Comparing these effects to lowering the statutory corporate tax rate shows a 2.5-to-2.9-percentage-point equivalent change in the corporate rate. Considering these provisions is important in measuring the effects of tax reform on the rate of return on investment. The user cost of capital, influenced by tax reform, is crucial in determining the effects on the rate of return on investment. It is calculated as R/(1-t)+d, where R is the after-tax return, t is the tax rate, and d is the depreciation rate. Changes in the effective marginal tax rate can impact the required pre-tax return to capital, thus affecting the user cost of capital. The user cost of capital is influenced by tax reform, impacting the rate of return on investment. Changes in the effective marginal tax rate can affect the required pre-tax return to capital, thus influencing the user cost of capital. Table 11 and Table 12 show the increases in the cost of capital and estimate the long-run effects on the capital stock, considering factors like factor substitution elasticity and savings elasticity. The effects of changing tax variables on the capital stock are limited due to the small role taxes play in the cost of capital. Even repealing significant provisions like alternative depreciation only slightly reduces the capital stock. Limiting itemized deductions, which are often not utilized, has a small impact on the capital stock. In comparison, a five-percentage-point decrease in the corporate tax rate is estimated to slightly increase the capital stock. Tax reform affecting savings and investment is unlikely to significantly impact capital growth. A 5% decrease in the corporate tax rate would increase the capital stock by 0.2% to 0.4%, while a 10% reduction proposed in The Tax Reform Act of 2014 would increase it by 0.4% to 0.8%. These effects can be offset by limiting itemized deductions. The Tax Reform Act of 2014 proposed a 10% reduction in the corporate tax rate, which could increase the capital stock by 0.4% to 0.8%. However, this rate cut could be offset by changes in the individual tax rates, such as disallowing itemized deductions for state and local taxes. Broadening the tax base can partially or fully offset the effects of changing tax rates on labor and capital income. The analysis suggests that achieving increased economic growth through revenue-neutral tax reform may be challenging, as seen in the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Tax reform can still achieve other goals, such as reducing distortions in the tax system and simplifying tax compliance and administration. These efficiency gains may not significantly impact measured output. The analysis used 2008 IRS data to estimate individual tax rates and changes in deductions. The sample included 139,651 taxpayers. The analysis used 2008 IRS data to estimate individual tax rates and changes in deductions for 139,651 taxpayers. Taxable income was calculated by subtracting personal exemptions and itemized deductions from total income. Tax liabilities were calculated based on current law parameters adjusted to 2008 levels, without considering AMT, phase in/outs, or tax credits. The analysis focuses on limitations on itemized deductions for taxpayers who choose to itemize deductions. Effective marginal tax rates are calculated by comparing initial and additional tax liabilities after allocating $1,000 in ordinary income to each taxpayer. The difference between the two tax liabilities divided by $1,000 gives the effective marginal tax rate. The effective marginal tax rate is calculated by dividing the difference in tax liabilities after allocating $1,000 in income by $1,000. This rate is then weighted by income shares and distribution within itemizers. Average effective marginal tax rates are calculated for different income deciles, and a composite marginal effective tax rate is created. The effective marginal tax rate is calculated by dividing the difference in tax liabilities after allocating $1,000 in income by $1,000, weighted by income shares and distribution within itemizers. The resulting estimates are presented in Table 1 and Table 2, showing the differences in effective marginal tax rates faced by taxpayers that itemize. The methodology and data for calculating changes in effective tax rates on capital income are provided in this appendix. The methodology and data for calculating changes in effective tax rates on capital income are provided, focusing on base-broadening provisions affecting savings and investment. The formula for calculating the effective firm-level tax rate is explained, considering pre-tax return, after-tax discount rate, corporate tax rate, economic depreciation rate, and present discounted value of tax depreciation deductions. The formula for calculating the pre-tax return for noncorporate businesses involves adjusting for effective tax rates on capital gains and dividends. The discount rates differ between corporate and noncorporate firms, with the noncorporate sector using the corporate discount rate reduced by taxes on capital gains and dividends. Special tax rates and adjustments are made for earnings not subject to tax in an economy-wide portfolio. The effective tax rate is determined by the statutory rate, the recovery of costs, and any credits. Rapid depreciation lowers the tax rate. The formula is used to calculate firm-level tax rates. To calculate the total sectoral tax rate, the firm's discount rate is adjusted to include debt finance. The effective tax rate is determined by the statutory rate, cost recovery, and credits. Rapid depreciation lowers the tax rate for firm-level calculations. The pre-tax returns for various assets are weighted to provide an overall pre-tax return, excluding land. Assets used in business include structures, equipment, and intangible assets. They are assigned to either the corporate or noncorporate sector. Table B-1 lists asset values and economic depreciation rates for 22 types of equipment assets, 7 types of structures, and 3 types of intangibles. The value of assets depends on tax recovery speed, tax life, and depreciation method. For more details on tax lives and depreciation formulas, refer to [author name scrubbed], The Economic Effects of Taxing Capital Income, MIT Press, 1994. Alternative lives simulated in the report are available upon request. The report provides data on mining structures costs, with 57.7% expensed through intangible drilling costs and dry holes. Table B-2 summarizes asset distribution in corporate and noncorporate sectors. Additional data needed for rates of return, inflation rate, debt finance share, and tax rates. Effective tax rates are sensitive to tax rates, not real rates of return. The effective tax rates are sensitive to the inflation rate, with an equity rate of return set at 7% before individual tax. Debt is weighted at 36% and equity at 64%. The nominal interest rate is 7.5% with an inflation rate of 2%. The statutory corporate tax rate is 35%, slightly reduced by deductions. Manufacturing and non-manufacturing claims affect corporate income tax returns. The estimated tax rates for equipment, structures, and intangible assets in the National Income and Product Accounts are 34.12%, 34.29%, and 33.83%, respectively, with an overall rate of 34.14%. For unincorporated business income, the estimated statutory tax rate is 27%. When considering individual returns, the estimated tax rates for the three categories are 26.74%, 26.87%, and 26.56%, with an overall rate of 26.83%. Disallowing itemized deductions for state and local taxes increases the rate by 1.69 percentage points. State and local taxes increased the rate by 1.69 percentage points, and disallowing all itemized deductions increased the rate by 2.5 percentage points. The marginal rates for interest, dividends, and capital gains are 22%, 14.6%, and 15.4%, respectively. These values were increased by 1.22, 1.68, and 1.7 percentage points if disallowing itemized deductions for state and local income taxes and by 1.93, 2.45, and 2.44 percentage points if disallowing all itemized deductions. Interest and dividends paid do not fully appear on individual income tax returns, with a small share reported due to assets in pension and retirement accounts. The small share reported is largely due to assets in pension, retirement, and insurance plans. Half of privately held capital gains is assumed untaxed until death. Firms can choose between two research tax credits, resulting in an effective marginal rate of slightly more than half, or 7.9%. The research credit offers an effective marginal rate of slightly more than half, or 7.9%. The model uses a CES production function and obtains differentials for output, capital stock, and labor. The numeraire for this model is the overall price level, P. The equation dP/P = a(dC/C) + (1-a)(dW/W) = 0 relates the change in wage rate and cost of capital when price is fixed. The cost of capital is R/(1-t c ) +d, where R is the after-tax real return, t c is the tax rate, and d is the economic depreciation rate. The wage links labor and capital demand to their prices. In the short run, with fixed capital stock, the labor supply function is dL/L = (E LS -E LI ) (dW/W) \u2013 E LS dt/(1-t). Labor demand is equated to labor supply to measure the effect on wages. In the long run, labor demand is equated to labor supply to solve for wages and labor. The feedback effect on labor from wage increases disappears if income and substitution elasticities are equal. The long-run effects on capital involve a supply function for capital in the form of a savings rate. Savings equals investment in the steady state. In the steady state, savings equals investment, and the model can be solved for the change in capital and labor due to changes in tax rates on labor and capital income. The effect on the capital stock depends on the factor substitution elasticity. Without a change in the tax rate on capital, there is no feedback. In the steady state, savings equals investment, and the model can be solved for the change in capital and labor due to changes in tax rates on labor and capital income. The factor substitution elasticity determines the effect on the capital stock. Without a change in the tax rate on capital, there is no feedback effect on wages."
