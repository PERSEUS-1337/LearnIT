    "content": "The \"Pollution and Costs Reduction Act\" aims to reduce emissions of air pollutants to stimulate job creation and innovation in clean technology industries. It highlights the inefficiency in energy consumption in buildings, leading to high operating costs exceeding $100 billion annually. The Act includes a Building Pollution Reduction Program. The Clean Air Act is amended to include a Building Pollution Reduction Program, which defines air pollutants and emissions from buildings. The Administrator is tasked with establishing and implementing this program. The Building Pollution Reduction Program aims to assist building owners in the US to reduce air pollutants and operating costs by constructing efficient buildings or improving existing ones. Assistance is based on verifiable emissions reductions through operational improvements like energy efficiency. The Building Pollution Reduction Program aims to assist building owners in the US to reduce air pollutants and operating costs through improved energy efficiency, water-use efficiency, renewable energy sources, and additional measures determined by the Administrator. Priority is given to projects achieving minimum scores on energy performance benchmarking tools. The Energy Star program, established by the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, requires buildings to achieve a certain energy performance benchmarking score or rating. Retrofitting existing buildings must show significant improvement in their benchmarking score. The benchmarking tool must show a minimum 30-point improvement or an equivalent using an established metric. Building owners with a track record of pollution reduction must complete the measures, resulting in measurable pollution reduction benefits beyond Energy Star metrics. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2012 through 2016 to carry out the section."
