The \"CBP Hiring and Retention Act of 2016\" allows for retention incentives for U.S. Customs and Border Protection employees critical to border security. The Secretary of Homeland Security can pay a retention bonus to prevent these employees from leaving federal service. The \"CBP Hiring and Retention Act of 2016\" allows for retention bonuses for critical U.S. Customs and Border Protection employees to prevent them from leaving federal service. Payment is contingent on entering a written agreement with specific terms and conditions. Retention bonuses under the \"CBP Hiring and Retention Act of 2016\" are subject to specific conditions and regulations, including termination terms and payment limits. The bonus amount is a percentage of the employee's basic pay, capped at 25%, and can be paid in installments or as a lump sum. Retention bonuses under the \"CBP Hiring and Retention Act of 2016\" can be paid in installments or as a lump sum at the end of the service period. Installment payments are calculated based on a percentage of basic pay, not exceeding the bonus percentage rate. If the installment payment percentage is lower than the bonus percentage rate, the remaining bonus amount is paid in the final installment. The retention bonus under the \"CBP Hiring and Retention Act of 2016\" is payable as part of the final installment payment to the covered CBP employee after completing the full service period. This bonus is excluded from the employee's basic pay. \"SEC. 3. PILOT PROGRAMS FOR U.S. CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION.\" In this section, definitions are provided for terms like \"covered area,\" \"covered CBP employee,\" \"Department,\" and \"Secretary.\" The Secretary has the authority to establish special rates of pay for covered CBP employees in designated areas. The duty station is in a covered area with a maximum special rate of pay not exceeding 125 percent of the regular rate for covered CBP employees. The special rate expires after 2 years unless extended by the Secretary based on performance evaluation. The Secretary may extend the period for paying covered CBP employees at special rates of pay if performance is satisfactory. The rate of pay reverts to what it would have been without the special rate when the pilot program ends. During a 1-year period, if an applicant for a position in U.S. Customs and Border Protection fails a polygraph examination, the results cannot be disclosed to other agencies or used by them. The Secretary may use polygraph examinations to determine appointments in the agency, with a possible extension if deemed satisfactory. Applicants must be provided with a list of disqualifying actions before undergoing the examination. The Secretary may use polygraph examinations for appointments in the agency, providing applicants with a list of potential disqualifying actions. The list is not exhaustive, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection retains the authority to report admissions. The bill aims to restrict the use of polygraph examination results by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and other federal agencies for appointment decisions. The bill aims to limit the use of polygraph results by federal agencies for appointing individuals to positions."
