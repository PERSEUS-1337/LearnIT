    "content": "The \"Reciprocal Market Access Act of 2011\" is the short title of this Act. It aims to establish findings and purposes related to market access. Congress finds that the fundamental tenet of the World Trade Organization is reciprocal market access, as outlined in the Marrakesh Agreement. The American people have the right to expect that promises made by trade negotiators will be realized, with a results-oriented approach forming the basis of future trade agreements. The United States emphasizes the need for verification procedures in trade negotiations to ensure market access and reciprocal trade benefits. Tariffs have been reduced or eliminated, making nontariff barriers the main challenge for US exports. The US market is known for being open with low tariff rates and limited nontariff barriers. The purpose of this Act is to ensure that US trade negotiations result in expanded market access for US exports by addressing nontariff barriers imposed by foreign countries. Currently, negotiations focus on reducing tariffs separately from nontariff barriers, which can hinder US businesses' access to foreign markets. The purpose of the Act is to ensure expanded market access for US exports by addressing nontariff barriers imposed by foreign countries, not just eliminating tariffs on goods imported into the US. LIMITATION ON AUTHORITY TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE RATES OF DUTY PURSUANT TO CERTAIN TRADE AGREEMENTS. The President cannot reduce or eliminate duty rates on products as part of a trade agreement with a foreign country without first certifying to Congress that tariff and nontariff barriers have been addressed. The President must certify to Congress that tariff and nontariff barriers have been addressed before reducing or eliminating duty rates on products in a trade agreement with a foreign country. Any violation of the trade agreement is immediately enforceable. SEC. 4. ENFORCEMENT PROVISIONS. If the President agrees to a modification in trade agreements and the United States Trade Representative finds that a foreign country has not reduced barriers or has imposed new ones, the modification will be withdrawn until Congress receives a certification. The Trade Representative will investigate if a petition is filed by an interested party alleging grounds for withdrawal. The withdrawal of a modification of an existing duty requires a petition from an interested party with supporting information. Interested parties include manufacturers, producers, wholesalers, and workers in the US of a similar product. Interested parties eligible to file a petition for a modification of an existing duty include manufacturers, producers, wholesalers, and workers in the US of a similar product. Additionally, a trade or business association with members who manufacture, produce, or wholesale a domestic product with similar characteristics can also file a petition. Members of the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives or the Committee on Finance of the Senate are also eligible. The United States Trade Representative must make a determination within 45 days of the petition being filed. The Trade Representative will assess if a petition meets the requirements for modifying an existing duty and inform the petitioner of the decision and reasons. The International Trade Commission will conduct a market access assessment. The International Trade Commission will assess the impact of proposed trade agreements on tariff and nontariff barriers and policies of foreign countries regarding US exports. They will identify barriers and opportunities for US exports if existing barriers are eliminated. The International Trade Commission will assess the impact of proposed trade agreements on eliminating nontariff barriers and policies. They will consult with US domestic producers and submit a report to relevant authorities and Congress before negotiations begin. The International Trade Commission will submit a report on proposed trade agreements in unclassified form, with the option of including a classified annex if necessary."
