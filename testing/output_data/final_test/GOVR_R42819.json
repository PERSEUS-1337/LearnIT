    "title": "R42819",
    "content": "The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) was last amended by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. Congress has not reauthorized the ESEA, but programs continue to receive annual appropriations. Legislation to reauthorize the ESEA has been considered by both the House and Senate during the 112th Congress. The Student Success Act (H.R. 3989) and the Encouraging Innovation and Effective Teachers Act (H.R. 3990) were ordered reported on strictly partisan votes. It is uncertain if S. 3578 or H.R. 3989 and H.R. 3990 will be considered on the Senate or House floors. These bills would reauthorize the ESEA with different approaches in areas such as accountability for student achievement, teacher quality, and support for education. Both bills eliminate existing programs and create new ones. This report analyzes S. 3578, H.R. 3989, and H.R. 3990 in relation to current law, focusing on their proposed changes to the ESEA. It provides a structured overview of how each bill would reshape the ESEA by title and part, highlighting key proposals that would significantly alter current legislation. The report does not cover technical changes but includes an appendix on program authorizations. H.R. 3989 and H.R. 3990 are viewed as a comprehensive reauthorization of the ESEA. The report analyzes S. 3578, H.R. 3989, and H.R. 3990 in relation to current law, focusing on how the bills would change the ESEA. Programs in the bills are considered new if they propose substantive changes or are newly proposed. Programs are considered retained if they are similar in purpose, recipients, and activities to current law. The block grant program created under H.R. 3990 is considered new and differs from the current Innovative Programs block grant program in various ways. While many current ESEA programs would not be retained under H.R. 3990, funds could potentially be used for similar activities under a new block grant program. The proposed block grant program discussed in the report could potentially fund similar activities as current programs, but it is not guaranteed. The report focuses on major changes to current law and does not provide detailed information on specific programs or activities. The reauthorization approaches of S. 3578 and H.R. 3989 are examined in this section. The report examines reauthorization approaches taken by S. 3578, H.R. 3989, and H.R. 3990 in key areas: accountability for student achievement, teacher quality, and targeted support for education. Under NCLB, standards-based accountability requirements were enacted for Title I-A funds. S. 3578 and H.R. 3989 treatment of these requirements is discussed. Each state must adopt challenging academic content standards. States must adopt challenging academic content and achievement standards in mathematics, reading, and science for specific grade levels. Yearly assessments aligned with these standards must be developed and administered. Annual measurable objectives (AMOs) for reading and mathematics assessments are required. The development of Annual Measurable Objectives (AMOs) for reading and mathematics assessments is required, with a single minimum percentage of students needing to meet or exceed proficiency levels. Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) is determined based on student academic achievement and participation rates in assessments. The goal is for all students to reach proficiency by the end of the 2013-2014 school year. The Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) standards require schools to meet proficiency levels in reading and math assessments, with 95% student participation rates. AYP must be met for all students and disaggregated subgroups, with consequences for schools that fail to meet standards for two consecutive years. Schools failing to meet AYP for consecutive years face consequences such as offering public school choice, developing improvement plans, using Title I-A funds for professional development, and providing supplemental educational services. LEAs must reserve 20% of Title I-A funds for transportation and SES. Continued failure leads to corrective action, including staff replacement, curriculum changes, extended school year/day, or working with outside experts. Subsequent AYP failures require further planning and actions. The consequences for schools failing to make AYP include planning for and implementing restructuring, which may involve converting to a charter school. S. 3578 proposes new requirements for college and career ready standards in reading and math, with aligned assessments. States can choose to administer a single annual assessment or multiple assessments leading to a single score. The bill proposes new requirements for college and career readiness standards in reading and math, with aligned assessments. It eliminates the concept of AYP and requires assessments for at least 95% of students and subgroups. Schools with low graduation rates may face interventions, but there is no specific ultimate goal with consequences for not meeting college and career readiness. The bill proposes identifying persistently low-achieving and achievement gap schools, requiring them to implement various improvement models or face closure. Public school choice would be offered to students in these schools, with no requirement for SES. States must also align college and career readiness standards in reading and math, with assessments for 95% of students and subgroups. Under H.R. 3989, states would need to adopt content and achievement standards for mathematics and reading, with aligned assessments in grades 3-8 and once in grades 9-12. Science standards and aligned assessments would no longer be mandatory. States could choose to administer a single annual summative assessment or multiple assessments resulting in a single score, without the need for establishing AMOs. The bill would eliminate the concept of AYP and the requirement for establishing AMOs. It would mandate assessments for at least 95% of all students and subgroups, along with reporting high school graduation rates. Outcome accountability requirements would be removed, and states would need to implement a school improvement system for Title I-A-1 funded schools. Public school choice and SES would no longer be mandatory, but funds would be reserved for direct student services. The bill would create a new reservation of funds for direct services to students under Section 1003A, requiring states to reserve 3% of Title I-A-1 funds for competitive grants to LEAs for public school choice or academic tutoring. NCLB included requirements for equitable distribution of highly qualified teachers and programs to support teacher quality. S. 3578, H.R. 3989, and H.R. 3990 would amend these provisions. Current law mandates that Title I schools ensure highly qualified instructional staff and prevent disadvantaged students from being taught by inexperienced teachers. Newly hired teachers funded by Title I-A must also be highly qualified, meaning they have a bachelor's degree, state certification, and subject-matter knowledge. The Teacher and Principal Training and Recruitment Fund (Title II-A) provides support for state and local efforts to meet ESEA teacher quality requirements, while the Teacher Incentive Fund (Title V-D) offers grants for high-need schools to implement performance-based compensation systems for teachers and principals. S. 3578 aims to maintain similar initiatives. S. 3578 aims to retain current law requirements for equitable distribution of teachers, with adjustments in determining teacher quality. States must use two of five measures, including HQT status, experience level, and teacher evaluation ratings. LEAs receiving Title I-A funds must ensure all teachers in core subjects meet HQT requirements, with exceptions for LEAs with approved teacher evaluation systems. H.R. 3989 proposes changes to teacher evaluation systems for LEAs in states with approved systems, focusing on new core subject teachers. The bill also modifies the Title II-A formula grant program, removing requirements for equitable distribution of instructional quality and highly qualified teachers. Additionally, H.R. 3990 mandates LEAs receiving Title II-A funds to have a teacher evaluation system in place. H.R. 3990 mandates LEAs to have a teacher evaluation system using student achievement as a significant factor for personnel decisions. It retains Title II-A formula grant funding but modifies allocation criteria. Allowable activities are limited to supporting state and local teacher evaluation systems. The ESEA includes formula grant programs and competitive grant programs, with the latter addressing various issues like counseling, arts education, and magnet schools. Some programs are no longer funded. S. 3578 proposes to retain and create new competitive grant programs to support activities currently funded under the ESEA. H.R. 3989 and H.R. 3990 would eliminate some formula grant programs and most competitive grant programs included in current law but would include a block grant program whose funding could potentially be used to support similar activities. S. 3578 would retain most of the current formula grant programs, eliminate several competitive grant programs, and add new targeted grant programs to support similar activities. The bill H.R. 3989 and H.R. 3990 would eliminate some formula grant programs and most competitive grant programs, but introduce a new block grant program called the Local Academic Flexible grant. This grant would provide states with $2.7 billion in formula grants, offering flexibility in fund usage. States would need to allocate at least 75% of the funds to award competitive grants to eligible entities. States receiving funds must allocate 75% to award competitive grants to eligible entities, including partnerships of LEAs, CBOs, business entities, and nongovernmental entities. At least 10% must go to nongovernment entities. Funds can also be used for state-level activities such as developing standards, administering assessments, monitoring programs, providing training, and covering administrative costs. Grants to entities can be used for student support activities like tutoring and expanded learning time. The funds provided must be used for activities to support students' academic achievement, such as tutoring and expanded learning time. Nongovernmental entities must allocate a portion of the funds for these activities. It is uncertain how the proposed block grant program would affect funding compared to programs that may be eliminated under H.R. 3989 and H.R. 3990. Table 1 outlines how S. 3578, H.R. 3989, and H.R. 3990 would modify current law regarding ESEA programs based on line-item amounts for appropriations. The table does not account for the actual number of programs funded under each line-item appropriation. It provides appropriations information for FY2012 and shows where the programs would be placed under the proposed bills. The table outlines how S. 3578, H.R. 3989, and H.R. 3990 would modify current ESEA programs based on appropriations. Retained programs may undergo changes, while new programs may address similar purposes. Both S. 3578 and H.R. 3990 would retain a state grant program for teachers but with modifications to the formula and fund usage. The Advanced Placement program would be renamed as the Accelerated Learning program under S. 3578, expanding to include International Baccalaureate programs. Table 2 compares the bills to current law, detailing key issues like structural changes, funding, accountability, and Title I-A. The themes covered in the text include structural and funding issues, accountability, Title I-A, special populations/areas, teachers, principals, school leadership, STEM education, flexibility, choice, program areas under ESEA, and authorizations in current law compared to S. 3578, H.R. 3989, and H.R. 3990. The comparison shows that S. 3578 has 36 authorizations, while H.R. 3989 and H.R. 3990 have 12 each, with some authorizations applying to multiple programs. Table A-1 displays the number of authorizations in current law and proposed bills. Some authorizations may apply to multiple programs. New program authorizations in S. 3578, H.R. 3989, or H.R. 3990 do not imply that the program was not authorized under current law. For instance, S. 3578 includes separate authorizations for Teacher Incentive Fund (TIF) grants and Promise Neighborhoods, which are already funded programs. The programs TIF and Promise Neighborhoods are currently funded through appropriations language under the Fund for the Improvement of Education. Separate authorizations are not listed for these programs, and the authorizations in the proposed bills are for \"such sums\" for FY2012 through FY2016. H.R. 3989 and H.R. 3990 specify authorization amounts for FY2013 only, with amounts for FY2014 through FY2018 to be determined by inflation. The total authorized level in H.R. 3989 and H.R. 3990 is $24.0 billion, while FY2012 appropriations for ESEA under current law are $23.3 billion. Authorization of an appropriation is not a guarantee of funding as Congress can enact appropriations at different levels."
