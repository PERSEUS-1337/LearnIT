    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 15463 of the Government Code defines key terms related to the No Place Like Home Program, including the program itself, the No Place Like Home Fund, and permanent supportive housing. The authority may issue revenue bonds up to $2 billion for financing permanent supportive housing under the No Place Like Home Program, including reserves, administrative expenses, and loan reimbursements. The authority may issue bonds for redeeming, refunding, or retiring outstanding bonds under certain conditions. The provisions of Sections 15441 to 15450 apply to bonds issued under this subdivision. The authority can provide loans to the Department of Housing and Community Development for permanent supportive housing projects or bond refunds. Loan proceeds can be used for various purposes including reserves, expenses, and administrative costs. The authority and the Department of Housing and Community Development can enter agreements for credit enhancement or liquidity, execute necessary instruments, and carry out powers granted for revenue bonds issued under this section. This section provides an alternative method for issuing bonds and agreements, exempt from certain laws like the California Environmental Quality Act. Funding for permanent supportive housing under this section does not exempt it from other applicable laws. The Legislature acknowledges the importance of housing for individuals with mental illness, recognizing the link between untreated mental illness and homelessness, particularly among single adults. California's homeless population includes women with children, veterans, and the chronically homeless. California has the largest number of homeless veterans in the United States at 24 percent of the total population. Fifty percent of California\u2019s veterans have serious mental illness and 70 percent have a substance use disorder. Fifty percent of homeless mothers in California have experienced a major depressive episode, 36 percent have post-traumatic stress disorder, and 41 percent have a substance use disorder. Ninety-three percent of supportive housing tenants with mental illness and substance use disorders voluntarily participate in services. Adults who receive 2 years of Full Service Partnership services experience a 68 percent reduction in homelessness. (8) Bond funds invested in permanent supportive housing can leverage additional dollars through tax credits, Medicaid funding, and other housing development funds.\n(9) Tenants of permanent supportive housing reduced emergency department visits by 56% and hospital admissions by 45%.\n(10) Housing chronically homeless Californians cuts public service costs in half, with potential reductions of over 70% in health and criminal justice system involvement.\n(11) Addressing the needs of the most vulnerable homeless Californians is a top priority.\n(12) Counties providing mental health services benefit the state. The Department of Housing and Community Development has the expertise to oversee a grant or loan program for permanent supportive housing. The California Health Facilities Financing Authority can issue bonds to support the development of crisis mental health services in California counties. The curr_chunk discusses the use of bond funding to accelerate funding for permanent supportive housing for homeless individuals with mental illness. It also defines key terms related to the program, such as \"county\" and \"development sponsor.\" The curr_chunk defines key terms related to the No Place Like Home Fund program, including \"fund,\" \"homeless,\" \"permanent supportive housing,\" and \"program.\" It also distinguishes between the competitive program and distribution program within the overall program structure. The curr_chunk defines \"distribution program\" as part of the No Place Like Home Fund program, targeting individuals or households who are homeless, chronically homeless, or at risk of chronic homelessness."
