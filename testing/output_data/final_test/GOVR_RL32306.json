    "content": "The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2005, H.R. 4568 (P.L. 108-447), allocated $20.09 billion for Interior and related agencies, including the Department of the Interior and agencies in Agriculture, Energy, and Health and Human Services. Title II of the bill includes funding for the Forest Service, Department of Energy programs, Indian Health Service, and various related agencies such as the Smithsonian Institution and National Endowment for the Arts. Appropriations levels for FY2005 reflect rescissions in P.L. 108-447. The total funds available for FY2005 appropriations, including regular annual and supplemental appropriations, are calculated based on comparisons between FY2004 funding levels, FY2005 President's request, and Congress's recommendations. The House Committee on Appropriations provides primary funding figures, with additional sources including the Senate Committee on Appropriations and agency budget justifications. Some funding figures may not add up precisely due to rounding, and certain DOI websites listed in the report have been intermittently operational due to a court order. For FY2004, Congress appropriated $20.51 billion, higher than FY2003. This included cuts in the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act and the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2004. There was also a $500 million supplemental appropriation for wildland fire suppression. Controversial issues included funding for firefighting and land acquisition, as well as the automatic renewal of grazing permits and leases. The FY2004 appropriations included provisions such as automatic renewal of grazing permits, extension of the Recreational Fee Demonstration Program, modifications for judicial review of timber sales in Alaska, and capping funds for competitive sourcing efforts. It also led to a stay on a court decision regarding Indian trust funds. However, contentious issues like changes to BLM regulations and funding for specific activities were dropped from the law. For more details, refer to CRS Report RL31806. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2005 allocated $20.09 billion for Interior and related agencies, with $2.97 billion for wildfire protection under the National Fire Plan. It also included $255.5 million for the Land and Water Conservation Fund for federal land acquisition and grants to states. The President's FY2005 budget request for Interior and related agencies totaled $19.69 billion. The House and Senate Appropriations Subcommittees on the Interior held hearings on the budget requests. The House Subcommittee on Interior appropriations approved the draft bill on June 3, 2004, with a total of $20.03 billion for FY2005, including $500 million for emergency wildland firefighting. The House passed H.R. 4568, the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations bill for FY2005, with $20.03 billion. The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported its bill (S. 2804) with $20.26 billion, including $500 million in supplemental fire funds. The House-passed bill for FY2005 included changes to drought conservation measures on the Missouri River and reauthorized the collection of fees for the Abandoned Mine Land Fund through May 31, 2005. Both the House-passed and Senate Committee-reported bills had higher funding than the President's FY2005 request but lower than the FY2004 enacted level, with $500 million allocated for emergency firefighting in both years. The FY2005 House-passed bill had higher funding in areas such as Fossil Energy Research, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Indian Health Service, Clean Coal Technology, National Endowment for the Arts, and National Endowment for the Humanities. It also had lower funding in areas including Energy Conservation, Federal Land Acquisition, National Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Land Management, Forest Service, and Smithsonian Institution. P.L. 108-447 provided $2.97 billion for the National Fire Plan for FY2005. The House-passed bill for FY2005 included $3.02 billion, while the Senate committee-reported bill had $2.98 billion. This funding encompassed $500 million for emergency fire fighting, with additional allocations for federal land acquisition and grants to states. The Senate bill allocated $311.1 million for land acquisition, higher than the House's $140.0 million. The President had requested $314.0 million for FY2005. Prior to the enactment of P.L. 108-447, continuing resolutions were used to provide temporary funding for FY2005 for Interior and related agencies due to the lack of annual appropriations. Debate on FY2005 funding levels focused on controversial issues, including the Abandoned Mine Lands (AML) Fund and potential changes to the program. The report discusses various topics such as funding for arts and humanities, competitive sourcing of government functions, and grazing categorical exclusions for Forest Service lands. The curr_chunk discusses grazing categorical exclusions for Forest Service lands, Indian Trust Funds accounting, and Land Acquisition funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The curr_chunk discusses maintenance backlogs, Missouri River management, and Outer Continental Shelf leasing issues. The curr_chunk discusses preleasing and leasing activities in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, oil and gas leases in offshore California, and the potential opening of the North Aleutian Basin Planning Area for oil and gas development. It also addresses roads and timber harvesting in the Tongass National Forest, snowmobiling in Park Units, and strategic decisions related to these activities. The curr_chunk discusses key issues such as the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, Wild Horse and Burro Management, and Wildland Fire Fighting. These topics include filling the SPR to capacity, new authority for sale of wild horses and burros, funding for fire fighting, and environmental impact analysis. The curr_chunk discusses the impact of environmental analysis, public involvement, and challenges to agency decisions on fuel reduction activities, as well as the Yukon Flats Land Exchange and congressional consideration of the FY2005 Interior appropriations bill. Interior and related agencies appropriations increased by 60% from FY1996 to FY2005. The budget for land management agencies increased by 6% from $18.89 billion to $20.09 billion in current dollars. The Bureau of Land Management manages public land for various uses and is responsible for federal subsurface mineral resources. Another key function is wildland fire management. The Bureau of Land Management manages 56 million acres of Indian Trust lands and is responsible for wildland fire management on 370 million acres of DOI and other federal lands. Congress enacted $1.82 billion for the BLM in FY2005, a 3% increase over the President's request. Funding for Management of Lands and Resources was $836.8 million, a decrease from FY2004 levels and requested amounts. The FY2005 law allocated funds for various BLM programs, with some receiving increased funds such as wild horse and burro management, while others decreased like range management and facilities maintenance. Energy and minerals programs were funded at flat levels. The law also continued to restrict energy leasing activities within national monuments and placed a moratorium on new mining patent applications on federal lands. The FY2005 law included changes to wild horse and burro management on federal lands, allowing for the sale of excess animals and their remains. It also removed provisions prohibiting the sale of wild horses and burros for commercial products. Additionally, the law did not explicitly prohibit the BLM from slaughtering healthy wild horses and burros. Congress allocated $831.3 million for Wildland Fire Management in FY2005, including $98.6 million for emergency firefighting. In FY2005, Congress allocated $17.5 million for BLM fuels reduction, with a focus on the wildland-urban interface. The House Appropriations Committee required the BLM to prioritize fuel projects in alignment with the Forest Service to ensure funds are used effectively. In FY2005, Congress decreased funds for preparing and suppressing fires, expressing a need to control costs. The Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior were directed to report on performance measures for improving reporting on fire suppression costs. The House Committee on Appropriations expressed concern that fire funding may not maintain the level of readiness needed for public safety. The BLM was directed to analyze current readiness levels and adjust funds accordingly. In FY2005, Congress decreased funds for preparing and suppressing fires, expressing a need to control costs. The wildland fire funds appropriated to BLM are used for fire fighting on all Interior Department lands. Interior appropriations laws also provide funds for wildland fire management to the Forest Service for fire programs primarily on its lands. Congress enacted $11.3 million for BLM construction for FY2005, which is less than enacted for FY2004 but more than requested by the Administration and recommended by the Senate Committee on Appropriations for FY2005. In FY2005, Congress decreased funds for BLM construction, expressing concern about low funding levels compared to other agencies. The enacted amount for Land Acquisition was $11.2 million, with ten projects funded using unobligated balances. The House did not support funding new acquisitions, calling them a \"low priority,\" while the Senate recommended $22.9 million for land acquisition. The enacted level was a decrease from the President's request and FY2004. In FY2005, Congress decreased funds for BLM construction and land acquisition from the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The FY2004 enacted level for land acquisition was $18.4 million, a reduction from FY2003. For the O&C Grant Lands, Congress enacted $107.5 million, funding programs for managing resources on these lands. The Department of the Interior and the Bureau of Land Management are responsible for managing, protecting, and developing resources on federal lands. For more information, visit their websites. Congress approved $1.332 billion for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in FY2005. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service received $1.332 billion in FY2005, with the largest portion allocated to the Resources Management account. Funding for the Endangered Species program, Refuge System, and Law Enforcement were included in this budget. The Administration proposed a decrease in the Endangered Species program funding, but Congress enacted $143.2 million for FY2005. The Landowner Incentive Program, Stewardship Grants, and Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund saw decreases in funding from FY2004 to FY2005. Overall FY2005 funding for endangered species programs increased in the President's request but fell in the enacted budget. Certain changes related to species recovery and pesticide use were not offered as amendments during consideration of FY2005 Interior appropriations legislation. The President proposed funding changes for the National Wildlife Refuge System in FY2005, including a decrease in operations and maintenance budget. Congress enacted $381.0 million for FY2005 with no earmark for deferred maintenance. Additionally, funding for Law Enforcement saw a decrease from the previous year. The President proposed a decrease in funding for Law Enforcement to $51.3 million for FY2005, while Congress approved $55.6 million. For Land Acquisition, the Administration proposed an increase to $45.0 million, but Congress ultimately cut the program to $37.0 million for FY2005. This program is funded from appropriations from the Land and Water Conservation Fund, with a shift towards less funding for traditional land acquisition. The FY2005 law allocated $22.6 million for the core acquisition program, with funding reserved for traditional land acquisition. The Senate committee-reported bill proposed $34.7 million for federal refuge lands, while the House bill did not allocate any funds for these lands. Additionally, funds were provided for the acquisition of lands for waterfowl habitat in the Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. The Yukon Flats land exchange allows for oil and gas production on acquired lands, with revenues going to a special Treasury account for FWS purposes. Supporters believe it expedites the exchange and protects waterfowl habitat, while opponents argue it lacks public input, risks losing oil-rich lands, and allows energy development in wildlife habitats. The Wildlife Refuge Fund compensates counties for federal lands of the NWRS, with additional appropriations needed to cover the full authorized amounts. Congress generally provides extra funding, with $14.4 million supported for FY2005 but ultimately matching the FY2004 level of $14.2 million. The FY2005 appropriation level would cover 46% of the authorized full payment, down slightly from the FY2004 level of 47%. The MSCF benefits Asian and African elephants, tigers, and rhinoceroses, generating significant constituent interest despite its small size. The President's budget proposes moving funding for the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Fund into the MSCF, with cuts in programs for great apes and African and Asian elephants, but increases for rhinos, tigers, and neotropical migratory birds. The House approved $100,000 in increases for each subprogram, while Senate Committee levels were generally in between. FY2005 enacted levels show modest cuts in all programs except for tigers and rhinos. The State and Tribal Wildlife Grants program helps fund conservation efforts for species. The State and Tribal Wildlife Grants program, created in FY2001, funds conservation efforts for species of concern to states and tribes. It lacks an authorizing statute and funds can be used for conservation plans and projects. The President proposed $80.0 million for FY2005, with the final appropriation at $69.0 million. The final FY2005 appropriation is $69.0 billion. Mute swans introduced to Chesapeake Bay causing ecological harm. Legislation attempts to exclude non-native species from MBTA protections unsuccessful. Amendment added to FY2005 law defining \"native to the United States.\" The Fish and Wildlife Service is directed to publish a list of non-native bird species, specifying that the MBTA applies only to native species. Animal welfare groups have objected to this provision and requested its repeal. The National Park Service oversees 388 units covering 84 million acres of diverse natural and historic areas. The National Park Service manages a variety of natural and historic areas, representing American cultural identity. They use different designations, including national parks, with nearly 280 million annual visits. The FY2005 NPS appropriations totaled $2.37 billion, slightly higher than the President's budget request. The law included provisions for winter use rules for snowmobiles in Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks. The FY2005 NPS appropriations totaled $2.37 billion, slightly higher than the President's budget request. A provision was enacted for snowmobile use rules in Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks for the 2004-2005 winter season to prevent lawsuits. The House rejected an amendment to reinstate a Clinton-era rule phasing out private snowmobile use in the parks. Another provision adjusted the boundaries of the Cumberland Island Wilderness to allow use of an existing road and concession tours. The park operations budget covers resource protection, visitor services, facility operations, maintenance, and support programs. The FY2005 NPS operations budget is $1.68 billion, slightly lower than recommended levels but higher than the previous year. Concerns were raised about funding shortages for core programs due to unbudgeted costs. Park advocacy groups estimate national parks operate with two-thirds of needed funding. National parks operate with two-thirds of needed funding, supporting law enforcement programs of the U.S. Park Police in urban park areas. The USPP provides security for historic monuments, special events, and dignitary escort. FY2004 conference agreement criticized USPP for not addressing budget accountability and management issues. The House-passed FY2005 bill urged the NPS and DOI to address budget accountability and management issues within the USPP before the end of 2004. The budget request for FY2005 focused on terrorist threat preparedness, including funds for the Presidential Inauguration and enhanced security efforts. The enacted budget for USPP in FY2005 was $80.1 million, $2.2 million above FY2004. The former USPP Chief was suspended in December 2003 and fired in July 2004 for discussing agency funding issues with the press. The U.S. Merit System Protection Board is under appeal, with funding for park recreation and resource protection programs. The FY2005 law provides $61.0 million, a decrease from FY2004. The Administration proposed reducing aid programs and heritage area funding. Congress has consistently restored or increased heritage area funding. The enacted level for the Heritage partnership program is $14.6 million for National Heritage Areas, above the Administration's request of $2.5 million. Three new heritage areas were created in the FY2005 appropriations law. For Statutory or Contractual Aid, the enacted level is $11.2 million, $1.6 million below the FY2004 enacted level. The Administration requested no funds for this program for FY2005. Funding for the Urban Park and Recreation Recovery program (UPARR) was initially problematic until the creation of the Conservation Spending Category (CSC) in the FY2001 Interior Appropriations Act, which allocated $30.0 million for UPARR. Congress appropriated $30.0 million for UPARR in FY2001 and FY2002. However, for FY2003 and FY2004, appropriations were significantly lower for program administrative costs and grant administration. In FY2005, the President requested no funds for UPARR and proposed eliminating the separate UPARR line item, instead recommending that program grant administration be returned to the National Recreation and Preservation line item. The House-passed bill and Senate committee also recommended eliminating funding for UPARR. The FY2005 law provides no funding for UPARR and transfers limited grant administration funding to National Recreation and Preservation. NPS construction funding for FY2005 is $353.0 million, including $50.8 million for disaster response. Maintenance funding is $582.7 million, slightly less than the Administration's request. The FY2005 NPS construction and maintenance funding is $935.7 million, exceeding previous levels and the Administration's request. The total spending to reduce the maintenance backlog in FY2005 would be more than $1.1 billion, including funds from recreation fees and the Highway Trust Fund. The estimated deferred maintenance for the NPS is between $4.52 billion and $9.69 billion, with a mid-range figure of $7.11 billion. Concerns have been raised about the effectiveness of funding for construction and facility maintenance in reducing the backlog. The FY2005 law restricts NPS funds for partnership construction projects exceeding $5.0 million without approval from the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. The NPS developed interim guidance for managing partnership construction projects. The House-passed bill aimed to impose a temporary moratorium on projects over $5 million to control costly construction projects. The Senate Appropriations Committee did not enforce a blanket moratorium on partnership projects. Appropriations for FY2005 under the LWCF totaled $146.3 million, with $55.1 million for federal land acquisition and $91.2 million for state assistance. The FY2005 appropriations for the Land and Water Conservation Fund totaled $146.3 million, with $55.1 million allocated for federal land acquisition and $91.2 million for state assistance. States determine their spending priorities for park land acquisition and recreation planning. The enacted level is slightly lower than the House-passed, Senate committee-recommended, requested levels, and FY2004 appropriation. Federal land acquisition funding has been controversial, with varying levels allocated for acquisition management and acquisition funding. The enacted level for acquisition funding is $44.8 million. The FY2005 appropriations law established a new 10-year recreation fee program for federal land management agencies, allowing them to retain and spend entrance and user fees without further appropriation. The National Park Service estimates fee receipts of $124.7 million for FY2004 and $122.8 million for FY2005. The former program had been controversial and replaced by the new program. For more information, visit the NPS website. The Historic Preservation Fund (HPF), administered by the National Park Service (NPS), provides grants for protecting cultural resources and enhancing economic development through restoring historic districts, sites, and buildings significant in American history. Grants are typically funded on a 60% federal/40% state matching share basis, with additional funding for cultural heritage projects for Indian tribes, Alaska Natives, and Native Hawaiians. In FY2005, Congress allocated $71.7 million for these preservation efforts. In FY2005, Congress provided $71.7 million for the Historic Preservation Fund, a decrease from the Administration's request and the previous year. There is ongoing debate about whether historic preservation programs should be funded by private money instead of the federal government. Congress has eliminated permanent federal funding for the National Trust for Historic Preservation but continues to support preservation efforts through Save America's Treasures. The FY2005 appropriations law requires project recommendations for Save America's Treasures grants to be approved by the Appropriations Committees. $29.6 million is provided for these grants, a 1% decrease from the FY2005 request. Funding for the \"Preserve America\" grants initiative was not included in the FY2005 appropriation. In the past, Historic Preservation Fund included funds for preservation of historic buildings on HBCU campuses. FY2001 had $7.2 million unused authorization. No funding for HBCUs in FY2002 or FY2003, but $3.0 million in FY2004 and $3.5 million in FY2005. National Trust for Historic Preservation no longer receives federal funding. The National Trust, chartered by Congress in 1949, aimed to protect historic American sites. It received federal funding until FY1998 but has since become self-supporting. Small appropriations were given in FY2003 and FY2004, with $0.5 million in FY2004 for the Endowment Fund. The FY2005 appropriation did not include funding for the endowment fund. For more information on Historic Preservation, visit http://www2.cr.nps.gov/. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) is a key science agency providing information on natural hazards, the environment, energy, minerals, water, and biological sciences. It is also a mapping agency and a data source for water resources. USGS celebrated its 125th anniversary in 2004 and receives funds for various activities including mapping, geologic hazards, water resources, biological research, science support, and facilities. Total appropriations for FY2005 are $936.5 million. The FY2005 appropriations for the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) are $936.5 million, which is $1.5 million less than FY2004 but $16.7 million more than the Administration's request. The Senate Appropriations Committee directed reinstatement of projects targeted for elimination and emphasized core programs. The enacted appropriations provide less funding in five of the six activities traditionally conducted by the USGS. The FY2005 appropriations for the USGS are $936.5 million, slightly less than FY2004 but more than the Administration's request. Funding for Enterprise Information was consolidated into a new line item, with the House providing $44.1 million and the Senate $45.2 million. The enacted appropriations for Enterprise Information are $44.4 million. The FY2005 appropriations for USGS are $118.8 million, with funding for Enterprise Information Security and Technology, Enterprise Information Resources, and Federal Geographic Data Coordination. The National Mapping Program aims to provide high-quality geospatial data to the public. The appropriations are $4.0 million less than the House-passed level and $1.1 million less than the Senate committee-reported bill. The FY2005 appropriations for USGS are $118.8 million, with funding for Enterprise Information Security and Technology, Enterprise Information Resources, and Federal Geographic Data Coordination. The largest decrease within this program is for the Cooperative Topographic Mapping Program, with appropriations of $71.4 million\u2014a decrease of $9.5 million from FY2004. Landsat 7 program faces challenges with degraded satellite imagery, and no clear solutions have been proposed. The Senate Appropriations Committee expressed concern about the program and the lack of guidance on how to proceed. The Landsat 7 Satellite takes images for environmental monitoring, with 25% of data showing degradation. Despite this, it remains a cost-effective solution. The House committee supports long-term satellite data acquisition and collaboration for next-generation sensors. The Senate Appropriations Committee emphasizes USGS responsibility for satellite operations and data collection. FY2005 appropriations for Geologic Hazards, Resources, and Processes activities are $229.2 million. FY2005 appropriations for Geologic Hazards, Resources, and Processes activities are $229.2 million, slightly higher than the House-passed level and the Senate committee-reported level, and $8.5 million more than the Administration's request. This covers programs in Hazard Assessments, Landscape and Coastal Assessments, and Resource Assessments. The mineral resources program would receive $21.6 million, $6.5 million more than requested, for inquiries into mining and materials processing industries. Water Resources Investigations would receive $211.2 million, close to the House-passed bill. FY2005 appropriations for Water Resources Investigations are $211.2 million, slightly less than the Senate committee-reported bill, $8.5 million above the Administration's request, and $4.5 million less than the FY2004 enacted level. Funding for the Hydrologic Monitoring, Assessments and Research activity is $142.5 million, the Cooperative Water Program is $62.3 million, and Water Resources Research Institutes is $6.4 million. The Bush Administration's FY2005 request aimed to discontinue USGS support for Water Resources Research Institutes, but Congress restored funding for FY2002 to FY2005. Congress has restored funding for the institutes from FY2002 to FY2005, with FY2005 appropriations at $171.7 million for Biological Research. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concern about the growth of the National Biological Information Infrastructure (NBII) and directed the USGS to consolidate operational expenses by locating all new \"thematic\" nodes in the same location as regional nodes. The NBII aims to provide increased access to data on the nation's biological resources. The USGS was directed by Congress to develop a long-term plan for the Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Program, a partnership between federal and state governments and academia. The focus for FY2005 is on reducing harmful invasive species and wildlife diseases, with ongoing research on invasive species threats and mapping of \"hotspots\" of impacts in the United States. Science Support costs are aimed at modernizing infrastructure for data management and dissemination. For FY2005, appropriations for modernizing infrastructure for scientific information management are $65.6 million, less than previous years. Facilities maintenance costs are $94.6 million, slightly lower than requested amounts. The US Geological Survey received $95.9 million in appropriations for FY2005, slightly less than the Senate committee-reported bill of $95.0 million and $1.6 million more than the FY2004 level. Additionally, $1.0 million was allocated for disaster recovery. The Minerals Management Service administers offshore leasing and revenue management programs for oil, gas, and minerals. Revenues from leases are distributed to states, the US Treasury, and designated programs. The Minerals Management Service administers offshore leasing and revenue management programs for oil, gas, and minerals. Revenues from leases are distributed to states, the US Treasury, and designated programs. The Administration's FY2005 budget request for MMS was $282.4 million, with $7.1 million for Oil Spill Research and $275.3 million for Royalty and Offshore Minerals Management. Congress enacted overall funding for MMS of $277.6 million for FY2005. The Minerals Management Service received a total appropriation of $173.8 million for FY2005, with $103.7 million in offsetting collections. The MMS estimates collecting and disbursing over $6 billion in revenue annually, primarily from oil and natural gas royalties. Royalties from natural gas production have accounted for 40-45% of annual receipts, while oil royalties have accounted for no more than 25%. The FY2004 appropriations law continued the moratorium on leasing activities in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico. Industry groups argue that limited sales are hindering resource potential, while environmental groups and some officials fear risks to the environment and local economies. The FY2004 law extended leasing moratoria in various areas, excluding the North Aleutian Basin Planning Area. There is debate over opening this area for oil and gas development to offset the struggling fishing industry in Bristol Bay. Environmentalists oppose this effort, as the area is not part of the current leasing plan. The Secretary of the Interior submits five-year leasing programs under the OCSLA, supporting moratoria on leasing in certain areas. MMS oil and gas leases in offshore California have drawn congressional interest, with controversy over lease extensions. In June 2001, the U.S. Court for the Northern District of California struck down MMS lease suspensions in offshore California. The Bush Administration appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which upheld the decision in December 2002. The Department of the Interior is working with lessees to resolve the issue, while a breach-of-contract lawsuit by oil companies seeking $1.2 billion is pending further action. The Minerals Management Service is processing suspension requests for undeveloped leases, with six Environmental Assessments finding no significant impact. A consistency review by the state will precede a decision on the requests. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act established the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement to ensure land mined for coal is restored, funded by the Abandoned Mine Lands fund. The Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act established the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement to ensure land mined for coal is restored, funded by the Abandoned Mine Lands fund. Congress intended for states and tribes to develop their own regulatory programs incorporating minimum standards. Fee collections are divided into federal and state shares, with grants awarded based on a distribution formula. Some states are pushing for increased AML appropriations due to unappropriated balances exceeding $1 billion. The total unappropriated balance in the AML fund was nearly $1.7 billion by the end of FY2004, with Western states critical of the program as coal production shifts westward. The Administration submitted legislation in the 108th Congress to reauthorize fee collections for the Abandoned Mine Lands program, addressing state and regional concerns. However, the Congress was unable to reach a resolution on the program's structure. The Senate Committee on Appropriations added a short-term extension to May 31, 2005, while the House version of the bill had no similar provision. The Administration requested $53.0 million for a ten-year plan to return unobligated state share balances to the states in the Abandoned Mine Lands program. The House committee recommended $194.1 million for the AML fund, $49.8 million less than the Administration's request but $3.5 million above the FY2004 appropriation. For FY2005, Congress enacted an appropriation of $188.2 million from the AML fund. \"Minimum program states\" are states with significant AML problems but insufficient coal production for significant fees to the AML fund. Grants to states are based on current and historic coal production. Minimum funding for these states was increased to $2.0 million in 1992, but Congress has only appropriated $1.5 million since FY1996. The Administration proposed $2.0 million annually for minimum program states, but Congress maintained funding at $1.5 million. Congress provided $105.4 million for Regulation and Technology programs in FY2004, with a request for $108.9 million in FY2005. This included funding for the Appalachian Clean Streams Initiative and the Small Operators Assistance Program. The Senate Committee on Appropriations added $1.0 million for Regulation and Technology, with instructions for a study on coal reserves. The Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences conducted a study on coal reserves and mining technologies with a budget of $108.4 million for FY2005. The Administration requested $352.8 million for the Office of Surface Mining, a 19% increase from FY2004. The enacted FY2005 budget for OSM was $296.6 million. The Bureau of Indian Affairs provides services to Native American tribes. For more information on OSM, visit http://www.osmre.gov/osm.htm. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) provides various programs and services to Native American tribes, including government operations, law enforcement, education, and economic development. The BIA's budget for FY2005 was proposed to be $2.25 billion, with slight variations in the House and Senate recommendations. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) FY2005 budget was $2.30 billion, slightly below FY2004 but above the request. Key issues included BIA reorganization and problems in the BIA school system. Interior Secretary Norton initiated the reorganization in April 2003. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) is responsible for managing Indian tribes' and individuals' trust funds and assets, including 45 million acres of tribal trust land and 10 million acres of individual Indian trust land. The BIA has been criticized for mismanaging these funds and assets, leading to a reorganization initiated by Interior Secretary Norton in April 2003. The BIA has faced criticism for mismanaging Indian trust funds and assets, leading to trust reform efforts in the 1990s. In 1994, the OST was created to oversee trust management reform, and in 1996, trust fund management was transferred from the BIA to the OST. Despite unsuccessful reform efforts, the DOI contracted a management-consultant firm in 2001 for recommendations on trust management improvements and agency reorganization. The DOI announced a reorganization plan in December 2002 for trust management reform, despite not reaching full agreement with tribal leaders. The plan involves restructuring the BIA, AS-IA, and OST to focus on trust management structures and functions. BIA's trust operations will be separated from other services, and trust officers will be added to oversee trust management at regional and agency levels. Some tribes had been operating trust management reform pilot projects under self-governance compacts. The reorganization plan for trust management reform by the DOI in December 2002 excluded management reform pilot projects with regional BIA offices under self-governance compacts. The plan includes improvements in trust asset systems, policies, historical accounting, reduction of backlogs, and modernization of computer technology. Many Indian tribes and tribal organizations have criticized the reorganization as premature and have urgently requested its suspension. The reorganization plan for trust management reform by the DOI in December 2002 excluded certain tribes with pilot projects from the BIA reorganization. Congress responded to tribal concerns by continuing the exclusion for FY2005, but did not suspend the reorganization. The BIA funds schools educating about 48,000 students in 23 states, with key issues being low student achievement and inadequate school facilities. Key problems include low student achievement and a large number of inadequate school facilities in BIA-operated schools. Congress created a $2.9 million fund in FY2004 to encourage tribal boards to take over school operation, but the Administration proposed deleting it for FY2005. Despite Congress retaining the fund at $1 million, many BIA school facilities are old and dilapidated with health and safety deficiencies. Education construction covers new school facilities, repairs, and improvements based on priority lists. The BIA has estimated a backlog of $942 million in education facility repairs, with FY2005 appropriations reduced by $61.0 million for school construction projects still under construction. Congress appropriated $263.4 million for education construction in FY2005, 11% below FY2004. The Administration proposed adding language authorizing the BIA to manage school construction projects under tribal self-determination contracts if construction does not begin within 18 months of funding availability. In FY2005, Congress allocated $263.4 million for education construction, which was 11% lower than FY2004. Indian tribes have urged Congress to explore additional sources of construction financing due to a $942 million backlog in education facility repairs. Congress also increased funding for a demonstration program allowing tribes to help fund BIA-funded school construction, earmarking $12.3 million for three projects. The Office of Insular Affairs (OIA) provides financial assistance to insular areas and former insular areas, managing relations between them and the federal government. Funding for OIA consists of permanent and indefinite appropriations, making up 70-80% of the budget. For FY2005, the estimated total budget was roughly $305 million. For FY2005, the Office of Insular Affairs estimated a total budget of $305 million, with $196 million allocated to three freely associated states and $109 million in fiscal assistance to U.S. territories. Discretionary and mandatory funds make up the remaining balance of the budget. The FY2005 budget for the Office of Insular Affairs was $305 million, with $196 million allocated to freely associated states and $109 million in fiscal assistance to U.S. territories. The FY2005 appropriation for AT was $75.6 million, exceeding the Administration's proposal by $2.6 million, while CFA funding was $5.5 million, lower than requested. Overall, OIA discretionary funding for FY2005 is $81.0 million, a 1% decrease from FY2004. Congress continues to monitor economic development and fiscal management in the insular areas. For FY2005, Congress allocated $226.8 million for PILT, a 1% increase over FY2004 and a 0.4% increase over the Administration's request. The House agreed with the President's proposal, rejecting a $15.0 million amendment to increase PILT funding. The Senate committee-reported bill included $230.0 million for PILT, a $5.3 million increase over FY2004. The bill contained $230.0 million for PILT, an increase of $5.3 million over the FY2004 enacted level. The PILT program compensates local governments for federal land within their jurisdictions. Since 1976, payments of more than $3 billion have been made. The program has been controversial due to appropriations being less than authorized amounts. The program was shifted from the BLM budget to Departmental Management in DOI in FY2004. For more information on the Payments in Lieu of Taxes program, visit the BLM website at http://www.blm.gov/pilt/. The Office of Special Trustee for American Indians, under the Secretary of the Interior's office, oversees the reform of Interior Department management of Indian trust assets. Indian trust funds were transferred from the Bureau of Indian Affairs to the OST in 1996 as authorized by P.L. 103-412. The OST manages tribal funds owned by about 300 tribes in approximately 1,400 accounts. The Office of Special Trustee for American Indians oversees two sets of funds: tribal funds owned by about 300 tribes in approximately 1,400 accounts with a total asset value of $2.9 billion, and Individual Indian Money (IIM) accounts in about 260,000 accounts with a total asset value of $400 million. The funds include monies from various sources such as claims awards, settlements, and investment income. The FY2005 budget proposal requested $317.7 million for the OST, with varying approval amounts from the House and Senate. The Office of Special Trustee for American Indians (OST) is undergoing reorganization, including the creation of field operations and the placement of fiduciary trust officers at BIA agency and regional offices. Many Indian tribes are opposed to the reorganization and have requested further consultation with Congress. The historical accounting effort aims to correct balances in tribal and IIM accounts. The Interior Department has proposed a $335 million project to reconcile tribal and IIM accounts, with a focus on historical accounting. The Administration proposed an increase in funding for historical accounting, with $80.0 million allocated for IIM accounts and $29.4 million for tribal accounts. However, the House and Senate Appropriations Committee capped the amount at $58.0 million. The House Appropriations Committee capped funds for historical accounting at $58.0 million for FY2005, citing ongoing mediation and settlement discussions in the trust-funds litigation. An IIM trust funds class-action lawsuit (Cobell v. Norton) was filed in 1996, with many activities related to the Cobell case, including litigation support activities. The significant issue for appropriations concerns the method of conducting historical accounting to estimate IIM accounts' proper balances. The DOI proposed a historical accounting method costing $335 million over five years, estimating a low total owed to IIM accounts. The plaintiffs' method, with uncertain procedural costs, estimated $176 billion owed. A trial in 2003 decided the accounting method to use. In 1999, the court found DOI and Treasury breached trust duties in document retention and data gathering. The final phase of the lawsuit will determine the amount owed to plaintiffs based on the chosen accounting method. The court's decision on historical accounting for the Cobell lawsuit was delivered on September 25, 2003. The court rejected both the plaintiffs' and DOI's proposed historical accounting plans and ordered DOI to account for all trust fund and asset transactions since 1887 without using statistical sampling. The Interior Department estimated the cost of this accounting method to be $6-12 billion. The FY2004 Interior appropriations conference report included a provision to delay the historical accounting for the Cobell lawsuit, citing cost concerns and the need for Congress to address the issue. Critics argued that the provision was constitutionally questionable and unjust to the plaintiffs. The FY2004 Interior appropriations conference report included a provision to delay the historical accounting for the Cobell lawsuit, citing cost concerns and the need for Congress to address the issue. Critics argued that the provision was unjust to the plaintiffs and might undermine the Interior Department's incentives to negotiate a settlement. The provision was enacted on November 10, 2003, and led to an appeal by the DOI on the same day. The U.S. Court of Appeals temporarily stayed the September 25 order on November 12, 2003. The Appeals Court overturned much of the September 25 order on December 10, 2004. The Appeals Court overturned much of the September 25 order, stating that a congressional provision prevented the district court from requiring DOI to follow its directions for a historical accounting. The provision expired on December 31, 2004, and no bill was introduced in the 108th Congress to address the government's historical accounting obligation. Mediation discussions continued, and the district court has not reissued an order on historical accounting.

The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA) of 1988 oversees tribal regulation of bingo and gaming operations. The NIGC's funding adequacy is a key appropriations issue, with annual fees from tribes supporting its budget. Recent years have seen increased demand for oversight resources, leading to requests for additional funding. Congress temporarily increased the NIGC's fee ceiling to $12 million for FY2004-FY2005. The Administration proposed amending IGRA to create an adjustable fee ceiling in the FY2005 budget. The Administration proposed amending IGRA to create an adjustable, formula-based fee ceiling to allow NIGC funding to grow with the Indian gaming industry. Gaming tribes opposed the increased fee ceiling, arguing for a review of NIGC's budget in consultation with tribes. The House bill, Senate Committee recommendation, and FY2005 law extended the NIGC fee ceiling to $12 million for FY2006. The Senate Committee report allowed NIGC to use negotiated rulemaking with tribes for developing regulations. The NIGC activities were funded from fees during FY1999-FY2004, with no direct appropriations. The FY2005 appropriations for the Forest Service totaled $4.75 billion, including emergency funding for wildfires and natural disasters. This amount was higher than the recommended levels by the Senate Appropriations Committee and the House. The FY2005 appropriations for the Forest Service totaled $4.75 billion, including $400.0 million in emergency wildfire funding. This amount exceeded the President's request by $508.1 million and was $193.7 million less than FY2004 appropriations. Legislative provisions in the FY2005 law could impact timber harvesting in the Tongass National Forest and grazing decisions on FS lands. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) may exclude grazing on FS lands from documentation under certain circumstances, aiming to streamline the environmental review process. Supporters argue it reduces costs for reviewing grazing allotments with low environmental complexity, while opponents fear it could limit public input and harm the environment. Another provision in the law relates to the forest land enhancement program (FLEP), which provides financial assistance to private landowners for forestry practices. In 2003, the Administration borrowed $50.0 million of FLEP funds for firefighting, with $10.0 million repaid in FY2004. The FY2005 law cancelled $20.0 million of FLEP funding, leaving $20.0 million available through FY2006. Other provisions, like prohibiting funding for forest development roads in Tongass National Forest, were considered but not enacted. The amendment in question aimed to restrict new taxpayer-funded timber harvesting roads in the Tongass National Forest, but would not affect road construction by private timber companies or for other purposes. It would have limited timber harvesting in FY2005 but not maintenance of existing roads. The House rejected a related Udall amendment to halt new NFMA planning regulations, citing concerns about changes to planning processes and standards. The Bush Administration later issued new NFMA planning regulations. The Bush Administration issued new NFMA planning regulations in response to concerns about changes to planning processes and standards. Fire funding and protection programs have been controversial, with ongoing discussions about funding levels, locations for fire protection treatments, and challenges to fuel reduction activities. The National Fire Plan includes the FS wildland fire program and fire fighting on DOI lands, with DOI wildland fire monies appropriated to the BLM. Congress does not fund the National Fire Plan in any one place in Interior. The National Fire Plan funding for FY2005 totaled $2.97 billion, slightly less than recommended by the Senate Appropriations Committee and the House. BLM received $831.3 million, while the FS level was $2.14 billion. Funding was $500.3 million above the FY2005 budget request and $325.3 million less than FY2004 appropriations. The FY2005 appropriations for wildfire suppression totaled $867.3 million, with $39.4 million less than the House-passed level, $412.1 million more than the request, and $273.0 million less than FY2004 funding. The funds include fire suppression, preparedness, and other operations for both FS and BLM. The increase above FY2004 is slightly greater for the BLM (13%) than for the FS (9%). The FY2005 appropriations for wildfire suppression totaled $867.3 million, with $39.4 million less than the House-passed level, $412.1 million more than the request, and $273.0 million less than FY2004 funding. The increase above FY2004 is slightly greater for the BLM (13%) than for the FS (9%). Emergency firefighting funds were enacted in the FY2005 DOD appropriations to prevent borrowing from other accounts. The FY2005 appropriations law includes $493.1 million in emergency funding for disaster recovery, with $98.6 million for the BLM and $394.4 million for the FS. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $935.4 million for fire preparedness, slightly less than recommended by the Senate Appropriations Committee. Other fire operations funding totals $671.8 million, including fuel reduction funding under the Healthy Forests Initiative and the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003. Fuel reduction funding for FY2005 amounts to $463.9 million. Funding for wildfires in FY2005 totals $463.9 million, slightly less than recommended by the Senate Committee and the House-passed level. $30.0 million was transferred from DOD funds to the FS for fuel reduction and hazard mitigation in the San Bernardino NF, with additional funds allocated for a wildfire training facility. The House directed $8.0 million for community wildfire protection planning from State and Private Forestry accounts. Total State and Private Forestry (S&PF) funding in FY2005 is $292.5 million, with significant shifts in funding for forest health management, cooperative fire assistance, cooperative forestry, and international programs. The FY2005 law includes $101.9 million for forest health management, $20.6 million more than recommended by the Senate committee and requested by the Administration. The President proposed $10.0 million for an Emerging Pest and Pathogens Fund, but this was rejected. Total State and Private Forestry funding in FY2005 is $292.5 million, with shifts in funding for various programs. The FY2005 law includes $48.1 million for S&PF Cooperative Fire Assistance, which is $2.8 million more than the Senate Committee recommended and $3.0 million less than the House passed. This funding is also $8.7 million more than the FY2005 request and $0.4 million more than FY2004. The FY2005 law allocates $145.4 million for Cooperative Forestry programs, which is $22.0 million less than the Senate committee recommendation and $32.3 million less than the FY2005 budget request. The Forest Legacy program received $57.1 million, $14.0 million more than the House allocation and $42.9 million below the Administration's proposal for FY2005. The Economic Action Programs funding was also reduced. The enacted level for EAP is $19.0 million, $0.9 million less than the Senate Appropriations Committee recommended, nearly double the House-passed level of $10.0 million, and down $6.6 million from FY2004. Other program changes are more modest, with international programs totaling $6.4 million for FY2005. Additionally, P.L. 108-324 contained $49.1 million in emergency appropriations for FS assistance to private landowners for recovery from natural resource disasters. The FY2005 law includes $514.7 million for FS Capital Improvement and Maintenance, with an additional $50.8 million added. Total FY2005 funding for FS Capital Improvement and Maintenance is $565.5 million, which is higher than recommended by the Senate Appropriations Committee, House-passed, requested, and FY2004 levels. The funding levels for facilities, roads, and trails are similar to the requested amounts. The largest differences are for disaster recovery and deferred maintenance to reduce the agency's backlog estimated at $6.54 billion. The FY2005 law includes $13.8 million more than recommended for deferred maintenance and infrastructure improvement. The FY2005 law allocates $13.8 million for FS Land Acquisition, with $12.8 million for acquisition management and $48.2 million for land purchases. This is $21.5 million less than the Senate's recommendation but $45.5 million more than the House-passed level. FS research funding for FY2005 is $276.4 million, slightly less than the Senate committee's recommendation. The FY2005 law allocates $276.4 million for FS research, which is slightly less than the Senate committee's recommendation. National Forest System appropriations are $1.39 billion, $5.8 million more than the Senate committee recommended and $6.6 million less than the House-passed level. The Department of Agriculture and U.S. Forest Service information can be found on their respective websites. Various CRS reports on forest fire protection and funding are available. The FY2005 budget request for fossil energy research was slightly lower than the previous year. The FY2005 appropriations law funded fossil energy R&D programs at $571.9 million, lower than FY2004 but higher than FY2003. Key funding categories included Coal and Other Power Systems, Natural Gas Technologies, Petroleum Technology, and Program Direction and Management Support. The law differed significantly from the Administration's request, with lower funding for FutureGen but increases in Advanced Systems, Fuels, and Fuel Cells research. Natural Gas and Petroleum Technologies also received higher funding levels than requested. The FY2005 law provided higher funding levels for Natural Gas and Petroleum programs compared to the Administration's request. This included $8.4 million for infrastructure projects in Natural Gas and $18.7 million for Petroleum Exploration and Production. Congress also allocated $32.1 million for transportation fuels and chemicals, exceeding the Administration's request of $16.0 million. Additionally, the Clean Coal Power Initiative (CCPI) received $287.0 million for FY2005, part of a $2 billion, 10-year commitment for advanced research and development. The Administration's FY2005 budget included funding for the Clean Coal Power Initiative (CCPI) at $287.0 million, with $237.0 million allocated for the FutureGen program. The FutureGen project aims to produce electricity and hydrogen from a coal-fired plant with zero emissions. The CCPI is similar to the Clean Coal Technology Program (CCTP) and has faced rescissions and deferrals since the mid-1990s. The Administration sought $237.0 million in rescissions from the CCTP program to offset the funding for FutureGen. The FY2005 law deferred spending $257.0 million of remaining Clean Coal Technology funds, rather than rescind the money as requested by the Administration. The CCTP will eventually be phased out. The FY2005 law provides $17.8 million for FutureGen and $49.3 million for the CCPI. The House deferred $237.0 million of CCTP funds for future FutureGen requirements. The House Appropriations Committee expressed disappointment with the emphasis on funding new energy research efforts like FutureGen over ongoing energy programs. The House approved $105.0 million for the CCPI, with the House Appropriations Committee recommending restoring proposed reductions for fossil energy research. The Senate agreed with funding levels for FutureGen and deferred $257.0 million for CCTP. The Senate also supported $50.0 million for the CCPI. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was authorized in 1975 to store over 650 million barrels of crude oil in salt domes in Louisiana and Texas. It serves as an emergency source of oil in case of supply interruptions. In 2001, President Bush ordered the SPR to be filled to its capacity of 700 million barrels using royalty-in-kind (RIK) oil. This method avoids the need for Congress approval. Deliveries of royalty-in-kind (RIK) oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) began in 2002 and were scheduled to continue through April 2005. Some policymakers urged the suspension of RIK deliveries to release oil to tight markets, but the administration argued that the volumes were too small to impact prices. During the 108th Congress, there were multiple attempts to suspend deliveries of RIK oil to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in order to sell the oil instead. Various members of Congress supported deferral of deliveries, but these attempts were ultimately rejected. The most recent effort occurred during debate on the FY2005 Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill, where Senator Byrd proposed suspending RIK fill to allocate additional funding for homeland security. The proposed suspension of RIK fill to provide $470 million for homeland security purposes was rejected. The costs for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) are mainly for maintaining facilities and readiness. The SPR request for FY2005 was $177.1 million, including $5.0 million for the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve (NHOR). The NHOR, established by the Clinton Administration, stores 2 million barrels of home heating oil. The House and Senate Committee on Appropriations agreed to the funding levels. The enacted appropriation for FY2005, including the NHOR, is $174.6 million. Legislation to permanently authorize the SPR and NHOR and fill the SPR to its capacity was not enacted. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY1996 authorized the sale of the federal interest in the oil field at Elk Hills, CA. On February 5, 1998, Occidental Petroleum Corporation paid $3.65 billion to the U.S. Treasury for Naval Oil Shale Reserve-1. The Department of Energy returned Naval Oil Shale Reserve-2 to the Ute Indian Tribe in 2000. Naval Oil Shale Reserve-3 was transferred to the Department of the Interior in 1999. The United States retains a 9% royalty interest in NOSR-2 for environmental remediation costs. The Naval Petroleum Reserves program includes two small oil fields in California and Wyoming, estimated to generate $7.2 million in revenue during FY2005. Congress allocated $18.0 million for NPR maintenance in FY2004 and FY2005. The final appropriation for FY2005 was $17.8 million. California Teachers' Retirement Fund will receive 9% of Elk Hills sale proceeds after costs deduction, with five annual payments of $36.0 million starting in FY1999. The FY2004 budget allocated $72.0 million for the Elk Hills School Lands Fund, with $36.0 million to be paid in FY2005. The FY2005 enacted level was $71.5 million, including advance appropriations for FY2006. The Senate Committee on Appropriations recommended $72.0 million for FY2005. For more information on Naval Petroleum and Oil Shale Reserves, visit http://fossil.energy.gov/programs/reserves/npr/. The FY2005 budget request seeks funding for energy efficiency programs, including the Hydrogen Fuel Initiative. The request includes $875.9 million for energy efficiency, with a decrease in R&D funding compared to FY2004. Weatherization funding is also increased. The House Appropriations Committee's report stated that the Weatherization Program funding has been increased to $238.0 million, with an additional $11.0 million added. The report encourages DOE to conduct an updated assessment of the program. The House approved $894.0 million for DOE energy conservation funding in FY2005, with an increase of $18.1 million compared to the Administration's request. The House sought more funding for R&D but less for grants, noting disappointment in the emphasis on \"long-term\" efforts over ongoing programs that yield energy and emissions savings. The House Appropriations Committee recommended restoring reductions in energy conservation research funding. The House Committee recommended increasing R&D funding by $67.0 million to achieve energy independence, lower energy consumption, and reduce emissions. The House Appropriations Committee's report included provisions for DOE to implement cost-saving measures and include sub-activities in the budget document for FY2006. The House Committee recommended increasing R&D funding by $67.0 million to achieve energy independence, lower energy consumption, and reduce emissions. Recommendations include investing more in stationary fuel cells, funding research on fuel cell start-ups in freezing weather, conducting performance assessments for the Building America program, and not reducing staffing and program funding for Industries of the Future. Other suggestions involve new solicitations for off-highway research, earmarking $1.0 million for the Vulcan Beam Line, and coordinating the Cooperative Program with States closely with DOE's Fossil Energy Program. Funding for the review of programs by the National Academy of Science should be a permanent annual expense line. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported the FY2005 Interior Appropriations bill with $854.3 million for DOE's Energy Efficiency Program, including $580.5 million for R&D and $230.0 million for Weatherization grants. Congress enacted $640.1 million for DOE's Energy Efficiency Program in FY2005, with $13.3 million less for R&D compared to FY2004. In FY2005, the Energy Efficiency Program saw a decrease of $13.3 million in R&D funding compared to FY2004. This difference includes reductions in Industrial Technologies and Vehicle Technologies, but increases in Fuel Cells and Buildings. The LHE appropriation law allocated $228.2 million for Weatherization grants, $1.0 million more than the previous year. For more information on energy conservation, visit the DOE website. The Indian Health Service (IHS) provides medical services to American Indians and Alaska Natives through federal, tribal, and urban programs. They operate hospitals, health centers, and treatment centers, with additional services provided by tribes and tribal groups through contracts and compacts. The Indian Health Service (IHS) operates regional youth substance abuse treatment centers and residential quarters for staff. The FY2005 IHS appropriation is $2.99 billion, a 2% increase from FY2004. 87% of the funding is allocated for health services and 13% for health facilities. Funding comes from congressional appropriations, private health insurance, and federal programs like Medicare. The Indian Health Service (IHS) received a total reimbursement of $598.7 million in FY2005, with funding from private health insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP. The IHS Health Services appropriation for FY2005 was $2.60 billion, slightly below the President's request but 3% higher than the previous year. The Clinical Services budget of $2.09 billion includes primary care at IHS and tribally run hospitals and clinics. Hospital and health clinic programs receive the majority of the Clinical Services budget at IHS and tribally run facilities. For FY2005, hospitals and clinics will receive $1.29 billion, with additional funding allocated to dental, mental health, alcohol and substance abuse, and contract care services. The enacted appropriation for contract care in FY2005 is $480.3 million, an increase from the previous year. The final FY2005 appropriation for Preventive Health Services is $110.6 million, a decrease from the President's request of $112.2 million. However, it is an increase of $3.7 million from FY2004. Funding for various programs within preventive health services will increase over FY2004 levels, with program totals allocated for public health nursing, health education, immunizations in Alaska, and the tribally administered community health representatives program. Other health services will receive an enacted appropriation of $395.4 million for FY2005, a decrease from the previous year. The FY2005 appropriations for Indian Health Service decreased in various areas, including scholarships for health care professionals, tribal management grants, and contract support costs. However, funding for health-related activities in off-reservation urban health projects increased slightly. Additionally, funding for IHS administration and management costs for programs operated directly by IHS also increased. The FY2005 appropriation for Indian Health Service increased by $714,000 to $61.4 million to address staffing issues. The total appropriation is $388.6 million, a 10% increase over the President's request. Congress created two diabetes programs in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 created two diabetes programs, one for Type 1 research and the other for IHS diabetes program. Funding for these programs was increased in 2000 and extended through FY2003, with $100 million allocated each year. Congress further extended funding in 2002, authorizing $150 million for each program. The Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation (ONHIR) was created to resolve a dispute between the Hopi and Navajo tribes over lands. It involves land and housing acquisition, infrastructure construction, and voluntary relocation of tribe members at federal expense. For more information, visit the Indian Health Service website. The Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation (ONHIR) deals with land and housing acquisition, infrastructure construction, and voluntary relocation of tribe members. Congress has expressed concerns about the speed of the relocation process and avoiding forced relocations. ONHIR's FY2005 appropriation was reduced to $4.9 million, a 63% decrease from FY2004, with a backlog of relocatees awaiting replacement homes. ONHIR has a backlog of relocatees awaiting replacement homes, with 163 Navajo families still needing to complete relocation. Most of these families are not currently living on Hopi partitioned land, and some refuse to relocate. In contrast, all but one of the 27 Hopi families on Navajo partitioned land had completed relocation by the end of FY2003. ONHIR has a backlog of relocatees awaiting replacement homes, with 163 Navajo families still needing to complete relocation. Congressional committees have expressed impatience with the speed of relocation but have not recently criticized the current pace. A proviso in ONHIR appropriations language prohibits evicting Navajo families from Hopi partitioned lands without providing a replacement home, potentially leading to forced eviction in the future as the backlog is reduced. The remaining Navajo families are refusing relocation, and the Hopi Tribe may take legal action against the United States for not giving them \"quiet possession\" of all Hopi partitioned lands. The Smithsonian Institution is a museum complex with 17 museums and galleries, funded mostly by the federal government. The Bush Administration proposed a 5.0% increase in funding for the Smithsonian, totaling $628.0 million. The Bush Administration proposed a 5.0% increase in funding for the Smithsonian, totaling $628.0 million. This includes $499.1 million for Salaries and Expenses, covering administration of museums and research institutions. The House-passed appropriation was $619.8 million, reflecting a 4% increase over the FY2004 law. The Senate committee-reported appropriations bill for the Smithsonian Institutions was also mentioned. The Senate committee-reported appropriations bill for the Smithsonian Institutions proposed $627.0 million, an increase of $7.2 million over the House level and $30.7 million over the FY2004 level. The final FY2005 appropriation provided $615.2 million for the Smithsonian, with $489.0 million allocated to the Salaries and Expenses account. A new account title, Facilities Capital, was introduced in FY2004 for revitalization, construction, and facilities planning and design. The FY2004 law allocated $107.6 million for Facilities Capital, with the FY2005 budget proposing $128.9 million. Congress enacted $126.1 million for Facilities Capital in FY2005, along with funds for revitalization, construction, and facilities planning. Revitalization funds address building deterioration, maintenance, and critical repairs. $31.7 million was allocated for operating expenses for the NMAI in FY2005, a decrease from the previous year. The FY2004 law allocated $107.6 million for Facilities Capital, with the FY2005 budget proposing $128.9 million. Congress enacted $126.1 million for Facilities Capital in FY2005, along with funds for revitalization, construction, and facilities planning. $31.7 million was allocated for operating expenses for the NMAI in FY2005. The NMAI was controversial due to arguments about the need for renovation of existing Smithsonian museums versus the construction of a new museum. The groundbreaking ceremony for the NMAI took place in 1999, with the grand opening in 2004. The Smithsonian Institution faced controversy over proposed closures, leading to the establishment of a science commission. The commission's 2003 report highlighted declining support for science programs. Efforts to revitalize science included addressing over three quarters of the commission's recommendations. Funding for the Smithsonian's Center for Materials Research and Education (SCMRE) was provided in FY2004 and FY2005. Additionally, the National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC) was established within the Smithsonian. The National Museum of African American History and Culture (NMAAHC) was established within the Smithsonian Institution through P.L. 108-184. It will focus on collecting, preserving, studying, and exhibiting African American historical and cultural material, covering periods such as slavery, Reconstruction, the Harlem Renaissance, and the civil rights movement. The FY2005 budget allocated $3.9 million for the NMAAHC, with discussions on space availability on the Mall for the museum. The FY2005 budget allocated $17.6 million for salaries and expenses at the National Zoo. Concerns have been raised about the zoo's facilities and animal care. The Smithsonian Institution plans to revitalize the zoo with an estimated $19 million for construction, including a new elephant facility by 2007. The National Zoo, 110 years old, is deteriorating physically. The National Zoo is in need of revitalization due to deteriorating facilities and animal care concerns. A new construction project costing $68.3 million will provide ample space for animals, bringing the zoo in compliance with industry standards. Funding includes federal appropriations, private donations, and income from trust funds. The Smithsonian Institution receives funds from private sources, government grants, and contracts. Trust funds include investment income, revenue from business ventures like the Smithsonian magazine, and private donor-designated funds. Concerns arise when donor-specified funds restrict the institution's control, with designated funds totaling $84.5 million in FY2004. There is debate over renaming buildings for donors and sponsors. The Congress has been debating issues related to funding and integrity at the Smithsonian Institution, including concerns over renaming buildings for donors. The National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities (NFAH) provides federal support for arts and humanities through organizations like the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH). The NEA and NEH have been operating on temporary authority through appropriations law since FY1993. Congress debates federal funding for arts and humanities, with opponents arguing for abolishment and proponents emphasizing the national significance of programs like national touring theater and dance companies. The NEA's direct grant program for the arts currently supports approximately 1,600 grants, with state arts agencies receiving over 40% of grant funds. For FY2005, Congress enacted $121.3 million for NEA, a decrease of 13% from the Administration's budget. The FY2005 budget proposed funding the American Masterpieces program under NEA grants and state partnerships, but the Senate committee-reported bill did not allocate additional funds for it. Congress enacted $2.0 million for American Masterpieces and $121.3 million for NEA in FY2005. The FY2005 budget allocated $121.3 million for NEA, with $21.4 million for the Challenge America Arts fund. Congress requires detailed reports on fund usage. Debate on past NEA grants continues, with funding priorities and restrictions reiterated in appropriations laws. The NEH supports grants for humanities education, research, preservation, and public humanities programs. Congress allocated $138.1 million for NEH in FY2005, including funding for matching grants and administration. The final appropriation for FY2005 provides $11.2 million for the We the People initiative, an increase from the previous year but a decrease from the Administration's request. Grants include model curriculum projects for schools in humanities subjects. The Office of Museum Services provides various grants to museums to improve their services. The FY2005 appropriations bill includes funding for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, as well as related agencies. The National Endowment for the Arts, National Endowment for the Humanities, and Institute of Museum and Library Services also receive funding. The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) is authorized at $900 million annually through FY2015 for various purposes. The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) is utilized by federal land management agencies for land acquisition and recreational development. State and local governments also benefit from LWCF grants administered by the NPS. Additionally, funds from LWCF have been used for various activities beyond land acquisition since FY1998. Earmarked appropriations for federal acquisitions are common, while state grant programs are usually not earmarked. The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) is primarily used for federal land acquisition and recreational development. State grant programs are not typically earmarked. The total authorized amount for LWCF appropriations since inception was $28.1 billion, with actual appropriations totaling $14.2 billion. Appropriations for federal land acquisition increased from $138.0 million in FY1996 to $453.2 million in FY2001, but have since declined significantly, similar to reductions seen in the early and mid-1990s to address the federal budget deficit. In FY2003 and FY2004, land acquisition and grants to states declined. The federal budget deficit has drawn increased attention, with a total of $900.2 million requested for FY2005, of which $314.0 million would have gone to federal land acquisition and state grants. The remainder, $586.2 million, was the largest amount requested in the program's history for purposes other than land acquisition and stateside grants. In FY2003 and FY2004, land acquisition and state grants declined. For FY2005, $900.2 million was requested, with $314.0 million allocated for federal land acquisition and state grants. The House-passed legislation provided funding for various programs, with a focus on acquisition management. State grants would have seen minimal changes from FY2004 levels. The House bill would have allocated $92.5 million for the Forest Legacy Program and the Habitat Conservation Program. The House-passed legislation allocated $92.5 million for the Forest Legacy Program and the Habitat Conservation Program, which was nearly $500 million less than the Administration's request for funding for other programs. The Senate legislation earmarked $549.0 million for LWCF, providing almost the same total as the Administration requested for federal land acquisition. The Senate bill allocated funding for various federal land management agencies, with state grants remaining consistent with the House bill. Additionally, over $237 million was provided for programs administered by the Fish and Wildlife Service. The FY2005 appropriation for other purposes totaled $203.4 million for FWS and FS programs, showing less contention compared to previous years. The FY2001 Interior appropriations law created the Conservation Spending Category (CSC) to combine funding for various resource protection programs, including the LWCF. This was in response to the Clinton Administration's request for increased funding under the Lands Legacy Initiative and congressional interest in the Conservation and Reinvestment Act. The CSC authorized annual spending growth of $160.0 million. The law authorized annual spending growth for the Conservation Spending Category (CSC) by $160.0 million, from $1.6 billion in FY2001 to $2.4 billion in FY2006. All CSC funding is subject to the appropriations process, with disagreements on how programs should be categorized. Appropriations history through FY2005 shows funding exceeding targets in FY2001 and FY2002, with increases in Interior and Commerce funding. Congress appropriated $1.75 billion for a group of programs, almost reaching the target of $1.76 billion. The Interior portion received $1.32 billion, meeting the authorized amount. The FY2003 request was $1.67 billion, below the target of $1.92 billion, with a total appropriation of $1.51 billion. For FY2004, the request was $1.33 billion, below the target of $2.08 billion, with $1.00 billion requested for the Interior portion against a target of $1.56 billion. The FY2005 request for Interior programs included $1.05 billion for the CSC, an increase of $140 million from FY2004. The total appropriated amount is unclear as requests from the Forest Service and Department of Commerce were not included in the CSC structure. The House Appropriations Committee's report mentioned the CSC only in the minority. The FY2005 House-passed bill would fund the CSC at $850 million below the $1.7 billion target. The Senate Appropriations Committee expressed concerns about proposals to create \"direct entitlement funding\" for conservation programs. In the 106th Congress, initiatives were introduced for funding natural resource protection in the Conservation Spending Category. The alterations to the natural flow of water in South Florida, caused by canals, levees, and urban development, have led to environmental deterioration. Congress authorized the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to create a plan to restore the South Florida ecosystem, including the Everglades, resulting in the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) in 1999. The federal government, along with state, local, and tribal entities, is engaged in a collaborative effort to restore the South Florida ecosystem through the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) authorized in 2000. CERP aims to redirect excess freshwater to restore natural hydrological functions without impacting water needs of agricultural and urban areas. The federal government is responsible for half of the restoration costs. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) involves 68 projects with a total estimated cost of $7.8 billion, with the federal government covering half of the cost. Funding for restoration projects in the South Florida ecosystem is provided through annual appropriations bills, with the Department of the Interior overseeing activities through various agencies. Federal appropriations for restoration projects in the South Florida ecosystem have been provided to various agencies including the Corps, NOAA, EPA, and USDA. From FY1993 to FY2004, federal funding exceeded $2.3 billion, with state funding surpassing $3.6 billion. The average annual federal cost for restoration activities in Southern Florida for the next 10 years is expected to be significant. The federal cost for restoration activities in Southern Florida is estimated to be around $286 million per year for the next 10 years. In FY2005, the Administration requested $231.0 million for restoration efforts in the Everglades, with $67.0 million allocated for the implementation of CERP. However, the DOI was only appropriated $65.5 million for CERP and non-CERP activities, which was significantly less than the requested amount. The USGS received $7.7 million for research, planning, and modeling, while the BIA received $0.5 million for water projects and restoration on tribal lands. The FY2005 enacted funding was lower than the Administration's request due to the omission of a proposed land acquisition project under the NPS. The request for $40.0 million to acquire mineral rights for Big Cypress National Preserve was not granted. The Collier Resources Company has mineral rights in the preserve and reached an agreement to sell them to the DOI. Forty million dollars would have covered a portion of the cost of the mineral rights, estimated at $120 million. The House and Senate bills for FY2005 did not allocate funds for mineral rights restoration in South Florida. The House Appropriations Committee expressed concerns about coordination and research for the ecosystem, directing DOI to submit reports on funded projects and implementation of recommendations. The Senate bill included provisions for NPS construction funds to be spent in accordance with the FY2004 law. The FY2005 appropriations provide $8.0 million for the Modified Water Deliveries Project, $4.8 million below the FY2004 level. Funds will be provided unless federal departments report water quality issues in the A.R.M. Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge and Everglades National Park. The FY2005 appropriations include provisions conditioning funds on achieving water quality standards in response to concerns about phosphorus pollution in the Everglades. This was based on a Florida State Law amending the Everglades Forever Act. The House and Senate Committees on Appropriations disapproved further expenditure of funds if standards were not met. The Everglades Restoration efforts are detailed in various CRS reports by different authors. More information can be found on the websites of the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Program and the Corps of Engineers. The Bush Administration's Competitive Sourcing Initiative is also mentioned. The Bush Administration's Competitive Sourcing Initiative aims to save money through public-private competition in commercial activities like law enforcement and maintenance. Concerns exist about cost savings and service quality, especially for agencies like the National Park Service and the Department of Energy. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2005 imposed spending limits on competitive sourcing studies for DOI and DOE. Limits on competitive sourcing studies for DOI and DOE in FY2005 are set at $3.25 million and $0.5 million respectively, with Forest Service spending capped at $2.0 million. Agencies must report full costs associated with sourcing studies to Congress. The FY2005 House-passed bill aimed to require annual reporting on competitive sourcing activities but was not enacted. The reporting requirements for competitive sourcing activities were repealed by P.L. 108-447, which also required agencies to specify funding levels for such studies in their annual budget submissions. Concerns were raised about the fast pace of the initiative and reprogramming funds without approval, particularly by the Forest Service. The FY2004 House-passed bill attempted to prevent new competitive sourcing studies, but the President threatened to veto it if that language was included. An ongoing controversy over conflicting water levels for upper and lower Missouri River Basin states was an issue during the markup of the Senate Committee on Appropriations of the FY2005 Interior appropriations bill. A provision to change a trigger that requires the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) to implement drought conservation measures on the Missouri River remained in S. 2804 after a debate to have it removed during committee markup, but was not enacted into law. No similar language had been included in the House-passed bill. The Senate Committee on Appropriations debated changing the trigger for implementing drought conservation measures on the Missouri River in the FY2005 Interior appropriations bill. The current trigger is 31 million acre-feet of storage at a March 15 check, but S. 2804 proposed suspending navigation if storage fell below 40 MAF at any time during the year. The current storage level is 35.7 MAF, with estimated storage on March 15, 2005 between 34.9 MAF and 36.5 MAF. The Missouri River management debate includes discussions on changing the trigger for implementing drought conservation measures. Various reports by CRS cover topics such as the Army Corps of Engineers Civil Works Program, Abandoned Mine Land Fund Reauthorization, Everglades Restoration, Federal Lands, Grazing Regulations, and more. The Bureau of Land Management has made changes, and various reports by CRS cover topics such as Historic Preservation, Land and Water Conservation Fund, Mining on Federal Lands, National Monument Issues, National Park Management, and Natural Resources Policy. The CRS reports cover topics related to South Florida ecosystem restoration, comprehensive Everglades restoration plan, conservation spending, federal land and resource management, federal land management agencies, federal land ownership, Bureau of Land Management lands, and national forests. The CRS reports cover various topics such as phosphorus mitigation in the Everglades, energy efficiency, forest fire protection, hydrogen and fuel cell vehicle research, national forest roadless area initiatives, and the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is covered in CRS reports along with other topics such as phosphorus mitigation in the Everglades, energy efficiency, forest fire protection, and national forest roadless area initiatives.
