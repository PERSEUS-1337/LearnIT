    "content": "A master limited partnership (MLP) is a business structure taxed as a partnership but traded on financial markets like corporate stock. MLP income is taxed once at the individual level, unlike C corporations which face double taxation. This tax advantage can attract more capital at a lower cost for MLPs. MLP units, traded on financial exchanges like corporate stock, offer single taxation for higher after-tax returns to investors. This structure attracts more capital at lower costs for businesses, with units providing periodic cash distributions similar to dividends. Publically tradable MLP units pay periodic cash distributions similar to dividends and are traded on various stock exchanges. Unit holders receive a portion of the partnership's income, deductions, and credits based on the units owned. The general partner manages the partnership in exchange for an incentive distribution right (IDR), typically a 2% share of distributable cash flow. The general partner of a publicly tradable MLP receives an increasing share of distributable cash flow above a baseline if the yield on limited partner units exceeds certain thresholds. This payment structure compensates for risks and incentivizes maximizing investor returns. To qualify as an MLP, 90% of gross income must be \"qualifying income,\" which includes dividends, interest, rents, capital gains, and mining and natural resource income. Recently, the definition of qualifying income has been expanded to include income from transportation and storage of certain resources. The expanded definition of qualifying income for MLPs now includes income from transportation and storage of renewable fuels and industrial source carbon dioxide. MLPs typically own and operate business assets indirectly through an operating company to reduce administrative burdens and limit liability across different states. Operating companies also provide more options and protection for structuring debt financing. MLPs can use an operating company to filter income and separate debt more easily. Their tax treatment is complex, limiting the investor pool to sophisticated investors. Investors pay tax on partnership income annually, regardless of distributions. The taxation of MLP investments is complex, with passive losses only able to offset passive income. Cash distributions are not taxed until units are sold, and are generally taxed as capital gains. Losses from one MLP cannot offset income from another MLP. Investors in MLPs must calculate their adjusted basis by subtracting cash distributions received and adding their share of net income. This ensures income is only taxed once. Additional tax considerations include depreciation deductions and potential unrelated business income taxation (UBIT), which may impact pension funds and tax-preferred accounts. The tax treatment of pension funds and tax-preferred accounts investing in MLPs is a concern. Income over $1,000 from MLP investments is subject to unrelated business income tax (UBIT) at corporate rates. Proposed changes to the tax treatment of carried interest could affect energy-related MLPs. Proposed changes to the tax treatment of carried interest, primarily affecting financial services industries like hedge funds and private equity funds, could potentially impact energy-related MLPs. Carried interest, taxed at capital gains rates, is seen as compensation for services rather than capital gains. However, altering this tax treatment may have minimal effects on MLPs, as the IDR payments to general partners already function as a form of carried interest based on partnership performance. Master limited partnerships (MLPs) use IDR payments as a form of carried interest based on partnership performance, which is taxed at ordinary income rates. While there may be a small fraction of MLP carried interest taxed as capital gains, it is minimal. MLPs became more favorable for tax purposes after the Tax Reform Act of 1986, but other changes limited their attractiveness for investors. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 made MLPs more favorable for tax purposes, but the introduction of passive loss rules limited their attractiveness for investors. In 1987, IRC \u00a7 7704 modified the rules for publicly traded partnerships (PTPs) and MLPs, treating them as corporations for tax purposes unless they met specific criteria. The 1987 rules related to publicly traded partnerships (PTPs) and master limited partnerships (MLPs) were enacted to address concerns about erosion of the corporate tax base. If income criteria were not met, the partnership could be grandfathered for 10 years before being taxed as a corporation or ceasing operations. Congress noted that PTPs were being used to avoid corporate taxes, circumventing pre-1987 tax laws. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 potentially expanded the pool of capital able to invest in MLPs by changing rules related to UBIT, making it more attractive for traded partnerships to disincorporate and integrate corporate and shareholder tax levels. The 2004 Jobs Act changed rules related to UBIT, making it more attractive for mutual funds to invest in MLPs by allowing partnership distributions to be qualifying income. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 expanded the definition of qualifying MLP income to include renewable fuels and industrial source carbon dioxide activities. This change aimed to provide tax parity for biofuels pipelines compared to petroleum pipelines. During the 111th Congress, policies were enacted to support investment and growth in the renewable energy sector, aligning with the Obama Administration's emphasis on clean energy technology. This included addressing financing challenges for renewable energy projects post-financial crisis, with potential benefits for job creation and domestic energy security. The renewable energy sector faced new financing challenges after the financial crisis, with tax-equity markets becoming scarce. To address this, Congress enacted the Section 1603 grants program, allowing taxpayers to receive grants in lieu of tax credits. This program helped prevent a decline in renewable energy investment. The Section 1603 grant program prevented a decline in renewable energy investments by allowing taxpayers to receive direct grants from the Treasury. This program broadened the pool of renewable energy investors and has led to discussions about attracting more capital to the sector, such as through allowing renewable energy developers to structure as master limited partnerships (MLPs). Congress may consider expanding qualifying income definitions or making other tax law changes to facilitate this. In the case of the Section 1603 grant program, qualifying renewable energy technologies were those eligible for the renewable energy PTC or ITC. The MLP structure could be extended to include other technologies supporting renewable energy, attracting additional capital to the sector through higher returns typically offered by MLPs. This could provide easier access to equity for renewable power facilities. MLPs could offer easier access to equity for clean energy projects, making them more competitive with fossil fuels. Changes to passive loss rules alongside MLP structuring for renewables could attract investors to the sector. Tax losses would pass through to investors under the MLP structure. Tax losses passing through to investors under the MLP structure could make renewable energy investments more attractive by allowing them to offset other income. Extending the MLP structure to renewables may reduce the cost of capital and increase investment in the sector. Expanding the definition of qualifying income to allow renewable energy producers to structure as MLPs could raise concerns about the corporate tax base size. This could potentially decrease the size of the corporate tax base if more firms are allowed to structure as MLPs. Expanding the definition of qualifying income to allow certain energy companies to structure as MLPs could result in a decrease in the corporate tax base and federal revenue losses. Senator Max Baucus and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner have raised concerns about the increasing use of passthroughs over corporate entities. Baucus suggested treating passthroughs as corporations for high-income earners, while Geithner emphasized the need for Congress to reconsider allowing corporations alternative organizational forms. Congress needs to reconsider whether certain businesses should be allowed to choose their tax classification as corporations or passthrough entities. This decision could impact the competitive advantage of fossil fuel energy companies over renewables. One option is to require publicly traded energy companies to structure as C-corporations to level the playing field and prevent preferential tax treatment for fossil fuel MLPs. The policy change could limit capital access for industries using MLP structure, potentially reducing investments. Allowing renewable energy as MLPs, along with tax benefits exemptions, may lead to concerns about tax shelters and \"gold plating\" of projects. Investors could exploit tax benefits for other income, creating shelter opportunities. Investors in the 1980s used debt to finance wind projects for tax benefits. Removing passive activity loss rules for renewables with investment tax credits could create tax shelter opportunities. MLPs are typically used for stable cash flow technologies, so renewable energy with technology risk may not benefit from this structure. MLPs could potentially attract additional capital to the renewable energy sector, stimulating investment and growth. This could also allow investors to benefit from renewable energy tax incentives and avoid tax-equity markets. However, extending the definition of qualifying income to include renewable energy facilities as MLPs may raise policy concerns. The MLP universe has expanded in recent decades, particularly in the energy sector. The number of energy MLPs grew from 6 in 1994 to 72 in 2010, with total market capitalization increasing significantly. There are concerns that changes in MLP regulations could lead to tax shelter opportunities. The proportion of energy MLPs in the industry has also increased over the years. The share of MLPs in the energy industry has increased over the years, with a shift towards midstream or transportation activities. In 1990, 10% of MLPs were oil and gas midstream operations, which increased to 44% by 2010. Meanwhile, the proportion of MLPs involved in oil and gas exploration and production decreased from 21% to 10%. Energy and natural resources account for nearly 90% of market capital in MLPs, with over 70% attributed to midstream oil and gas operations."
