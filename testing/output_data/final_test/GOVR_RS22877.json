    "content": "Individuals can establish health savings accounts (HSAs) since 2004 to pay for medical expenses on a tax-advantaged basis with a qualifying high-deductible health plan. Contributions can be made up to an annual maximum. HSAs should not be confused with Health Reimbursement Accounts (HRAs), which only employers can establish and contribute to. Data on enrollment and cost sharing for HDHPs and HSAs are available from multiple sources. The curr_chunk discusses various data sources for HSAs and HDHPs, providing guidance on choosing the right source based on the question being asked. It also mentions the availability of data on enrollment, premiums, and deductibles from different surveys and IRS tax returns. The IRS data is recommended for information specifically on HSAs. The IRS data, broken down by tax reporting units, provide total tax deductions and their value. Other sources combine data on HSA-eligible HDHPs and HRAs, with enrollment estimates provided by EBRI and Mercer for individuals with these plans. EBRI data includes age, income, and health status information. The Mercer survey provides information on firm size, while the AHIP data offers details on HSA-qualified HDHPs and covers a large number of enrollees. The Kaiser Family Foundation/Health Research and Education Trust survey focuses on firms and provides insights on health plans. The KFF/HRET survey includes data on enrollment from various sources, showing significant differences in estimates due to unique measurement concepts. AHIP reports 10,009,000 individuals covered by HSA-eligible HDHPs, while EBRI reports 11,200,000 individuals enrolled in HSA-eligible HDHPs or HRAs in 2009. Mercer states that 9% of covered employees have HSA-eligible plans in 2009, and the IRS data show 810,729 tax returns claimed an HSA deduction in 2008. These enrollment measures are not directly comparable due to representing different concepts. The number of individuals claiming deductions for HSA contributions in 2008 is the smallest due to the growing number of HSAs and not all individuals contributing or claiming deductions. AHIP provides comprehensive information on premiums and deductibles for different markets and age groups. Small group market deductibles are generally higher due to the spread of major illness risk and fewer economies of scale. The average deductible for small group policies is $2,329, slightly higher than the $2,203 average deductible for large group policies. Different data sources provide insights into HSA-eligible HDHPs, but caution is needed when combining information from these sources. When combining data from different sources, it is important to focus on a specific question and use the source that best answers it."
