    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Literacy, Education, and Rehabilitation Act\". It provides credit for participation in educational, vocational, treatment, assigned work, or other developmental programs. The \"Literacy, Education, and Rehabilitation Act\" amends Section 3624 of title 18, United States Code to allow prisoners to receive credit towards their sentence for participating in designated programs, up to 60 days per year beyond time already served. The \"Literacy, Education, and Rehabilitation Act\" allows prisoners to earn credit towards their sentence by participating in designated programs, with up to 60 days per year beyond time served. Credit is prorated and awarded based on satisfactory participation or progress in these programs as determined by the Director of the Bureau of Prisons. Prisoners can earn credit towards their sentence by participating in designated programs, with factors like program difficulty, time required, responsibility level, rehabilitative benefits, and benefits to the Bureau of Prisons considered in awarding credits. The Director of the Bureau of Prisons makes the credit policy available for prisoners to review before participating in designated programs. Any person under the custody of the Attorney General is eligible for credits, and designated programs benefit prisoners or the Bureau of Prisons. Prisoners may participate in educational, vocational, and treatment programs, as well as assigned work and developmental programs. Foreign prisoners transferred to the custody of the Attorney General can also participate in designated programs for satisfactory behavior.
