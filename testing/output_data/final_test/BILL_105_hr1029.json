    "content": "The \"Insurance Claims Privacy Protection Act\" includes sections on short title, findings, purposes, definitions, limitations on disclosure of claims information to law enforcement agencies, separation of functions between crime bureau and insurance data support organization, coordination with State law, and enforcement. The Congress recognizes the need for insurers to share claims information to expedite claim processing and prevent fraudulent activities. Insurers work with law enforcement to ensure the integrity of the claims process, although protections against improper disclosure are being reconsidered. The insurance industry is planning to eliminate privacy protections and share individual claims information with law enforcement agencies, despite the lack of enactment of model privacy legislation proposed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. The insurance industry's current plans involve disclosing personal claims information to law enforcement agencies, which raises concerns about violating individual privacy rights and potentially intimidating individuals from filing claims. Effective State regulation is deemed insufficient, and congressional enactment of a uniform rule is seen as the only way to protect personal privacy rights. The Act aims to protect insurance customers' privacy rights by preventing insurers from sharing personal information with law enforcement agencies, establishing clear rules for insurance crime bureaus, and providing remedies for violations. The Act defines key terms related to insurance claims data, including \"all claims database,\" \"crime bureau,\" and \"insurance claims data support organization.\" These definitions aim to regulate the sharing of information and prevent illegal or fraudulent activities in property and casualty insurance claims. An \"insurance claims data support organization\" collects claims information for property and casualty insurers, excluding activities of insurers. Property and casualty insurance covers all lines except life and health insurance. A casualty insurer provides property and casualty insurance directly or through agents or brokers. Limitations on disclosure of claims information to law enforcement agencies are outlined in Section 5. No property and casualty insurer, crime bureau, or insurance data support organization can disclose claim information to law enforcement unless it is to prevent or prosecute fraud, respond to a subpoena, or if illegal activities are suspected. SEC. 6. Separation of crime bureau functions from insurance data support organization functions. An insurance data support organization can establish an all claims data base and provide claims information to a crime bureau for detecting fraudulent activities. A crime bureau can prevent fraud and collaborate with law enforcement but cannot operate an all claims data base. SEC. 7. COORDINATION WITH STATE LAW. This Act does not prevent states from enacting stricter privacy protections for property and casualty insurance claims. States can certify to the Attorney General that they have equivalent protections, allowing enforcement solely through that certification. The Attorney General can revoke certification for breaches. SEC. 8. ENFORCEMENT. SEC. 8. ENFORCEMENT. Violations of this Act can be enjoined in Federal court without jurisdictional amount restrictions. The Attorney General or private parties can bring injunctive actions. Civil penalties of up to $10,000 may also apply."
