    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Preserve Access to Affordable Generics Act.\" It includes Congressional findings and declaration of purposes. The Congress finds that prescription drugs account for a significant portion of healthcare spending, with generic drugs being a cost-effective option. Competition in the pharmaceutical market and enforcement of antitrust laws can lead to lower prices for consumers and the healthcare system. The Federal Trade Commission has found that brand name pharmaceutical manufacturers collude with generic drug manufacturers to delay competition, which goes against free competition and antitrust laws. Appellate court decisions in 2005 upheld settlements involving pay-offs to keep generic competition off the market. The Federal Trade Commission found that brand name pharmaceutical manufacturers collude with generic drug manufacturers to delay competition. In the 6 months following the March 2005 court decisions, the FTC found settlement agreements where generics received compensation and agreed to restrictions on marketing. Over 2/3 of settlement agreements in 2006 involved pay-offs from brands to delay generic entry, which is anti-competitive and harms consumers. The purpose of this Act is to enhance competition in the pharmaceutical market. The purpose of the Act is to enhance competition in the pharmaceutical market by prohibiting anticompetitive agreements and collusion between brand name and generic drug manufacturers to keep generic drugs off the market, support antitrust laws, and clarify the law to prevent payments from brand name to generic drug manufacturers to delay competition. SEC. 3. UNLAWFUL COMPENSATION FOR DELAY. The Clayton Act is amended to include a new section prohibiting interference with generic marketing. The Act prohibits agreements in drug sales where an ANDA filer receives value and agrees not to market the product. However, settlements allowing the ANDA product to be marketed before patent expiration are allowed. In this section, the term 'agreement' refers to agreements under antitrust laws, 'agreement resolving or settling a patent infringement claim' includes any related agreements, 'ANDA' is an application for generic drugs, 'ANDA filer' is the party filing the application, and 'ANDA product' is the drug to be manufactured under the application. The term 'drug product' refers to a finished dosage form containing a drug substance, 'NDA' is a new drug application, and 'NDA holder' is the party with FDA approval to market a drug product. The FDA Orange Book, also known as Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, is used in connection with NDA. Patent infringement refers to the violation of any patent or filed patent application. Control is presumed by direct or indirect share ownership of 50 percent or greater. The term 'patent infringement claim' refers to any allegation made to an ANDA filer that its ANDA product may infringe a patent held by the NDA holder of the drug product. SEC. 4. NOTICE AND CERTIFICATION OF AGREEMENTS. Section 1112(c)(2) of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 is amended to include a description of any additional agreements entered into within 30 days of the initial agreement. Additionally, a certification requirement is added for agreements filed under subsections (a), (b), or (c). The Assistant Attorney General and the Commission must provide a certification stating that the filed materials represent the final agreement between parties, include any related ancillary agreements, and describe any oral agreements that have not been reduced to writing. SEC. 5 amends Section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act regarding forfeiture of 180-day exclusivity period. SEC. 6 mandates a study by the Federal Trade Commission. The Federal Trade Commission is required to conduct a study on the prevalence and impact of agreements in patent infringement suits in the pharmaceutical market, as well as other anticompetitive practices in the industry over the last 5 years. The Federal Trade Commission must consult with the Department of Justice on anticompetitive practices in the pharmaceutical market and submit a report to Congress within a year with recommendations on potential amendments to antitrust laws. Amendment to antitrust laws may be needed to address competition issues identified in the study. The Attorney General or Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission will assess if further enforcement action is necessary to restore competition or prevent a substantial lessening of competition resulting from the practices under investigation. Authorization of appropriations is granted to the Federal Trade Commission for the implementation of this Act."
