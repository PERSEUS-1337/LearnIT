The National Ocean Exploration Program Act mandates the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to conduct interdisciplinary exploration voyages to survey marine environments, prioritize deep ocean regions for scientific discoveries, and document historic shipwrecks and submerged sites. The National Ocean Exploration Program Act mandates the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to conduct interdisciplinary exploration voyages to survey marine environments, prioritize deep ocean regions for scientific discoveries, and document historic shipwrecks and submerged sites. The program aims to combine archaeology and oceanographic sciences, develop a transparent review process for proposals, enhance technical capabilities of the marine science community, accept donations for ocean exploration purposes, and establish an ocean exploration forum for partnerships and communication among experts and stakeholders. The national program aims to enhance scientific and technical expertise by collaborating with stakeholders. SEC. 104. OCEAN EXPLORATION TECHNOLOGY AND INFRASTRUCTURE TASK FORCE. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, along with other agencies and experts, will convene a task force to develop and implement a strategy for ocean exploration technology and infrastructure. This includes transferring new technology, improving communication infrastructure, and creating a data management system for research and management purposes. The program aims to conduct public outreach activities to improve understanding of ocean science, resources, and processes. It also encourages partnerships for transferring exploration technology and expertise. Interagency financing is authorized for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Science Foundation, and other Federal agencies involved in the program established under section 102. Funds can be shared, transferred, received, and spent for administrative or programmatic projects. The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act authority is not superseded or limited by this title. Authorization of appropriations is also included. SEC. 107.

SHORT TITLE: \"NOAA Undersea Research Program Act of 2005\"\n\nSEC. 202. ESTABLISHMENT. The Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will establish an undersea research program with the purpose of increasing scientific knowledge for the management, use, and preservation of oceanic resources. The program will focus on research, exploration, education, and technology development, serving the academic community's undersea science needs. The undersea research program established by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will be conducted through a national headquarters, regional research centers, and a technology institute. The program director will oversee the program with guidance from a Council of Center Directors consisting of regional center and technology institute directors. The undersea research program includes core research, advanced technology development, education programs, and natural product discovery from ocean and aquatic systems. The undersea research program includes core research, advanced technology development, education programs, and natural product discovery from ocean and aquatic systems. The regional centers' external projects are managed through an open and competitive process to evaluate scientific merit, relevance to NOAA, research goals, and technical feasibility. Authorization of appropriations is also addressed. Authorized appropriations for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration include $12.5 million for regional centers and $5 million for the National Technology Institute in fiscal year 2006, $13.75 million for regional centers and $5.5 million for the Institute in fiscal year 2007, and $15.125 million for regional centers in fiscal year 2008. For fiscal years 2006 to 2010, authorized appropriations include funding for regional centers and the National Technology Institute. The regional centers receive varying amounts each year, with 50 percent allocated to West Coast Regional Centers and 50 percent to East Coast Regional Centers. The National Technology Institute also receives a set amount each year. For fiscal years 2011 to 2013, authorized appropriations include funding for regional centers and the National Technology Institute. The regional centers receive $20,131,000 in 2011, $22,145,000 in 2012, and an unspecified amount in 2013, with 50 percent allocated to West Coast Regional Centers and 50 percent to East Coast Regional Centers. The National Technology Institute receives $7,321,000 in 2011, $8,053,000 in 2012, and $8,859,000 in 2013. In fiscal years 2013, 2014, and 2015, funding for regional centers and the National Technology Institute is allocated. For 2013, $24,359,000 is designated for regional centers, split equally between West Coast and East Coast centers, and $9,744,000 for the National Technology Institute. In 2014, $26,795,000 is allocated for regional centers and $10,718,000 for the National Technology Institute.
