Health insurance agents, known as \"producers,\" assist consumers in selecting and enrolling in insurance products. In 2008, there were about 434,800 producer jobs, with 73% being independent and 21% being captive agents. Producers are typically paid through sales commissions. Health insurance commissions are typically higher in the first year of a new sale and continue annually as long as the individual or family remains enrolled. The commission is a percentage of premiums paid by the enrollee. Initial sales commissions range from 3%-15% for individual and small group markets. Renewal commissions are lower than initial sales commissions. Large group sales are often handled by captive agents who receive a combination of salary, commissions, and bonuses. Approximately 24 million Americans are expected to enroll in individual and small group health plans. 24 million Americans are expected to enroll in individual and small group qualified health plans through the health insurance exchanges established by the Affordable Care Act. The role of health insurance producers in the exchanges is not guaranteed by law, as other sources like the consumer web portal could provide alternatives. The exchange aims to standardize information on insurance options and provide navigators for prospective enrollees. This may reduce the demand for assistance from producers. The Affordable Care Act may lead to insurance companies cutting back on producers or reducing their commissions to lower administrative expenses. This could potentially impact the use of producers by health insurance companies. Producer activity is mainly regulated by states, except for government-sponsored programs like Medicare Advantage. Some believe that the changes from the ACA could put producers out of business. Producers are regulated by states to prevent unfair sales practices and ensure licensure standards are met. Most states follow the NAIC Model Unfair Trade Practices Act, which prohibits misrepresentations, false statements, and requires maintaining records and complaint procedures. States also use the NAIC's Producer Licensing Model Act for standardized regulation, including reciprocity for licensing and age requirements. Producers must undergo a criminal background check, specialized training, and pass a knowledge test. States have complaint reporting systems for insurance companies and producers, with investigations leading to actions against offenders. Producer issues rank low in consumer complaints about insurance coverage. The NAIC's summary of reported complaints shows that marketing and sales complaints about insurance coverage ranged from 4.32% to 4.66% between 2007 and 2010. The PPACA requires states to establish health insurance exchanges by 2014 to facilitate the purchase of qualified health plans. These exchanges will provide standardized comparisons between health plans. PPACA establishes federal standards for producer activity in health insurance exchanges, including requirements for marketing, choice of providers, covered benefits, and value of coverage. The Secretary must develop procedures for states to allow producers to enroll individuals in Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) and assist with premium tax credits. States can also set additional rules for their exchanges. PPACA establishes federal standards for producer activity in health insurance exchanges, including requirements for marketing, choice of providers, covered benefits, and value of coverage. States may establish additional rules for their exchanges, but these rules must not conflict with regulations set by the Secretary. The \"navigators\" program is also established to assist individuals with enrollment in Qualified Health Plans (QHPs). Navigators are responsible for public education, distributing information on premium tax credits and cost sharing reductions, and facilitating enrollment. Navigators may be licensed producers but must be independent of health insurance issuers and comply with standards to ensure fair, accurate, and impartial information. The PPACA establishes federal standards for producer activity in health insurance exchanges, including requirements for marketing, choice of providers, covered benefits, and value of coverage. The minimum medical loss ratio (MLR) standards set by PPACA will impact the use of producers, as plans must provide an annual rebate if the MLR falls below certain percentages. States can adjust the percentages for the individual market. The PPACA establishes federal standards for producer activity in health insurance exchanges, including requirements for marketing, choice of providers, covered benefits, and value of coverage. States can adjust the percentages for the individual market. HHS estimates that between 2.8 million and 9 million members will receive rebates between $587 million and $1.5 billion in aggregate. NAIC established uniform definitions and methodologies for calculating the MLR, with input from stakeholders like NAHU. The NAIC debated whether commissions should be included in the calculation of the MLR, with consumer representatives arguing that they should be considered administrative costs. Ultimately, NAIC concluded that the law does not clearly address the inclusion of commissions in the MLR calculation, but encouraged HHS to accommodate producer compensation arrangements in any MLR regulation. On December 1, 2010, the Secretary issued an interim final regulation for the MLR provision, agreeing with NAIC's interpretation to include producer commissions in the calculation. Concerns were raised about the potential impact on producers, with insurers likely reducing their use and compensation of producers to avoid issuing MLR rebates. The MLR provision may lead insurers to cut back on producer compensation, impacting access to health insurance agents. However, it is uncertain how this will affect consumers as there is no consensus on appropriate access levels. Some insurers may meet the MLR minimum without reducing administrative costs significantly, while others may cut expenses in other areas. Industry observers have suggested potential cuts to producer commissions. Some industry observers suggest cuts to producer commissions, stating that brokers are still compensated well despite reductions. With first year commissions halved, brokers may still find the compensation sufficient compared to previous years. The income of brokers has been reduced due to minimum MLRs, but they previously benefited from rising premium rates. Recent experiences with Medicare programs suggest that limiting producer compensation may not significantly impact access to services. Regulations restrict initial and renewal compensation for sales in Medicare Advantage and Part D programs. The regulations limit renewal compensation for Medicare Advantage and Part D programs to 50% of initial compensation. States can request adjustments to the MLR standard if it may destabilize the individual market. Consumers may face difficulties accessing agents and brokers if issuers leave the market, impacting premiums, benefits, and cost-sharing. Only Maine has received authorization for an adjustment to the MLR standard, with other states like New Hampshire, Nevada, and Kentucky also applying. The Maine application did not address the impact of the 80 percent MLR individual market standard on access to agents and brokers. Other applicants believed the MLR provision would negatively affect access to producers, but no empirical evidence was provided. Kansas reported adjustments to compensation models for agents and brokers, but without public data on commission rates and producer finances, it is difficult to assess the impact of the MLR provision. Representative Mike Rogers introduced the Access to Professional Health Insurance Advisors Act of 2011 (H.R. 1206) to amend the PHSA and exclude remuneration for insurance producers from MLR administrative costs. The bill is under review by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce."
