The \"Promoting Good Cyber Hygiene Act of 2017\" mandates the establishment of a list of best practices for cyber hygiene by the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology within one year of enactment. These practices are to be simple, basic controls effective against common cybersecurity threats, and applicable to the Federal Government, private sector, and individuals using information systems or devices. The \"Promoting Good Cyber Hygiene Act of 2017\" requires the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology to establish a list of best practices for cyber hygiene within one year. These practices should be based on international standards and the Cybersecurity Framework from Executive Order 13636. The best practices are voluntary and are encouraged to be used and improved upon by the Federal Government, private sector, and individuals using information systems or devices. The Director will annually review and update the list of best practices for cyber hygiene. The list will be published in a clear format and made available on the websites of the Federal Trade Commission and Small Business Administration. Federal cybersecurity requirements will not be affected by these practices. Agencies must consider the benefits when implementing the best practices. Each Federal agency must consider the benefits of emerging technologies for cyber hygiene, such as multi-factor authentication, data loss prevention, encryption, and phishing education. A study on promoting effective cyber hygiene for the Internet of Things is required by the Secretary of Homeland Security. The Secretary of Homeland Security, along with other agencies, will conduct a study on cybersecurity threats related to the Internet of Things. This study will assess the impact of these threats on federal information systems, excluding those of the Department of Defense and the intelligence community.
