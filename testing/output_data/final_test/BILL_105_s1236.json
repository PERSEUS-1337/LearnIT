    "content": "The Act titled \"National Police Pursuit Policy Act of 1997\" is cited as the short title. In 1996, 377 deaths occurred in the US due to high-speed motor vehicle pursuits, with 103 being police officers or innocent bystanders. 40% of pursuits in 1995 resulted in accidents, 20% in injury, and 1% in death. 60% of pursuits were not related to felony offenses. Insufficient statistical data is available on high-speed pursuits. A recent study found that 73% of law enforcement officers had been involved in high-speed motor vehicle pursuits in the past year, with 40% reporting accidents resulting from these pursuits. 71% of agencies provided data on high-speed pursuits, despite only 31% maintaining consistent records. Recent studies have shown that law enforcement recruits receive minimal training in driving skills, with a focus on mechanics rather than safe high-speed pursuit procedures. However, increased emphasis on pursuit policies and training reduces the occurrence of high-speed pursuits among trained recruits. SEC. 3.
