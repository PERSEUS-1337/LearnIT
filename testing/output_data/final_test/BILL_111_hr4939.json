The Act recognizes the fiscal pressures of an aging population and seeks to restore confidence in the long-term financial integrity of these programs. The \"Social Security and Medicare Protection Act\" aims to preserve surpluses for retirement and health security, preventing their use for other purposes. It adds a new section to protect Social Security and Medicare surpluses. The \"Social Security and Medicare Protection Act\" prohibits setting a budget surplus lower than the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund surplus for any fiscal year. The \"Social Security and Medicare Protection Act\" prohibits budget resolutions from assuming an increase in outlays or a decrease in revenue for social security or medicare reform legislation. The \"Social Security and Medicare Protection Act\" restricts the consideration of spending and tax legislation in Congress if it would reduce the surplus for a fiscal year below the level set in the budget resolution. The \"Social Security and Medicare Protection Act\" limits spending and tax legislation in Congress that would decrease the surplus below the budget resolution level. This restriction does not apply to social security or medicare reform bills. Enforcement involves adjusting the surplus levels in the budget resolution to prevent deficits. The \"Social Security and Medicare Protection Act\" restricts legislation that would reduce the surplus below the budget resolution level by adjusting budgetary aggregates. Surplus levels are calculated based on baseline levels from the most recent budget resolution. The concurrent resolution on the budget sets discretionary spending levels at current law levels for the budget year and baseline levels for outyears, adjusted for changes in surplus levels based on the most recent budget resolution. The concurrent resolution on the budget sets discretionary spending levels at current law levels for the budget year and baseline levels for outyears, adjusted for changes in surplus levels based on the most recent budget resolution. Adjustments in budgetary aggregates for updated economic and technical assumptions in the mid-session report of the Director of the Congressional Budget Office shall be included in the first current level report on the congressional budget submitted for publication in the Congressional Record after the release of such mid-session report. Budgetary treatment for any fiscal year resulting from social security or medicare reform legislation must not exceed the amounts set forth in the most recently agreed to concurrent resolution on the budget. The concurrent resolution on the budget or section 302(a) allocation for legislation shall not affect enforcing any point of order. The surplus of the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund for a fiscal year will be based on levels in the report or joint explanatory statement accompanying the budget resolution. Additional content in reports accompanying budget resolutions and joint explanatory statements is required. The report accompanying a concurrent resolution on the budget and the joint explanatory statement for each resolution must include surplus levels for each fiscal year and the surplus or deficit in the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. Definitions for 'medicare reform legislation' and 'social security reform legislation' are provided. The bill or joint resolution for social security reform legislation requires a three-fifths vote in the Senate to waive or appeal. The section will be effective until social security and medicare reform legislation is enacted. A conforming amendment is also included in the Congressional Budget Act. The table of contents in the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 is amended. SEC. 4 of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 focuses on protecting Social Security and Medicare surpluses. If the President's budget recommends a surplus lower than the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, it must include proposals for social security or medicare reform legislation. This provision will no longer apply once such reform legislation is enacted."
