    "content": "The \"Horseracing Integrity and Safety Act of 2013\" establishes definitions for terms like \"interstate off-track wager\" and \"veterinarian-client-patient relationship\" as per the Interstate Horseracing Act of 1978. It also mandates the creation of an independent anti-doping organization for interstate horseracing. The \"Horseracing Integrity and Safety Act of 2013\" mandates an independent anti-doping organization to ensure the integrity and safety of interstate horseraces. The organization is responsible for developing and enforcing rules regarding substances, methods, and treatments for horses participating in these races. The \"Horseracing Integrity and Safety Act of 2013\" requires an independent anti-doping organization to oversee substances, methods, and treatments for horses in interstate races. This includes implementing programs for anti-doping education, research, testing, and adjudication to prevent horses from racing under the influence of performance-enhancing substances. The \"Horseracing Integrity and Safety Act of 2013\" empowers an independent anti-doping organization to regulate substances, methods, and treatments for horses in interstate races. It prohibits individuals who violate anti-doping rules from participating in horseraces, including those who have violated rules multiple times or are under suspension by a State racing commission. The independent anti-doping organization mandated by the \"Horseracing Integrity and Safety Act of 2013\" must publish rules within a year of the Act's enactment. It has the authority to suspend exclusion periods for individuals who provide substantial assistance in uncovering rule violations or violations of federal or state law by others. The independent anti-doping organization can reinstate a suspended exclusion period if a person fails to provide substantial assistance. Consultations with various groups are allowed in developing rules. A transition rule permits the use of furosemide in horses 3 years old or older for a 2-year period. The use of furosemide in horses 3 years old or older must comply with specific requirements outlined by the Association of Racing Commissioners International, Inc. and be within a veterinarian-client-patient relationship. The independent anti-doping organization designated by the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 2006 will oversee anti-doping measures. SEC. 4. CONSENT REQUIRED FOR ACCEPTANCE OF INTERSTATE OFF-TRACK WAGERS. Host racing associations must obtain consent from an independent anti-doping organization to conduct horseraces for interstate off-track wagers. This consent is required through an agreement that outlines terms, including compliance with rules and payments to the organization. The independent anti-doping organization must receive payments to cover the costs of carrying out its duties under the Act. All costs incurred by the organization must be defrayed through agreements."
