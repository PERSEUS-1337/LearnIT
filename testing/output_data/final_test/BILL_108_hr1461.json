    "content": "The \"Clean School Buses Act\" establishes a pilot program. The Secretary of Energy will establish a pilot program for awarding grants to eligible entities for alternative fuel school buses and ultra-low sulfur diesel school buses. Grant requirements will be published within 3 months, and proposals will be solicited within 6 months of the enactment of the Act. Grants will only be awarded to eligible recipients. Grants will be awarded to local or State governmental entities or contracting entities providing school bus service for the demonstration of alternative fuel and ultra-low sulfur diesel school buses. The focus is on replacing older buses with more environmentally friendly options. Grants awarded for demonstrating alternative fuel and ultra-low sulfur diesel school buses prioritize replacing buses made before model year 1977. Recipients cannot benefit economically from the grant and must operate the buses for a minimum of 5 years. The grant covers the cost of new alternative fuel or ultra-low sulfur diesel school buses, including taxes and fees. It also provides funding for up to 10% or 15% of the bus price for necessary alternative fuel infrastructure, depending on its availability to the grant recipient and other bus fleets. The grant recipient must contribute 15% of the total bus cost or $15,000 per bus. For ultra-low sulfur diesel school buses, they must prove access to low sulfur fuel and commit to using it. Funding can only be used for new alternative fuel or ultra-low sulfur diesel school buses over 14,000 lbs. The grant recipient must contribute 15% of the total bus cost or $15,000 per bus for new alternative fuel or ultra-low sulfur diesel school buses over 14,000 lbs. These buses must meet specific emission standards based on their model year. The program requires buses to meet specific emission standards, with a focus on reducing nonmethane hydrocarbons, oxides of nitrogen, and particulate matter emissions. The Secretary of Energy aims for nationwide deployment of alternative fuel and ultra-low sulfur diesel school buses, with grants awarded to ensure broad geographic distribution. The Secretary of Energy aims for nationwide deployment of alternative fuel and ultra-low sulfur diesel school buses through grant awards with a goal of geographic distribution and limiting funding for specific purposes. An annual report evaluating program implementation is required to be submitted to Congress. The Secretary of Energy aims to deploy alternative fuel and ultra-low sulfur diesel school buses nationwide through grant awards. Definitions for \"alternative fuel school bus\" and \"ultra-low sulfur diesel school bus\" are provided in the section. The Fuel Cell Bus Development and Demonstration Program is outlined in Section 3. The Secretary of Energy will establish a program for cooperative agreements with private sector fuel cell bus developers to develop fuel cell-powered school buses. Non-Federal contributions for activities funded under this program must be at least 20% for fuel infrastructure development and 50% for demonstration activities. Up to $25,000,000 may be used for this program from fiscal years 2004 through 2006. The Secretary of Energy will transmit a report to Congress evaluating the conversion of natural gas infrastructure for fuel cell-powered school buses and assessing the development program's results by October 1, 2006. Authorization of appropriations for the Secretary of Energy under this Act:\n- $60,000,000 for fiscal year 2003\n- $70,000,000 for fiscal year 2004\n- $80,000,000 for fiscal year 2005\n- $90,000,000 for fiscal year 2006."
