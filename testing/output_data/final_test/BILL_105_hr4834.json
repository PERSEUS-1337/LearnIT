The \"Northwest Salmon Recovery Act of 1998\" aims to address changes in the electric utility industry and ensure that electric power customers repay all costs associated with the Federal Columbia River Power System. Additionally, new tools are needed to promote salmon recovery, conservation, and renewable resources in the Pacific Northwest region. The \"Northwest Salmon Recovery Act of 1998\" aims to address changes in the electric utility industry and ensure that electric power customers repay all costs associated with the Federal Columbia River Power System. Additionally, new tools are needed to promote salmon recovery, conservation, and renewable resources in the Pacific Northwest region. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The \"Northwest Salmon Recovery Act of 1998\" defines key terms such as Administration, Administrator, Council, Commission, region, Secretary, and States for the purposes of the Act. The term \"tribes\" refers to federally recognized Indian tribes in Washington, Idaho, Montana, and Alaska. The term \"unified plan\" refers to the plan developed under the Act, and \"WPPSS\" stands for the Washington Public Power Supply System. SEC. 4. GOVERNANCE. The Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with various governments, must develop a unified plan for salmon recovery in the Pacific Northwest by December 31, 1999. The plan aims to restore sustainable salmon populations to support tribal and nontribal harvests and cultural practices, addressing various legal responsibilities and commitments. The implementation of the plan will be overseen by the Secretary of the Interior. The Secretary of the Interior must develop a plan for salmon recovery in the Pacific Northwest, in compliance with legal requirements, to be implemented under their oversight. Fiscal accountability is emphasized in the plan for salmon recovery in the Pacific Northwest. The Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with other agencies, must establish an accounting system for the Administration within 12 months of the Act's enactment. This system must ensure timely repayment of costs to the United States Treasury, with independent reviews and input from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The accounting system for the Administration must accurately identify costs for fish and wildlife restoration, including treaty obligations, fish mitigation requirements, and water quality standards. Costs of spills or water releases cannot be allocated to fishery restoration accounts. The accounting system for the Administration ensures consultation with governments, tracks costs for significant responsibilities, and makes records available to the public, including those related to fishery restoration, public purposes, and the WPPSS debt. The system ensures compliance with procedures for filing complaints and managing the budget for fish and wildlife, including tracking funding accurately. The unified plan includes open and accurate tracking of funding, independent scientific review by an advisory board, and coordinated project prioritization processes for activities funded under the Act. The Act mandates consistent criteria for fish and wildlife expenditures by governments and specified Secretaries, including resolution procedures for budget disputes. Section 4(h)(10)(D) of another Act is repealed. SEC. 6. Payments towards the Natural Resources Recovery Fund and the WPPSS debt. Establishment of a Natural Resources Recovery Fund managed by the Secretary of the Interior for the restoration of fish and wildlife in the region, including meeting treaty, trust, and Endangered Species Act responsibilities. Amounts in the Fund to be used in consultation with States, tribes, and Federal agencies until a unified plan takes effect. The Natural Resources Recovery Fund, managed by the Secretary of the Interior, is established for fish and wildlife restoration in the region, including meeting various responsibilities. Fees collected from utilities for electric power sales are deposited in the Fund for conservation and renewable energy projects. The Administrator will collect a fee of 3 mills per kilowatt hour from direct service industrial customers for 15 years to repay Washington Public Power Supply System debt. Additionally, fees and charges will be established to ensure fair allocation of repayment costs. The Administrator will require new direct service industrial customers to pay a fee or surcharge for electric energy delivery until 2006. Wholesale power purchasers not entering into a contract after 2006 will pay an exit charge determined by the Administrator. The Administrator will establish fees, surcharges, and exit charges for direct service industrial customers and wholesale power purchasers to ensure equitable payment towards the Washington Public Power Supply System debt. These charges are in addition to the rates set in sections 7 and 8. SEC. 7. Rates for power sales by Bonneville Power Administration. Rates, Terms, and Conditions for the sale of electric energy by the Administration to its customers shall recover all costs incurred by the United States for generation and marketing, including meeting various responsibilities and requirements. Rates established under this section require Commission approval. The Commission must approve rates for the sale of electric energy by the Administration to ensure they meet requirements. Existing rates will remain unless determined inconsistent with regulations, in which case new rates will be established not exceeding market rates. The Commission must approve rates for the sale of electric energy by the Administration to ensure they meet requirements. New rates will be established not exceeding market rates in the Western System Coordinating Council. SEC. 8. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulation of Bonneville Power Administration transmission rates. The Bonneville Power Administration's transmission of electric energy is regulated by the Federal Power Act, with the Commission overseeing rates, terms, and conditions. Rates must cover all costs related to treaty, trust, and environmental responsibilities. The Bonneville Power Administration's transmission of electric energy is regulated by the Federal Power Act and overseen by the Commission. The financial system must separate costs related to transmission from power sales to ensure proper allocation of costs. Transmission rates are reviewed and approved by the Commission to recover only transmission-related costs. The Administrator may impose a transmission fee for cost recovery. The Commission must ensure no preference is given to the Administration for power transmission, except for specific purposes. The Administrator can adjust costs if reserves fall below $800,000,000 or if a 10-year forecast shows less than a 95 percent probability of meeting financial obligations. If the Administration has less than a 95 percent probability of meeting a payment to the United States Treasury, the Administrator must adjust wholesale power rates and implement cost recovery measures to correct the reserve deficiency within 5 years. This may include increasing wholesale rates up to the market rate for electricity in the Western System Coordinating Council and implementing a transmission fee if necessary to generate sufficient revenues. The Commission must approve, disapprove, or modify any transmission rate increase within 30 days. The increase must meet certain requirements and the Administrator must take steps to avoid it. The transmission fee should not exceed $100,000,000 a year."
