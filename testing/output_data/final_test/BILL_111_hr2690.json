The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Agriculture as defined in guidance issued under section 3(a). SEC. 3. THE SCHOOL-WIDE PAPERLESS FREE SCHOOL MEAL PROGRAM. The Secretary must implement the school-wide paperless free school meal program by July 1 following the final guidance publication. Draft guidance for local educational agencies and schools must be published for comment within 6 months of the Act's enactment. The Secretary will issue final guidance for the school meal program within 9 months of the Act's enactment. The guidance will outline how schools can demonstrate eligibility for free meals. The participation threshold is set at a minimum of 65 percent estimated eligibility rate for free meals. The Secretary will issue final guidance for the school meal program within 9 months of the Act's enactment, including an alternate method for determining estimated eligibility rates. The final guidance for the school meal program will include an alternate method for determining estimated eligibility rates, considering the number of students certified as eligible for free meals and those determined eligible based on household applications in the last 3 years. The final guidance for the school meal program will include data on income and poverty statistics from reliable sources such as the Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates program and the American Community Survey. The curr_chunk discusses data sources for determining eligibility for the school meal program, including the American Community Survey, determinations under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, and data from other means-tested programs. The curr_chunk discusses additional data sources deemed reliable by the Secretary for determining school meal program eligibility rates, including local educational agency-wide data. The guidance may include phone and door-to-door sampling to improve accuracy in determining school eligibility rates, with a requirement not exceeding a 95 percent confidence interval of plus or minus 2 percentage points. The Secretary shall issue guidance for local educational agencies to evaluate eligibility rates every 4 years in participating schools, with instructions on how to conduct the evaluation. The authority of each local education agency participating in the program under this Act is determined monthly based on the number of lunches and breakfasts served, multiplied by the estimated eligibility rate of enrolled students eligible for free meals and specific assistance factors. The calculation for determining the payment rate for free breakfasts and reduced price meals in schools involves multiplying the total number of meals served by the estimated eligibility rate of enrolled students and specific assistance factors. The payment rate for school meals is calculated by multiplying the number of students not eligible for free or reduced price lunches and breakfasts by the national average payment rates established under relevant acts. The payment rate for school meals is determined by multiplying the total number of lunches served in the school by the commodity assistance rate. The number of students not eligible for free or reduced price lunches is calculated by subtracting the number of free and reduced price lunches served from the total number of lunches. Similarly, the number of students not eligible for free or reduced price breakfasts is calculated in a similar manner. The price of breakfasts is determined by subtracting the number of free and reduced price breakfasts served in the school from the total number of breakfasts served. The Secretary must report to Congress within 2 years of program implementation, detailing the increase in students receiving free or reduced meals and recommending legislation to expand program eligibility. Appropriations are authorized as needed for program implementation."
