    "content": "The \"Human Cloning Prohibition Act of 2105\" may be cited as such. Congress finds that some individuals plan to clone human beings using somatic cell nuclear transfer, a technique used in animals. Scientists warn of the risks of producing stillborn or unhealthy children through cloning, which is considered unethical. Cloning represents a concerning shift towards manufacturing humans in laboratories to specific specifications. Cloning raises ethical concerns due to asexual reproduction, blurring parental roles, potential unauthorized reproduction, and creation of cloned embryos for research or treatment. The ethical concerns of human cloning include the creation of tissues for treatment, condemnation of creating life for exploitation, and the need for a ban on cloning to prevent the process at the beginning. The ethical concerns of human cloning include the creation of tissues for treatment and the need for a ban on cloning to prevent the process at the beginning. Cloning of DNA fragments, cell cloning, and embryo cloning of nonhuman animals are considered appropriate uses of medical technology. The Council of Europe has agreed on the prohibition of cloning human beings. The deliberate creation of genetically identical human beings is against human dignity and a misuse of biology and medicine. Collaborative efforts in human cloning impact international commerce. 23 countries, including Canada, France, and Germany, have banned human cloning. The United Nations has called for a ban on all human cloning. Cloned human embryos have been created in some cases for extracting embryonic stem cells. The creation of genetically identical human beings through human cloning is condemned as a misuse of biology and medicine. Cloned human embryos are being created to extract embryonic stem cells, raising concerns about the exploitation of women for human eggs and the potential for gestating cloned human embryos to birth. SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON HUMAN CLONING. Title 18, United States Code, amended to include CHAPTER 16--HUMAN CLONING. Sec. 301 defines human cloning as a form of asexual reproduction using nuclear material from a somatic cell. Sec. 302 prohibits human cloning in any form. The legislation prohibits human cloning, including performing, attempting, or participating in it, as well as importing or shipping the product of human cloning. Violators may face fines, imprisonment up to 10 years, or civil penalties. The legislation prohibits human cloning and imposes penalties, including a civil penalty of not less than $1,000,000 and not more than double the gross gain. Scientific research in areas not prohibited by the section is allowed, such as nuclear transfer or cloning techniques for non-human entities.
