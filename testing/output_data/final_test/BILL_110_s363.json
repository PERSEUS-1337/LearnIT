    "content": "The \"Hope Offered through Principled, Ethically-Sound Stem Cell Research Act\" or the \"HOPE Act\" aims to intensify research for improved understanding and treatments of diseases. It also promotes the derivation of pluripotent stem cell lines without creating or harming human embryos for research purposes. The \"HOPE Act\" defines key terms related to stem cell research, including altered nuclear transfer, biological artifact, direct reprogramming of adult cells, and embryo adoption. The \"HOPE Act\" defines terms related to stem cell research, including human embryo, embryonic stem cells derived from the inner cell mass, and in vitro fertilization. The \"HOPE Act\" defines terms related to stem cell research, including in vitro fertilization (union of egg and sperm outside the body), oocyte (unfertilized human egg cell), organismically dead embryo (irreversible loss of cellular capacity), pluripotent cell (can produce all cell types), and pluripotent stem cells (precursor cells capable of differentiation). The \"HOPE Act\" defines terms related to stem cell research, including precursor cells capable of perpetuating themselves and producing various cell types, a Review Board for oversight, and stem cell lines cultured for proliferation without differentiation. The \"HOPE Act\" defines terms related to stem cell research and establishes a Review Board for oversight. Additionally, it allows for the provision of federal funding. The Secretary conducts basic and applied research to develop techniques for pluripotent stem cells without creating or destroying human embryos for research purposes. Research on fetuses in utero is allowed under specific regulations, including methods using cells derived from altered nuclear transfer or organismically dead embryos. Other research methods include investigating pluripotent potential in adult stem cells and direct reprogramming of adult cells, as long as they do not harm human embryos and are certified by the Review Board. The Secretary must issue final guidelines within 90 days of enactment, providing direction for additional research involving human cells to ensure consistency with regulations. If research creates or harms embryos, it must be halted until reviewed by the Review Board. The Secretary must issue final guidelines within 90 days of enactment for research involving human cells to align with regulations. Research with the potential for clinical benefit should be prioritized, considering techniques outlined by the President's Council on Bioethics. An annual report on activities conducted under this section must be submitted to Congress. This section does not change the policy on stem cell line funding by the National Institutes of Health. The National STEM Cell Research Review Board is established. The National Stem Cell Research Review Board, established within the Department of Health and Human Services, is responsible for monitoring and prioritizing research for compliance with the Act, prioritizing research with potential benefits, ensuring fair consideration for funding, and completing duties in a timely manner. The board is composed of 11 individuals appointed by the Secretary, including scientists or physicians with relevant expertise. The National Stem Cell Research Review Board, established within the Department of Health and Human Services, is responsible for monitoring and prioritizing research for compliance with the Act. The board is composed of scientists, ethicists, legal experts, and community members who are objective and unaffiliated with the research institutions. The National Stem Cell Research Review Board, established within the Department of Health and Human Services, consists of members with remunerative relationships, who are familiar with the views and needs of research subjects, patients, and patient communities affected by stem cell research. Members serve 4-year terms to ensure continuity and diversity in appointments. The National Stem Cell Research Review Board members serve 4-year terms. Vacancies must be filled within 90 days. The Board ensures appropriate use of federal funds and does not disperse funds. Members who are US officers or employees do not receive compensation. The National Stem Cell Research Review Board members serve 4-year terms and vacancies must be filled within 90 days. US officers or employees on the Board do not receive compensation. Other members receive compensation not exceeding the daily equivalent of grade GS-15. The Board may appoint an Executive Secretary and staff to assist in carrying out its functions. SEC. 6. INFORMED CONSENT PROVISIONS. This section aims to ensure individuals can make voluntary and informed decisions about the use of human embryos or biological materials. Consent must be obtained in writing at the time of transfer to the research team. Donors must be informed that they can withdraw consent until materials are utilized in research. SEC. 7. PRIVACY. SEC. 7. PRIVACY. Provisions protecting individually identifiable information apply to donors under this Act. SEC. 8. PROHIBITION ON PROFITEERING FROM COMMERCE IN EMBRYOS, HUMAN OVUMS, OR EMBRYONIC STEM CELL LINES. The National Organ Transplant Act is amended to include human ovum, blastocyst, embryo, and stem cells derived from a human embryo. Additionally, the Public Health Service Act is amended to prohibit profits from therapies that destroy human embryos and sets requirements for research involving human embryos. The National Organ Transplant Act is amended to include human ovum, blastocyst, embryo, and stem cells derived from a human embryo. It is unlawful to receive valuable consideration for therapies using cells from a human embryo if the process destroyed the embryo. Funding for stem cell research is addressed in Section 9. The National Organ Transplant Act is amended to include funding of $5 billion from 2008 to 2017 for research and administrative costs related to human embryo adoption and genetic condition research. Research is funded to promote population health without harming human embryos and to improve clinical techniques to reduce unimplanted embryos after in vitro fertilization treatments."
