    "content": "The diminishment of Arctic sea ice has increased human activities in the region, leading to concerns about territorial disputes, commercial shipping, resource exploration, endangered species, and military operations. The United States, as an Arctic country, has significant interests in the region, and decisions made by Congress could impact these interests. This report provides an overview of Arctic-related issues for Congress to consider. The report does not track legislation on specific Arctic-related issues and provides multiple definitions of the Arctic region. Readers should be aware that different discussions may use varying definitions. The most common definition of the Arctic is the land and sea area north of the Arctic Circle. The Arctic Circle encompasses the land and sea area north of about 66.34 o North latitude. It includes the northernmost third of Alaska, the Chukchi Sea, and U.S. territorial waters. The area within the Arctic Circle is about 14.5 million square kilometers, or 5.6 million square miles, making up 2.8% of the world's surface. Around 4 million people, or 0.05% of the world's population, live in the Arctic region. Approximately 4 million people, or 0.05% of the world's population, live in the Arctic region. Russia's part of the Arctic is home to roughly 2 million people. Eight countries have territory north of the Arctic Circle, including the United States, Canada, Russia, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, and Iceland. These countries are known as the Arctic countries and are members of the Arctic Council. Five of these countries, including the United States, Canada, Russia, Norway, and Denmark, are considered Arctic coastal states according to the Arctic Research and Policy Act of 1984. The Arctic region includes all United States and foreign territory north of the Arctic Circle, as well as contiguous seas like the Arctic Ocean and the Beaufort, Bering, and Chukchi Seas. It also encompasses the Aleutian chain and certain parts of Alaska below the Arctic Circle. Different definitions of the Arctic are based on factors such as temperature, tree line, permafrost, sea ice, or administrative boundaries. The Arctic region is defined based on climate-related factors, such as the 10\u00b0C isotherm for the warmest month. This definition excludes some areas north of the Arctic Circle but includes others south of it. The Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme defines the Arctic as areas north of the Arctic Circle and specific latitudes in Asia. The Arctic region is defined based on climate-related factors, such as the 10\u00b0C isotherm for the warmest month. This definition includes marine areas north of the Arctic Circle and specific latitudes in Asia and North America. Some observers use the term \"high north\" to refer to the Arctic, distinguishing between the colder high Arctic closer to the North Pole and the less cold low Arctic or subarctic regions. Alaska, as an Arctic country, has significant interests in the region despite being geographically separated. Alaska has significant interests in the Arctic region, despite being geographically separated. A research paper found that Americans mildly disagree with the assertion of U.S. Arctic identity, with an average rating of 3.51 on a scale of 1 to 7. Men and older individuals are more inclined to agree with Arctic identity. Men and older individuals, compared to women and younger respondents, are more likely to agree with the assertion of Arctic identity and interests. Alaskans show significantly greater agreement, while Canadians have a stronger sense of being an Arctic nation than Americans. Americans also feel more like a Pacific nation than an Arctic one. The Arctic Research and Policy Act of 1984 provides for a national policy on research needs in the Arctic. The Arctic Research and Policy Act of 1984 established the U.S. Arctic Research Commission and designated the National Science Foundation as the lead federal agency for Arctic research policy. It also created the Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee to develop a national Arctic research policy. NSF is requesting $534.5 million for its Office of Polar Programs for FY2019, a 30.6% increase from FY2018. Within this amount, $113.56 million is allocated for research in the Arctic and Antarctic, a 2.7% increase from FY2018. Additionally, $39.33 million is designated for Arctic research and support logistics, an 8.9% increase from FY2018.

NSF provides $39.33 million for Arctic Research Support and Logistics, supporting science in the Arctic Sciences section. Funding goes to grantees or key organizations for research support and logistics services, including access to icebreakers, airlift support, field stations, safety training, satellite phones, and observatories. Arctic Sciences personnel support merit-reviewed research proposals in various disciplines. The George W. Bush Administration released a presidential directive on January 12, 2009, establishing a new U.S. policy for the Arctic region, superseding a 1994 directive. The directive recognizes the United States as an Arctic nation with interests in the region and outlines a six-element policy for the Arctic. The Obama Administration released a national security strategy document in May 2010, stating the United States' broad interests in the Arctic region, including national security, environmental protection, resource management, indigenous communities, scientific research, and international cooperation. The Obama Administration released the National Strategy for the Arctic Region in May 2013 to address challenges and opportunities in the Arctic due to sea ice diminishment. This strategy defines U.S. national security interests in the region and aims to enhance international cooperation. The National Strategy for the Arctic Region, released in 2013, focuses on U.S. national security interests in the Arctic, aiming to enhance international cooperation and address challenges posed by sea ice diminishment. The strategy outlines three key lines of effort to advance U.S. security interests in the region. The National Strategy for the Arctic Region, released in 2013, focuses on U.S. national security interests in the Arctic, aiming to enhance international cooperation and address challenges posed by sea ice diminishment. It outlines three key lines of effort: infrastructure and capabilities for U.S. security in the Arctic, responsible stewardship of the Arctic environment and resources, and strengthening international cooperation through bilateral and multilateral arrangements. The approach to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (Law of the Sea Convention) in the Arctic region focuses on safeguarding peace and stability, making decisions based on current science and traditional knowledge, and fostering innovative partnerships with various stakeholders. The Obama Administration released an implementation plan for the May 2013 national strategy for the Arctic region, focusing on developing capabilities, consulting with Alaska Natives, and collaborating with various stakeholders to address the changing Arctic environment. The Implementation Plan for the Arctic region focuses on national interests in safety, security, and environmental protection, aligning with international partners to address climate change. It follows the Strategy's three lines of effort: advancing US security interests, responsible Arctic stewardship, and strengthening international cooperation. The plan emphasizes the impacts of climate change on the global population and Alaska residents in the Arctic. The Implementation Plan for the Arctic region emphasizes aligning implementation activities with the Executive Order on Preparing the United States for the Impacts of Climate Change. It highlights the importance of fostering partnerships with Arctic stakeholders, including the State of Alaska and Alaska Natives, to address emerging challenges and opportunities in the Arctic environment. The Federal Government should maintain communication and cooperation with the State of Alaska to support national priorities. The Implementation Plan for the Arctic region emphasizes aligning activities with the Executive Order on Climate Change. It aims to foster partnerships with Arctic stakeholders and coordinate activities across Federal bodies. The plan outlines 36 specific initiatives with objectives, next steps, progress measurement, and lead agencies. The Obama Administration released three documents on the national strategy implementation on March 9, 2016. The Obama Administration released three documents on the implementation of the national strategy for the Arctic in 2015, including a progress report, an implementation framework, and a summary of accomplishments and priorities. Executive Order 13689 was issued on January 21, 2015, to enhance coordination of national efforts in the Arctic as the United States assumed the Chairmanship of the Arctic Council. The Obama Administration released documents in 2015 to implement the national strategy for the Arctic. An Executive Order was issued to enhance coordination of national efforts in the Arctic. A Steering Committee was established to provide guidance and coordinate Federal Arctic policies. The Steering Committee, in coordination with relevant agencies, will meet quarterly to oversee implementation of Arctic policies and ensure coordination of Federal activities. They will provide guidance on implementing priorities identified in national directives and agency plans. The Steering Committee, along with relevant agencies, will meet regularly to oversee Arctic policy implementation and coordinate Federal activities. They will prioritize activities, establish a working group to enhance coordination, and address any gaps in implementation by May 1, 2015. Collaboration with Alaska stakeholders is crucial for transparency and effectiveness. The Steering Committee will facilitate consultation and partnerships with Alaska Native tribal governments, organizations, and stakeholders to improve coordination and information sharing on Arctic issues. They will ensure meaningful tribal consultation and collaboration in the development of Federal policies with Alaska Native implications. The Executive Order established an Arctic Executive Steering Committee to provide guidance on Federal Arctic policies, coordinate with State, local, and Alaska Native tribal governments, and invite consultation from various entities. The AESC was established to guide Federal Arctic policies and coordinate with various entities. The Trump administration left the committee dormant for two years, while the Obama administration appointed Admiral Robert J. Papp Jr. as the first U.S. Special Representative for the Arctic. Papp's duties included interacting with ambassadors from other countries in the Arctic region. The Arctic Council was created in 1996 to promote cooperation among Arctic States and indigenous communities on issues like sustainable development and environmental protection. The council addresses regional development, emergency response, climate change, and natural resource extraction, excluding military security. The position of U.S. Special Representative for the Arctic has been vacant since January 20, 2017. The Arctic Council, established in 1996, focuses on sustainable development and environmental protection in the Arctic region. It excludes military security. The council's Secretariat became operational in 2013 in Troms\u00f8, Norway. Its membership includes eight countries with territory in the Arctic Circle: the United States, Canada, Russia, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Denmark (Greenland). Additionally, six organizations representing Arctic indigenous peoples have Permanent Participant status for active participation and consultation within the council. The Arctic Council, established in 1996, focuses on sustainable development and environmental protection in the Arctic region. Thirteen observer states and organizations have been approved, including Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, the United Kingdom, France, Spain, China, India, Italy, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and Switzerland. The council's work is carried out in six working groups focusing on various Arctic issues. The Arctic Council rotates chairmanship among member states every two years. The United States held the chairmanship from 2015 to 2017, with John Kerry leading the team during the Obama Administration. The chairmanship was then transferred to Finland in 2017. Finland's chairmanship program in the Arctic Council focuses on climate change and meeting the Paris emissions targets. The council does not have the authority to enforce its guidelines, assessments, or recommendations, as each Arctic State is responsible for implementation. The Arctic Council's mandate excludes military security. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea governs activities on the world's oceans. The US is not a party to the convention. Part VI of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea establishes sovereign jurisdiction over the resources of the continental shelf, allowing coastal states to extend their shelf limit beyond 200 nautical miles with scientific data submission to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf for review and approval. Coastal states agree to establish outer limits of their continental shelf in accordance with this process and their national laws. The Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf reviews and approves submissions from coastal states to extend their shelf limit. Disagreements can lead to revised submissions. The limits set by a coastal state based on the commission's recommendations are final. The U.S., as a nonparty to UNCLOS, has limitations in participating in the commission. Becoming a party to UNCLOS would enhance international recognition. Becoming a party to UNCLOS would help the United States maximize international recognition and legal certainty regarding the outer limits of the U.S. continental shelf. Customary international law, as reflected in UNCLOS, confers rights and obligations on coastal states relating to the continental shelf. The International Court of Justice has declared Article 76(1) to have the status of customary international law. Article 76(1) states that the continental shelf extends to \"the outer edge of the continental margin or to a distance of 200 nautical miles,\" whichever is further. The detailed rules for determining the outer limits of the continental shelf are set forth in paragraphs 2 through 7 of Article 76. The United States, like other countries, uses provisions to determine its continental shelf limits under customary international law. The commission's mandate is to make recommendations on the outer limits of the continental shelf, not as a claims process. Continental shelf entitlement exists as a matter of fact and does not require explicit claims. The commission's process is crucial for obtaining international recognition and legal certainty of the outer limits. The United States has potentially overlapping extended continental shelf areas with Russia and Canada in the Arctic. A maritime boundary agreement was reached with Russia in 1990, but has not been fully approved. Russia has respected the agreement in determining its extended continental shelf limits. Canada and the United States have not established a maritime boundary in the Arctic yet. Canada and the United States have not established a maritime boundary in the Arctic yet. Both countries are cooperating to define their continental shelf in the Arctic Ocean. The extent of overlapping areas will be determined in the future, and the maritime boundary will be addressed bilaterally. The United States has been actively involved in collecting data for its extended continental shelf since 2001 through the Extended Continental Shelf Project. The Extended Continental Shelf Project began in 2007 to define the Arctic shelf. Some suggest a new legal regime for the Arctic due to unforeseen circumstances under UNCLOS. Others propose designating the Arctic above a certain parallel as a wilderness area, similar to the Antarctic Treaty. Supporters of UNCLOS argue that the United States should join the convention to protect its national interests in the Arctic. The Obama Administration's plan includes an initiative to seek Senate approval for accession to UNCLOS. The formation of a Senate Arctic Caucus was announced by Senators Lisa Murkowski and Angus King to discuss America's future in the Arctic as the nation prepares to accede to the Chair of the Arctic Council. Record low Arctic sea ice extents in recent years have raised concerns about climate change and the potential for ice-free summers in the Arctic by the 2030s, opening up opportunities for transport, resource extraction, fishing, and tourism. The changing climate in the Arctic, including warming temperatures, melting permafrost, and shifting animal populations, is expected to impact traditional livelihoods, cultures, and the survival of polar bear populations. These changes also raise risks of pollution, food supply issues, safety concerns, cultural losses, and national security threats. Additionally, there are linkages between warming Arctic conditions and extreme weather events in mid-latitude continents, such as heat waves, fires, severe winters, and monsoons. This suggests important implications locally and across the Hemisphere. The Arctic has experienced significant warming since the 1970s, with temperatures now 1.8 o F warmer than the climate normal. Scientists attribute this warming to human-related greenhouse gas emissions, which are expected to continue even after stabilization. The polar amplification in the Arctic may lead to irreversible changes. The Arctic has seen warming since the 1970s due to human-related greenhouse gas emissions. This has led to reduced sea ice extent, thickness, and perennial ice. Natural climate variability has also played a role in record low ice extents in 2007 and 2012. Factors like warm Arctic temperatures, moist winds, and storms have accelerated ice melt rates. Modeling GHG-induced climate change in the Arctic is challenging. Modeling of GHG-induced climate change in the Arctic projects consistent warming through the 21st century, with temperature increases ranging from +1\u00b0 to +9.0\u00b0 C. Some models suggest localized cooling in the North Atlantic Ocean near Greenland and Iceland. Most warming is expected in autumn and winter, with little change in summer temperatures over the Arctic Ocean. Scientists predict the Arctic will transition to an ice-free ocean in summers by the late 2030s, with thinner, more fragile ice cover. The Arctic region's ice cover is becoming thinner, more fragile, and regionally variable. Arctic coastal states are making submissions to the Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf to claim sovereign control over oil and gas reserves. Russia is attempting to show that the underwater Lomonosov Ridge is an extension of its continental margin. In 2001, Russia's submission regarding the Lomonosov Ridge in the Arctic Ocean was rejected. Canada also claims part of the ridge as its continental shelf. In 2007, a Russian submersible placed a flag at the North Pole, but it was seen as a symbolic act with no legal effect. In 2008, Arctic coastal states reaffirmed their commitment to the UNCLOS legal framework for establishing continental shelf limits in the Arctic. In the Arctic, there are unresolved territorial disputes and jurisdictional questions related to the Northwest Passage. Canada predicts reduced ice pack, allowing for increased shipping traffic. Ottawa claims the passage as sovereign Canadian territory, while the US and others argue it is an international strait. Negotiations are ongoing between the US and Canada in the Beaufort Sea, and an agreement was reached with Russia in 1990 regarding the Bering Sea. In 1990, the US and Russia signed an agreement on the Bering Sea, but Russia has not approved it. Denmark and Canada dispute Hans Island's territorial rights. Norway and Russia have a longstanding disagreement over the \"Grey Zone\" in the Barents Sea. On September 15, 2010, Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev signed an agreement in Murmansk, dividing a resource-rich area between the two countries. The accord includes fishing rights and joint development of oil and gas reserves. Russia's concession of sovereignty over the area to Norway is seen as significant by some, while others believe Moscow may seek Norwegian cooperation in offshore resource development. Canada's commitment to sovereignty, economic development, environmental protection, and empowerment in the Arctic region is emphasized. Negotiations with the United States and Denmark over boundary disputes are a top priority. Despite disagreements, Canada and Denmark are collaborating on Arctic issues, including a memorandum of understanding on defense cooperation. The melting Arctic ice presents opportunities for a shorter route from the Atlantic to Asia. The melting of Arctic ice could create a shorter shipping route between major trading blocs, benefiting countries like China, Japan, and South Korea. This could lead to lower shipping costs and make their products more competitive. Two potential trans-Arctic routes could open up, including the Northern Sea Route along Russia's northern border. The Northern Sea Route (NSR) along Russia's northern border was opened for transit by foreign vessels in 1991. Russia aims to reserve oil and gas transport along the NSR for Russian-flagged ships. The Northwest Passage (NWP) through the Canadian Arctic Islands offers potential trade routes, with the southern route through Peel Sound being open in recent summers, while the more direct northern route through McClure Strait is prone to ice blockage. The Northwest Passage (NWP) is less commercially viable than the NSR for trade between northeast Asia and northeast North America. Cargo ship transits are rare, with more activity from cruise vessels and research ships. Most cargo ship traffic in the Arctic is regional, transporting natural resources or supplies to communities and extraction facilities. Recent uptick in Arctic shipping is due to commodity prices, not just melting ice. NSR remains the primary route for Arctic shipping. Arctic waters can be open to shipping even with ice present. One-year ice is thinner and easier to break up by icebreakers. However, melting ice has led to unpredictable ice flows in potential sea lanes, with multiyear ice and icebergs posing obstacles. The source of multiyear ice is not expected to diminish despite climate change, making forecasting ice block patterns challenging. Lack of ice in summer months can still hinder shipping in the Arctic. The unpredictability of ice conditions in the Arctic poses a major hindrance for trans-Arctic shipping, especially for container ships carrying thousands of containers. Cruise ships can adjust their routes based on ice conditions, but container ships must adhere to strict schedules for loading and unloading cargo. The presence of ice and adverse weather conditions in the Arctic pose challenges for shipping, affecting schedules and increasing operating costs. Ships carrying bulk commodities may have more flexibility, but the risks of navigating Arctic waters are significant. Ice, storms, intense cold, and heavy fog are common obstacles, requiring specialized equipment like icebreakers for safe passage. The Arctic shipping route presents challenges due to ice and adverse weather conditions, requiring icebreakers to create a path for ships. Using smaller vessels could reduce costs but increase fuel consumption and limit the shipping season to a few weeks. These factors may offset the savings of a shorter route, making trans-Arctic shipping costly and requiring significant investment in infrastructure. To facilitate Arctic shipping, vessel captains would rely on marine surveys and satellite images due to the impracticality of using visual aids like buoys in shifting ice conditions. Aviation reconnaissance and updated charts are necessary, along with ship-to-shore communication infrastructure and refueling stations. Developing a pool of mariners with ice navigation experience and calculating risk premiums for polar routes are essential steps for successful Arctic shipping. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Alaska studied the feasibility of a deep-draft port in the Arctic to accommodate larger vessels for commercial maritime traffic. Currently, vessels with drafts over 20 feet must sail considerable distances to reach Arctic duty stations. A deep-draft port could serve as a base of operations for these vessels, facilitating Arctic shipping. The study identified Nome or Port Clarence as potential deepening sites for Arctic maritime traffic. The Coast Guard prefers mobile assets and seasonal bases over a permanent port. The U.S. Committee on the Marine Transportation System prioritized infrastructure improvements for Arctic navigation in a 2013 report. Maritime trading nations have adopted international treaties through the International Maritime Organization (IMO) to establish standards for ocean carriers in safety, pollution prevention, and security. Key conventions include SOLAS, MARPOL, and SCTW, which the 168 IMO member nations have adopted. The United States enforces these standards through the U.S. Coast Guard. The U.S. Coast Guard enforces international maritime conventions for ships arriving at U.S. ports and those sailing under the U.S. flag. Many ship owners register their vessels in countries with favorable tax and regulatory regimes, leading to enforcement of regulations by port states. The fragmented nature of ship ownership and operation can pose challenges to regulatory enforcement. A new IMO polar code came into effect on January 1, 2017, supplementing existing regulations for ships operating in ice-infested waters. The code applies to passenger and cargo ships of 500 gross tons or more engaged in international voyages, aiming to improve safety and prevent pollution in the polar regions. The IMO polar code, in effect since January 1, 2017, applies to passenger and cargo ships over 500 gross tons in polar regions. It aims to enhance safety and prevent pollution by regulating ship construction, equipment, crew training, and operation. Nations can impose additional requirements on ships in their ports or coastal waters. U.S. Coast Guard regulations align with IMO conventions but may have extra mandates. Canada and Russia have stricter pollution rules for Arctic waters. The U.S. Coast Guard is seeking IMO approval for a vessel traffic separation scheme in the Bering Strait, with over 400 transits annually. Decreases in summer polar ice may impact oil, gas, and mineral exploration in the Arctic. Offshore of Alaska, the U.S. outer continental shelf covers vast areas with high potential for oil and gas. Harsh conditions in the Arctic, especially in winter, make infrastructure development costly and challenging for oil, gas, and mineral extraction. Severe weather hinders ongoing offshore operations and exploration efforts. Efforts to map the margins of the U.S. OCS are intensified due to shrinking sea ice cover in the Arctic. Mapping projects are underway to delineate continental margins beyond the 200 nautical mile EEZ for potential development of submerged lands rich in oil, gas, methane hydrates, and minerals. Shrinking glaciers could expose land with economic mineral deposits, while melting permafrost poses challenges to oil, gas, and mineral activities. The melting permafrost in the Arctic poses challenges to oil, gas, and mineral activities by compromising ground structures like pipelines and infrastructure. Warmer temperatures also shorten ice road transport seasons, creating transportation challenges. The shrinking Arctic ice cap has increased interest in exploring for offshore oil and gas, with reduced sea ice allowing for longer exploration periods and a longer summer window for offshore drilling. The summer window for offshore Arctic drilling is extended due to shrinking sea ice, increasing the chances of making oil and gas discoveries. Interest in Arctic resources was boosted by a 2008 USGS report estimating significant undiscovered oil and gas reserves north of the Arctic Circle. The report suggested that the Arctic may hold 90 billion barrels of oil, 1,700 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, and 44 billion barrels of natural gas liquids. Additionally, Science magazine indicated that a substantial portion of the world's undiscovered oil and gas reserves could be located in the Arctic region. Gas and 13% of the world's undiscovered oil may be found north of the Arctic Circle. The Alaska portions of the U.S. OCS contain approximately 27 billion barrels of oil and 131 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Offshore oil and gas exploration in the Arctic could help sustain domestic supplies. Severe weather and sea ice pose challenges to exploration. Infrastructure is needed to extract and transport any new oil and gas deposits. The Trump Administration aims to promote offshore development in the Arctic region by scheduling lease sales in all 15 Alaska planning areas, including the Beaufort Sea and Chukchi Sea. Currently, only the Beaufort Sea has producing wells in federal waters, with the Cook Inlet also having active federal leases. The Obama Administration's leasing program for 2017-2022 governs current lease sales on the Alaska OCS. Infrastructure is crucial for extracting and transporting petroleum in the region. The Trump Administration plans to promote offshore development in the Arctic region by scheduling lease sales in all 15 Alaska planning areas, including the Beaufort Sea and Chukchi Sea. Currently, only the Beaufort Sea has producing wells in federal waters, with the Cook Inlet also having active federal leases. Industry activities in the region have fluctuated due to changing oil prices, development costs, and regulations. For example, Shell Oil Company ceased exploration in offshore Alaska in 2015 citing reasons such as insufficient indications of oil and gas, high exploration costs, and a challenging regulatory environment. Companies also relinquished over 90% of leases in the Beaufort and Chukchi Sea planning areas between February and November 2016 due to a slump in oil prices. In late 2018, there was no activity in the Chukchi Sea planning area, but recent developments show increased industry interest. The Trump Administration approved drilling permits in the Beaufort Sea, and BOEM granted approval for an oil and gas development plan in the region. Concerns about industry response to potential oil spills in the Arctic have influenced federal regulations. In July 2016, BOEM and BSEE released final safety regulations for Arctic exploratory drilling, including requirements for companies to reduce oil spill risks. Some opposed the regulations as burdensome, while others felt they didn't go far enough in protecting the environment. President Trump ordered a review of the regulations in 2017, leading to rule revisions in 2018. In 2018, the Department of the Interior announced rule revisions for Arctic drilling. Legislation in the 115th Congress aimed to repeal or codify the Obama Administration's Arctic rule. Concerns about oil and gas activities led to bans on leasing in sensitive Arctic areas by Congress and the President. President Obama reinstated a moratorium in the North Aleutian Basin, withdrawing acreage from oil and gas leasing eligibility. In December 2016, he also withdrew other large portions of the U.S. Arctic from leasing disposition. President Obama withdrew large portions of the U.S. Arctic from leasing, including the Chukchi Sea and Beaufort Sea planning areas. President Trump's Executive Order 13795 opened these areas for leasing consideration, except for the North Aleutian Basin. Nations bordering the Arctic Ocean are mapping their continental margins beyond the 200-mile EEZ limit. Several Arctic border countries, including the Russian Federation, have conducted complex investigations to support submissions for an extended continental shelf in the Arctic to the Commission. Russia's 2001 submission included the Lomonosov Ridge as an extension of its continental margin, spanning from Russia to Canada. Russia submitted a revised claim in 2015 to extend its continental shelf in the Arctic, including the Lomonosov Ridge and Mendeleev Rise. The Commission has not made a decision on this submission. The United States is also gathering data for a potential submission through the Extended Continental Shelf Project, assisting multiple countries in delineating their extended continental shelves. Canada and the United States have overlapping regions of the seabed as part of their extended continental margins. The United States and Canada are collecting data to delineate their extended continental shelves in the Arctic. The data will help establish maritime boundaries and determine overlap in the seabed. Russia also has potentially overlapping areas with the United States, but has not asserted its extended continental shelf in those regions. A warming Arctic presents new opportunities and challenges for mineral exploration onshore. Receding glaciers expose land with economic mineral deposits previously hidden under ice. Longer summers extend exploration seasons, allowing for easier transportation of equipment and ore. However, mining infrastructure relying on permafrost may become unstable with warmer temperatures. Mining in the Arctic faces challenges with melting permafrost and economic viability. Some believe mining could offer better long-term development opportunities than oil and gas due to a larger workforce and longer project lifetimes. However, uncertainties exist regarding environmental changes and risks associated with industrial activity in the region. Warmer temperatures are shortening ice road transport seasons, impacting infrastructure for resource development. Climate change impacts in the Arctic are shortening ice road transport seasons, creating transportation challenges, and stimulating human activities in the region. The decline of sea ice and retreating glaciers have increased the risk of oil pollution, with concerns about a potential large oil spill. Recent economic activities like oil and gas exploration and tourism have heightened the risk of pollution in the Arctic region. The potential impacts of an Arctic spill on Arctic species and ecosystems are severe. Human activity levels in the region determine the risk of oil pollution. Climate changes may increase access to resources and shipping lanes but logistical challenges could hinder activity. Unpredictable ice conditions may discourage trans-Arctic shipping, a significant factor in the risk of oil pollution. Oil tankers, carrying millions of gallons of oil, have caused many large spills in recent decades. The level of trans-Arctic shipping is uncertain, but oil exploration is expected to increase. Oil exploration and extraction activities are expected to intensify in the Arctic region, leading to potential oil spills. The largest unintentional oil spill in recent history was the 2010 Deepwater Horizon incident in the Gulf of Mexico, releasing approximately 200 million gallons of crude oil over 87 days. The second-largest spill was the IXTOC I incident in 1979, with an estimated 140 million gallons spilled due to an oil well blowout in Mexican Gulf Coast waters. Prior to the Deepwater Horizon incident, the spill record for offshore platforms in U.S. federal waters had shown improvement. The potential risks of oil and gas activities in Alaska's North Slope are being compared to the Deepwater Horizon incident in the Gulf of Mexico. Some argue that the analyses should consider the 2010 Gulf oil spill, while others believe Arctic operations pose less risk due to shallower waters and lower pressures. Shell Oil has stated that pressures in the Chukchi Sea would be significantly lower than those in the Gulf oil spill. Oil spills and accidents are likely to occur even with stringent control systems. No spill is entirely benign, with even minor spills causing harm to organisms and populations. Marine mammals, birds, bottom-dwelling species, and organisms in early stages are especially vulnerable. The effects of spills can vary greatly, lasting from days to decades, with potential long-term harm in Arctic ecosystems. Oil spills in Arctic ecosystems may have long-lasting effects on plant life through their root systems. The impact on unique Arctic species' ability to thrive in cold environments and the potential for increased toxicity due to temperature changes are not well understood. Studies suggest that oil spills in high-latitude, cold-ocean environments could cause more damage than expected, with concerns that oil persistence in the Arctic may be underestimated. Wildlife population recovery in the Arctic may be slower due to longer life spans and slower reproduction rates. Climate change in the Arctic is expected to increase human activities, posing a higher risk of oil pollution, particularly from spills. Conditions in the Arctic present unique challenges for oil spill response and cleanup efforts, with concerns about the response gap for spills in the region. Response time is critical as spilled oil becomes harder to track and contain in icy conditions. Stakeholders worry about logistical challenges in areas without proper equipment or trained professionals. The response gap for oil spills in the Arctic region is a significant concern due to limited infrastructure. The lack of designated air stations and limited vessel infrastructure in the northern Arctic latitudes poses challenges for oil spill response activities. In situ burning and dispersant application methods may be restricted in this remote region. Recovery methods like in situ burning and dispersant application may be hindered in the Arctic due to limited logistical support and infrastructure. Reports have identified obstacles such as inadequate ocean and weather information, as well as communication technology issues. Past oil spill responses in the Aleutian Islands have shown minimal oil recovery, highlighting concerns for potential spills in the Arctic region. The 2014 NRC report highlights challenges in responding to oil spills in cold and icy waters, where weather conditions can hinder response efforts. Oil weathering processes are slowed down in colder temperatures, allowing more time for response strategies like in situ burning or skimming, but also increasing the risk of prolonged exposure in the ecosystem. Further study is recommended in understanding oil spill behavior in arctic climates. The 2014 report highlights challenges in responding to oil spills in Arctic conditions, such as low temperatures, darkness in winter, oil encapsulation under ice, and reduced effectiveness of containment systems. The existing governance framework for maritime operations in the Arctic lacks legally binding requirements. The governance framework for maritime operations in the Arctic lacks legally binding requirements, despite provisions in international conventions. The Arctic Council signed an Agreement on Cooperation on Marine Oil Pollution Preparedness and Response in 2013 to enhance coordination and assistance in oil spill response. Additionally, the United States has bilateral agreements with Canada and Russia for oil spill response operations. The United States has bilateral agreements with Canada and Russia for oil spill response operations in Arctic waters. The agreement with Canada, established in 1974 for the Great Lakes, has been amended to include Arctic waters. The U.S.-Russian agreement, made in 1989, has not been tested as extensively as the U.S.-Canada agreement. Climate change effects in the Arctic are altering marine ecosystems, impacting living marine resources. The central Arctic Ocean's resources are becoming more accessible to commercial fishing due to environmental changes. Large commercial fisheries already exist in the Arctic, prompting fishery managers to support precautionary approaches to fisheries management in the region. Congress passed a joint resolution (P.L. 110-243) in response to uncertainties related to these changes. Congress passed a joint resolution (P.L. 110-243) in 2008 to initiate international discussions for managing migratory and transboundary fish stocks in the Arctic Ocean. International cooperation is crucial due to shared fish stocks among Arctic rim nations and the need for coordination in managing fish populations that move across national jurisdictional zones and high seas. In 2009, the National Marine Fisheries Service implemented the North Pacific Council's Fishery Management Plan for the Arctic Management Area, prohibiting commercial fishing initially and moving boundaries of crab fisheries. Five nations signed a declaration in 2015 to prevent unregulated commercial fishing in the central Arctic Ocean. The five nations signed a declaration in 2015 to prevent unregulated commercial fishing in the central Arctic Ocean due to limited scientific knowledge of marine resources in the region. Interim measures include authorizing vessels to fish in the high seas area under established management organizations, conducting joint scientific research, and promoting compliance with international law. The declaration signed in 2015 aims to prevent unregulated commercial fishing in the central Arctic Ocean by coordinating monitoring activities, ensuring noncommercial fishing is based on scientific advice, and involving indigenous peoples. Future management may involve China, the EU, Iceland, Japan, and South Korea, but Iceland has been excluded from consultations. The establishment of an Arctic Ocean regional fishery management organization is still uncertain. The potential establishment of an Arctic Ocean regional fishery management organization is uncertain, with questions surrounding which countries would be involved and the development of commercial fisheries in the central Arctic Ocean. Concerns exist about how this development could impact threatened and endangered species like the polar bear and Pacific walrus, both of which heavily rely on thick sea ice during their life cycles. The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) listed the southern distinct population segment (DPS) of spotted seals as threatened on October 22, 2010. They also proposed listing four subspecies of ringed seals and two DPS of one subspecies of bearded seal as threatened on December 10, 2010. The shrinking Arctic ice cap is impacting species like bears and walruses, which heavily rely on thick sea ice during their life cycles. The rapid environmental changes make it challenging for species with specific adaptations to respond effectively. The Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) safeguards whales, seals, walruses, and polar bears from harmful human actions that could lead to extinction. It establishes a moratorium on the \"taking\" of marine mammals in U.S. waters and on the high seas, including the Arctic. Once a terrestrial species reaches the Arctic Ocean, it has no more northern or colder habitat available, making it vulnerable to rapid environmental changes. The Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) safeguards whales, seals, walruses, and polar bears from harmful human actions that could lead to extinction. It allows U.S. citizens to obtain authorization for taking small numbers of mammals incidental to activities like offshore oil and gas exploration, with monitoring requirements and conditions. Indigenous peoples in the Arctic have developed specialized cultures and economies based on the region's conditions. Indigenous populations in the Arctic have undergone significant changes in their lifestyles and economies due to trade, population influx, and climate change. There is a growing demand for international recognition and broader rights among Arctic indigenous peoples, who have diverse cultures and speak multiple languages. They have been present in the Arctic for over 10,000 years, predating European arrival. Before European arrival, Arctic indigenous peoples lived off hunting, fishing, herding reindeer, and gathering. Their knowledge of Arctic wildlife and environments is foundational to their cultures. Contact with Europeans began in the 9th century in Fennoscandia and progressed west-to-east across northern Asia, reaching northeastern Arctic Asia by the 17th century. North American Arctic indigenous peoples' contact with Europeans started in Labrador in the 16th century and in Alaska. Contact with Europeans in the Arctic started in the 16th century in Labrador and Alaska, and in the late 10th century in Greenland. This led to significant changes in indigenous economies, cultures, and populations, especially in the 20th century. Life expectancy among Alaska Natives has increased, but they still lag behind the overall U.S. population. Most Arctic indigenous peoples have become minorities in their countries' Arctic regions. Around 2003, approximately 10% of the 3.7 million Arctic population were indigenous. Many Arctic indigenous communities rely on traditional activities like hunting and fishing, but some have shifted to wage employment. The impact of climate change on Arctic indigenous peoples is influenced by subsistence economics and globalization. Political structures and relationships with national governments vary among Arctic indigenous groups. Arctic indigenous groups have unique governance structures within national frameworks, with varying levels of control over land and resources. Their political relationships with national and local governments play a significant role in responses to Arctic climate change, which is expected to impact their economies, population, health, and cultures. Changes in the Arctic climate will impact the population, health, and cultures of indigenous peoples. Sea ice, permafrost, and weather changes will affect traditional subsistence activities, leading to food insecurity and health risks. Infrastructure damage and erosion are also increasing due to these environmental changes. Permafrost changes have damaged infrastructure and increased erosion in Alaska, leading to flooding and threats to Native villages. Congress funded the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to assess erosion risks in 178 communities, with many villages needing to relocate due to imminent threats. However, barriers such as difficulties in finding new sites and eligibility for federal programs have impeded relocation efforts. The Alaska Federation of Natives has requested Congress to mitigate flooding and erosion in Native villages and fund relocation where necessary. Senator Lisa Murkowski acknowledges the extraordinary cost of mitigating flooding and erosion in Alaska Native villages and funding relocation when necessary. Economic activities such as oil, gas, mineral exploration, forestry, and tourism are expected to increase, providing economic opportunities for Arctic residents, including indigenous peoples. However, there is a conflicting desire between combating climate change and embracing economic growth through foreign investment among Arctic indigenous people. Some health problems in indigenous communities may worsen with Arctic climate change due to increased pollution and exposure to contaminants. Warmer temperatures could lead to more insect- and wildlife-borne diseases, while changes in water systems may increase waterborne diseases. Climate change may also impact Arctic indigenous cultures, causing mental stress and behavioral issues. Indigenous peoples are responding to these challenges through international activities and advocacy. The rise of solidarity among indigenous peoples organizations in the Arctic region is significant for policy issues. Six national or international indigenous organizations are permanent participants of the Arctic Council. Advocacy by Arctic indigenous people led to the adoption of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in 2007. In 2009, the Inuit Circumpolar Council hosted the Indigenous Peoples Global Summit on Climate Change, highlighting accelerating climate change caused by unsustainable development. In 2009, the Inuit Circumpolar Council highlighted accelerating climate change caused by unsustainable development and called for a greater indigenous role in climate change decisions. The U.S. Coast Guard is responsible for polar icebreaking operations to support scientific research, defend U.S. sovereignty in the Arctic, and monitor U.S. interests in polar regions. The U.S. Coast Guard conducts various missions in Arctic waters, including monitoring sea traffic, search and rescue operations, law enforcement, and protection of marine resources. Their polar icebreakers support National Science Foundation research activities in both the Arctic and Antarctic regions, with a focus on resupplying McMurdo Station in Antarctica. The U.S. Antarctic research station at McMurdo Sound is resupplied by the Coast Guard's icebreakers, Polar Star and Healy. Polar Star breaks ice near Antarctica during the southern hemisphere summer and returns to Seattle for maintenance. The annual McMurdo resupply mission presents the greatest icebreaking challenge for U.S. polar icebreakers. Healy primarily operates in the Arctic. The medium polar icebreaker, Healy, primarily operates in the Arctic supporting NSF research activities and other operations. Despite diminishing polar ice due to climate change, the need for U.S. polar icebreakers is expected to persist, with potential increased mission demands. Changing ice conditions in Antarctic waters have made the McMurdo resupply mission more challenging since 2000. The U.S. polar icebreaking fleet consists of one heavy polar icebreaker, Polar Star, and one medium polar icebreaker, Healy. The Coast Guard's second heavy polar icebreaker, Polar Sea, has been nonoperational since 2010. The fleet, originally intended for 30-year service lives, may need to expand to up to six icebreakers to meet mission demands according to a DHS Mission Need Statement approved in 2013. The Coast Guard plans to acquire up to six new icebreakers (3 heavy and 3 medium) to meet mission demands in the high latitudes. The Polar Security Cutter (PSC) program aims to start construction of the first new heavy polar icebreaker in FY2019, with an estimated total cost of about $2.1 billion for three heavy polar icebreakers. The Polar Security Cutter (PSC) program has received a total of $1,034.6 million in procurement funding through FY2019, including $675 million from the FY2019 DHS appropriations act for the Coast Guard's procurement account. This funding includes $20 million for long leadtime materials for the second ship in the program. The Polar Security Cutter (PSC) program has received $1,014.6 million in funding through FY2019, with $20 million allocated for long leadtime materials for the second ship. The Coast Guard's FY2019 five-year Capital Investment Plan projected an additional $125 million in FY2020 procurement funding for the program. Congress faces decisions on approving, rejecting, or modifying procurement funding requests, contract options, and continued support for the program. Increasing concerns about Arctic-area search and rescue capabilities due to rising sea and air traffic in Arctic waters. Ship casualties in Arctic Circle waters from 2005 to 2014 highlighted in a 2015 report by Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty. Challenges include long response times for Coast Guard aircraft and cutters to reach distressed ships or downed aircraft in Arctic waters, exacerbated by harsh climate conditions. The harsh climate complicates search and rescue operations in the Arctic region, with concerns about cruise ships needing assistance. Incidents with cruise ships in Antarctic waters and a Russian-flagged ship running aground in Canada's Northwest Passage have raised alarm. Coast Guard officials note long response times for emergencies in the Arctic, prompting efforts to enhance SAR capabilities through new bases, Arctic-capable aircraft, cutters, and rescue boats. The challenges of Arctic search and rescue operations include long distances, severe weather, ice conditions, poor communications network, lack of infrastructure, and resource presence. Advanced information sharing and cooperation with other Arctic countries' navies and coast guards are needed to improve maritime safety in the region. SAR authorities in the Arctic are recognizing the need for advanced information sharing and cooperation among coast guards, emergency authorities, and other stakeholders. Joint training, technological innovation, and practical cooperation are recommended to enhance SAR capabilities in the region. This includes sharing lessons learned, improving communication networks, navigation, survival and rescue equipment, and healthcare services. The survey also emphasizes the importance of sharing information on infrastructure projects, resource assets, Automatic Identification System data, weather data, emergency plans, exercises, and lessons learned through a common database. Developing joint efforts among various stakeholders is crucial for improving Arctic SAR operations. On May 12, 2011, representatives from the member states of the Arctic Council signed an agreement on cooperation on aeronautical and maritime SAR in the Arctic. The agreement divides the Arctic into SAR areas with each party having primary responsibility for SAR operations. The delimitation of search and rescue regions does not affect boundaries between states. Developing joint courses for Arctic SAR and establishing a working group for new innovations are recommended for improving international cooperation. The Arctic Council signed an agreement on cooperation for aeronautical and maritime search and rescue (SAR) operations in the Arctic. Each party has primary responsibility for SAR in designated areas. The agreement identifies competent authorities, agencies, and rescue coordination centers for each party, including the United States Coast Guard and Department of Defense. Each party is responsible for bearing costs unless otherwise agreed. Elmendorf (ARCC Elmendorf) Article 12 states that each Party bears its own costs for implementing the Agreement, subject to resource availability. A working group, including maritime and aeronautical perspectives, is re-evaluating SAR operations in Polar waters due to increased interest in icy environments. More detailed guidance for SAR organizations is needed. The need for more detailed guidance for SAR organizations in Polar waters is being addressed through an update of the International Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue Manual (IAMSAR) in 2019. The manual, although not mandatory, is widely followed by SAR organizations globally and provides a framework for multinational SAR operations. The guidance will be expanded based on the Polar Code, recent IMO regulatory updates, and lessons learned from incidents like the disappearance of Malaysian Airlines' MH370. The Senate Armed Services Committee acknowledges the increased activity in the Arctic and emphasizes the importance of Arctic search and rescue operations. The Senate Armed Services Committee is concerned about the limited search-and-rescue capabilities in the Arctic region, as highlighted in the Department of Defense's report. Additional personnel recovery capability is needed, including forward-deployed assets and air drop response packages. The 176th Wing of the Alaska National Guard is the closest dedicated response force. The 176th Wing of the Alaska National Guard is the closest dedicated response force with refueling capability for Arctic search-and-rescue incidents. They have two Arctic Sustainment Packages to support 50 individuals for 3 days in extreme conditions. The committee recommends additional funding for sustainment to maintain these packages. The geopolitical environment for the Arctic is undergoing a shift due to renewed great power competition with China and Russia, challenging the U.S.-led international order. This shift, combined with diminishing Arctic ice and increased human activities in the region, has implications for the future of the Arctic. The Arctic's future is uncertain as it faces a potential shift from cooperation to competition and increased tensions. Maintaining the tradition of peaceful resolution and respect for international law is crucial to prevent conflicts from spreading into the region. Observers argue that the Arctic's tradition of cooperation and low tensions, while successful, may not be sustainable as competition and tensions from other regions seep in. They suggest preparing for increased competition and higher tensions in the Arctic. Observers suggest preparing for increased competition and higher tensions in the Arctic to ensure successful resolution of Arctic issues, even in a competitive environment. Maintaining the region as a zone of cooperation and low tensions could inadvertently encourage aggressive behavior by Russia or China in other parts of the world. The shift in the international security environment to great power competition may highlight the limitations of the Arctic Council as a governing body. Some argue that supporting peaceful countries in resisting unwanted actions by Russia or China in the Arctic is crucial to prevent a divide-and-conquer strategy. The challenge lies in finding an approach that combines the strengths of different perspectives. The Arctic Council does not enforce its guidelines or recommendations, as each Arctic State is responsible for implementation. Its mandate excludes military security, which may become more problematic in the current era of great power competition. One option to address the limitations of the Arctic Council could be amending its rules to enforce guidelines or expanding its mandate to include military security issues. Supporters argue these changes could help the council adapt to the shifting geopolitical environment in the Arctic and maintain its relevance. Excluding military security from the council's mandate may leave Arctic security issues unaddressed or shift them to a less effective forum for peaceful dispute resolution. Some argue for amending the Arctic Council's rules to include military security issues, while others believe the council's current success means it doesn't need fixing. Multilateral discussions on Arctic security have taken place, such as the Arctic Security Forces Roundtable established in 2011. The Arctic Council, along with additional countries, and the Northern Chiefs of Defense conference, have been discussing Arctic issues. The Arctic Council's function and features are defined by the Ottawa Declaration, including working groups, lack of legal personality, Indigenous representation, consensus-based forum, and exclusion of military security. The Arctic Council is evolving to meet new challenges and opportunities, with a strategic plan being developed for approval in 2019. Reforms are being considered to improve governance in the contemporary political landscape while maintaining practicality. The Arctic Council is evolving with a strategic plan in development for approval in 2019. Despite having adequate funding, there are constraints on discretionary funding for the Secretariat and Working Groups, leading to projects being driven by funding rather than the other way around. The Council has improved transparency through an open access archive, but funding still plays a significant role in project implementation. The Arctic Council has made progress in transparency through its open access archive but struggles with accountability to stakeholders, northerners, and taxpayers. There is confusion about the role of Observers and limited involvement of northern regional governments. Environmental protection receives the most attention and resources, while education, health services, and local infrastructure are not within the Council's mandate due to funding constraints. The Arctic Council focuses on environmental protection but lacks accountability to stakeholders and northern regional governments. Economic development, previously taboo, is now addressed by the Arctic Economic Council. Climate change is a major concern in regional politics, yet the Arctic Council lacks dedicated groups to address it. The Arctic Council, established in 1991, faces challenges in addressing climate change and transitioning to a post-petroleum future due to the lack of commitment from governments. The Working Group structure, inherited from the Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy, lacks a formal reporting structure, leading to unique organizational designs among the groups. The Working Groups within the Arctic Council have diverse organizational designs influenced by state laws and funding. Their effectiveness is hard to measure, and the Task Force category was created in 2009 for time-sensitive initiatives. The Arctic Council lacks legal personality and operates as a consensus-based forum without treaty obligations or law-making authority. States are not required to follow majority decisions. The Arctic Council operates without legal obligations for states to follow majority decisions, allowing flexibility and accommodation of different interests. While a more formal legal structure could strengthen the Council's implementation of policies, its informal nature has enabled full involvement of all stakeholders, including Permanent Participants. The Arctic Council, despite lacking legal personality, has been involved in discussions leading to legally binding agreements through its Working Groups. The rotating Chairmanship, established by the Ottawa Declaration, has led to a lack of continuity in the Council's work but ensures every state's investment in its success. The permanent Secretariat in Troms\u00f8, established in 2013, addressed issues with the rotating Chairmanship. The recommendations to improve the Arctic Council's form and function include evaluating and potentially overhauling the Working Group structure, ensuring capacity and resources for climate change mitigation, addressing funding and project fund issues, and limiting the Council's role to functions it uniquely performs. The recommendations for improving the Arctic Council's function include delegating work to appropriate bodies, engaging with sub-national governments, expanding the Amarok tracking tool, focusing on knowledge transfer for sustainable development issues, and maintaining good international relations. The shift in the international security environment to renewed great power competition may highlight differing perspectives between China and the Arctic Council member states on Arctic governance. Russia and China diverge on the question of who makes international law in the Arctic. China showed interest in Arctic rights in 1991, after inheriting them from the Nationalist government in 1925. The eight Arctic Council nations established a governance system in the '90s. China's interest in Arctic governance challenges the control of the Arctic Council member states, who established a governance system in the '90s. China seeks greater influence in the Arctic, advocating for international law based on UNCLOS for non-Arctic nations. The Arctic governance system is deemed ineffective by some, with disagreements among key Arctic states. China is pushing for a larger role in Arctic governance beyond economic interests. The legal framework for the Arctic is described as patchy and less developed compared to the Antarctic. China is seeking a greater role in Arctic governance, citing the inadequacies of the current legal framework. A white paper released by the Chinese government in January 2018 highlights China's increasing expertise in Arctic matters and justifies its involvement as a 'near Arctic state'. The paper emphasizes the importance of the Arctic's climate, environment, and ecology to all states. China, as an observer state in Arctic governance, is creatively using other routes to influence Arctic governance, such as active engagement in the International Maritime Organization and the International Seabed Commission. China has participated in the formation of the IMO's Polar Code and the recent adoption of the Agreement to Prevent Unregulated High Seas Fisheries in the Central Arctic Ocean. China aims to shape international rules in the Arctic by developing new regulations and strengthening environmental protection through treaties. It also seeks to contribute to the Arctic Council's research and projects, but it remains to be seen how much space Arctic states will allow for China's participation. This aligns with China's broader goal of increasing its influence in global governance. China is asserting a more influential role in global governance, particularly in emerging areas like cyber operations and trade dispute settlement. China's approach to Arctic governance is seen as a test of its use of international law to assert itself on global issues. China has been labeled a \"rule maker\" in Arctic governance, indicating its increasing influence in this area. The blue paper highlighted China's evolving role in global governance of the Arctic, shifting from a \"rule follower\" to a \"rule maker.\" It emphasized China's leadership in shaping the governance philosophy and agenda in the region, citing its geographical proximity and economic interests as driving factors. The blue paper emphasized China's role in global governance of the Arctic, focusing on agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and oceans. China aims to maintain regional security, promote world peace, and respect the sovereignty of Arctic states. The paper calls for China to remain calm and not take radical actions, ensuring the decision-making powers of the Arctic Council. China's observer status since 2013 may face challenges due to the \"China threat theory.\" Chinese enterprises, including China, are looking to develop a deeper commitment to the Arctic region. Non-Arctic states are also formulating Arctic policies and strategies, potentially seeking more influence within the Arctic Council and other international forums. Arctic states have coopted non-Arctic states as observer states in the Arctic Council, developing new rules while maintaining existing international law principles. They reject the idea of creating new international rules specifically for the Arctic, as it would be less advantageous than the current system. The shift in the international security environment poses challenges for the Arctic, particularly in relation to elements of the U.S.-led international system. The current environment challenges elements of the U.S.-led international order post-World War II, including the principles of non-forceful dispute resolution and freedom of the seas. Any weakening of these principles could have significant implications for the Arctic region, known for peaceful dispute resolution and respect for international law. Observers suggest that the overall U.S.-led international order may be eroding or collapsing. The erosion or collapse of the U.S.-led international order could impact the Arctic's tradition of cooperation and low tensions. The shift in the international security environment raises questions about the priority given to the Arctic in U.S. policymaking. Renewed great power competition may require more attention and resources for the Arctic. The Arctic's importance in U.S. policymaking is being questioned due to challenges in the international order. Renewed great power competition in various regions may divert attention and resources away from the Arctic. The region must compete for U.S. policymaker attention and resources amidst constraints. The Arctic region's significance in U.S. policymaking is being reevaluated amidst challenges in the international order. Russia holds a significant stake in the Arctic with its vast territory, coastal cities, and natural resources. The competition and cooperation dynamics with Russia in the Arctic are a key consideration for U.S., Canadian, and Nordic policymakers. Russia has the most at stake in the Arctic due to rapid ice melting on its side, leading to quicker opening of the Northern Sea Route for shipping. Despite cooperation with the US, Canada, and Nordic countries on various Arctic issues, the focus on the Arctic by leaders like President Trump and President Putin is limited. The Arctic is a potential starting point for improving US-Russia relations, with examples of cooperation like the International Space Station and agreements on Central Arctic Ocean fishing. Joint Arctic marine expeditions could further enhance cooperation and trust between the two countries. A joint Arctic marine expedition in the Central Arctic Ocean could be proposed to support the new fisheries agreement. The U.S. and Russia may lead in exploring enforcement issues with the new IMO International Code for Ships Operating in Polar Waters. Renewed military-to-military cooperation could focus on Arctic emergency operations, fostering friendship flights and cultural exchanges between indigenous communities bordering the Bering and Chukchi Seas. However, concerns have arisen over Russia's increased military presence in the Arctic. The Arctic region is facing potential military tension and competition, with concerns about the readiness of the United States, Canada, and Nordic countries to defend their interests. Canada boycotted a 2014 Arctic Council meeting in Moscow to protest Russia's actions in Ukraine. Economic sanctions imposed by the U.S. on Russia could impact Russian Arctic offshore oil exploration. Hillary Clinton warned that Arctic cooperation may be at risk if Russia pursues expansionist policies in the region. Russia's potential restriction of foreign warships in the Arctic Ocean could create tension with the United States over the status of the Northern Sea Route. This dispute may have broader implications for international waters and could set a precedent for challenges in other parts of the world. Russia's Defense Ministry is amending legislation to require foreign warships to notify Russia before passing through the Arctic in 2019. This move comes as NATO shows renewed interest in the region, which was once considered the northern flank of NATO's defensive line during the Cold War. The shift in international security dynamics has led to a change in NATO's focus from defending against Russia to other security concerns. NATO's focus has shifted to deterring potential Russian aggression against member countries, leading to increased attention on Norway and its sea areas. Trident Juncture 18, NATO's largest exercise since the Cold War, included a strong Arctic element and involved all 29 NATO members plus Sweden and Finland. The 2012 and 2013 NATO reports debated NATO's involvement in the Arctic due to concerns about sovereignty and Russian reactions. NATO was suggested as a forum for dialogue on military issues in the region, with a focus on security challenges like surveillance and environmental cleanup. NATO's involvement in the Arctic has been debated, with concerns about sovereignty and Russian reactions. Despite tensions with Russia, NATO has no current plans to increase its presence in the High North. However, there are discussions about potentially reviving a Cold War naval command to counter Moscow's submarine activity in the Arctic. NATO aims to maintain low tensions in the Arctic despite increased Russian military presence. Secretary General Stoltenberg emphasizes the need to avoid an arms race and higher tensions in the region. NATO is enhancing its naval capabilities in response to the growing Russian presence in the North Atlantic and Arctic regions. The NATO summit in Brussels presents an opportunity for the Alliance to focus on the Arctic region, where there is internal division on NATO's role. Norway advocates for NATO's involvement in the Arctic, while Canada has hindered past efforts in this regard. Since 2014, NATO has focused on Russia's actions in eastern Europe, but little has been done to protect NATO interests in the Arctic and Black Sea. Russia has a defined Arctic strategy, while NATO lacks a comparable one for the High North. NATO lacks a strategy for the High North, unlike Russia which has a defined Arctic strategy. The EU is also increasing its interest in the Arctic for geopolitical reasons, focusing on securing a role and access to resources in the region. The EU plays a growing role in the Arctic, with member countries like Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Faroe Islands, and Greenland having economic ties and agreements with the EU. Norway and Iceland, although not EU members, are part of the European Economic Area. The EU is a significant importer of Arctic resources and supports Arctic science programs. The EU is a central sponsor of Arctic science programs and has recently shown a more urgent interest in the region. EU Commission President Juncker has commissioned a policy paper on the EU's Arctic priorities, which could influence upcoming elections and the formation of the next EU Commission. The EU is focusing on the Arctic due to changing geopolitical dynamics and the need for natural resources. The European Union aims to take a leadership role in the region to prevent others from doing so. The European Union adopted its first comprehensive Arctic strategy in 2016, known as the \"Integrated Arctic Policy.\" Juncker is planning to update this policy sooner than expected. The upcoming policy paper will not be legally binding but will strengthen focus on Arctic resources. EU's main goal is to secure access to oil, gas, minerals, fishing stocks, and shipping routes in the Arctic. EU does not involve itself in Arctic security and intends to maintain this approach amidst sanctions standoff with Russia. The EU values dialogue with Russia on Arctic affairs despite sanctions standoff. Russia blocks EU's formal observer status in Arctic Council, but EU remains engaged as a de facto observer. China's Arctic activities have increased in recent years. China's Arctic presence has grown steadily in recent years, with increased diplomatic activities in Nordic countries and the signing of a free trade agreement with Iceland. China is also exploring oil possibilities in Icelandic waters and engaging in economic discussions with Greenland. China has an Arctic-capable icebreaker, Xue Long, and is constructing a second one domestically. China is expanding its Arctic presence with an Arctic-capable icebreaker named Xue Long 2 and plans to build a 30,000-ton nuclear-powered icebreaker. China released a white paper in January 2018 referring to itself as a \"near-Arctic state\" and highlighting trans-Arctic shipping routes as part of the Polar Silk Road. China is interested in using the Northern Sea Route to shorten shipping times between Europe and China and reduce dependence on southern sea routes. China reached agreements with Russia to create an \"Ice Silk Road\" and establish a credit agreement between banks. China and Russia have a credit agreement for infrastructure projects along the Northern Sea Route (NSR), with China investing up to $9.5 billion. China is also involved in Arctic oil and gas exploration, with investments in Russia's Arctic industry, including a 20% stake in the Yamal natural gas project. China's growing activities in the Arctic include investments in infrastructure projects along the Northern Sea Route (NSR) and Arctic oil and gas exploration. China has a stake in the Yamal natural gas project and is interested in mining opportunities in the Arctic seabed and Greenland. Additionally, China may be eyeing Arctic fishing grounds and views its presence in the region as fitting for a major world power. China's growing activities in the Arctic have raised questions about its motivations and ultimate goals. The international security environment's shift to great power competition has prompted Arctic states to consider how to respond. While there are opportunities for cooperation, China's activities also pose challenges for Arctic states in defending their interests. U.S. policymakers are grappling with how to integrate China's presence in the Arctic. U.S. policymakers are considering how to incorporate China's Arctic activities into U.S.-China relations and whether to link them to actions in other regions. They are exploring potential areas for cooperation with China in the Arctic and contemplating imposing punitive measures for unwanted actions. In one instance, the U.S. suggested Denmark fund airports in Greenland to counter China's influence. Russia is considering how to respond to China's activities in the Arctic, balancing economic opportunities with concerns about China's growing power. Cooperation between Russia and China in the Arctic reflects their broader partnership aimed at countering the United States in international affairs. China's growing power in the Arctic is a concern for Russia, as it could lead to China becoming the dominant power in Eurasia. Sino-Russian cooperation in the Arctic is mainly commercial, focusing on trade routes, offshore oil, telecommunications, and tourism. Military cooperation is limited. China's actions in the Arctic, particularly since publishing its Arctic white paper in January 2018, suggest a desire for dominance in the region. This has raised concerns in Russia, with some commentators fearing China aims to diminish Russia's role to that of a subordinate. China's expanding presence in the Arctic is evident through increased orders and investments in various sectors. China is increasing its share of orders for goods carried across Arctic waters, boosting ownership stake in Russian ships, building ice breakers and ice-capable ships, establishing drilling platforms in areas claimed by Russia, and constructing port facilities on Russian territory. These developments indicate China's desire for dominance in the Arctic region. China is expanding its presence in the Arctic region, with a focus on increasing its share of orders for goods transported through Arctic waters and building up its naval strength. Russia sees China as a strategic partner in the Arctic, with a growing role in the region that could challenge the US more than Russia. The Russian Federation and People's Republic of China are working together to strengthen cooperation in the Arctic. Russia expects China to help develop its northern region, but doubts remain about China's commitment. China's ambitions in the Arctic go beyond joint initiatives, and Russia's assumptions about China's role in the region may not be accurate. The Northeast Passage requires significant infrastructure investment before it can become profitable, and China has other options besides working with Russia in the Arctic. The Russian conviction is that China's choices in the Arctic are limited to the NEP and NWP, with no other alternatives. China's involvement in the Arctic will be multilateral, not just with Russia. China's strategy aims to internationalize the Arctic, potentially sidelining Russia. International competition from other Arctic players may also challenge Russian efforts. Arctic nations cautiously welcome China's increased role in the region but set limits on Chinese investments. Each country, under public pressure, establishes its own boundaries. Russia shows a mix of interest and caution towards China, welcoming investments but also intent on maintaining control. Russia is focused on developing port infrastructure along the Northern Sea Route (NSR) while also aiming to maintain control over it, potentially causing tensions with China. China views the NSR as part of its Belt and Road Initiative and may resent any obstacles to its use. Despite being allies, Russia is wary of China's military power and is irritated by non-Arctic states' involvement in Arctic affairs. Since 2017, there has been optimism for Sino-Russian cooperation in the Arctic region, with shared visions for joint development of Arctic energy resources and shipping lanes. However, concrete joint projects on the Northern Sea Route are lacking due to divergent interests and conflicting cost-benefit analyses from China's perspective. China's interest in the Northern Sea Route is driven by strategic and political factors rather than economic ones. Diverging interests between China and Russia pose a challenge for future cooperation. Moscow needs to show more sincerity in improving China's cost-benefit analysis. Expectations for Sino-Russian cooperation on the route should focus on concrete plans rather than rhetoric. Despite identifying converging interests, China and Russia have not reached an optimistic conclusion on the economic practicality of the Northern Sea Route. Diverging interests, especially regarding mutually beneficial compromises, remain a significant obstacle to future progress. China views the route as a lofty future ambition rather than a viable substitute for traditional shipping routes, emphasizing its potential as a supplement. The lack of concrete projects on the ground highlights the gap between discussions and actual development. China has shown more interest in infrastructure cooperation in areas like the Primorye International Transportation Corridor and energy projects, rather than the joint development of the Northern Sea Route with Russia. Their enthusiasm for cooperation in the Arctic region is driven by political and strategic motives, aiming to secure a privileged position in projects where Russia seeks international partnerships. Russia's options for partners may expand once international sanctions are lifted, or if the United States identifies China as a major threat and Russia as a potential ally in the Sino-U.S.-Russian strategic triangle. The Sino-Russian partnership in the Arctic region supports China's ambitions but also acts as a check on them. China's Arctic white paper focuses on climate change and sustainable development, downplaying security interests and the link to naval capabilities for great-power status. The PLA plays a crucial role in China's Arctic capabilities, with the region becoming a key part of China's evolving role in global governance. China's evolving role in the changing Arctic is a key part of its maritime strategy. Despite obstacles like limited experience in cold-water navigation, China is investing in polar research. Fears about Russia in Northern Europe may initially support China's Arctic activities, but could change if China seeks a larger role. China's ambitions in the Arctic could complicate its relations with Russia, despite Russia's initial support. China's relationship with Russia is crucial for its Arctic ambitions, but Russia's stance on Arctic shipping may limit China's role. As an observer in the Arctic Council, China relies on member states to advocate for its proposals and can only engage in Arctic resource development through cooperation with these states. Concerns have been raised by regional states about China's Arctic aspirations, particularly regarding potential tensions with Russia over the Northern Sea Route if Arctic ice continues to melt. China's growing interest in the Arctic has raised concerns among Arctic states, particularly those with significant resources or coastal access. While Russia and Canada have reservations about China's involvement in the region, Nordic countries have welcomed it. China's approach involves multilateralism, bilateral diplomacy, and investments under the Belt and Road Initiative. Smaller Arctic states like Iceland are wary of the potential political and economic impact of Chinese funds. Chinese investments in Greenland have sparked controversy due to its strategic location and domestic pressures for independence from Denmark. China is slowly building up its presence in the Arctic, focusing on scientific capacity and naval capabilities in anticipation of future economic opportunities as the ice recedes. Russia has provided an entry point for China in the region, despite being wary of its intentions. China sees the Arctic as a land of untapped resources and a chance to increase its global influence, but must be cautious of Russian sensitivities. As the ice melts, the region's political dynamics are shifting, raising concerns about China's intentions and its impact on the status quo. Melting ice in the Arctic has significant political and environmental implications for China, serving as a testing ground for its global ambitions. The shift towards great power competition raises questions about China's compliance with international law in the South China Sea and how it may impact its behavior in the Arctic. During the Cold War, the Arctic was a military battleground between the United States and the Soviet Union, with both operating nuclear-powered submarines and bombers in the region. The question now arises whether the US should suspend China's observer status on the Arctic Council as a punitive measure for actions in the South China Sea, and whether the US should join UNCLOS, considering issues in both the South China Sea and the Arctic. Renewed tensions with Russia since 2014 have raised concerns about military competition in the Arctic region. Observers question if the US is adequately prepared to defend its interests there, despite cooperative efforts among Arctic states. The competitive aspects of the situation in the Arctic have been exaggerated in some press accounts. Russia's recent military investment in the region may just be normal modernization, but U.S. military forces are paying renewed attention to the Arctic. The Navy, Coast Guard, Air Force, Army, and Marine Corps are all focusing more on Arctic operations. Other countries like Canada, the UK, and Nordic countries are also increasing their military presence in the region. The Department of Defense's report on the 2010 QDR highlights the impact of changing climate on military operations. The changing climate in the Arctic is affecting the Department of Defense's operating environment. The opening of Arctic waters will allow for seasonal commerce and transit, creating opportunities for collaborative efforts to enhance human and environmental security in the region. DoD must work with the Coast Guard and Department of Homeland Security to address communication gaps, improve domain awareness, search and rescue capabilities, and environmental observation. DoD supports accession to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea for cooperative engagement in the Arctic. President Obama assigned responsibility for the Arctic to U.S. Northern Command in April 2011. The Department of Defense's operating environment in the Arctic is changing due to climate change. In April 2011, responsibility for the Arctic was assigned to U.S. Northern Command. This change in the Unified Command Plan also included Alaska under U.S. Northern Command's jurisdiction. DOD released a strategy for the Arctic in November 2013, which was updated in December 2016. The Obama Administration designated DOD as the lead federal agency for specific initiatives in the national strategy for the Arctic region. The Department of Defense (DOD) is designated as the lead federal agency for specific initiatives in the national strategy for the Arctic region, including developing a framework for sea ice forecasting. Climate change presents opportunities for nations to collaborate, as mentioned in the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review and the February 2015 National Security Strategy. The Department of Defense (DOD) is leading initiatives in the national strategy for the Arctic region, focusing on sea ice forecasting. Recent reports highlight the effects of climate change on coastal regions and the need for international cooperation in combating various threats. The Obama administration's strategic guidance emphasizes a supporting role for the DOD in the Arctic due to a low military threat expected in the region. The DOD plays a supporting role in the Arctic region due to low military threat. As sea ice diminishes, DOD may support federal agencies and partners for a secure region. They participate in forums like the Arctic Security Forces Roundtable and lead training exercises for partner capacity building. DOD leads training exercises like Arctic Zephyr to build partner capacity in the region and monitors security indicators. Actions have been taken with interagency partners to address near-term capabilities needed in the Arctic, such as maritime awareness and communications. Studies have identified necessary capabilities for Arctic operations, and the Implementation Plan to the National Strategy for the Arctic Region outlines activities to address these needs, including improved sea ice modeling. The DOD is focusing on improved sea ice modeling and other capability needs in the Arctic. The Navy's Arctic Roadmap prioritizes actions to enhance operations in the region, while U.S. Northern Command is updating regional plans and conducting analysis to determine future capability needs. This includes updating the Commander's Estimate for the Arctic and studying various mission areas like maritime homeland defense and undersea surveillance. The DOD is focusing on identifying future capability needs in areas like maritime homeland defense and undersea surveillance in the Arctic. Uncertainty remains around the pace of change and commercial activity in the region, creating challenges for DOD to balance the risk of inadequate capabilities with the cost of premature investments. DOD plans to monitor changing Arctic conditions to determine the appropriate timing for capability investments. The DOD is investing in research, military infrastructure, and capabilities to support the development of the Arctic as a secure region. In FY 2017, investments focus on capabilities and research for next-generation capabilities. About $6 billion is allocated for FY 2017 investments, with $461.3 million designated for the Army. In FY2017, the DOD allocated about $6 billion for investments in the Arctic region. This includes $461.3 million for Army research and development, $362.2 million for Air Force military construction, and $5.209 billion for various defense capabilities. The majority of the $5.209 billion is for Air Force operations and maintenance, Air Force procurement, and Army military personnel costs. The DOD remains committed to collaborating with allies and partners to protect U.S. national security interests in the Arctic. The DoD is committed to collaborating with allies and partners to promote security in the Arctic region. Their strategy builds upon previous directives and aims for a secure and stable Arctic where U.S. national interests are safeguarded. The DoD's Arctic strategy focuses on ensuring security, safety, and defense cooperation in the region, preparing to respond to various challenges independently or with allies. Timeframes for near-term (present to 2023), mid-term (2023-2030), and far-term (beyond 2030) are addressed, considering uncertainties in environmental, economic, and geopolitical conditions. The strategy also includes a classified annex. The 2016 Arctic Strategy outlines ways for the DoD to achieve its objectives, including enhancing defense capabilities, strengthening deterrence, preserving freedom of the seas, and supporting civil authorities. It also emphasizes partnerships with other departments, agencies, and nations to promote security and cooperation in the region. The DoD is focused on enhancing defense capabilities, strengthening deterrence, and promoting defense cooperation in the Arctic. Alliances and partnerships are crucial for maintaining security and stability in the region. The DoD will continue to seek innovative and cost-effective ways to achieve its objectives, following established principles and consultation policies. The DoD is required to submit a report on resolving Arctic security capability gaps and investment plans for military infrastructure to protect U.S. national security interests in the region. The National Security Strategy mentions the importance of upholding rules in the Arctic for U.S. prosperity and security. The National Defense Strategy does not specifically mention the Arctic. Section 1071 of H.R. 5515 calls for a report on an updated plan. Section 1071 of H.R. 5515 requires the Secretary of Defense to submit a report on an updated Arctic strategy by June 1, 2019. The report should include a description of U.S. national security interests in the Arctic, an assessment of threats posed by adversaries in the region, and the roles of each military service in joint operations. The report required by Section 1071 of H.R. 5515 mandates the submission of an updated Arctic strategy by June 1, 2019. It should outline U.S. national security interests, assess threats from adversaries, and detail joint strategies for sea, air, and ground operations in the Arctic region. Additionally, the report must address training, capability, and resource gaps, as well as the level of cooperation between the Department of Defense, other government agencies, and local entities for Arctic defense. The report required by H.Rept. 115-874 directs the Secretary of Defense to submit a report on current cold weather capabilities and readiness of the United States Armed Forces within 180 days. It should include descriptions of current cold weather capabilities, anticipated requirements for military operations in cold climates, and the readiness of the joint force for cold weather training and equipment. The Senate Appropriations Committee directs the Secretary of Defense to evaluate Arctic broadband infrastructure in northern Alaska and the Aleutian Islands to support military operations. The Committee directs the Secretary of Defense to evaluate broadband infrastructure in the United States Arctic, specifically in the Aleutian Island chain and Alaska's northwest and northern slope communities. The report will assess existing infrastructure, limitations, and future needs. Additionally, the Navy and Coast Guard are examining the impact of increased human activities in the Arctic on their operations, including potential changes in ships, aircraft, bases, and supporting systems. The Navy and Coast Guard are studying the implications of diminished Arctic sea ice on their operations. This includes exploring new operating areas for Navy ships and Coast Guard cutters in the region. U.S. national security interests in the Arctic involve missile defense, strategic sealift, deterrence, and maritime security operations. The Navy and Coast Guard are studying the implications of diminished Arctic sea ice on their operations, including exploring new operating areas in the region. U.S. national security interests in the Arctic involve strategic sealift, deterrence, maritime security operations, and ensuring freedom of navigation and overflight. More information is needed to support expanded Navy and Coast Guard operations in the Arctic, which may require altering ship and aircraft designs and operating methods. Cooperation with other Arctic countries will be valuable in achieving defense and homeland security goals. The Navy released its first Arctic roadmap in November 2009 to guide activities in the region for FY2010-FY2014. A 2011 report highlighted the need for the Navy to be prepared for increased human activity in the changing Arctic environment. Despite opening up, the Arctic will remain harsh with hazardous sea ice and extreme weather. While the submarine fleet has experience, other assets like the surface fleet and air assets have limited experience in the region. The Navy must consider the Arctic in future policy planning. The Navy must now consider the Arctic in terms of future policy, strategy, force structure, and investments. The Department of the Navy will lead coordination on maritime detection and tracking in the Arctic, working with other Federal departments and agencies to improve nautical charts, enhance atmospheric and oceanic models, and monitor climate change indicators. The Obama Administration's 2014 implementation plan for the Arctic mentions the Navy collaborating on marine charting and mapping. The Navy released an updated Arctic roadmap in 2014 to guide its activities in the region until 2030. The 2014-2030 Navy Arctic roadmap highlights the challenges of operating in the Arctic Region, emphasizing the harsh climate, vast distances, and limited infrastructure. Despite the low threat security environment, the Navy is prepared to prevent conflict and protect national interests in the region. The Navy's strategic objectives in the Arctic Region include ensuring US sovereignty, providing homeland defense, responding to crises, preserving freedom of the seas, and promoting partnerships. Resource constraints necessitate informed and deliberate naval investments for future Arctic operations. The Navy's strategic objectives in the Arctic Region include improving operational capabilities, expertise, and capacity, leveraging partners, and balancing regional requirements with national goals. The Roadmap provides direction for near-term, mid-term, and far-term actions, focusing on enhancing the Navy's ability to operate in the Arctic Region. In the near-term, there is low demand for additional naval involvement as current capabilities are sufficient. The Navy will refine doctrine and procedures for potential future operations in the Arctic Region. In the mid-term, the Navy will support Combatant Commanders, US Coast Guard, and other government agencies. Increased ice-free conditions in the far-term may require expanded Navy support. The roadmap outlines near-term operations until 2020, focusing on undersea and air assets with limited surface ship operations. Weather factors, including sea ice, will be considered in operational risk assessments. By 2020, more personnel will be trained in Arctic operations. The Navy will increase expertise in Arctic operations through training personnel, participating in exercises, and personnel exchanges. They will refine strategy, policy, and plans for the Arctic region, update operating requirements, and invest in capabilities for future demands. Emphasis will be on low-cost activities and collaboration with interagency partners and allies. By 2030, the Navy will have the necessary training and personnel to respond to contingencies and emergencies in the Arctic region. Surface vessels will operate in ice-free areas, improving capabilities through complex exercises with regional partners. Primary risks include search and rescue missions and disaster response. In the far-term, the Navy aims to support sustained operations in the Arctic region to meet national policy guidance. Naval forces will be ready to respond to potential threats to national security and provide contingency response, with risks including increased search and rescue missions and disaster response. The Navy is reestablishing the 2nd Fleet to focus on countering Russian naval forces in the North Atlantic and Arctic. They plan to send a warship through Arctic waters for a freedom of navigation operation. The U.S. Navy plans to conduct its first ever freedom of navigation operation in Arctic waters. The Coast Guard has been operating in the Arctic Ocean since 1867, enforcing U.S. laws, conducting search and rescue missions, assisting scientific exploration, and ensuring navigation safety and environmental stewardship. The Coast Guard has been operating in the Arctic Ocean since 1867, enforcing U.S. laws, conducting search and rescue missions, and ensuring navigation safety. They have conducted operations in the Arctic Region since 2008 to assess capabilities and mission requirements, including establishing temporary Forward Operating Locations and flying aerial sorties to evaluate activities in the region. They continue to deploy Coast Guard cutters to test equipment, train crews, and increase awareness of Arctic activity. The High Latitude Study from July 2010 identified significant Coast Guard mission areas in the Arctic: Defense Readiness, Ice Operations, Marine Environmental Protection, and Ports, Waterways, and Coastal Security. These areas are crucial for protecting national interests and ensuring security, scientific knowledge collection, supporting commercial enterprises, and preserving the Arctic environment. The Coast Guard's unique capabilities in the Arctic support Defense Readiness missions, including resupplying Thule Air Base and McMurdo Station, and conducting Freedom of Navigation Operations. The lack of polar icebreaking capability is a significant challenge, along with other gaps like communications. The impact on Coast Guard missions in the Arctic includes communication system capability, lack of suitable facilities for aircraft servicing, and gaps in environmental response in ice-covered waters. These challenges reduce on-scene presence and operational capability in the region. The Coast Guard faces capability gaps in the Arctic region impacting Aids to Navigation, Search and Rescue, and Law Enforcement missions. As maritime traffic increases, safety concerns for mariners grow. Assessing polar icebreaking needs and deploying assets like icebreakers and helicopters are crucial for mission success in Arctic Alaska. The study considers force mixes to enhance the Coast Guard Alaska Patrol, including a high-endurance cutter with a recovery helicopter in the Bering Sea, and medium-range helicopters in Kodiak. These force packages aim to address capability gaps in the Arctic region. Recapitalizing aging icebreakers is the first step, followed by investments in forward operating locations and medium-range helicopters. Rough cost estimates for forward operating locations are around $36 million each, and for helicopters, it is $9 million. The Coast Guard deployment posture in northern Alaska needs improvement through a mix of cutters, aircraft, and infrastructure. A strategy document released by the Coast Guard outlines objectives for the Arctic over the next 10 years, focusing on safe and secure maritime activity in U.S. Arctic waters. The Coast Guard's efforts in U.S. Arctic waters involve coordinating with DHS components to facilitate commerce, manage borders, and improve resilience to disasters. They utilize a variety of cutters, boats, aircraft, and shore infrastructure to meet mission demands, including mobile command and control platforms and seasonal air and communications capabilities. These assets enable priorities such as search and rescue operations, border security, intelligence collection, disaster response, and environmental protection in the region. Winter sea travel remains limited due to extensive ice. Recent summer and early autumn sea ice extent record lows have made seasonal maritime navigation more feasible in the Arctic. Economic development drives much of the current maritime activity in the region, including resource extraction, adventure tourism, and trans-Arctic shipping. Oil and gas exploration activities bring risks that can be mitigated through appropriate maritime governance. Tourism is increasing rapidly in the Arctic, with transportation via passenger vessels expected to further increase near- and offshore activities in Arctic waters. The U.S. Coast Guard outlines three strategic objectives for the next 10 years: Improving Awareness, Modernizing Governance, and Broadening Partnerships. Improving Awareness: Coast Guard operations in the Arctic require precise and ongoing awareness of maritime activities, which is currently limited due to surveillance and information system constraints. Enhanced awareness enables threat identification, information-sharing, and improved risk management through collaboration with various stakeholders. Modernizing Governance: Governance in the Arctic involves overseeing maritime activities while safeguarding national interests, requiring institutions, authority structures, and capabilities. Close collaboration within DHS and with other departments and stakeholders is essential for integration, innovation, and the adoption of emerging technologies. The Coast Guard aims to improve Arctic governance by fostering collective efforts domestically and internationally. This includes reviewing its institutions and regimes to prepare for future missions. Success in the Arctic requires collaboration across public and private sectors, regulatory regimes, international forums, partnerships, and local engagements in Arctic communities. The Coast Guard focuses on training and volunteer service in Arctic communities. Close intergovernmental cooperation is crucial for success in the Arctic, including working with DHS, Department of State, and Department of Interior. Additional factors for long-term success include building national awareness of the Arctic, strengthening maritime regimes, improving public-private relationships, seeking necessary authorities, and identifying future requirements and resources. This strategy outlines priorities for capabilities, advances in science and technology, and shaping trends favorably. The strategy advocates leveraging DHS capabilities to secure borders, prevent terrorism, and adapt to changing environmental conditions in the Arctic. The Coast Guard will focus on improving awareness, modernizing governance, and broadening partnerships for safe and environmentally responsible maritime activity in the region. The United States Coast Guard, under Homeland Security, leads 6 out of 36 Arctic initiatives, including enhancing domain awareness and improving hazardous material spill response. They work with the EPA for spill prevention, with a focus on international cooperation and waterways management. The Coast Guard, in collaboration with other Arctic nations, established the Arctic Coast Guard Forum (ACGF) in October 2015. The ACGF aims to coordinate exercises, strengthen relationships, and share best practices among the eight Arctic countries. The chairmanship of the ACGF rotates with the chair of the Arctic Council. Initial meetings in 2014 were well-received, leading to the formation of working groups and a Joint Statement. The first \"Heads of Arctic Coast Guards\" meeting occurred in October 2015. The first \"Heads of Arctic Coast Guards\" meeting took place in October 2015 at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy, where participating nations approved the Terms of Reference and released a Joint Statement. A 2016 GAO report highlighted the U.S. Coast Guard's progress in implementing its Arctic strategy, including exercises for oil spill response and search and rescue, forming a safety committee, and developing a web-based tracking tool. Identified capability gaps include communications, infrastructure, and icebreaking, which the Coast Guard is working to mitigate. The Coast Guard has worked with Arctic partners to address capability gaps in communications, infrastructure, and icebreaking. While they have taken actions to implement Arctic strategies and operations, they have not systematically assessed the effectiveness of these efforts. By evaluating their progress, the Coast Guard can better understand and mitigate these gaps. The Coast Guard is working to address gaps in its Arctic operations due to its aging icebreaker fleet. They have struggled to maintain year-round access to the Arctic and meet icebreaking service requests. Efforts to acquire a new icebreaker are underway, but face limitations. There is a projected 3- to 6-year gap in heavy icebreaking capabilities. The Coast Guard is facing a 3- to 6-year gap in heavy icebreaking capability before a new icebreaker is operational. Coast guard leaders from Arctic nations signed a joint statement for cooperation on emergency maritime response and operations in the northern seas. International cooperation is emphasized as more Arctic shipping routes open up. The joint statement signed by Coast Guard leaders from Arctic nations focuses on emergency maritime response and operations in the region as shipping routes become more accessible due to retreating ice. International collaboration has led to the establishment of strategies and tactics for achieving common operational goals, with table top exercises already conducted in Reykjavik, Iceland, and the District of Columbia. A live exercise in the Arctic is planned for later this year to enhance safe, secure, and environmentally responsible maritime activity in the region. Admiral Zukunft emphasized the importance of cooperation with other Arctic nations to enhance maritime activity in the region. He highlighted the need for the U.S. to build a new fleet of icebreakers. The Senate Appropriations Committee acknowledged the national security imperatives for an increased U.S. presence in the Arctic and commended the Coast Guard for establishing an Arctic Strategy and Program Office. The Arctic Program Office, established to further national defense and security interests in the Arctic, has collaborated with international partners to improve awareness and governance in the region. It recently supported the completion of a study leading to an IMO-approved vessel traffic measure for navigation safety in polar waters. The Coast Guard may request additional resources for the office's mission. The Arctic Program Office collaborates with international partners to improve governance in the region. It supported a study for IMO-approved vessel traffic measures. The office may request additional resources for its mission. (Pages 61-62) Various CRS reports cover topics such as climate change, the U.N. Law of the Sea Convention, Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, oil development, oil spills, polar bears, and the Coast Guard Polar Security Cutter Program. The Arctic Program Office collaborates with international partners to improve governance in the region, supporting a study for IMO-approved vessel traffic measures. It may request additional resources for its mission. The Arctic Research and Policy Act of 1984 highlights the importance of the Arctic for energy resources, national defense, and renewable resources like fish. The Arctic's renewable resources, including fish and seafood, are vital for the nation's economy. Understanding Arctic conditions is crucial for better agricultural management in the United States. Industrial pollution in the Arctic can disrupt global weather patterns and requires international cooperation for control. The Arctic serves as a research hub for human health, adaptation to extreme climates, and high latitude communications, which are important for future defense needs. Arctic marine technology is essential for cost-effective operations. The United States has important security, economic, and environmental interests in developing and maintaining a fleet of icebreaking vessels capable of operating effectively in the heavy ice regions of the Arctic. Most Arctic-rim countries, particularly the Soviet Union, possess advanced Arctic technologies. Federal Arctic research is currently fragmented and uncoordinated, leading to neglect in certain areas and unnecessary duplication of effort in others. Improved logistical coordination and support for Arctic research is necessary for increased efficiency and utility of national Arctic research efforts. A comprehensive national policy and program plan are needed to organize and fund neglected scientific research in the Arctic. The Federal Government should focus on collecting basic data related to various phenomena in the Arctic and research the long-term effects of development to mitigate adverse consequences.
