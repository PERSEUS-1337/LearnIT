    "content": "In 1994, leaders of 34 Western Hemisphere countries agreed to negotiate the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) to reduce trade barriers. Negotiations began in 1998, aiming to create a free trade area by 2005. Progress was assessed in 2001, with a goal to conclude negotiations by January 2005 and implement the FTAA by December 2005. Countries exchanged offers in 2003 to reduce tariffs and quotas on traded goods. The FTAA negotiations in 2002 focused on counteroffers to reduce tariffs and quotas on traded goods, with significant differences in viewpoints on agriculture, particularly domestic farm subsidies. Negotiating free trade in agricultural products was seen as a challenging issue, similar to the NAFTA negotiations between the US and Mexico. Hemispheric trade liberalization would impact US agricultural trade with South America, Central America, and the Caribbean, excluding Cuba. Trade in most agricultural products with Canada and Mexico was already free or would become so under NAFTA. The United States recorded a $2.8 billion deficit in agricultural trade with non-NAFTA countries in the Western Hemisphere in 2002. Agricultural products from outside the NAFTA trade bloc enter the US duty-free through various trade preference programs like the Caribbean Basin Initiative and the Andean Trade Preference Act. Countries taking advantage of these programs are not required to offer tariff concessions on products imported from the US. Deficits occurred in two-way trade with South American and Central American countries. In 2002, the United States had a $2.8 billion deficit in agricultural trade with non-NAFTA countries in the Western Hemisphere. Agricultural trade with Caribbean nations generated a surplus. U.S. agricultural exports to FTAA countries totaled $4.2 billion, while imports from FTAA countries totaled $7.0 billion. NAFTA partners accounted for $15.9 billion in farm and food exports. In 2002, U.S. agricultural exports to Canada and Mexico totaled $15.9 billion, representing a significant portion of worldwide purchases. Discussions on eliminating barriers to agricultural trade have focused on two negotiating groups within the FTAA. The FTAA negotiations in 2000 and 2002 focused on agricultural provisions and market access guidelines. Trade ministers reached agreement on methods and modalities for tariff reductions to meet the timetable set in 2001. Trade ministers agreed on tariff reductions for FTAA negotiations, with countries starting from current applied rates. CARICOM members have exceptions for using maximum bound rates as reference points for tariff reductions. The final stages of negotiations are co-chaired by Brazil and the United States. The final stages of FTAA negotiations are co-chaired by Brazil and the United States. All countries met the deadline for presenting initial tariff reduction offers. The U.S. Trade Representative leads the negotiations, with input from other departments like the USDA. Trade ministers agreed on objectives for negotiating hemispheric free trade. Trade ministers in 1998 agreed on objectives for negotiating hemispheric free trade in agricultural products, including eliminating measures restricting market entry, developing rules on export subsidies, and ensuring food safety regulations are based on science. FTAA negotiators were instructed to incorporate progress from WTO negotiations on agriculture. The FTAA objectives include addressing safety and agricultural health rules in international trade. The U.S. position on agricultural negotiations is to work with the agricultural community to address import sensitivities and export interests. Tariffs and tariff-rate quotas are used to protect certain economic sectors, with one major FTAA objective being to progressively address border protection measures. The FTAA aims to eliminate tariffs and non-tariff barriers to agricultural trade between participating countries. Negotiations will include market access for agricultural products to integrate smaller economies. The U.S. proposes treating agricultural trade the same as manufactured goods for free trade benefits. The U.S. position in the FTAA negotiations advocates reducing tariffs to ensure broad benefits of free trade, taking into account product sensitivities. Average agricultural tariffs in the FTAA region vary, with North America at 25%, South America at 39%, Central America at 54%, and the Caribbean Islands at 86%. Applied tariffs can be lower than bound rates, ranging from 11% to 17% in Central and South America during 1995-99. The FTAA aims to reduce tariffs to zero and eliminate TRQs by 2020, following WTO rules for tariff elimination within 10 years. Some countries seek exceptions for specific products under restrictive TRQs. The FTAA aims to reduce tariffs and eliminate protection on most trade within 10 years. Some politically-sensitive agricultural products may have a transition period of up to 20 years. The U.S. offers immediate duty-free access on 56% of agricultural products. The United States is willing to grant immediate duty-free access on 56% of agricultural products from non-NAFTA countries under the FTAA. Ambassador Zoellick proposes eliminating tariffs on politically-sensitive farm products with varying timetables based on country size and economic development. All agricultural products are open for negotiation without exclusions. The WTO Agreement aims to reduce export subsidies and domestic support in agricultural trade, addressing mechanisms that distort trade. Export subsidies give exporters a price advantage, impacting international trade in agricultural and food products. The FTAA negotiating objectives aim to eliminate agricultural export subsidies and trade-distorting practices in the Hemisphere. The U.S. proposes mechanisms to prevent non-FTAA countries from exporting subsidized agricultural products to the FTAA. This targets the European Union, known for heavily subsidizing its agricultural exports. The U.S. proposal in the FTAA aims to eliminate agricultural export subsidies and trade-distorting practices, targeting the European Union. Some South American countries have raised concerns about domestic farm support leading to commodity surpluses and lower prices in world markets. Some South American countries are concerned about domestic farm support leading to lower prices in world markets. They want to address this issue in FTAA negotiations by linking their reduction in border protection on agricultural products to the U.S. reducing its domestic farm support, which the U.S. rejects. The U.S. proposal in the FTAA aims to eliminate agricultural export subsidies and trade-distorting practices, targeting the European Union. The U.S. proposal in the WTO calls for a hemispheric agreement to reduce trade-distorting domestic support. Brazil's counter-proposal questions the scope of the FTAA, suggesting negotiations with Mercosur as a bloc and shifting focus to investment, government procurement, and intellectual property rights. The United States advocates for including investment, government procurement, and intellectual property rights in a comprehensive FTAA agreement, while Brazil proposes a \"FTAA lite\" focusing on different priorities. The U.S. also calls for the elimination of exclusive export rights granted to State Trading Enterprises in agricultural exports to allow for private traders to participate. This position aims to change entities like the Canadian Wheat Board, the sole exporter of wheat to several Latin American countries. The United States aims to include its position in the FTAA to expand agribusiness operations in countries with State Trading Enterprises. The FTAA agricultural negotiating objective follows the WTO's SPS Agreement to prevent protectionist trade practices and facilitate trade in the hemisphere. It calls for measures based on scientific principles to protect human, animal, and plant life, and to facilitate trade. The WTO Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures aims to ensure food safety and protect animals and plants from diseases. It requires countries to base their standards on science and not use measures to discriminate against other WTO members. The U.S. position calls for FTAA countries to collaborate on developing international standards in line with the WTO's SPS Committee. The U.S. aims to collaborate with FTAA countries to develop international standards based on the work of the WTO's SPS Committee, rather than creating a separate organization. The NGMA is tasked with addressing rules of origin, customs procedures, technical trade barriers, and safeguards for agricultural products, which are crucial for market access. The U.S. proposes detailed rules and disciplines to ensure sensitive products are protected. The U.S. proposes differential treatment for sensitive products in the transition to free trade within the FTAA, aiming to benefit producers in the hemisphere. Environmental and labor issues are contentious, with some advocating for their inclusion in trade agreements while others argue they should be addressed separately. Some U.S. farm groups are concerned about lower production costs and minimal safety standards in Latin American agricultural sectors, fearing increased imports would harm their competitive position. While some support including labor and environmental provisions in trade agreements, others oppose it, preferring trade liberalization that promotes sustainable agriculture and better working conditions. According to a USDA analysis, U.S. agriculture would benefit from participating in an FTAA that eliminates tariffs in the Western Hemisphere. The study found that U.S. farm income would increase by $180 million annually, total agricultural exports would rise by $580 million, and total agricultural imports would increase by $830 million. The impact would vary among commodities, with potential gains in wheat market share in Brazil for both the United States and Canada. Additionally, there are expected gains in U.S. exports of corn, soybeans, and cotton to the hemisphere. The USDA analysis shows that U.S. agriculture would benefit from participating in an FTAA by increasing farm income and total agricultural exports. However, there could be negative impacts on U.S. sugar and orange juice due to increased competition from lower-cost producers like Brazil and Guatemala. Congress will consider any agreement resulting from FTAA negotiations under fast track procedures. The Executive Branch is required to consult with Congress on specific agricultural issues during trade negotiations, including those in the FTAA. Special consultation procedures with Congress are outlined for negotiations affecting certain agricultural products. Extensive consultations on agricultural trade negotiations are mandated between the Executive Branch and the House and Senate Agriculture Committees. The Executive Branch must consult with Congress on agricultural issues during trade negotiations, including the FTAA. Special procedures are outlined for negotiations on import-sensitive agricultural products, requiring consultations with specific congressional committees. The Executive Branch must consult with Congress on agricultural issues during trade negotiations, including the FTAA. Special procedures are outlined for negotiations on import-sensitive agricultural products, requiring consultations with specific congressional committees. The International Trade Commission is requested to assess the economic effects of tariff reductions on U.S. industries and the economy as a whole. The USTR must notify congressional committees of products for tariff liberalization in negotiations. If any other import-sensitive agricultural products are identified for tariff reduction, or if a country requests a reduction, USTR must take action. The Trade Representative must notify congressional committees of products for tariff reductions in negotiations for the FTAA. Agricultural negotiations could face challenges when specific commodities are discussed, with some Latin American countries seeking increased access to the U.S. market for products that compete with U.S. producers. U.S. commodity groups and agribusiness aim for more opportunities in the Latin American market. The United States, Brazil, and other countries are negotiating agricultural trade agreements in the Latin American market. While the U.S. focuses on eliminating tariffs, Brazil wants to address domestic agricultural support issues. There are differing views on how to handle this in the negotiations, with a potential compromise needed in the next three weeks. The outcome of the Miami FTAA Ministerial on November 17-21 will be influenced by whether a compromise emerges in the next three weeks. U.S. agricultural interests have presented their views on the FTAA negotiations to USTR officials, but there is a lukewarm response or opposition from the U.S. agricultural sector. There is a belief that U.S. agriculture may benefit more from a multilateral WTO agreement than an FTAA agreement. If an FTAA agreement reflecting 1998 objectives is reached, U.S. farm policymakers may face challenges in opening the market to import-sensitive farm products. The potential outcome of the FTAA agreement could lead to interest in developing alternatives to the current sugar program and mechanisms to support commodities like vegetables, fruit, and orange juice against increased import competition."
