The amendment to Section 199(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows for contract manufacturing or production arrangements where one person can be eligible for the deduction if all parties agree in writing. For the deduction under this section, the person is treated as performing specific activities under the arrangement, and no other person is considered to be performing those activities. A contract manufacturing or production arrangement involves a person contracting with unrelated parties for the manufacture, production, growth, or extraction of qualifying production property or a qualified film. The Secretary will set regulations to determine substantial contribution through US employee activities in manufacturing, production, growth, or extraction of qualifying production property. Factors determining production property include oversight, direction of activities, physical transformation, material selection, vendor ownership, and control of raw materials. The curr_chunk discusses management of risk, cost reduction, efficiency initiatives, logistics control, quality control activities, product design, and trade secrets in manufacturing processes. The curr_chunk discusses the transfer of intellectual property and technology for manufacturing purposes, along with other activities determined by the Secretary. It also includes a safe harbor provision for determining substantial contribution based on economic risk of loss in material costs for production. For production within the United States to qualify as making a substantial contribution, employees must be involved in manufacturing, production, growth, or extraction. Economic risk of loss is determined by bearing ultimate responsibility for direct material costs, unaffected by certain factors. The determination of economic risk of loss includes contractual requirements for insuring direct materials and liability for breach of performance. Direct material cost encompasses materials integral to production property and those consumed in production. Effective Date. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after the enactment of this Act, with an option for retroactive application if certain conditions are met. The amendments made by this section provide safe harbors and do not affect eligibility for a deduction under section 199 of the Internal Revenue Code for persons contracting to manufacture, produce, grow, or extract specific property."
