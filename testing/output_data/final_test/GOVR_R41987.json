Examples include blogs, forums, YouTube, LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. It can be accessed through various devices. Social media has evolved rapidly in the past decade, enabling new ways of interaction and information sharing. It has also played a significant role in emergencies and disasters, with platforms like Facebook hosting emergency-related organizations. Social media is used by emergency and disaster-related organizations, universities, private and nonprofit sectors, and state and local governments for information dissemination, communication, and coordination. It is also utilized at the community and household level for responding to emergencies, with examples such as warning others of unsafe situations, creating volunteer groups, and raising funds for disaster relief. A study by the American Red Cross in 2012 found that 40% of respondents would use social tools to inform others they were safe, indicating the increasing use of social media in crisis situations. Social media is utilized during emergencies and disasters for information dissemination, communication, and coordination. It allows people to communicate when traditional lines of communication are unavailable, such as during power outages. Social media can be used to disseminate public safety information and as an emergency management tool through inputs. Social media is used as an emergency management tool for communication, warnings, assistance requests, situational awareness, damage estimates, investigations, and post-incident analysis in emergencies and disasters. Its applications vary between governmental and non-governmental entities. Social media is utilized by emergency management organizations to coordinate and send notifications for training events and mobilize first responders during incidents when traditional call systems fail. For example, during Hurricane Gustav, a Community Emergency Response Team used social media to notify team members and update status messages. Social media is also used to disseminate public safety information before, during, and after incidents. Social media is used by organizations to provide public safety information before, during, and after incidents. For example, the Department of Health and Human Services used Twitter to share Zika virus prevention tips. Social media is also utilized for community outreach and customer service, gathering feedback on safety-related topics. During emergencies, social media offers real-time updates, such as Orlando authorities informing the public about the Pulse nightclub shootings and the Boston Police Department updating citizens throughout the Boston Marathon bombings. The Boston Police Department and other agencies use social media for real-time updates during emergencies. The National Weather Service alerts citizens about road conditions during snowstorms. The U.S. Geological Survey provides automated river levels during floods in Texas. Federal emergency alerts include the Personal Localized Alerting Network (PLAN) system. The Personal Localized Alerting Network (PLAN) system, implemented in 2011, expands emergency alert notifications to mobile phones through geographically targeted alerts sent via cell towers. Government officials can target alerts to specific areas, pushing information to dedicated receivers with PLAN-enabled devices. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) oversees the Integrated Public Alert and Warnings System (IPAWS), allowing over 150 entities to transmit messages to cell phones using Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA). Social media plays a crucial role in disseminating crisis information during emergencies, with platforms like Twitter and Instagram being used to share updates and safety statuses. For instance, during Hurricane Sandy, millions of tweets and images were generated within hours. Additionally, Facebook's \"safety check\" feature was activated during the Paris terrorist attacks to allow users to inform their loved ones about their safety status. Social media can disseminate crisis information during emergencies, with features like Facebook's \"safety check\" used during the Paris terrorist attacks. Crowdsourcing and crisis maps are also valuable sources of information during incidents. For example, the U.S. Geological Survey's \"Did You Feel It?\" project collects reports to create intensity maps for earthquakes. Crisis maps combine scattered information from the Internet onto a single map for users to access storm paths, flood zones, evacuation routes, shelter locations, and power outage areas. Social media is utilized to alert emergency managers and officials by monitoring information flows from various sources during incidents, aiding in establishing situational awareness. Social media is crucial for establishing situational awareness during incidents, allowing first responders to gather real-time information, assess victim needs, and direct resources effectively. It also provides the public with a communication channel to interact with the government. Social media is changing emergency communications by allowing two-way communication for requests for assistance, potentially supplementing or replacing traditional emergency systems like \"911\". Younger people are more likely to use social media for help and believe agencies should monitor their posts. Some older adults are also using social media and may develop similar expectations for quick responses from agencies. Emergency managers may need to embrace social media technology to meet public needs, although feasibility may be questioned during high-volume periods. Social media is used for recovery efforts, managing donations, organizing volunteers, and providing information on available assistance at different levels of government. Social media is used for recovery efforts, managing donations, organizing volunteers, and providing information on available assistance at different levels of government, including FEMA Individual Assistance grants and other recovery programs like the American Red Cross and Small Business Administration's Disaster Loan Program. Social media can help raise funds through private contributions when individuals and households do not qualify for federal assistance, but it cannot fully replace it. Recovery from large-scale disasters can cost billions of dollars, with social media accelerating the damage estimate process by transmitting images of damaged structures. The damage estimate process is accelerated by using social media to transmit images of damaged structures like dams, levees, bridges, and buildings. A smart phone application in Kansas helps the Army Corps of Engineers identify and report structural weaknesses in levees by geotagging problem areas. This has improved efficiency, speed, and accuracy in detecting and responding to levee failures, while also reducing human error. Congressional interest has been sparked in better incorporating social media at the federal level for emergency and disaster response. The federal government is exploring ways to utilize social media for disaster response. FEMA Administrator met with tech companies to discuss using digital tools for public service. Future applications may include mobile FEMA websites for information access and communication between various groups. The Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications Committee on Homeland Security held hearings to enhance social media efforts for disaster preparedness. Crowdsourcing information with geotagged coordinates can improve the quality and timeliness of critical information during disasters. During Hurricane Sandy, crowdsourcing was used to identify filling stations with gasoline. Student volunteers called stations in New Jersey to check availability, providing data for over 1,000 stations for the Sandy crisis map. The Department of Energy's call center used this information. Social media is increasingly used during emergencies, with 20% of Americans receiving emergency information from apps. American Red Cross surveys in 2012 found that 76% of Americans expect help within three hours of posting a request. The Red Cross found that 76% of Americans expect help within three hours of posting a request on social media, with 40% using social media to inform others they are safe. Social media is also used by roughly 75% of users to seek information about incidents. Legislation was introduced in Congress to enhance public-private partnerships for communication and collaboration. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 mandates the establishment of a social media working group within the Department of Homeland Security. The group must submit an annual report to Congress reviewing current and emerging social media technologies for preparedness and response to terrorist attacks and emergencies, sharing best practices, and making recommendations to improve DHS's use of social media for emergency management. The DHS is required to share information among its components and with state and local governments, review training on social media use during emergencies, and coordinate with the private sector on legal and security concerns. Another bill mandates a pilot program with the American Red Cross to leverage social media for preparedness and response, including disseminating public information and delivering supplies to affected areas. The DHS is mandated to collaborate with the American Red Cross on a pilot program using social media for preparedness and response. Various federal entities utilize social media for emergencies and disasters in different capacities, with no single platform being used across the federal government. The federal government uses social media in various ways, with statistics on its use not always available. Social media is constantly evolving with new applications and technologies. Federal agencies negotiate terms of service agreements with social media vendors to ensure compatibility with federal law, policies, and regulations. FEMA utilizes various social media platforms to disseminate information and coordinate recovery efforts, including Facebook, Youtube, and Twitter. They provide guidance on what to do before, during, and after an incident, as well as information on applying for federal and nongovernmental assistance. FEMA uses social media to share key messages, information on disaster assistance programs, and weather alerts. They also utilize social media management systems to filter out non-critical information and focus on emergency management tasks. FEMA utilizes social media to gather crowdsourced disaster-related information within the United States through their app \"Disaster Reporter.\" This allows various stakeholders to contribute and view information on a publicly accessible map. FEMA has the capacity to deploy staff from Regional Offices for surge support in social media operations during emergencies. Their social media policies are guided by the Web 2.0 policy, which includes guidelines for third party outlets, moderating discussions, and records management. The Office of External Affairs at FEMA has a digital engagement section responsible for designing social media items and assisting with social listening during emergencies. The Small Business Administration (SBA) provides low-interest loans for businesses and individuals affected by disasters. SBA uses social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube to engage with users and share information. They also have an e-newsletter with recovery advice for subscribers. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) coordinates preparedness activities and oversees public health agencies like CDC, FDA, and NIH. HHS uses social media platforms for their National Health and Security Strategy to prepare communities for health threats during emergencies. The HHS working group, part of the Department of Health and Human Services, monitors social media for public health issues during emergencies, dispels rumors, and coordinates with other organizations. They do not have dedicated web pages for incidents or collect social media data. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) collaborates with states, localities, and other nations to detect, investigate, and prevent diseases and injuries. They use various social media platforms but do not have incident-specific accounts. CDC responds to disasters, supports recovery efforts, and has multiple profiles addressing public health topics. CDC primarily uses social media for disseminating public health information and obtaining situational awareness during emergencies. They do not respond to individual requests for assistance but coordinate with other agencies through the emergency operations center. The Social Media Council oversees CDC's social media activities, and during emergencies, information is coordinated through the Joint Information Center to ensure consistency across platforms. The social media team can surge in capacity during crisis events, as seen during the 2014 Ebola response. The National Guard, a state and federal organization with over 450,000 personnel, is frequently used for emergency response. It operates under state governors' control and can perform law enforcement functions in a state capacity. Additionally, it can be activated under Title 32 of the U.S. Code to respond to emergencies and disasters. The National Guard can be activated under Title 32 of the U.S. Code for emergencies and disasters, remaining under state control while receiving pay and benefits from the federal government. The National Guard Bureau serves as the communication channel between the Departments of the Army and Air Force and the states, using social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for public education and internal communication. The National Guard Bureau uses social media for situational awareness and rumor control, following policy guidance outlined in the Department of Defense's \"Web and Internet-Based Capabilities (IBC) Policies.\" They utilize response-specific analytics for data-driven decisions in emergencies and disasters. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers provides emergency response, flood control, and navigable channel maintenance. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers deploys trained teams for emergency response activities, including power provision, debris removal, and structural assessments. They utilize various social media platforms for information dissemination and coordination with FEMA and NWS. They do not use incident-specific web pages or respond to individual requests. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers collects Facebook data for FY2015, not specific to disasters. The NWS, part of NOAA, uses Twitter and Facebook for weather updates. Local and national offices utilize social media for community service. The National Weather Service (NWS) uses social media to provide information about weather events, including safety information on various hazards. They may use social media to warn users about approaching hurricanes and assist emergency response efforts post-event. NWS also conducts Service Assessments to evaluate their products and services after significant meteorological events. NWS conducts Service Assessments to evaluate products and services, including social media use. Assessments praise NWS's use of social media in increasing awareness of weather threats. NWS also sends Wireless Emergency Alerts to mobile users during critical weather events. Surveys show citizens expect help within three hours of posting on social media. Some citizens expect help within three hours of posting on social media, but some jurisdictions lack the resources to meet this expectation during large-scale disasters. The West Virginia State Police advises against using social media for immediate help due to monitoring limitations. Congress could explore using social media for assistance requests and develop policies to support state, local, and federal agencies. Congress could investigate the use of social media for emergency assistance requests and consider implementing a pilot program to evaluate its effectiveness. Public-private partnerships could help accelerate the diffusion of technology from the private sector to the public sector. The new technology developed for social media in emergencies could be shared with the public sector through public-private partnerships. Proponents argue that PPPs would bring additional resources, increase private sector involvement, reduce costs, and achieve more objectives efficiently. Detractors, however, believe PPPs are complicated and require too much. Detractors argue that PPPs are complex and require excessive oversight, raising concerns about potential fraud and misuse of technology grants. Inaccurate or outdated information spread on social media during disasters can hinder response efforts and jeopardize the safety of first responders and the community. The extent of this problem is debated, with some studies suggesting social media information is generally accurate. Some studies suggest that social media information is generally accurate, despite concerns about misinformation during disasters. The volume of information generated during crises can be overwhelming for emergency managers to sift through. Unofficial sources are often trusted by the public, with reports indicating they may be more desirable than official social media websites. During disasters, people turn to Twitter and Facebook for immediate information not found on traditional channels. Congress could investigate accuracy of disaster information and strategies to handle influx of data and prevent misinformation. There is concern about intentional dissemination of inaccurate information on social media to disrupt response efforts, including potential terrorist tactics like secondary attacks on first responders. Officials and responders using social media for situational awareness should be cautious of malicious use and develop mitigation measures. Some incidents may result in prolonged power outages, while smartphones and tablets may have limited battery life during emergencies. During emergencies, smartphones and tablets may have limited battery life, and cellular towers may be down, hindering their use. Internet and cloud technology are valuable only with power and connectivity. Innovative solutions like deployable mobile networks and charging stations could help residents during large-scale disasters. Congress could require FEMA to deploy mobile networks in declared disasters and consider other methods for device recharging during power outages. Some may argue that traditional forms of communication should be used alongside social media during emergencies to avoid overreliance on technology. Concerns also exist about overwhelming Internet traffic during crisis situations, as seen in Belgium after the terrorist attacks in Brussels. Congress could examine potential issues with Internet traffic in the United States during emergencies. The federal government's expenditure on social media during disasters is unclear, including the cost of monitoring and responding to incoming messages. This information is crucial for Congress to assess how resources are being utilized and allocated. The financial information on social media expenditure during disasters is essential for congressional oversight and evaluating effectiveness. Privacy concerns exist regarding data mining of personal information by the federal government. The E-Government Act of 2002 mandates agencies to assess the privacy impact of any substantially revised actions. The E-Government Act of 2002 requires federal agencies to conduct Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) for new Information Technology Systems that collect personally identifiable information. The assessments use Fair Information Privacy Principles (FIPPs) to evaluate and mitigate privacy impacts. In March 2011, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a PIA for the Use of Unidirectional Social Media Applications. The PIA on the Use of Unidirectional Social Media Applications by DHS covers personally identifiable information (PII) access, use, retention, and sharing. It does not include monitoring, law enforcement, or intelligence activities. Privacy laws can limit the government's use of social media data during disasters, prompting efforts to develop software for removing personal information from messages. Social media plays a crucial role in emergency management by providing accurate and timely information for public safety. Congress may need to amend laws to allow for the removal of personal information from social media messages during disasters. This could help improve communication and response efforts during large-scale disasters. The use of social media for emergencies and disasters is expected to increase, leading to a greater expectation for government to provide information through social media. Many emergency managers and agencies have already adopted social media for this purpose. Social media applications in emergency management can be categorized as output and input, with the federal government mainly using it for output. However, there is potential for social media to be a more effective emergency management tool beyond just disseminating information. The potential of social media as an emergency management tool is being realized, with a focus on reorienting towards inputs. Some argue that federal involvement may hinder the flexibility of social media, suggesting state and local leadership with federal support. Suggestions include pilot programs and public-private partnerships. Congress could mandate FEMA to develop 3G and 4G mobile networks. Congress could require FEMA to develop and deploy 3G and 4G mobile networks in presidentially declared disasters, provide grants to state and local governments for social media capabilities, investigate federal social media use for decision-making, and address challenges like inaccurate crisis information and technical limitations."
