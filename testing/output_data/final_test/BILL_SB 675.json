    "title": "SB 675",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 1262.5 of the Health and Safety Code requires hospitals to have a written discharge planning policy ensuring appropriate posthospital care arrangements are made for patients at risk of adverse health consequences upon discharge. Counseling may also be provided to patients and family members for posthospital care preparation. As part of discharge planning, hospitals must allow patients to designate a family caregiver for posthospital care. If the patient is unable to do so upon admission, they or their legal guardian must designate a caregiver once conscious. If no caregiver is designated, the hospital must document the declination. The hospital policy requires notifying the patient's designated family caregiver of discharge or transfer promptly, even if unable to contact them. Notification must be documented in the patient's medical record. The hospital must inform the patient and family caregiver about post-discharge health care requirements, including medication education and counseling. The patient's legal decision-maker should also receive this information if the patient is unable to make decisions. The hospital must provide culturally competent medication education and counseling to the patient and caregiver, allowing for questions about posthospital care needs. Upon transfer to a skilled nursing or intermediate care facility, a transfer summary with essential patient information must be provided, including diagnosis, treatment plan, medications, and rehabilitation potential. The patient and legal representative must receive a copy of the summary. Additionally, at discharge, the hospital must provide information on all medications dispensed. A hospital must provide patients in need of long-term care at discharge with contact information for agencies offering community-based long-term care options. Contracts between hospitals and health care plans cannot restrict compliance with this requirement. Discharge planning policies for hospitals must be appropriate to the patient's condition and destination, and meet their needs. Hospitals are not required to delay discharge or transfer a patient, or disclose information without proper consent. These policies do not override privacy and information security laws regarding protected health information. A family caregiver is defined as a relative, friend, or neighbor who provides unpaid assistance for someone with a physical or mental disability. No reimbursement is required for this act as it pertains to creating new crimes or infractions within the California Constitution."
