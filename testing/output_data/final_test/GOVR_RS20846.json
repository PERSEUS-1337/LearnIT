    "content": "Executive orders are a way for the President to exercise authority, but they must be based on power from the Constitution or delegated by Congress. The President cannot use executive orders to implement policies that go against the law. The report discusses the President's constitutional authority to issue executive orders and other written directives, as well as the legal framework used by courts to analyze their validity. It also explores the roles of the President and Congress in modifying and revoking executive orders. The President communicates directives to the executive branch through executive orders and proclamations, which have the force of law when based on constitutional or statutory authority. Executive orders govern government officials, while proclamations primarily affect private individuals. The President's power over individual citizens is limited to constitutional or statutory provisions. The President's proclamations are not legally binding unless based on constitutional or statutory authority. Executive orders, presidential memoranda, and proclamations can direct government actions. Presidential directives can have the force of law if issued under a legitimate claim of authority. Executive orders and proclamations must be published in the Federal Register, while presidential memoranda are published when they have general applicability and legal effect. The President's authority to issue executive orders, presidential memoranda, and proclamations stems from implied constitutional and statutory authority. This power is derived from Article II of the U.S. Constitution, which vests the executive power in the President and requires the faithful execution of laws. Executive orders, presidential memoranda, and proclamations can have the force of law if issued under a legitimate claim of authority. The authority to issue executive orders, presidential memoranda, and proclamations has been utilized by every President since the inception of the Republic. Executive orders have been contentious, covering controversial areas like internment camps and equal treatment in the armed services. They have also been used for mundane tasks like directing federal agencies. The President's ability to issue executive orders is not dictated by constitutional or statutory authority. The President's use of executive orders and memoranda has been a historical practice. While executive orders are often used for matters requiring public awareness, memoranda are more routine in directing agencies to carry out tasks consistent with the law. Some argue that the broad use of executive orders constitutes unilateral lawmaking that encroaches on congressional power. The Supreme Court's decision in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer established a framework for analyzing the legality of executive actions. The Supreme Court's decision in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer established a framework for analyzing the legality of executive actions. In 1952, President Truman issued an executive order to take possession of steel mills during the Korean War, which was challenged and declared unconstitutional by the Court. Justice Jackson's framework in his concurring opinion has become more influential than the majority opinion by Justice Black. The Supreme Court's decision in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer established a framework for analyzing the legality of executive actions. In this case, the Court concluded that the President's executive order was effectively a legislative act and therefore unconstitutional, as it lacked authorization from Congress or the Constitution. This decision emphasized the separation of powers doctrine, highlighting that the lawmaking power is entrusted to Congress alone. Justice Black's majority opinion in Youngstown emphasized the separation of powers doctrine, entrusting lawmaking power to Congress alone. While there were five concurrences in the decision, Justice Jackson's has proven to be the most influential, establishing a tripartite scheme for analyzing presidential actions in relation to constitutional and congressional authority. Jackson's concurrence suggests that presidential powers may be influenced by congressional action. Justice Jackson's tripartite scheme categorizes presidential actions based on their relationship with congressional authority. When the President acts with Congress's authorization, his authority is at its peak, supported by strong presumptions and wide judicial latitude. In cases where Congress has not granted or denied authority, the President can still act on his independent powers. The President's authority is at its \"lowest ebb\" when he takes actions incompatible with Congress's will, relying solely on his own constitutional powers. Justice Jackson noted that courts typically uphold exclusive presidential control by disabling congressional authority. Justice Jackson observed that courts generally sustain exclusive presidential control by disabling Congress from acting on the subject. He cautioned that presidential actions with \"conclusive and preclusive\" power could disrupt the constitutional equilibrium. Applying this to President Truman's seizure of the steel mills, Justice Jackson found that Congress had not authorized the action, making it unsustainable under the first category. Additionally, Congress had conflicting statutory policies, ruling out defense under the second category. The President's action could only be upheld if it met certain criteria. Jackson concluded that the President's seizure of steel mills could only be justified by relying on any remaining executive power not controlled by Congress. This left the President in a vulnerable constitutional position, as the action was within congressional power. Justice Jackson's framework for analyzing presidential actions has continued to influence modern legal interpretations. The Court upheld executive orders nullifying non-Iranian interests in Iranian assets and suspending settlement claims, citing broad presidential authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Congress had implicitly approved the President's authority in dealing with international crises through claims settlements. Not all courts use Justice Jackson's framework for evaluating executive orders. In 1995, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit overturned an executive order by President Clinton, ruling it invalid due to conflicting with the National Labor Relations Act. The court did not refer to the Youngstown decision when making this determination. The U.S. Court of Appeals overturned President Clinton's executive order in 1995 for conflicting with the National Labor Relations Act. Executive orders lack stability and can be modified or revoked by the President or successors. Presidents have modified orders to influence agency rulemaking processes, as seen in the timeline starting with President Gerald Ford's Administration. President Gerald Ford issued Executive Order 11821, requiring agencies to issue inflation impact statements for proposed regulations. President Jimmy Carter then mandated agencies to consider economic impacts and identify alternatives with Executive Order 12044. President Ronald Reagan revoked Carter's order and implemented Executive Order 12291, directing agencies to implement rules only if benefits outweigh costs. President Clinton later modified the system with Executive Order 12866, requiring a cost-benefit analysis for rules with significant economic impact. Executive Order 12866, issued by President Clinton, modified the system established during the Reagan Administration by easing cost-benefit analysis requirements and emphasizing agencies' duty to fulfill commitments from Congress. President George W. Bush later issued Executive Orders 13258 and 13422, amending Clinton's order by focusing on regulatory planning and review, defining guidance documents, and applying parts of the Clinton executive order to guidance documents. President Barack Obama revoked Executive Orders 13258 and 13422, instructing agencies to rescind rules implementing President Bush's orders. He also issued Executive Order 13563, which reaffirmed regulatory review principles and emphasized public participation and agency coordination. Obama's Executive Order 12866 focused on simplifying regulations for industries with significant requirements, promoting public participation, and ensuring the objectivity of scientific information. Executive Order 13579 extended these goals to independent regulatory agencies, with Congress able to influence the effectiveness of executive orders. Congress has the authority to modify or nullify executive orders based on the President's constitutional authority. Repealing an order or removing its underlying authority can negate its legal effect. Congressional repeals are rare due to potential conflicts with the President's interests. Less than 4% of executive orders have been modified by Congress. Congress can revoke an executive order by enacting legislation stating it \"shall not have legal effect.\" For example, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 revoked a 1912 executive order creating the Naval Petroleum Reserve Numbered 2. In 1992, Congress revoked an executive order by President George H. W. Bush to establish a human fetal tissue bank for research purposes. Congress can inhibit executive orders by denying funds for implementation. If Congress supports an executive order, it may codify the order for greater stability. Congress can codify a presidential executive order for stability, even with modifications, or ratify an order issued on questionable legal authority."
