    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Black Lung Disability Trust Fund Debt Restructuring Act.\" The Black Lung Disability Trust Fund was created in 1978 to shift the cost of compensating victims of black lung disease from the Federal Government to the coal mining industry. The Trust Fund is funded by excise taxes on coal and can receive repayable advances from the Treasury for benefit payments. Repayment with interest is required to the general fund of the Treasury. Since 1990, Trust Fund revenues from coal excise taxes have covered benefit payments and costs but not repaid the Treasury advances, leading to growing debt each year. The Trust Fund's annual interest charges now exceed benefit payments, and its total excise tax revenues. The Trust Fund's debt to the Treasury is around $8.2 billion and will continue to grow without action, leading to insolvency. Refinancing the debt is necessary to restore long-term fiscal solvency. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The curr_chunk defines \"repayable advance\" as an amount appropriated to the Trust Fund for benefit payments and other authorized expenditures, to be repaid when funds are available. It also explains the \"market value of the outstanding repayable advances, plus accrued interest\" as the present value of principal and interest payments. The curr_chunk explains that the refinancing date is 2 days after the enactment of the Act, and the Treasury 1-year rate is determined by the Secretary of the Treasury based on market yields. The Treasury rate, determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, considers market yields on comparable US obligations. Refinancing of outstanding principal and unpaid interest on repayable advances is addressed in Section 4. On the refinancing date, the Trust Fund will pay the market value of outstanding repayable advances plus accrued interest by transferring sums to the Treasury's general fund. This includes issuing obligations to the Secretary of the Treasury and using appropriations from section 5 if needed. If the Trust Fund cannot repay the obligations, additional issuance may be required. The Trust Fund may issue obligations to the Secretary of the Treasury to repay obligations and make benefit payments if unable to do so, with a maturity of 1 year and bearing interest at the Treasury 1 year rate. The Trust Fund is authorized to issue obligations to the Secretary of the Treasury, who can purchase them for this purpose. The Secretary of the Treasury can use proceeds from the sale of securities to purchase Trust Fund obligations, extending the purposes for which securities may be issued. SEC. 5. APPROPRIATIONS. An amount is appropriated to the Trust Fund to pay the difference between the market value of outstanding repayable advances and the proceeds from obligations issued to the Secretary of the Treasury. SEC. 6. PREPAYMENT OF TRUST FUND OBLIGATIONS. SEC. 6. The Trust Fund can repay obligations to the Secretary of the Treasury before maturity by paying a prepayment price equal to the Treasury yield on comparable marketable obligations. SEC. 7. Excise tax levels are extended. SEC. 7. Extension of excise tax levels to the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund until all obligations are paid off."
