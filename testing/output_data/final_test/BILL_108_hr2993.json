    "content": "The Act is titled the \"District of Columbia and United States Territories Circulating Quarter Dollar Program Act\" and involves the issuance of redesigned quarter dollars honoring the District of Columbia and each of the territories. Section 5112 of title 31, United States Code, is amended to include a new subsection for the redesign and issuance of circulating quarter dollars honoring the District of Columbia and the territories in 2009. The coins will have designs emblematic of the District of Columbia and the territories, with flexibility in the placement of inscriptions. The redesign and issuance of circulating quarter dollars in 2009 will feature inscriptions on the reverse side and designs emblematic of the District of Columbia and territories like Puerto Rico, Guam, and others. The redesign of circulating quarter dollars in 2009 will include 6 designs selected by the Secretary in consultation with the chief executive of the District of Columbia or the honored territory, the Commission of Fine Arts, and reviewed by the Citizens Coinage. The redesign of circulating quarter dollars in 2009 will involve a selection process developed by the Secretary, allowing participation from various officials, artists, engravers, and the general public to ensure dignified designs are chosen. Frivolous designs will not be selected to maintain the pride of the Nation's coinage and currency. The Secretary will not choose frivolous or inappropriate designs for minted quarter dollars. No head and shoulders portrait or bust of any person, living or dead, and no portrait of a living person can be included in the design. All coins minted under this subsection will be considered numismatic items. The Secretary may mint and issue quarter dollars in uncirculated and proof qualities as determined. The Secretary may mint and issue quarter dollars with 90 percent silver and 10 percent copper, honoring the District of Columbia and territories in 2009 in a specific order. The subsection outlines provisions for the application of the minting of quarter dollars with designs emblematic of territories in the event of statehood or independence. The subsection defines \"territory\" as specific regions including Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the US Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands. The House of Representatives passed the bill on March 25, 2004."
