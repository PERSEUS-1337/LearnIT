    "content": "The \"New Mexico Forest Health and Fire Prevention Act of 1998\" includes sections on short title, findings, definitions, forest health program, fire prevention fund, appropriations, and audit requirements. Congress finds that proactive management of National Forest System lands in New Mexico is necessary to prevent catastrophic fires. Utilizing local communities for forest thinning and creating businesses from harvested wood can help mitigate the increasing number and severity of wildfires. These fires result from high tree densities, species composition, and structure outside the historic range, leading to soil erosion, air and water quality degradation, loss of wildlife habitat, and damage to forest resources. Serious destruction or degradation of important forest resources occurs in all regions of New Mexico, posing a significant threat to human life, property, wildlife habitat, and other forest resources. Management activities should involve local communities to prevent catastrophic wildfires. Restoration and protection of important forest resources in New Mexico require active forest management involving rural communities to integrate environmentally compatible harvesting techniques and develop local businesses driven by market forces. Adequate funding is needed to address the increasing backlog of unfunded projects in the National Forest System units efficiently. A comprehensive, Statewide effort is necessary to restore and protect forest resources in an organized, community-wide, timely, and scientific manner. Immediate action is needed to improve National Forest System lands in New Mexico where serious resource degradation has been identified. Inventory and analysis of fire conditions are necessary to reverse destruction of important forest resources effectively.

Inventory and analysis of fire conditions are necessary to reverse destruction of important forest resources effectively. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines key terms such as \"Federal forest lands\" as National Forest System lands in New Mexico, \"community\" as rural areas surrounded by Federal forest lands, \"Fund\" as the Forest Health and Fire Prevention Fund, and \"implementation date\" as January 15, 2000 or the first day of the 19th full month after enactment. The Secretary may designate January 15 as the implementation date. Land management plan refers to a plan prepared by the Forest Service for Federal forest lands. New Mexico Program is for restoring and protecting forest resources in New Mexico. Overhead expenses include common services and indirect expenses. The terms defined by expense items 1-10 in the Forest Timber Cost Efficiency Study Final Report are related to general administration expenses and program support costs. A recovery area is an identified Federal forest land area experiencing small stand timber and woody tree encroachment. A recovery project, as defined by the District 3 Regional Forester, aims to restore or protect forest resources in a designated area through various methods like thinning, prescribed fire, habitat improvement, and water quality measures. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Agriculture and is related to soil stabilization, water quality improvement, and protection. SEC. 4. NEW MEXICO PROGRAM OF FOREST HEALTH AND FIRE PREVENTION. The District 3 Regional Forester in New Mexico will start a program to restore and protect forest resources on Federal lands through recovery projects. The initial project will involve thinning the Monument Canyon Research Natural Area to improve the Ponderosa Pine Forests typical of the region. The research implementation for treatments to reduce small diameter trees will be monitored by leading research scientists in the southwest. Initial project standards and guidelines will be provided by scientists at the Monument Canyon Research Natural Area. Continued monitoring and information transfer with these scientists will guide modifications for other recovery projects. The Secretary will allocate funds for recovery areas during the New Mexico Program. The Secretary will allocate funds from the Forest Health and Fire Prevention Fund to Region 3 of the Forest Service for conducting recovery projects in identified recovery areas. The District 3 Regional Forester will identify and prioritize recovery areas for these projects, which will be carried out as a 5-year recovery project. The District 3 Regional Forester will select and decide on recovery projects for identified areas, excluding National Wilderness Preservation System units or roadless areas on Federal forest lands designated for study. The District 3 Regional Forester in New Mexico will select recovery projects in designated areas where implementation is prohibited by law, court order, or land management plan. Total acreage for each project will be identified. Mexico must identify the total acreage, cost, and duration for each recovery project. They must ensure the acreage matches the Secretary's designation, prioritize economic benefits for local communities, follow the land management plan, and implement projects cost-effectively for successful forest recovery. SEC. 5. FOREST HEALTH AND FIRE PREVENTION FUND. Establishment of the Forest Health and Fire Prevention Fund on the Treasury books, administered by the Chief of the Forest Service. Credits to the fund include authorized amounts, unobligated amounts from the roads and trails fund, and the Federal share of revenues from recovery projects in New Mexico. The fund's use is specified for a certain time period. The Forest Health and Fire Prevention Fund is established and administered by the Chief of the Forest Service. Amounts in the Fund are available to the District 3 Regional Forester for the New Mexico program and recovery projects without further appropriation. Overhead expenses cannot be allocated to the Fund or its authorized activities. SEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. $12,000,000 authorized annually for Act implementation until September 30, 2005. Funds deposited in Forest Health and Fire Prevention Fund. Existing recovery project contracts remain valid until completion. SEC. 7. AUDIT REQUIREMENTS. The Comptroller General will conduct an audit of the New Mexico program after four fiscal years to assess its compliance with the Act, financial status of the Fund, and any achieved cost savings or efficiencies."
