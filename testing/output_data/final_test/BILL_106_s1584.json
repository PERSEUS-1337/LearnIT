    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Schuylkill River Valley National Heritage Area Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings. The Schuylkill River Valley played a significant role in the cultural, political, and industrial development of the United States. It was the first spine of modern industrial development in Pennsylvania and contributed to the struggle for nationhood. The region developed prosperous agricultural and charcoal iron industries, making Pennsylvania a center for iron production in the colonies. Today, the area continues to thrive as a significant anthracite mining region. The Schuylkill River Valley has a significant industrial base with textile mills and iron works. There is a commitment to repairing environmental damage caused by industrial activity and completing the Schuylkill River Trail. Assistance is needed for preserving the river's significance for transportation and agriculture. The Schuylkill River Valley has historical and cultural significance, prompting federal involvement in conservation efforts with the Schuylkill River Greenway Association and other bodies to preserve and interpret heritage for future generations. The Schuylkill River Valley in southeastern Pennsylvania aims to foster relationships with government, private sector, and communities to conserve heritage and pursue economic opportunities. Additionally, efforts focus on conserving and interpreting historical, cultural, natural, and recreational resources related to the area's industrial and cultural heritage. The Act defines key terms such as cooperative agreement, Heritage Area, management entity, management plan, Secretary, and State. It establishes the Schuylkill River Valley National Heritage Area in Pennsylvania. The Schuylkill River Valley National Heritage Area is established to preserve and interpret historical and cultural sites in the Schuylkill River watershed in Pennsylvania. The management entity is the Schuylkill River Greenway Association, and a cooperative agreement will be entered into by the Secretary to carry out this initiative. The cooperative agreement for the Schuylkill River Valley National Heritage Area includes information on objectives, management, goals, conservation, interpretation, management entity, and the role of the State. The management plan for the Schuylkill River Valley National Heritage Area is outlined in Section 5 of the cooperative agreement. The management entity must submit a management plan for the Heritage Area within 3 years of the Act's enactment. The plan should consider state, county, and local plans, involve residents and organizations in the area, identify funding sources, and outline actions for resource protection. The management plan for the Heritage Area should include an inventory of resources, recommendations for resource management policies, and the development of intergovernmental cooperative agreements to protect historical, cultural, recreational, and natural resources. The management plan for the Heritage Area must include an inventory of resources, recommendations for resource management policies, intergovernmental cooperative agreements, economic viability support, implementation program, coordination of local, state, and federal programs, and an interpretation plan. Failure to submit the plan within 3 years disqualifies the Heritage Area from receiving federal funding until the plan is received. The management entity may update the plan instead of developing a new one. The management entity can update and submit the Schuylkill Heritage Corridor Management Action Plan approved in March 1995 to meet the requirements of this section. SEC. 6.

The management entity in the Heritage Area aims to encourage economic viability through the management plan. It involves local governments adopting land use policies consistent with the goals of the plan, considering diverse interests, conducting quarterly public meetings, seeking approval for substantial changes from the Secretary, and ensuring proper utilization of Federal funds. The management entity in the Heritage Area must submit a report to the Secretary detailing accomplishments, expenses, income, and recipients of loans or grants. They must also provide all records for audit related to the expenditure of Federal funds and ensure receiving organizations do the same. The management entity must provide records for audit related to the expenditure of Federal funds and cannot use these funds to acquire real property.
