    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Voter Protection Hotline Act of 2011\" and includes findings. Congress finds that government funding supports voter hotlines at various levels, but the public lacks access to information on these programs, leading to confusion with multiple hotline numbers. The Department of Justice emphasizes the need for a national hotline to facilitate the voting process. The Department of Justice has established a hotline to provide information for voters, but despite this, voting irregularities were still widespread during the 2008 election cycle in Virginia. Issues included voters not receiving registration cards, names missing from voter rolls, and registration paperwork errors not being notified until after the deadline. During the 2008 election cycle in Virginia, voting irregularities were widespread. In one location, all seven voting machines failed, leading to a 7-hour and 15-minute wait for voters. St. Louis voters faced issues with unprocessed change of address forms, while in New York City, over 3,500 voter registration forms were delayed until after the election. Pennsylvania voters in cities reported not receiving absentee ballots by Election Day, causing problems at polling places. Voters at poorly prepared poll locations in Los Angeles County and elsewhere in California also faced issues. Many voters in Los Angeles County and California experienced ballot shortages and confusion on Election Day, leading to nearly 1,000,000 people voting by provisional ballot. Some voters were incorrectly instructed to vote provisionally, while others were not offered provisional ballots when needed. Wait times of up to 6 hours were reported at some polling places. The fifteenth amendment protects citizens' voting rights, but every election cycle, many face obstacles like misinformation and intimidation. In 2004, voters received misleading calls about polling locations and voting days. In 2008, voters faced various obstacles such as changed polling locations, misleading fliers, inaccurate information on absentee ballot deadlines, and confusion about voter ID requirements in Michigan. In 2008, misleading fliers in Philadelphia and other states spread false claims to deter citizens from voting, including threats of arrest for unpaid parking tickets and loss of benefits for students registering to vote at school. In 2008, Minnesota Majority posed as the Secretary of State's office to question voter registrations, while in Ohio, sample paper ballots with a confusing layout led to double-voting issues. SEC. 3.
