The text amends section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code to replace \"political organization\" with \"principal campaign committee\" and makes technical and conforming amendments to various subsections. The amendment to section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code includes changes such as substituting 'the highest rate' for 'the appropriate rates' in subsection (b) and updating the subsection heading to 'Principal Campaign Committee' in subsection (c). The section heading for section 527 is also amended. The amendment to section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code establishes rules for Principal Campaign Committees. The effective date for these changes is for taxable years starting after the enactment of the Act. Additionally, there is a provision for canceling loans to a Principal Campaign Committee that are included in the committee's taxable income. The amendment to section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code excludes canceled loans from a principal campaign committee's exempt function income. Contributions in the form of canceled loans or payments on loans from lenders are not considered exempt function income. The amendment excludes canceled loans from a principal campaign committee's exempt function income. It applies to loans made by a bank or a candidate for Congress, with contributions not exceeding $2,000. The amendment is effective for taxable years after the enactment of the Act. SEC. 528 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 states that contributions exceeding $100 to political organizations must be included in gross income. Contributions over $100 to political organizations must be included in gross income and are subject to tax. Political organizations are defined as entities primarily accepting contributions or making expenditures for exempt functions. The table of sections for part VI is amended by adding a new item (527(e)). Sec. 528 states that contributions over $100 to political organizations will be included in gross income. The effective date for these amendments is for taxable years after the enactment of the Act."
