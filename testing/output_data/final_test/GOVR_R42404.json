    "content": "Federal lands cannot be taxed by state and local governments, leading to concerns about the loss to the tax base and burden on local taxpayers. Congress has enacted federal programs to offset this loss, but is re-examining them due to concerns about adequacy, rising payment levels, deficit reduction, and expiration of mandatory spending. These programs are mainly under the jurisdiction of the Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service. The National Wildlife Refuge Fund (NWRF) program, enacted in 1935, shares revenue generated on federal lands with local governments. The program, under the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), allows funds to be used for any governmental purpose. Amendments in 1978 made the program more complex, with payments to local governments. The 1978 amendments to the National Wildlife Refuge Fund (NWRF) program increased authorized funding levels based on a complex formula. The increase in funding cannot be solely explained by the growth in eligible land, but rather by payments for lands acquired or donated to the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS). The interaction between NWRF and the Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program further complicates the total payment a county receives for federal lands. The National Wildlife Refuge Fund (NWRF) program and the Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program are federal land payment programs managed by DOI. NWRF payments for FWS lands have never been fully funded since 1977, requiring supplements from annual appropriations. NWRF payments have ranged from 22% to 93% of the authorized amount, impacting local governments. The National Wildlife Refuge Fund (NWRF) program has seen a decrease in payments from 22% in FY1991 to a low of 22% in FY2010. This has had a more significant impact on counties with FWS lands compared to other federal ownerships. The report outlines key features of NWRF, including lands under FWS jurisdiction, sources of revenue, payment formulas, PILT payments for certain FWS lands, exceptions to payment calculations, changing authorization levels, and falling annual appropriations. Options for program changes are also discussed. Lands and waters under FWS jurisdiction are categorized into six management categories. Three categories, including National Wildlife Refuges, Waterfowl Production Areas, and Coordination Areas, make up the National Wildlife Refuge System, covering 49% of lands under FWS jurisdiction. Waterfowl Production Areas are mainly found in Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota. Coordination Areas are managed by states under cooperative agreements with FWS. National Fish Hatcheries are facilities where fish are raised to replenish stocks, mitigate water projects, manage fishery resources, and enhance recreational activities. National Monuments, designated by Presidential Proclamation, include marine areas established under the Antiquities Act of 1906. This category encompasses Service-managed areas outside the Refuge System. National monument areas within the Refuge System are included in the 'National Wildlife Refuges' category total. FWS lands and waters not part of the Refuge System make up 51% of FWS jurisdiction, totaling 306.1 million acres. FWS lands are categorized based on ownership, jurisdiction, acquisition, and eligibility for NWRF payments. Criteria for eligibility include specific land reservations. The NWRF payments eligibility criteria include lands reserved from the public domain and acquired lands, with specific payment options. FWS lands under primary jurisdiction are eligible, while lands with secondary jurisdiction do not receive payments. The NWRF payments eligibility criteria exclude certain lands, such as wildlife coordination areas managed by states, acquired lands in U.S. Minor Outlying Islands, lands in American Samoa, submerged lands outside state jurisdiction, and public domain lands under secondary FWS jurisdiction. The NWRF payments are not eligible for lands under secondary FWS jurisdiction unless they generate net revenues. Payments to counties are mandatory based on receipts from the sale or lease of goods and services from FWS lands. In FY2012, these receipts totaled $7.3 million, with $3.3 million deducted for direct FWS expenses. In FY2012, $3.3 million was deducted for direct FWS expenses, leaving $4.0 million available for payment under NWRF in FY2013. If net revenues are insufficient, discretionary appropriations can be used to meet the shortfall. From FY1978 to FY2012, receipts and appropriations have not met the authorized level, except in 1981. The NWRF payment calculation process involves determining FWS jurisdiction, land acquisition status, net receipts, fair market value, and purchase price for each county. This information is used to calculate each county's authorized level, which is then summed to determine the total authorized level for the program. NWRF provides payments for FWS land under the agency's primary or sole jurisdiction. NWRF provides payments for FWS land based on jurisdiction and land acquisition status. Different formulas apply to acquired versus reserved lands. No payment for lands under secondary FWS jurisdiction. Reserved lands with net receipts receive 25% payment, while those without receive none. Acquired lands have four payment options based on calculations. Acquired lands generate payments based on four options: $0.75/acre, 0.75% of current FMV, 0.75% of acquisition cost for lands under FWS supervision before 1977, and 25% of net receipts. FMV is reappraised every five years, and payments may differ from property taxes. Box H(4) states that 25% of net receipts are deducted for expenses related to revenue. Box I compares the authorized amount with national receipts. If net receipts are insufficient, additional funds are appropriated by Congress to meet formula levels. Since 1978, the PILT program has mostly fallen short of authorized levels, except in FY1981. The formula creates a growing authorization level, impacting federal payments to local governments for some FWS lands. Specifically, DOI calculates an additional payment under PILT for FWS lands reserved from the public domain. The PILT program has often fallen short of authorized levels since 1978, except in FY1981. DOI calculates additional payments under PILT for FWS lands reserved from the public domain. NWRF revenues paid to counties are deducted from PILT payments the following year. Specific criteria affect individual states or territories for NWRF or PILT payments. In Alaska, there is a dispute over the total acres of FWS public domain land eligible for PILT payments. The dispute between FWS and the state involves discrepancies in acreage figures used for PILT calculations, particularly in Alaska and Hawaii. FWS does not include submerged lands in the calculations, leading to unresolved issues regarding eligibility for NWRF and PILT payments. The Refuge Revenue Sharing Act does not include American Samoa as eligible for NWRF payments, resulting in no payment for the 1,613 acres of System lands acquired by the U.S. Navy in the territory. Additionally, American Samoa does not receive PILT payments due to being acquired and not defined as a unit of local government. The decline in NWRF payments to county governments since 1991 is attributed to increasing authorization levels and declining total appropriations. The NWRF statute has limited potential causes for increasing authorization levels, with net revenues remaining fairly constant and declining in recent years. The increase in eligible FWS lands, primarily in the marine environment, does not fully explain the rise in authorization levels. The increase in authorization levels for NWRF payments is not fully explained by the rise in eligible FWS lands, as the bulk of the increase is in the marine environment. The $0.75/acre payment option and payments tied to purchase price before 1977 also do not account for the quadrupling of the authorized level. The fair market value of acquired lands is the main factor contributing to the increase, reflecting the general rise in real estate values up until about 2007. The increase in authorization levels for NWRF payments is mainly due to the rising fair market values of acquired lands, with some contribution from the number of eligible acres. Counties with high FMVs receive a larger share of funds, and there are few proposals in Congress to amend the program amidst pressure to reduce federal spending. The Administration proposed eliminating discretionary spending for NWRF from FY2012 to FY2015, with Congress rejecting the proposal each year. For FY2014, Congress appropriated $13.23 million, down 8.6% from FY2011. FWS estimated that counties would receive 24.4% of the authorized level in FY2014. Congress may consider various options to address funding for county governments, including eliminating NWRF and making FWS lands eligible for PILT, changing the compensation formula under NWRF, or fully funding the existing NWRF program. If NWRF is eliminated and FWS lands become eligible for PILT, counties would not receive federal payments based on FWS jurisdiction. Different distribution of net receipts or depositing them in the U.S. Treasury could be specified. Payments for eligible NWRF acquired lands with FMV over $338.67/acre would be reduced to $2.54/acre at most. PILT payments might be further reduced based on county population levels. Public domain lands would be minimally affected as they already receive PILT payments. Counties receiving payments based on 0.75% of FMV would see only marginal increases, as the top payment rate for PILT in FY2013 was $2.54/acre. The top payment rate for PILT in FY2013 was $2.54/acre, which would still represent only a modest fraction of the authorized NWRF payment level for refuge lands with high FMVs. Counties with lands outside the System that generate no revenue would receive a PILT payment for the first time under this option. If the fourth option were chosen, changes to the NWRF formula could reduce the authorized amount. Changes in the NWRF provision are necessary to lower the authorized amount, which could be achieved by lowering the rate, capping per-acre compensation, or setting all compensation at a fixed rate. Fully funding NWRF would require a significant increase in annual appropriation, with future increases dependent on FMVs and changes in FWS lands revenues. Congress could also consider changing the program to mandatory spending to achieve full funding. Achieving full funding under either option for the NWRF provision would face substantial difficulties due to the climate of continuing efforts to lower federal spending."
