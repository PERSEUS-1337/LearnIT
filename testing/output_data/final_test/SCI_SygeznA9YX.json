    "content": "Data Interpretation in Quantitative Aptitude exams involves answering questions based on plots like bar charts, line graphs, and scatter plots. Existing datasets for this task have limitations in terms of plot variety and question-answer pairs. To address this, a new dataset with 9.7 million question-answer pairs grounded over 270,000 plots containing a wide range of realistic x-y variables has been introduced. The dataset for Data Interpretation in Quantitative Aptitude exams includes $x$-$y$ variables like CO2 emission and fertility rate extracted from real-world data sources. Questions are complex and based on templates from interesting questions, while answers are not restricted to a small vocabulary. Existing models for Visual Question Answering cannot be used due to the dataset's complexity. Initial results show the need for a multi-staged modular pipeline for data extraction and question answering. Data plots like bar charts, line graphs, and scatter plots are efficient for summarizing numeric information. Machine comprehension of these plots for answering questions is a research problem at the intersection of Language and Vision with widespread applications. A modular framework is proposed to independently progress on sub-tasks in plot question answering. A new system is proposed to answer questions about data plots in financial reports and journals, aiding visually impaired individuals. Two datasets, FigureQA BID6 and DVQA BID5, have been released for this task. These datasets reveal challenges unique to plot question answering, different from Visual Question Answering (VQA). The need for more challenging datasets is highlighted to capture a wider range of information. The datasets FigureQA and DVQA contain plots created from synthetic data with limited vocabulary, reducing the complexity for models. In contrast, the dataset DIP uses realistic variable names and values, providing a more natural context for questions. FigureQA and DVQA have a smaller number of question templates compared to DIP. The dataset DIP uses realistic variable names and values, providing a more natural context for questions. It includes a richer question repository with 74 templates and more complex questions. The answers in this dataset come from a larger vocabulary, with 187,688 words not seen in the training data. The dataset DIP includes a novel test set with plots based on Open Government Data, containing additional variable and legend names not seen in World Bank Data. Existing VQA models are not suitable for this dataset due to its large answer vocabulary. Instead of using a single end-to-end system, a modular multi-staged pipeline is proposed to extract data and text objects from the plot. The dataset DIP includes a test set with plots based on Open Government Data, with various data, text, and numeric objects. A method BID13 is used for compositional semantic parsing to derive answers from a logical form. Existing Visual QA datasets and models are reviewed, highlighting the need to go beyond current end-to-end models. Several datasets for Visual Question Answering have been released, including COCO-QA, DAQUAR, VQA, CLEVR, NVLR, datasets with questions on natural and synthetic images. Some datasets focus on diagrams and research paper images. FigureSeer dataset contains images from research papers, while FigureQA and DVQA datasets focus on different types of plots. In this work, a new dataset is proposed to overcome limitations in existing datasets for Visual Question Answering. This dataset features plots created from real-world data with natural x-y axes variables, real data values, a large answer vocabulary, and diverse question templates. The availability of such datasets has enabled the development of complex neural network models with encoders, attention mechanisms, interaction components, and classification layers for answering questions based on images. These models have shown reasonable success on original VQA tasks. Existing VQA algorithms have shown success on original tasks but struggle with more complex numeric reasoning in datasets like FigureQA BID6 and DVQA BID5. These datasets involve interpreting numeric information in images like bar charts and scatter plots, requiring accurate inference based on axes, legends, and other elements. The questions are more quantitative and varied, with answers ranging from numerical to multi-word text. This poses a challenge for end-to-end models treating VQA as multi-class. We propose a modular pipeline approach for plot QA tasks, involving converting plots to semi-structured tables and using compositional semantic parsing for answering questions. The four main stages include curating data, creating different types of plots, generating questions through crowdsourcing. The dataset creation process involved extracting variables from online data sources like World Bank Open Data, Open Government Data, Global Terrorism Database, and Nutritional Analysis Data. Data was crawled to extract different variables for plotting relationships (e.g., rainfall vs. years, movie vs. budget). The dataset contains 841 unique indicator variables. The crawled data includes 841 unique indicator variables ranging from 1960 to 2016, corresponding to 160 unique entities. The data contains positive integers, floating point values, percentages, and values on a linear scale. The minimum value is 0 and the maximum value is 3.50E + 15. The dataset includes bar graphs, line plots, and scatter plots, covering a wide range of plot types commonly found in journals and research papers. Certain plot types like Venn diagrams and pie charts were not included due to insufficient data. The dataset includes various types of plots like bar graphs, line plots, and scatter plots with 841 unique indicator variables and 160 entities. Each plot represents 3-dimensional data and has bounding box annotations for different elements. A total of 273,821 plots were created with random plot parameters to ensure variety. The plot parameters include grid lines, font size, tick label notation, line style, marker styles, legend position, and colors. The x-axis has 2-12 elements, legends have 1-4 entries, and lines or bars vary from 1-4. The number of discrete elements on the x-axis is 5, and the number of legend names is 4. To create questions for a wide range of plots, 3,500 plots were sampled and workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk were asked to generate questions. Each plot was shown to 5 workers, resulting in 17,500 questions. Workers were instructed to ask complex reasoning questions involving multiple plot elements. Workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk were paid 0.1$ for each question they generated about the overall structure and specific elements of plots. Questions were categorized into 5 classes with 74 templates, including both manually designed and crowdsourced questions. Data Retrieval, Numeric Reasoning, and Comparative Reasoning are types of questions related to elements in a plot, requiring different levels of analysis. These questions range from specific value inquiries to comparative analyses across plot elements. The curr_chunk discusses generating questions for multiple indicator variables using templates that require manual intervention. It includes examples of questions combining numeric and comparative reasoning. The curr_chunk discusses the challenges of generating questions for indicator variables and the process of converting plots into semi-structured tables for question answering. The process of converting plots into semi-structured tables involves breaking it down into sub-tasks and extracting visual elements such as titles, labels, and data markers using object detection techniques like SSD. The process involves using SSD to detect visual elements in the graph and OCR to read values inside bounding boxes. A pre-trained OCR module is used for this task without re-training. The goal is to create a table from the extracted information. The process involves using SSD to detect visual elements in the graph and OCR to read values inside bounding boxes. A pre-trained OCR module is used for this task without re-training. The goal is to create a table where rows correspond to x-axis ticks and columns correspond to legend elements, with values filled in accordingly. Legend names are associated with legend markers based on proximity of bounding boxes. Tick labels are similarly associated with tick markers. In the process, legend names are associated with colors based on proximity of bounding boxes, while tick labels are linked to tick markers. To fill values in the table, bars are associated with x-ticks and legend names based on dominant colors in their bounding boxes. After associating legend names with colors and tick labels with tick markers, the next step involves extracting the value represented by each bar. This is done by using the height of the bar from the bounding box information and interpolating the value based on the y-tick labels above and below it. The extracted information is then structured into a table, similar to the approach used in the WikiTableQuestions dataset. The logical forms are ranked and applied to the knowledge graph to get the answer. Train-Valid-Test Splits were created using different combinations of indicator variables and entities, resulting in a total of 273,821 plots. 74 templates were instantiated to create (questions, answer) pairs for each plot, with varying numbers of questions per plot. The data was split into train (58%), valid (12%), test-familiar (12%), and test-novel (17%) sets. Test-novel contains plots from a data source not seen during training. The training details include creating a test-hard split with 3000 questions from 1000 plots, training object detection models for visual elements, and observing performance drops with a single model for all elements. Training each model for 200,000 steps with a batch size of 32 was found to be sufficient. For the Table QA module, the model was trained using questions from the dataset and ground truth tables. Training was limited to 200,000 questions due to computational constraints. The VED Module's performance was evaluated by computing average precision for detected bounding boxes, showing good results for most elements except line, y-label, x-tick, and y-tick. The VED Module's performance was evaluated for most elements except line, y-label, x-tick, and y-tick, which were found to be hard to detect due to their small size. The OCR module showed reasonable accuracy in detecting characters, suggesting potential improvements in other components of the pipeline. The SIE Module's performance was evaluated by comparing predicted values with ground truth, resulting in a significant drop in accuracy. Focus is needed on this last stage of the pipeline, especially for questions requiring comparative and compound reasoning. The DIP dataset was introduced for Data Interpretation. The DIP dataset for Data Interpretation over Plots contains scientific plots from real-world data sources like World Bank and stock market. Questions are based on templates extracted from realistic questions. The dataset poses challenges due to a large vocabulary, requiring a modular pipeline to convert plots to tables for answering questions using compositional semantic parsing. Improved models for reasoning over structured data are needed for this challenging dataset. The detailed statistics of the number of plots in each data split are presented in TAB7. It includes questions about the ratio of Y labels in different x ticks and comparisons between Y labels in different x ticks. Compound questions involve differences between Y labels and sums of Y labels in specific x ticks. The curr_chunk discusses various comparisons and calculations involving Y labels in different x ticks and legends, such as finding the maximum Y label, differences between Y labels, and comparisons with averages. The curr_chunk presents questions about the sum of Y labels in different x ticks and legends, comparing them to find if they are greater than certain values. It also discusses the distribution of question types in the DIP dataset."
