    "content": "The \"Adult Day Achievement Center Enhancement Act\" may be cited as the short title of this Act. Congress acknowledges that one in 6 people in the United States lives with a neurological disease, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), early-onset Parkinson's disease, and traumatic brain injury (TBI), which can result in disability and require assistance with daily activities. MS, a chronic disease affecting the central nervous system, can lead to symptoms like numbness, paralysis, and vision loss, with most diagnoses occurring between ages 20 and 50. Over 400,000 individuals in the US are living with MS. Individuals living with MS may require home care or nursing home placement, but most prefer to receive care at home. Approximately 80 percent of home care is provided by unpaid family caregivers. Parkinson's disease is a chronic neurological disease with primary symptoms including tremors, rigidity, slowness of movement, and impaired balance. Nearly 1,000,000 individuals live with Parkinson's disease. Traumatic brain injury, caused by head trauma, affects 1.4 million new cases annually, leading to disabilities in 90,000 individuals across various age groups. In military conflicts, 14-20% of surviving casualties have experienced TBI. Parkinson's disease affects nearly 1 million individuals, with 5-10% diagnosed before age 60 as \"early-onset.\" Family caregivers, mainly women, provide $306 billion in unpaid services annually. The pool of potential caregivers is decreasing, projected to be 4 caregivers per individual by 2050. Employers face a total cost of $17.1 billion for employees with caregiving responsibilities and $33.6 billion for all employed caregivers. Adult day programs offer various services. Adult day programs provide a range of services, including medical care, rehabilitation therapies, assistance with daily living activities, nutrition therapy, health monitoring, social interaction, stimulating activities, and transportation for seniors, individuals with disabilities, and younger adults with chronic diseases. These programs are particularly beneficial for individuals living with neurological diseases like MS, Parkinson's disease, TBI, and similar conditions, as they help alleviate symptoms, reduce dependency, offer socialization opportunities, and maintain quality of life. Adult day programs offer various benefits such as improved functional status, social support, and reduced fatigue, depression, and pain. They also lower medical costs, decrease nursing home admissions, and allow individuals to receive health services while living at home. However, there is a lack of adult day programs for younger adults with neurological diseases in the United States, limiting their access to these health and wellness opportunities. Younger adults with neurological diseases may not have access to adult day programs designed for older adults, which may not cater to their specific age-related or disability needs. Establishment of adult day programs. The Assistant Secretary for Aging will conduct a survey of adult day programs for individuals with neurological diseases like multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease within 90 days of the enactment of this section. The survey will identify successful programs and how they were established and funded. The Assistant Secretary for Aging will develop best practices for adult day programs, including program guidelines, scope of services, and performance goals to measure outcomes and success. The Assistant Secretary for Aging will establish a grant program for adult day programs based on the results of a survey evaluating program support. A competitive grant program is established annually to fund adult day programs for individuals with neurological diseases or conditions. Eligible entities must demonstrate understanding of the special needs of these individuals and the challenges faced by family caregivers. Family caregivers assisting individuals with neurological diseases must have the capacity to provide recommended services. Grants cannot exceed 40% of the entity's operating budget, including in-kind contributions. The Assistant Secretary for Aging will award annual grants under the program, ensuring diverse geographic representation among recipients. Minimum numbers of entities will be selected as grant recipients for each fiscal year. The Assistant Secretary for Aging will award annual grants under the program, ensuring diverse geographic representation among recipients. A minimum of 12 entities will be selected as grant recipients for the third fiscal year, and a minimum of 15 entities for the fourth fiscal year. A report will be prepared and made publicly available on the grant program, including descriptions of funded adult day programs, Federal funding amounts, expected outcomes, performance goals, and indicators to monitor progress. The curr_chunk discusses indicators for monitoring grant recipients' progress in responding to the needs of individuals with neurological diseases and assisting family caregivers. It also mentions plans for improving oversight and management of the grant program. The prev_chunk outlines the awarding of annual grants for diverse geographic representation, with a minimum number of entities selected as grant recipients for each fiscal year. The curr_chunk focuses on providing assistance to individuals with neurological diseases and their family caregivers by maintaining or improving functional abilities, preventing complications, promoting alternatives to nursing homes, and reducing strain on caregivers. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of a family caregiver as someone who provides unpaid assistance to an adult family member with special needs. It also mentions the authorization of appropriations for this purpose."
