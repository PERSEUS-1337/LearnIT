    "title": "AB 1745",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature acknowledges the need for more resources at the local level to ensure public safety, citing an increase in property and violent crimes in California's largest cities. This is exacerbated by criminal justice realignment and Proposition 47, placing additional burdens on local law enforcement. Rising crime rates, population growth, and inflation strain local law enforcement budgets. Funding has not kept pace with the state's population increase and inflation. Current funding of $549.1 million falls short of the recommended $631.1 million, impacting communities facing gang violence, drug addiction, and related crimes. The United States Department of Justice halted equitable funding payments to California law enforcement agencies, resulting in a loss of approximately $85 million in revenue. The Legislature intends to establish a new program to provide additional funding for drug interdiction, antigang enforcement, and other crime prevention activities. Budget Allocation for Drug and Gang Enforcement: Counties must allocate received funds for implementation within 30 days to the Supplemental Law Enforcement Services Account. The moneys allocated to counties and cities, including specific districts, based on population percentages, for law enforcement services. The allocation of funds for law enforcement services in Contra Costa County is based on population percentages. Newly incorporated cities must provide a population estimate to receive their allocation from the SLESA by July 15th of the fiscal year. Residents within specific districts such as Bear Valley, Stallion Springs, Lake Shastina, or Kensington in counties like San Mateo, Kern, Siskiyou, or Contra Costa, or within cities in those counties, will be considered as residing in the unincorporated areas. Funds allocated to counties will stay in the county SLESA, while funds allocated to cities will go into a city-established SLESA. Funds from the Supplemental Law Enforcement Services Account (SLESA) must be used for front-line law enforcement services and cannot replace other funding for Public Safety Services. The funds can be used for drug interdiction programs, body-worn cameras, and peace officer training, including training for handling persons with developmental disabilities or mental illness. The funds must be spent by June 30 of the following fiscal year. (4) Other front-line law enforcement services include antigang, community crime prevention, and juvenile justice programs. Recipient agencies cannot use more than 0.5 percent of their SLESA allocation for administrative overhead costs. The sum of $85 million is appropriated from the General Fund for allocation to counties for law enforcement services. The Controller will distribute the funds to Supplemental Law Enforcement Services Accounts based on a percentage schedule developed by the Department of Finance."
