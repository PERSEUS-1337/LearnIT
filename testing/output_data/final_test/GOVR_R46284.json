    "content": "The Small Business Administration (SBA) offers various programs to support small businesses, including disaster loan programs, loan guaranty programs, small business management training, and contracting programs. Congressional interest in the SBA's programs has grown due to the importance of small businesses in stimulating economic activity and job creation, especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the economy. The Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2020 and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) provided significant financial assistance to small businesses affected by COVID-19, including the creation of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) with loans guaranteed by the SBA. The CARES Act provides financial assistance to small businesses through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), offering loans with a 1.0% interest rate and eligibility for loan forgiveness. Additionally, the act includes deferment relief for existing loans and allocates funds for various SBA programs and initiatives. The CARES Act allocated $48 million for women's business centers (WBCs), $25 million for SBA resource partners, and $17 billion for subsidies for SBA's programs. The SBA accepted PPP loan applications on April 3, 2020, approving 1.66 million loans totaling nearly $342.3 billion. Loan applications were halted on April 15 due to reaching the authorization limit. The SBA began accepting new EIDL and Emergency EIDL grant applications on a limited basis on May 4 for agricultural businesses eligible under the Paycheck Protection Program and Healthcare Enhancement Act. Applications from agricultural businesses submitted before the legislative change are being processed without the need for reapplication. Other EIDL loan applications submitted before April 15 are also being processed. As of May 17, 2020, the SBA had approved 252,340 COVID-19-related EIDL. As of May 17, 2020, the SBA had approved 252,340 COVID-19-related EIDL loans totaling $24.8 billion. The SBA had also approved over three million Emergency EIDL grants totaling nearly $9.9 billion. The SBA resumed accepting PPP applications on April 27, 2020, after the enactment of the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act, which increased loan authorization limits and allocated funds for lending. As of May 16, 2020, the SBA had approved more than 4.3 million PPP loans totaling over $513 billion. The House passed the HEROES Act on May 15, 2020, which includes provisions to expand PPP eligibility and appropriate $10 billion for Emergency EIDL grants. The report discusses SBA disaster loans, access to capital programs, and management training programs for small businesses affected by COVID-19. The SBA provides disaster assistance in the form of loans, not grants, which must be repaid. These loans are available to individuals, businesses of all sizes, and nonprofit organizations in declared disaster areas for physical damage and economic injury. The SBA issues about 80% of its direct disaster loans to individuals and households to repair and replace homes and personal property. The SBA disbursed billions in disaster loans from FY2016 to FY2019, including EIDLs. The EIDL program is used to address the economic impact of COVID-19 on small businesses. The Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act made coronavirus-related economic injury eligible for EIDL expenses. EIDLs provide up to $2 million for working capital to help small businesses, agricultural cooperatives, and nonprofit organizations meet financial obligations due to disasters. Ineligible businesses include those not meeting SBA's criteria, deriving over one-third of revenue from gambling, casinos, racetracks, religious and political organizations. EIDL loan amounts are based on actual economic injury and financial needs, regardless of property damage. The SBA may waive the $2 million limit for major employers. EIDL funds cannot be used for debt refinancing, facility expansion, dividends, or relocation. Applicants need an acceptable credit history, repayment ability, and collateral for loans over $25,000. SBA may collateralize assets but won't deny a loan for lack of collateral. EIDL interest rates apply. EIDL loans do not require collateral but may collateralize assets if available. Interest rates are fixed at a maximum of 4% per annum with maturities up to 30 years. Applicants must request SBA EIDL assistance through a governor or the SBA Administrator. The SBA Administrator can submit a request for SBA EIDL under the Small Business Act. COVID-19 was deemed a disaster under the Act, making economic injury from the coronavirus eligible for the SBA's Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. Declarations for SBA EIDLs began on March 16, 2020, with changed requirements for states seeking disaster assistance for small businesses. Under new criteria, states and territories are now only required to certify that at least five small businesses have suffered substantial economic injury, allowing EIDL assistance to be available statewide instead of just within specific counties. The SBA had about $1.1 billion in disaster loan credit subsidy available to support $7 billion to $8 billion in disaster loans before the CARES Act's enactment. Loan credit subsidy covers the government's cost of extending credit and is used to protect against estimated shortfalls in loan repayments. The SBA's funding for disaster loan credit subsidies was a concern due to potential shortfalls in loan repayments. The CARES Act provided an additional $10 billion for the EIDL program, with additional funding from the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act. The increase in EIDL demand may require the SBA to enhance its disaster business loan portfolio and increase staff to meet the needs. The SBA received additional funding of $20 million from Title II of P.L. 116-123 to meet increased EIDL demand. A GAO report showed quick disaster loan processing times for past hurricanes, but it's uncertain if this applies to the current COVID-19 situation with a higher volume of applications. Concerns exist about the SBA's ability to expand its loan portfolio and hire staff quickly enough to process loans efficiently. Loan processing times are a significant concern for Congress and business owners. Delays in processing loans can lead to economic damage and potential collapse of businesses. Congress has explored options to expedite loan processing, such as increased staffing, waiving application requirements, and utilizing expedited or bridge loans. In response to criticism of SBA's disaster loan processing after the Gulf Coast hurricanes, Congress passed the Small Business Disaster Response and Loan Improvements Act of 2008, creating programs like the Expedited Disaster Assistance Loan Program and Immediate Disaster Assistance Program. The SBA offers loans up to $150,000 through various disaster assistance programs, including the Immediate Disaster Assistance Program (IDAP) and Private Disaster Assistance Program (PDAP). However, the SBA faced challenges in implementing these programs, as highlighted by the SBA Inspector General's statement before the House Committee on Small Business. Congressional representatives expressed concerns about the SBA's effectiveness in disbursing funds quickly and efficiently after disasters like Hurricane Sandy. The SBA struggled to implement Guaranteed Disaster Assistance Programs due to private lenders' reluctance, citing issues like high program costs, lack of infrastructure, longer loan maturities, and high loan provision costs. The SBA faced challenges in implementing Guaranteed Disaster Assistance Programs due to private lenders' concerns about high costs, inadequate collateral security, and lack of expertise in home loans. Congress canceled unobligated balances for these programs in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018. The CARES Act addressed loan processing issues by waiving certain requirements in response to COVID-19 economic injuries. The SBA announced deferment of payments on existing disaster loans through December 31, 2020, and new EIDL loans for one year. The CARES Act provides payment deferment relief for impacted borrowers in the Paycheck Protection Program. The SBA announced deferment of payments on existing disaster loans through December 31, 2020, and new EIDL loans for one year. PPP loan payments will be deferred for six months, with interest accruing during the deferment. The CARES Act allows for PPP loan forgiveness under specified conditions related to employee retention. Loan forgiveness has been granted in the past for disaster relief, such as after Hurricane Betsy in 1965. The CARES Act provides relief for businesses in Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi affected by a hurricane. It allows for loan cancellation or interest waivers up to $1,800 over three years. Additionally, it permits lending to educational institutions without private funding requirements and offers interest and principal payment deferrals for the first three years of the loan term. Businesses facing uninsured losses from disasters typically do not qualify for FEMA grants, and federal grant assistance is limited. The CDBG program provides disaster assistance to businesses through loans, grants, and compensation for lost wages or revenues. While CDBG funding can be used for emergencies, it must be reprogrammed in consultation with HUD. This assistance is not available for all major disasters. Congress could consider providing business grants through FEMA or the SBA for immediate disaster assistance. Enlisting FEMA to administer the program may offer benefits such as existing grant processing operations and access to FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund. Alternatively, SBA could administer the program due to its evaluation framework in place. Congress may need to make statutory changes to SBA's disaster loan account or authorize a new account to receive appropriations for disaster grants. Concerns include eligibility for businesses receiving SBA EIDL and the potential for waste, fraud, and abuse in grant distribution. The CARES Act allows the SBA Administrator to provide up to $10,000 as an advance payment within three days of receiving an EIDL application. Recipients do not have to repay this Emergency EIDL grant, even if they are later denied an EIDL loan. Congress could consider limiting grants to small businesses with 10 or fewer employees to prevent duplicative assistance. The SBA limited Emergency EIDL grants to $1,000 per employee, up to a maximum of $10,000. The CARES Act provides $25 million for oversight of the SBA's lending programs to prevent fraud. SBA EIDL interest rates for COVD-19 are 3.75% for businesses and 2.75% for nonprofit organizations. Congressional concerns include disaster victims' ability to pay off loans and the complexity of determining interest rates. The SBA determines EIDL interest rates using a formula specified in U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7636(d)(4)(A), with a maximum rate of 4% per annum for certain businesses. The rate for the Administration's share of loans is based on the average market yield of U.S. obligations. The SBA determines EIDL interest rates using a formula specified in U.S.C. \u00c2\u00a7636(d)(4)(A), with a maximum rate of 4% per annum for certain businesses. Congress could request SBA to reevaluate its interpretation of the formula to provide detailed information on how it benefits nonprofit organizations. Alternatively, Congress could change the formula or designate a specific interest rate for all SBA EIDL loans during COVID-19. The SBA stopped issuing direct business loans in 1998 due to high subsidy rates compared to loan guaranty programs. Instead, they guarantee loans from approved lenders to help small businesses. Businesses must meet the Small Business Act's definition to qualify for SBA assistance. The Small Business Administration (SBA) defines a small business as one that is organized for profit, has a place of business in the United States, operates primarily within the U.S. or contributes significantly to the U.S. economy, is independently owned and operated, is not dominant in its field nationally, and meets size standards set by the SBA. The SBA uses industry-specific size standards or a combination of net worth and net income to determine if a business is small. The Small Business Administration (SBA) sets size standards for small businesses based on activities in the NAICS, with criteria including net worth and net income. Size standards vary by industry and can be based on annual receipts, number of employees, asset size, or a combination for refineries. SBA historically uses number of employees for manufacturing and mining companies and annual receipts for other industries. The SBA sets size standards for small businesses based on activities in the NAICS, using criteria like net worth and net income. These standards vary by industry and are determined by factors such as average firm size, assets size, industry competition, and size distribution of firms. The SBA also provides loan guarantees through programs like the 7(a) loan guaranty program, the 504/CDC loan guaranty program, and the Microloan program. The SBA's loan guaranty programs, including the 7(a) loan guaranty program, the 504/CDC loan guaranty program, and the Microloan program, require personal guarantees from borrowers and share the risk of default with lenders. Ineligible businesses for loan guarantees are listed in 13 C.F.R. \u00c2\u00a7120.110, and nonprofit and charitable organizations are generally ineligible. Fees are charged to offset program costs, including those related to loan defaults. The SBA charges fees to offset program costs, including loan defaults. Fees are set in statute for 7(a) loans, with guaranty fees ranging from 2% to 3.5%. Lenders can also charge additional fees for loans exceeding $1 million. Additionally, lenders can collect fees from borrowers for administrative expenses. The SBA reduces fees for small business owners, such as waiving annual service fees and lowering guaranty fees for loans under $150,000 in rural areas or HUBZones. The Veterans Entrepreneurship Act of 2015 requires waiving guaranty fees for veteran loans under the SBAExpress program up to $350,000. The SBA aims for a zero subsidy rate to avoid needing budget authority for new loan guaranties. The 7(a) loan guaranty program, authorized by the Small Business Act, allows borrowers to use loan proceeds for various business purposes. This includes acquiring land, improving sites, purchasing buildings, constructing new buildings, acquiring fixed assets, financing working capital, and refinancing debts. The program is administered by SBA lending partners and aims to support small businesses. The SBA's 7(a) loan program approved over 51,000 loans totaling $23.2 billion in FY2019. The program has a guaranty rate of 85% for loans under $150,000 and 75% for larger loans. Loans must have a maximum term of 10 years, but can be extended up to 25 years for real estate or equipment financing. Lenders can charge fees to recoup expenses. The SBA allows lenders to charge fees to recoup expenses and set fixed interest rates for 7(a) loans based on a multistep formula. The maximum allowable fixed interest rates in May 2020 are 11.25% for loans of $25,000 or less, 10.25% for loans over $25,000 but not exceeding $50,000, 9.25% for loans over $50,000 up to $250,000, and 8.25% for loans over $250,000. Variable-rate loans are pegged to the prime rate, LIBOR plus 3%, or the SBA optional peg rate. The 504/CDC loan guaranty program uses Certified Development Companies (CDCs) to provide long-term, fixed-rate loans for major fixed assets. Loans cannot be used for working capital or repaying debt. Commercial lenders provide up to 50% of the financing package, secured by a senior lien. Each CDC has its own geographic territory. The 504/CDC loan program provides financing with a senior lien from commercial lenders, a junior lien from CDCs, and a guaranteed debenture from the SBA. Small businesses must contribute 10% equity and meet eligibility criteria. CDCs must create or retain jobs based on specific criteria. Loan participation ranges from $25,000 to $5.5 million with varying maturity terms. The SBA 504/CDC loan program offers financing for equipment and real estate with varying maturity terms. The maximum fixed interest rate is tied to U.S. Treasury rates. CDCs can charge various fees to borrowers, including a one-time guaranty fee, annual servicing fee, funding fee, development company fee, and participation fee. Borrowers may also be charged a processing fee. In FY2019, the SBA approved 6,099 504/CDC loans totaling nearly $5.0 billion for small businesses. During the Great Recession, Congress authorized the temporary use of 504/CDC program funds to refinance existing commercial debt for business expansion. In 2010, Congress expanded the types of projects eligible for refinancing under the 504/CDC program. In the 114th Congress, the 504/CDC loan guaranty program was expanded to allow refinancing of certain projects, with limitations on the amount that can be refinanced. Commercial loans eligible for the program must have a loan-to-value ratio of no more than 90% of the fair market value of the fixed assets being financed. Refinancing can be waived for good cause as determined by the SBA. Loans for business operating expenses cannot exceed 85% LTV ratio of collateral value. Fees for 504/CDC Refinancing program are similar to 504/CDC Loan Guaranty program. In FY2020, guaranty servicing fee is 0.3205% for regular loans and 0.322% for debt refinance loans. SBA approved 166 refinancing loans totaling $154.8 million in FY2019. Microloan program offers loans up to $50,000 to small businesses and nonprofit child care centers through intermediary lenders. Program started in 1992 after being authorized in 1991. The Microloan program, authorized in 1991, targets new and early stage businesses in underserved markets. It offers loans up to $50,000 for working capital and acquisition of materials, supplies, furniture, fixtures, and equipment. Loan terms are up to seven years with an interest rate based on the five-year Treasury rate. The Microloan program offers loans up to $50,000 for new and early stage businesses. The interest rate is based on the five-year Treasury rate and can be adjusted based on the intermediary's historic portfolio. The maximum interest rate charged to borrowers is determined by the SBA. Rates are typically negotiated between the borrower and the intermediary, ranging from 7% to 9%. In FY2019, 5,533 small businesses received Microloans totaling $81.5 million, with an average loan amount of $14,735 and an average interest rate of 7.5%. Proposals to address COVID-19 impacts focus on SBA loan deferrals, forgiveness, and expanded eligibility, including for certain nonprofit organizations. During the 111th Congress, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provided the SBA with additional funding, including subsidies for loan guaranty programs and an increase in the maximum loan guaranty percentage. The funding was extended through multiple laws to support small businesses. The Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2010, Temporary Extension Act of 2010, Small Business Loan Guarantee Program Extension Act, Continuing Extension Act of 2010, and Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 provided funding to the SBA for fee subsidies and 90% maximum loan guaranty percentage extensions through various dates in 2010. The Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 provided $5 million for administrative expenses to extend the SBA's fee subsidies and 90% maximum loan guaranty percentage until December 31, 2010. The Continuing Appropriations and Surface Transportation Extensions Act, 2011 allowed the SBA to continue these subsidies until March 4, 2011 or until funding ran out. The fee subsidies and guarantee percentage ended on January 3, 2011 due to funding exhaustion. Additionally, the act increased the 7(a) program's loan limit to $5 million and the 504/CDC Program's loan limits to $5 million. The Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 increased loan limits for various SBA programs, including raising the limit to $5 million for \"regular\" borrowers and manufacturers. It also temporarily expanded eligibility for low-interest refinancing and increased loan limits for the Microloan Program. Additionally, it authorized capital investments for a Small Business Lending Fund and appropriated funds for the State Small Business Credit Initiative Program. The Business Credit Initiative Program authorized a three-year Intermediary Lending Pilot Program for the SBA to make direct loans to nonprofit lending intermediaries, enabling small businesses to receive loans up to $200,000. It also established an alternative size standard for loan programs and provided small businesses with $12 billion in tax relief. Efforts were made in the 111th and 112th Congresses to reinstate direct lending to small businesses. During the 112th Congress, bills like H.R. 3007 and H.R. 5835 aimed to authorize the SBA to provide direct loans to small businesses, with specific criteria and loan amounts. In the 111th Congress, there was a push to reinstate direct lending to small businesses. During the 111th Congress, there was a consensus to address small businesses' capital needs to promote job creation. Some advocated for additional resources for the SBA, while others suggested business tax reduction and fiscal restraint to aid economic growth. Today, similar sentiments are expressed as Congress considers assisting small businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. During the current pandemic, there has been little concern about federal fiscal restraint despite the adverse economic impact of the coronavirus. The focus is on determining which specific policies would benefit small businesses the most, with considerations such as increasing loan limits, providing fee subsidies, and expanding eligibility criteria for SBA's capital access programs. These enhancements had a positive effect on small business lending during the Great Recession. During and after the Great Recession, SBA lending increased significantly due to fee reductions and increased loan guarantee percentages under ARRA. Loan approvals for SBA 7(a) and 504/CDC loans saw substantial growth. The increased loan volume raised concerns about staffing requirements and program risk. In 2012, the SBA highlighted the positive impact of legislation on loan volume, with the second-largest dollar volume ever recorded in FY 2012. In FY 2012, Business Administration's loan programs supported $30.25 billion in loans to small businesses, second only to FY 2011. The data show that ARRA and the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 helped small businesses access capital, but it is unclear how effective these programs were in assisting small businesses. Additional funding for oversight could help Congress evaluate the SBA's implementation of stimulus changes. The SBA OIG will oversee the SBA's implementation of stimulus changes to aid Congress in oversight. Additional funding for investigations of fraudulent activities by borrowers and lenders could deter fraud. Requiring the SBA to report performance data to Congress and on its website would ensure efficient spending of taxpayer dollars. The SBA has provided technical and managerial assistance to small businesses since 1953, initially through its own programs and later through third parties. Congressional interest in the SBA's training programs remains. Congressional interest in the SBA's management and technical assistance training programs has increased in recent years. The FY2020 budget allocated $239 million to fund various resource partners, including SBDCs, WBCs, and SCORE chapters. These programs aim to help small businesses create and retain jobs, with nearly a million entrepreneurs and business owners benefiting from mentoring and training each year. The Department of Commerce also offers similar training, such as the Minority Business Development Agency's support for minority business owners in obtaining contracts and financial assistance. The SBDCs provide training and assistance to minority business owners to help them secure contracts and financial awards. They offer free or low-cost programs tailored to local needs, covering areas like marketing, finance, technology transfer, government contracting, and more. SBDCs are funded by SBA grants distributed among states based on population percentages. In FY2020, the SBA received $135 million for SBDC grants through regular appropriations and an additional $192 million in CARES Act funding. SBDCs provided training and counseling to over 254,000 clients in FY2019, resulting in 17,810 new businesses. There are 63 lead SBDC service centers across the U.S. and its territories, managing over 900 outreach locations. Congress authorized the SBA's Microloan lending program in 1991. The SBA's Microloan program was established in 1992 to help women, low-income, veteran, and minority entrepreneurs access capital. Initially a five-year demonstration project, it became permanent in 1997. The program provides grants for technical training to intermediaries serving 49 states, DC, and Puerto Rico. Under the Microloan program, intermediaries in 49 states, DC, and Puerto Rico can receive a technical assistance grant of up to 25% of the total outstanding loan balance. The grant funds are used for marketing, management, and technical assistance for Microloan borrowers, with a limit on assistance for prospective borrowers and third parties. Intermediaries must contribute 25% of the grant amount from nonfederal sources, which can include indirect costs or in-kind contributions. Borrowers are not required to participate in the Microloan Technical Assistance program. The SBA does not mandate Microloan borrowers to join the Microloan Technical Assistance Program, but intermediaries usually require it. The program combines loans with intensive management and technical training. The SBA allocated $34.5 million for Microloan Technical Assistance grants in FY2020. The WBC Renewable Grant Program, established by the Women's Business Ownership Act of 1988, supports financially disadvantaged women-owned businesses. The Women's Business Center (WBC) program supports small businesses owned by women and was given permanent legislative status by P.L. 109-108 in 2006. The SBA awards WBCs up to $150,000 per year for a five-year period, with the option to apply for additional three-year funding intervals upon successful completion. The Women's Business Center (WBC) program provides funding for small businesses owned by women in five-year grant periods with the option to apply for additional three-year funding intervals. WBCs must match federal funding with nonfederal dollars, with the matching requirement decreasing after the initial grant period. In FY2019, WBCs assisted over 64,000 clients and helped start 2,087 new businesses. In FY2020, the SBA allocated $22.5 million for WBC grants through regular appropriations and an additional $48 million in supplemental funding. SCORE, established in 1964, receives grants from the SBA to provide mentoring, training workshops, and counseling services to small businesses through its 350 chapters and 800 branch offices across the US. Over 10,000 volunteer counselors assist small businesses at no or low cost, with SCORE serving 195,242 clients in FY2019. In FY2020, SCORE provided training and counseling services to 195,242 clients, resulting in 480 new businesses. The SBA received $11.7 million for SCORE grants, with additional funding provided by Congress for entrepreneurial development programs. For example, the ARRA and Small Business Jobs Act allocated extra funds for programs like Microloan Technical Assistance grants. Proposals like the COVID-19 RELIEF for Small Businesses Act of 2020 aim to provide further funding for SBA programs, including SBDCs, WBCs, SCORE, and Microloan Technical Assistance. The CARES Act appropriates $265 million for entrepreneurial development programs, including funding for SBDCs, WBCs, SCORE, and Microloan Technical Assistance grants. Matching requirements for SBDC and WBC grants are waived. Federal agencies are required to maximize small business participation in contracts. Congress may require reporting of performance data for grants and make it publicly available. Federal agencies must reserve contracts valued between the micro-purchase threshold ($10,000) and the simplified acquisition threshold ($250,000) for small businesses, unless competitive offers cannot be obtained. The SBA offers various programs to assist small businesses in obtaining and performing federal contracts, including prime contracting programs, subcontracting programs, and business development assistance through the 8(a) Minority Small Business and Capital Ownership Development Program. The 8(a) Program provides business development assistance to socially and economically disadvantaged individuals and small businesses owned by certain groups. Federal agencies can award contracts to the SBA for subcontracting to 8(a) firms, with the SBA able to delegate contract execution to procuring agencies. The 8(a) Program allows federal agencies to award contracts to the SBA for subcontracting to 8(a) firms. Contracts can be awarded through restricted competition or on a sole source basis, depending on the contract amount. For contracts under $4 million ($7 million for manufacturing), sole source awards are common. Contracts exceeding these thresholds are typically awarded via set asides with competition limited to 8(a) firms.ANCs, CDCs, NHOs, and Indian tribes are also eligible for 8(a) set asides. The 8(a) Program allows federal agencies to award contracts to SBA for subcontracting to eligible participants, including firms owned by ANCs, CDCs, NHOs, and Indian tribes. These firms may receive sole source awards valued at less than $4 million ($7 million for manufacturing contracts). Additionally, ANCs and Indian tribes can receive sole source awards exceeding $4 million ($7 million for manufacturing contracts) even when other eligible firms are expected to submit offers. The program aims to help federal agencies meet their goal of awarding 5% of contracting dollars to small disadvantaged businesses. In FY2018, $29.5 billion was awarded to 8(a) firms. The SBA also oversees the HUBZones Program to assist small businesses. The HUBZones Program assists small businesses in designated areas through set asides, sole source awards, and price evaluation preferences. It targets areas with low income, high poverty, or high unemployment. To be certified, 35% of employees must reside in a HUBZone. The program helps federal agencies award at least 3% of contracting dollars to HUBZone small businesses, with $9.8 billion awarded in FY2018. In FY2018, the federal government awarded $22.5 billion to Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Businesses (SDVOSBs) and $9.8 billion to HUBZone-certified small businesses. The SDVOSB program allows agencies to set aside contracts for SDVOSBs, with sole source contracts possible if the value is below $4 million. The program aims to help federal agencies reach the goal of awarding 3% of contracting dollars to SDVOSBs. The Small Business Administration (SBA) oversees the SDVOSB, HUBZone, and Women-Owned Small Businesses (WOSB) programs. The Women-Owned Small Businesses (WOSB) Program, overseen by the Small Business Administration (SBA), allows federal contracting officers to set aside contracts for WOSBs and Economically Disadvantaged Women-Owned Small Businesses (EDWOSBs) in underrepresented industries. Sole source contracts can be awarded to WOSBs if the value is below $4 million. In FY2018, the federal government awarded $23.4 billion to WOSBs. The SBA's Surety Bond Guarantee Program, operational since April 1971, aims to increase small businesses' access to government and private sector contracts by guaranteeing bid, performance, payment, and ancillary bonds. It guarantees individual contracts up to $6.5 million (adjustable for inflation) and up to $10 million for federal contracts with a certification. The guarantee ranges from 80% to 90% of the surety's loss in case of default. In FY2019, the SBA guaranteed 9,905 bid and final surety bonds. Surety bonds totaling nearly $6.5 billion are essential for small businesses competing for federal contracts. These bonds involve a three-party agreement between a surety, contractor, and project owner to ensure project completion. They enable project owners to contract with smaller businesses that may lack credit history or experience. The federal government requires prime contractors to provide a performance bond for contracts exceeding $150,000. Legislation such as ARRA and the Small Business Jobs Act have included enhancements for small business contracting. The CARES Act allows federal agencies to reimburse contractors for paid leave provided to employees. The CARES Act allows eligible contractors to receive reimbursement for paid leave provided to employees unable to work on federally-approved sites due to COVID-19 restrictions. This is part of efforts to support small businesses during economic downturns. The CARES Act, passed during the 111th Congress to address the economic slowdown post-Great Recession, includes loan deferrals, forgiveness, and expanded eligibility. This is in response to the economic impact of COVID-19, with concerns focused on widespread disruptions and pressure on businesses and households. The Act allows for reimbursement of paid leave for employees unable to work on federally-approved sites due to COVID-19 restrictions, supporting small businesses during economic downturns. The 111th Congress learned lessons on the benefits of additional funding for the SBA's Office of Inspector General and the Government Accountability Office. This funding can provide useful information for congressional oversight of the SBA's administration of the CARES Act, help detect administrative problems early, and deter fraud through investigations and audits. Requiring regular reporting on CARES Act implementation by the SBA can promote transparency and assist Congress in oversight responsibilities. The CARES Act established the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) to assist small businesses affected by COVID-19. The SBA announced PPP loans with a two-year term at a 1.0% interest rate. Requiring performance measures and direct reporting to Congress and the public could enhance oversight and confidence in SBA's efforts. The CARES Act established the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) to assist small businesses affected by COVID-19. The SBA announced PPP loans with a two-year term at a 1.0% interest rate. Waives fees and requirements for covered loans, expands eligibility to include more businesses, and increases the maximum loan amount. The CARES Act established the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) to assist small businesses affected by COVID-19. The SBA announced PPP loans with a two-year term at a 1.0% interest rate. Waives fees and requirements for covered loans, expands eligibility to include more businesses, and increases the maximum loan amount. Allows borrowers to refinance 7(a) loans made on or after January 31, 2020, as part of a covered loan with a maximum amount of $10 million. Covered loans are nonrecourse, except for nonauthorized purposes. Can be used for various expenses including payroll costs, health care benefits, insurance premiums, mortgage payments, rent, utilities, and interest on pre-existing debt obligations. Expands lender delegated loan approval authority for making covered loans to all 7(a) lenders to expedite PPP loan processing. The SBA announced PPP loans with a two-year term at a 1.0% interest rate, waiving fees and requirements for covered loans. Lenders are required to consider borrower eligibility based on operations and payroll expenses.
