    "content": "The \"Cellulosic Ethanol Incentive Act of 2007\" amends the Clean Air Act to extend the renewable fuel program until 2030. The renewable fuel program is extended until 2030, with increasing production levels each year from 2012 to 2030. The renewable fuel program is extended until 2031, with increasing production levels each year. Minimum quantity derived from cellulosic biomass is specified with a 2.5-to-1 ratio for cellulosic biomass ethanol. The minimum quantity of cellulosic biomass ethanol sold or introduced into commerce in excess of the required renewable fuel volume derived from cellulosic biomass for each calendar year is determined according to specified minimum volumes in a table starting from 2010. Minimum volume derived from cellulosic biomass (in billions of gallons):\n2010 - 0.25\n2011 - 0.25\n2012 - 0.5\n2013 - 0.65\n2014 - 0.85\n2015 - 1.10\n2016 - 1.64\n2017 - 3.11\n2018 - 4.72\n2019 - 6.49\n2020 - 7.46\n2021 - 8.48 The minimum volume derived from cellulosic biomass increased steadily from 2010 to 2021, reaching 8.48 billion gallons. Projections show a continued growth, with estimates of 20.33 billion gallons by 2030. The renewable fuel requirements are being updated to increase the minimum volume derived from cellulosic biomass to 33.33 billion gallons by 2030. Additionally, a regional requirement mandates that at least 30 percent of the total volume of renewable fuel in a State must be derived from renewable sources. The Administrator may reduce or waive the regional requirement for renewable fuel if impracticable for the region to meet the volume requirement. Amendments to paragraphs (3)(A) and (3)(B) extend the deadlines for compliance to 2029."
