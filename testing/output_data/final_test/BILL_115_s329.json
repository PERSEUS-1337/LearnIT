    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Maintaining Dignity and Eliminating Unnecessary Restrictive Confinement of Youths Act of 2017\" or the \"MERCY Act\". It addresses juvenile solitary confinement. The \"MERCY Act\" addresses juvenile solitary confinement in Chapter 403 of title 18, United States Code, by defining terms like covered juvenile and juvenile facility. The \"MERCY Act\" prohibits room confinement in juvenile facilities except as a temporary response to a covered juvenile's behavior posing a serious and immediate risk of harm. Least restrictive techniques must be used for juveniles at risk of harm. Before placing a covered juvenile in room confinement, staff must try less restrictive techniques such as talking to the juvenile to de-escalate the situation or allowing a qualified mental health professional to intervene. After attempting less restrictive techniques, a staff member of a juvenile facility must explain the reasons for room confinement to the covered juvenile before placing them in confinement. Release from room confinement will occur immediately when the covered juvenile regains self-control. If a covered juvenile poses a serious risk of harm, they will be placed in room confinement and released immediately when they regain self-control or after a specified time period. If a covered juvenile poses a serious risk of harm, they will be placed in room confinement and released immediately when they regain self-control or after a specified time period, such as 3 hours for those posing a risk to others or 30 minutes for others. After a covered juvenile poses a serious risk of harm, they may be placed in room confinement. If the risk persists after the maximum confinement period, the juvenile must be transferred to another facility for appropriate services. After a covered juvenile poses a serious risk of harm, they may be placed in room confinement. If the level of crisis service needed is not available, the juvenile must be transported to an emergency medical facility or an equivalent location. Nothing shall prohibit this action before the expiration of the time limit. Conditions for room confinement for juveniles include a minimum of 80 square feet of space, proper lighting, heating/cooling, ventilation, suicide-resistant and protrusion-free design, access to water, toilets, and hygiene supplies. The juvenile facility must provide notice to the attorney of record and authorized parent or guardian within 1 business day of placing a covered juvenile in room confinement, and within 24 hours of transferring the juvenile to another location. The use of consecutive periods of room confinement to evade the spirit and purpose of this subsection shall be prohibited. The Attorney General must submit a report to Congress detailing the physical force, restraints, and room confinement used at juvenile facilities, along with the number of instances disaggregated by race, ethnicity, and gender. The use of room confinement at juvenile facilities must address underlying issues leading to behavioral interventions, with positive or negative outcomes. A report to Congress must detail physical force, restraints, and room confinement instances, disaggregated by race, ethnicity, and gender. The use of room confinement at juvenile facilities must address underlying issues leading to behavioral interventions, with positive or negative outcomes.
