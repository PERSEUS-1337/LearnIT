    "content": "The Act is titled the \"International Hydrocephalus Treatment and Training Act\". It includes findings related to hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus, also known as \"water on the brain\", is a medical condition with abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain causing increased pressure and head enlargement. If untreated, it leads to disabilities and death, commonly affecting infants due to congenital or post-infectious causes like meningitis. Hydrocephalus, known as \"water on the brain\", is primarily caused by post-infectious hydrocephalus (PIH), accounting for 60% of cases globally. In developing countries, 3 to 5 out of every 1,000 newborns are affected by hydrocephalus, with over 300,000 children acquiring it annually. Untreated hydrocephalus can lead to cognitive and physical disabilities in children, yet families in developing countries often lack awareness of treatment options and care. Hydrocephalus can lead to abandonment, ostracization, and abuse of affected children in developing countries. Innovative medical procedures like ETV/CPC offer potential to save lives and prevent disabilities. VP shunt, the standard treatment, requires multiple revisions and can lead to blockages and death, especially in areas with limited access to healthcare. ETV/CPC is a shunt-less surgery for hydrocephalus that has shown to be effective in two-thirds of infant cases, with a 93 percent success rate in eliminating the condition. However, the limited availability of hospitals with expertise in treating hydrocephalus in developing countries creates a significant gap between the demand for treatment and the capacity of health systems. Neurosurgical care for hydrocephalus in developing countries is scarce due to a lack of trained surgeons. Innovative techniques like ETV/CPC could successfully treat cases and prevent future ones. Adoption of these techniques is cost-effective in the long term. In developing countries, neurosurgical care for hydrocephalus is limited due to a lack of trained surgeons. Innovative techniques like ETV/CPC offer a more cost-effective and efficient long-term treatment option, requiring only one surgery in most cases. This helps alleviate the strain on overburdened health systems in these regions. SEC. 137 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is amended to provide assistance for treating hydrocephalus and training surgeons. Assistance authorized under this section aims to prioritize life-saving treatment of hydrocephalus through innovative treatments, training of medical practitioners in developing countries, and establishing comprehensive training programs for surgeons. The President is authorized to provide assistance for a network of trained medical practitioners to treat hydrocephalus in children at pediatric hospitals and treatment centers in developing countries with a high incidence of the condition. Assistance aims to establish a comprehensive program for global hydrocephalus treatment and training activities. The program aims to provide assistance for pediatric hospitals in developing countries to perform endoscopic surgery for hydrocephalus treatment. It will be administered by healthcare executives and neurosurgeons, responsible for developing education curriculum, quality control standards, and safety guidelines. The assistance program aims to establish a surgeon training program within a pediatric hospital in a developing country with a high incidence of hydrocephalus. The goal is to train four surgeons annually and a total of 20 surgeons over a 5-year period to treat hydrocephalus using the ETV/CPC technique. The program should be operational within 1 year. The surgeon training program, established within a pediatric hospital in a developing country with a high incidence of hydrocephalus, aims to train four surgeons annually and a total of 20 surgeons over a 5-year period to treat hydrocephalus using the ETV/CPC technique. Candidates must have a commitment to providing medical assistance in the developing world and intend to practice medicine there following completion of the program. The program should be operational within 1 year. The surgeon training program requires a neurosurgeon with 3 years of experience in the developing world to complete a minimum of 50 ETV/CPC procedures and 25 VP shunt procedures. Assistance provided under the program should prioritize the ETV/CPC technique. The subsection (b) aims to establish 20 hydrocephalus treatment centers in developing countries, providing ETV/CPC procedures. These centers will be staffed by trained surgeons and a patient care administrator. Treatment centers established under this section must provide surgery for hydrocephalus in children, perform a minimum of 50 surgeries annually including at least 25 ETV or ETV/CPC procedures, and offer post-surgery care. Medical records should track patient care activities and information on the causes and incidence rates of PIH. In this section, definitions for CPC, ETV, ETV/CPC, and hydrocephalus are provided. The curr_chunk discusses the causes of increased intracranial pressure and head enlargement due to cerebrospinal fluid in the brain ventricles. It also defines medical practitioners, PIH (post-infectious hydrocephalus), and VP shunt (ventriculoperitoneal shunt). Authorization of appropriations for child survival and maternal health programs under this chapter is authorized for fiscal years 2014 through 2018."
