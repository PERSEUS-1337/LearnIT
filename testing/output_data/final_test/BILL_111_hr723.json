Congress finds that terrorist acts, major accidents, and industrial disasters lead to a significant number of burn injuries, with 25-30% of injured individuals requiring burn care treatment. The American Burn Association reports that there are only 128 burn centers in the United States. The United States has only 128 burn centers with a total capacity of 1,835 beds. Several burn centers in four states have closed, reducing the nation's ability to handle mass burn casualties from terrorist attacks or disasters. A study shows that 38% of burn patients treated in these centers are uninsured, posing a threat to their survival. The financial survival of burn centers is threatened by the level of uncompensated care they provide, which is crucial for emergency preparedness in the United States. Burn injuries are costly and require immediate medical attention. Waiving waiting periods for Medicare coverage and reimbursing costs for burn treatment are essential to ensure the survival of burn centers.
