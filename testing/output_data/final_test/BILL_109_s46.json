Congress finds that Ukraine allows its citizens the right to emigrate with minimal taxes, has been compliant with freedom of emigration requirements since 1997, and has made progress towards democracy and a free-market economy since 1991. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) is committed to developing governance in line with human rights principles. Ukraine is praised for its commitment to democracy and fair elections, making progress in meeting international standards. Ukraine, as an OSCE participating state, has implemented new election laws. Ukraine, as an OSCE participating state, has enacted legislation to protect national and religious minorities, combat incitement to violence based on discrimination, and engage in efforts to combat ethnic and religious intolerance through cooperation with US NGOs. Ukraine is continuing the restitution of religious properties confiscated from national and religious minorities during the Soviet era. They are committed to developing a legislative framework for this process. Ukraine has received normal trade relations treatment since a bilateral trade agreement with the United States in 1992. Ukraine's accession to the World Trade Organization is welcomed, but issues like access to US agricultural products and intellectual property protection need resolution. Ukraine has enacted protections for labor rights, committed to respecting freedom of the press as an OSCE member, expressed a desire for Euro-Atlantic integration, and participated in peacekeeping operations with the United States in Europe. Ukraine has participated in peacekeeping operations in Europe and has cooperated in the global fight against international terrorism. The President may determine that Title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 should no longer apply to Ukraine and proclaim the extension of permanent normal trade relations treatment to the products of Ukraine. After this extension, chapter 1 of Title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 will cease to apply to Ukraine. The sense of Congress is for the US to engage with Ukraine, encouraging them to meet OSCE commitments including free emigration, religious liberty, combating discrimination, and expanding property restitution. The condensed text chunk is: \n\nSupporting Ukraine in implementing democratic standards, creating independent legal and judicial systems, respecting media freedoms, pursuing market-oriented reforms, Euro-Atlantic integration, joining the WTO, and combating corruption. The condensed text chunk is: Ensuring quick resolution of trade disputes with Ukraine, particularly in intellectual property, poultry, and agricultural sectors. The trade agreement between the United States and Ukraine, in force since June 23, 1992, grants the U.S. rights to use safeguard rules against import surges from Ukraine. Section 421 of the Trade Act of 1974 applies to Ukraine similar to China, as long as the agreement remains valid. Congressional oversight is exercised over WTO accession negotiations. The President must notify Congress within 5 days of the US-Ukraine bilateral agreement on WTO accession. A report detailing the agreement must be transmitted to Congress within 15 days. Congressional Oversight Resolution can be introduced within 30 days of the initial notification to Congress. The Congressional Oversight Resolution, defined as a joint resolution of Congress expressing dissatisfaction with the US-Ukraine WTO accession agreement, must be considered within 30 days of initial notification to Congress. The Oversight Resolution can be introduced by any Member of the House or Senate, referred to specific committees, and cannot be amended by those committees. The Congressional Oversight Resolution, once introduced, cannot be amended and follows specific committee discharge and floor consideration procedures outlined in the Trade Act of 1974. This subsection is enacted by Congress as part of the rules of the House of Representatives and the Senate, superseding other rules. The procedures outlined in this subsection supersede other rules only if they are inconsistent with those rules. Both Houses have the constitutional right to change their rules regarding procedures at any time."
