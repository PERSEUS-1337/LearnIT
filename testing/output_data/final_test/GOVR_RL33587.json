    "content": "Medicare is a federal program established in 1965 to provide health insurance to individuals aged 65 and older, as well as qualified disabled individuals under 65, those with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). It consists of four parts (A-D) covering various medical services. Medicare acts as the primary payer for beneficiaries' medical bills, up to program limits, except for those covered by workers' compensation programs. Medicare is the primary payer for beneficiaries' medical bills, up to program limits. If an enrollee has other insurance, Medicare is billed first before other insurance. Medicaid pays only after Medicare and group health plans have paid. The Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) program, established in 1980, ensures other insurers pay first to reduce Medicare expenditures and extend the Medicare Trust Fund's life. The Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) program, established in 1980, made Medicare a secondary payer for medical claims involving non-group health insurance. MSP specifies instances where private insurance is primary and Medicare coverage is secondary. Medicare does not cover services paid for by other government entities like the Department of Veterans Affairs. MSP is different from Medicare supplement (Medigap) insurance policies, which are private policies providing supplemental coverage. Medigap policies are private supplemental coverage for individuals with Medicare as their primary payer. Medicare can step in as a secondary payer in cases of delayed primary payment, such as in medical liability claims or slow employer plan payments. Medicare can pay outstanding claims until a legal settlement is reached, and is entitled to recover its payments once a settlement is received. MSP laws have saved about $8 billion annually in Medicare spending, with $50 billion saved from FY2006 to FY2012. However, businesses and insurers find the paperwork requirements burdensome, leading to delays in settling liability cases. The American Bar Association urges Congress to simplify the process for dealing with MSP claims. HHS has increased workers processing claims, reorganized operations, and created standardized procedures for resolving smaller claims and some workers' compensation cases. In June 2012, HHS proposed a rule to expedite processing of certain MSP settlements. The SMART Act, part of H.R. 1845, created a new process for resolving MSP conditional payment claims. The law, signed by President Obama in January 2013, requires HHS to create a website for beneficiaries to access conditional payment information. Additional changes include data reporting requirements, appeal rights, and statutes of limitations. Medicare is the primary payer for retired beneficiaries, even with retiree health insurance. It is the secondary payer for working aged beneficiaries with group health insurance. Employer-sponsored health insurance is usually the primary payer for Medicare-eligible individuals with group coverage. Medicare may make a secondary payment if the group health plan does not cover the full bill. Under federal law, an employer with 20 or more employees must offer workers age 65 and older the same group health insurance coverage offered to other employees, without considering Medicare benefits. Individuals aged 65 or older with current employment status and in a group plan with more than 20 workers are entitled to the same benefits as younger employees. Employees with current employment status must actively work for the employer or be associated with the employer in a business relationship. They have the option to accept or reject employer group health coverage, with Medicare being secondary if certain guidelines are met. Employers are prohibited from paying for supplemental benefits for Medicare-covered services to avoid incentivizing employees to reject employer-sponsored coverage. Multiple-employer plans are also subject to these requirements. MSP requirements apply to multiple-employer plans and multi-employer plans under the Taft-Hartley law. Medicare is primary when each employer has less than 20 employees and secondary when at least one employer has 20 or more employees. Employers with less than 20 employees can request exemptions for working-aged employees, making Medicare primary for them. There are exceptions to MSP policy for working-aged individuals enrolled in Medicare Part B, individual health plans, or former spouses. Medicare is the primary payer for aged workers in employer-sponsored group health plans with less than 20 employees, while it is the secondary payer for disabled Medicare beneficiaries under age 65. Aging workers in group health plans with less than 20 employees are advised to enroll in Medicare when eligible to avoid gaps in coverage and higher costs. The Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) rules apply to disabled beneficiaries under age 65 with employer-sponsored health insurance. The requirements differ for disabled beneficiaries compared to aged workers, with a focus on the size of the employee group triggering secondary payer status. Multiple or multi-employer plans must comply with MSP rules if at least one employer has 100 or more employees. Exemptions from MSP requirements are not allowed for disabled workers enrolled in these plans. Disabled individuals under 65 can qualify for Medicare based on a diagnosis of ESRD. MSP rules apply for those covered by an employer-sponsored group health plan, regardless of employer size or current employment status. During the 30-month coordination period, group health plan coverage is the primary payer for ESRD-related costs for individuals with ESRD. After 30 months, Medicare becomes the primary insurer, even if the individual is also eligible for Medicare based on age or disability. During the 30-month coordination period, Medicare becomes primary after 30 months, even for individuals with employer-sponsored health insurance. There is an exception for beneficiaries with ESRD, where Medicare immediately becomes primary if specific conditions are met. Retiree health insurance remains primary for retirees who first qualify for Medicare based on ESRD and then turn 65 during the 30-month coordination period. Title X of COBRA allows certain group health plans to continue existing coverage for beneficiaries who experience changes in employment or family circumstances. This applies to group health plans offered by employers with 20 or more employees. COBRA benefits for group health plans offered by employers with 20 or more employees can last for 18 to 36 months, with enrollees paying up to 102% of the premium. COBRA is secondary to Medicare, and benefits may be terminated if the individual becomes entitled to Medicare. Spouses and children may still be eligible for COBRA if the primary beneficiary loses retiree coverage due to Medicare entitlement. Entitlement to Medicare due to ESRD affects COBRA continuation eligibility. Individuals who become eligible for Medicare while receiving COBRA benefits may face penalties and coverage delays if they do not enroll during the initial enrollment period. COBRA remains primary if entitlement to Medicare due to ESRD occurs before COBRA eligibility, but Medicare becomes primary once the 30-month coordination period ends. COBRA recipients not currently employed do not qualify for special enrollment in Medicare Part B. If individuals do not enroll in Medicare during the initial eight-month period, they may face a late enrollment penalty and have to wait until the next open enrollment period from January to March for coverage starting in July. Medicare acts as the secondary payer in cases where payment is expected from automobile medical insurance or other primary payers. Conditional payments may be made by Medicare when payment from primary payers is delayed, with a priority right of recovery from the primary payer in medical liability cases. Medicare acts as the secondary payer for items or services covered under workers' compensation laws. In contested claims, Medicare may be billed while a decision is pending. If a beneficiary exhausts all appeals under workers' compensation, Medicare becomes the primary payer for settlements. Medicare acts as the secondary payer for workers' compensation settlements. Beneficiaries must protect Medicare from unnecessary expenses by setting up a Workers' Compensation Medicare Set-aside Arrangement (WCMSA) for future medical costs. Federal providers, agencies, and laws are excluded from Medicare coverage. Medicare excludes federal providers, agencies, and laws from coverage, including U.S. military hospitals, Department of Veterans Affairs, and research grants. Medicaid is always secondary to Medicare, and Medicare coordinates benefits with the Federal Black Lung Program. Medicare does not pay for services covered under the Federal Black Lung Program for beneficiaries entitled to Black Lung medical benefits. Medicare coordinates benefits with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health benefits. Medicare may reimburse veterans for VA co-payment amounts for authorized services. VA may authorize private physicians for certain veterans with disabilities. TRICARE provides health care coverage for various military personnel and their families, while Medicare may supplement VA payments for physician services filed by veterans. Medicare can also cover services not authorized by the VA in certain cases. TRICARE for Life (TFL) is a Medigap program offering secondary coverage to beneficiaries aged 65 and older enrolled in both Medicare Part A and Part B. Medicare is the primary payer for services covered by both programs, while TRICARE is secondary. Beneficiaries must pay Medicare cost-sharing amounts and deductibles for services covered by Medicare but not TRICARE, and TRICARE cost-sharing amounts or deductibles for services covered by TRICARE but not Medicare. Overseas TFL beneficiaries have TRICARE as their primary coverage. TRICARE beneficiaries serving overseas must pay TRICARE's annual deductible and cost sharing. Medicare Part B premium must be paid to remain TFL-eligible for beneficiaries entitled to Medicare. CMS coordinates payment of Medicare benefits with other insurance to prevent mistaken payments and recoup payments when other insurance is primary. Prior to 2014, COBC and MSPRC oversaw MSP payments. The Benefits Coordination & Recovery Center (BCRC) was created in February 2014 to oversee MSP payments, addressing concerns about the efficiency of the system. The BCRC collects information on insurance coverage for Medicare beneficiaries from various sources to ensure proper payments by identifying primary and secondary payers. The Benefits Coordination & Recovery Center (BCRC) oversees Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) payments, determining primary payment responsibility between Medicare and other insurers. BCRC posts MSP records on the Common Working File (CWF) for verification and prepayment review. It also recovers funds owed to Medicare from liability, no-fault insurance, or workers' compensation plans. The Commercial Repayment Center (CRC) handles payment recoveries for group health plans. The Workers' Compensation Review Contractor (WCRC) oversees Workers' Compensation Medicare Set-Aside Arrangements (WCMSA) to cover future medical expenses in workers' compensation cases. Proposed set-aside accounts are reviewed by CMS before final approval. Medicare beneficiaries receive an Initial Enrollment Questionnaire (IEQ) for voluntary completion. Medicare beneficiaries receive a voluntary Initial Enrollment Questionnaire (IEQ) before Medicare entitlement begins. The questionnaire asks about employment status, health insurance coverage, and any employer-purchased health insurance. If not returned within 45 days, a follow-up survey is sent. The Social Security Act authorizes a data match program to identify cases where an insurer other than Medicare is the primary payer. The IRS matches data against tax records and sends it to SSA for processing for CMS. The BCRC reviews and analyzes this data. The BCRC reviews and analyzes data from the \"Data Match Employer-Employee File\" for CMS to identify secondary payer situations before Medicare makes payment. Employers who do not respond to a questionnaire about health insurance coverage may face civil monetary penalties. This information is used to determine claims where Medicare should not be the primary payer. The BCRC reviews data to identify secondary payer situations before Medicare pays. Health care providers must verify MSP information every 90 days and bill primary payers first. Section 111 of the MMSEA requires RREs to report health insurance status and payments involving Medicare beneficiaries. The SMART Act (P.L. 112-242) made changes to Section 111 of the MMSEA to speed up the process of estimating conditional payments for Medicare beneficiaries. It also reduced fines for non-compliance with reporting requirements and introduced civil penalties for failure to report claims. The MMSEA requires group health plans to report information to the BCRC on a quarterly basis regarding active, covered individuals who may be Medicare-eligible. The BCRC then provides insurers with information about primary and secondary coverage for Medicare beneficiaries. The Secretary of HHS can share this enrollment information with other government entities. The MMSEA Section 111 quarterly reporting requirements apply to non-group health plans like auto, homeowners, no-fault, and workers' compensation insurance. These plans must provide CMS with information on Medicare beneficiaries or dependent spouses for whom they are responsible for medical payments or who receive settlements. RREs are required to report diagnosis codes, financial awards, and other claimant information. The SMART Act modified reporting requirements for RREs under MMSEA Section 111, allowing plans to access or report Social Security or HICN numbers. CMS phased in implementation of reporting requirements for group health plans in 2009 and for workers' compensation and liability insurance through 2015. The HHS noted a significant increase in reports regarding MSP liability and payment situations since the MMSEA was passed. The number of reported MSP cases involving liability and no-fault plans rose by 176% from FY2008 to FY2011. The GAO reported a 42% increase in workers' compensation set-aside proposals submitted to the CMS contractor during the same period. However, some workers' compensation cases did not meet the financial thresholds required for CMS review. The health care provider submits a claim to the beneficiary's primary payer, who processes it according to the coverage contract terms. If the primary payer doesn't pay the full charges, Medicare may make secondary payments if the service is covered. Medicare payments cannot exceed what it would pay as the primary payer. Any third-party payer payments for Medicare-covered services are credited towards the beneficiary's deductibles and coinsurance. If the primary payment is less than the deductible, the beneficiary may be responsible for the remaining amounts. Medicare secondary payment amounts are subject to limits, such as for inpatient hospital care. Medicare acts as a secondary payer for inpatient hospital services, ensuring payments do not exceed Medicare's recognized amount. For example, if a patient's hospital services cost $6,800 and the primary payer covers $4,360, Medicare would pay the lowest of: $340 (Medicare's gross payment amount minus primary payer's payment), $3,517 (Medicare's gross payment amount minus deductible), $2,440 (hospital charge minus primary payer's payment), or $5,617 (hospital charge minus deductible). The hospital charge minus the Medicare inpatient deductible is $5,617, with Medicare paying $340. The combined payment from the primary payer and Medicare is $4,700. The beneficiary has no liability for Medicare-covered services if the primary payer's payment covers the deductible. Medicare acts as a secondary payer for physicians' services, ensuring payments do not exceed the lowest of the actual provider charge minus the primary payer's allowable charge, adjusted for copayment. Medicare acts as a secondary payer for medical claims, ensuring payments do not exceed the lowest of the actual provider charge minus the primary payer's allowable charge, adjusted for copayment. In some cases, Medicare may pay first for a claim, then determine it is the secondary payer. Medicare may also make conditional payments, such as when expecting payment from workers' compensation or no-fault insurance. Medicare can make conditional payments in cases where a claim is denied by a workers' compensation or no-fault insurance, or if a claim is not filed due to the beneficiary's incapacity. However, Medicare will not make conditional payments if a third-party payer plan claims to be secondary to Medicare, if a claim is not filed in a timely manner for reasons other than incapacity, or if a plan limits payment when the individual is entitled to Medicare. Medicare must be repaid for conditional payments by the primary payer or anyone who has received the primary payment, if it is demonstrated that another payer had a responsibility to make a payment. Repayment is expected when a beneficiary receives a settlement or other payment. CMS has the right of subrogation in cases involving Medicare beneficiaries, where the insurer seeks to recover its payment. Medicare has the \"right of subrogation\" to recover payments made for services provided to a beneficiary in case of a loss caused by a third party, such as in a car accident. Medicare can seek recovery from the beneficiary's collected money or through legal action against automobile insurance. Medicare will adjust its recovery to consider the beneficiary's costs in obtaining a settlement or judgment. Medicare has the right to recover payments made for services provided to a beneficiary in case of a loss caused by a third party. If the payment equals the judgment or settlement, Medicare will prorate the procurement costs. The MSP program aims to process and resolve conditional payment claims efficiently. The Commercial Repayment Center issues a Primary Payment Notice to the insurer or plan sponsor for verification. If the issue is not resolved, a demand letter is issued, and the employer or plan sponsor can pay or contest the claim. Interest accrues if the claim is neither paid nor contested. The BCRC follows up with affected parties in cases of accident or illness involving liability and insurers, reviews bills and relevant documents, calculates amount owed to Medicare, issues conditional payment notification, and determines total repayment after deducting allowable expenses. The BCRC calculates repayment owed to Medicare, deducts allowable expenses, issues demand letter with 60-day payment deadline. Beneficiaries can pay, appeal, or request waiver. Interest accrues on outstanding balance from demand date. If payment not received in 120 days, BCRC may refer issue to Treasury for collection. CMS will not refer debt to Treasury earlier than 120 days nor later than 240 days from demand letter. Time to resolve claim varies. MMSEA Section 111 reporting requirements increased claims. The MMSEA Section 111 reporting requirements led to an increase in conditional payment cases reported to CMS, causing complaints about delays in CMS response time. House and Senate hearings highlighted issues with MSP reporting requirements and contractor performance. GAO report in March 2012 identified areas for improvement in MSP administration. The GAO noted a substantial increase in average wait times for telephone calls to contractors regarding MSP cases from FY2008 to FY2011, along with delays in processing claims. CMS made progress in reducing its backlog during 2011 and created expedited options for speeding conditional payment claims in certain cases, such as the $1,000 Threshold and Fixed Payment Option for physical trauma-based injuries. The 2013 SMART Act streamlined the process for resolving Medicare's recovery claims for beneficiaries who suffer physical trauma-based injuries and receive settlements of $5,000 or less. Another option allows beneficiaries to self-calculate Medicare's recovery claim if certain conditions are met. The SMART Act, enacted on January 10, 2013, made civil penalties for non-compliance with insurance reporting requirements discretionary, with fines of up to $1,000 per day per claimant. Safe harbor proposals were solicited for identifying Medicare beneficiaries. A three-year limit was set for CMS to recover conditional payments after notice of settlement. The Act clarified the statute of limitations for lawsuits related to Medicare recovery claims. The SMART Act, enacted on January 10, 2013, made civil penalties for non-compliance with insurance reporting requirements discretionary. Final regulations were issued by the Secretary establishing a process for notifying Medicare of settlements and requesting a demand letter for reimbursement. A website was created for beneficiaries to access Medicare claims information. Certain liability claims became exempt from reporting and reimbursement as of January 1, 2014. The SMART Act, enacted in 2013, set a threshold amount of $1,000 for reporting and reimbursement by CMS. Beneficiaries can still use existing procedures for small-dollar and no-fault claims. The Act does not address creating set-aside accounts for future medical bills. CMS recommends individuals to protect Medicare's interest by creating set-aside accounts for future medical expenses in workers' compensation settlements to prevent Medicare from paying for services related to the settlement. Set-aside accounts are also becoming more common in other liability settlements. CMS does not review workers' compensation settlements for current Medicare beneficiaries when the award is less than $25,000 in total payments. However, individuals are advised to protect Medicare's interests by creating set-aside accounts for future medical expenses. The Workers Compensation Review Contractor (WCRC) reviews set-aside accounts in cases where an individual is within 30 months of becoming eligible for Medicare and the payment over the life of the settlement exceeds $250,000. The Workers Compensation Review Contractor (WCRC) considers factors like severity of illness, life expectancy, and medical costs for set-aside accounts. Once approved, Medicare won't cover injury-related expenses until the account is depleted. Set-asides are optional but recommended by ABA for Medicare's protection. CMS lacks formal regulations for set-asides, criticized by ABA and others. CMS has faced criticism for not having formal regulations for set-aside accounts, instead relying on informal guidance. In June 2012, CMS proposed new options for set-aside accounts. Lawmakers have introduced legislation to impose formal requirements for handling set-aside accounts. The number of set-aside accounts submitted to the WCRC has increased since Section 111 reporting requirements began. The average processing time for accounts rose from 22 days in April 2010 to 95 days in September 2011, but progress has been made in clearing up the backlog. CMS issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking in June 2012 for creating a standardized system for Medicare set-aside accounts in cases involving automobile injuries. CMS proposed new options for Medicare set-aside accounts in cases involving automobile and liability insurance, no-fault insurance, and workers' compensation. The rules are not finalized yet, but options include streamlining the process, setting specific conditions for Medicare not pursuing future claims, expanding the review system, amending payment options, allowing upfront payments, waiving payments for compromise settlements, and letting beneficiaries administer their own settlement accounts. CMS's MSP laws and regulations have saved Medicare about $50 billion from FY2006 to FY2012, with the largest savings from group health plans as primary payers. The annual MSP report shows total savings of over $8 billion in FY2011, increasing from $6 billion in FY2006. Workers' compensation payments have been the fastest growing part of MSP payments, with CMS payments to contractors also increasing. According to the GAO, payments to CMS contractors increased by $21 million from FY2008 to FY2011. Workloads for COBC, MSPRC, and WCRC also rose significantly during this time. Congress has expanded the MSP program to ensure required payments, reduce Medicare costs, and extend the Trust Fund's life. While MSP payments to CMS have increased, there is a backlog for contractors and concerns about reporting expenses and delays. The 2012 SMART Act addressed concerns about reporting expenses and delays among businesses, insurers, and attorneys. It created a centralized website for conditional claim information and set tighter timelines for CMS action. However, other issues related to MSP, such as creating set-aside accounts for future medical bills, remain unresolved. Legislation introduced in the 113th Congress, H.R. 1982, aims to establish a formal process for creating and reviewing workers' compensation set-aside accounts. The SMART Act, signed into law in 2013, includes provisions for an appeals process and allowing beneficiaries to set aside a percentage of settlements for future medical bills. Congress will oversee the implementation, with estimated budget savings for Medicare. However, there are concerns about CMS meeting timelines without additional funding. The SMART Act, signed into law in 2013, includes provisions for Medicare Secondary Payer Rules, making changes to MSP statute and CMS procedures. It applies to non-group health plans like workers' compensation and liability insurance. Section 201 directs CMS to provide a website for beneficiaries and authorized representatives to access information on claimed items and services related to potential settlements. The SMART Act, signed in 2013, requires CMS to update conditional payment information promptly after Medicare pays a claim. Beneficiaries can resolve discrepancies in downloaded statements of conditional payments through a timely process. No review is provided for this process, but beneficiaries can still appeal final conditional payment demands. Medicare beneficiaries or applicable plans can notify CMS 120 days before an expected settlement. Medicare beneficiaries can notify CMS 120 days before an expected settlement, judgment, award, or payment. Medicare has a 65-day response period to post conditional payments on the website. During a \"protected period,\" beneficiaries can download a final conditional payment amount. Regulations for the website and dispute resolution must be implemented within nine months. The Secretary must also establish a right of appeal for non-group health plans and their representatives. Section 202 and 203 of the MSP law require the Secretary of HHS to set a threshold amount for Medicare conditional payment appeals by non-group health plans. This threshold amount will apply to settlements, judgments, or payments related to liability insurance for physical trauma-based incidents starting from 2014. Section 203 of the MSP law modifies reporting requirements for Responsible Reporting Entities (RREs) regarding Medicare claimants, allowing fines of up to $1,000 per day for non-compliance. The Secretary must solicit proposals for safe harbor practices within sixty days of enactment, with final regulations to follow. Section 204 mandates modifications to reporting requirements for non-group health plans within 18 months of enactment. The SMART Act modifies reporting requirements for non-group health plans, allowing them to report Social Security Numbers or Health Insurance Claim Numbers of Medicare beneficiaries. The deadline for implementation can be extended if necessary. CMS must file suit for recovery of Medicare conditional payments within three years of receiving notice of a settlement. The SMART Act is estimated to reduce federal outlays by $45 million from FY2013 to 2022. The SMART Act is estimated to reduce federal outlays by $45 million from FY2013 to 2022. It allows for quicker legal settlements but may result in smaller payouts due to tighter timelines for estimating conditional payments. An interim final rule was issued on the Conditional Payment Web Portal under Section 201 of the SMART Act, effective from November 19, 2013. Key highlights include continued beneficiary access to claims details and the implementation of a multifactor authentication process for portal access. The implementation of a multifactor authentication process for access to the Web portal by authorized parties, including beneficiaries, attorneys, and applicable plans, is required by January 1, 2016. To obtain a final conditional payment amount, initial notice of pending liability insurance, no-fault insurance, or workers' compensation settlements must be provided to Medicare. Medicare will then have 65 days to post its initial claims compilation on the Web portal, with a possible 30-day extension. The beneficiary must notify CMS through the Web portal within 120 days of settlement, with initial notification to the Medicare contractor required at least 185 days prior to settlement. Disputes can be made once regarding improper claims, to be resolved within 11 business days. Traditional appeal rights are maintained after CMS issues its final demand. The beneficiary must notify CMS through the Web portal within 120 days of settlement, with initial notification to the Medicare contractor required at least 185 days prior to settlement. Disputes can be made once regarding improper claims, to be resolved within 11 business days. After disputes are resolved, the beneficiary can download a final conditional payment summary within 5 business days. Settlement information must be submitted within 30 days of securing the settlement, or the final conditional payment amount will expire. A pro rata reduction will be applied to the final conditional payment amount once settlement information is received. The final conditional payment amount and MSP recovery demand letter will be issued, excluding future medical items. The SMART Act established an appeals process for CMS determinations on MSP payments, allowing applicable plans to appeal. Proposed regulations outline an appeals process for liability insurers, no-fault insurers, and workers' compensation plans when Medicare seeks MSP recovery directly from insurers. CMS published an advanced notice seeking input on imposing Section 111 penalties on insurers for failure to report MSP situations. Recommendations are sought on defining noncompliance and determining penalty amounts for each day of noncompliance. Proposals for what actions constitute \"good faith efforts\" are also solicited. The CMS is seeking input on penalties for insurers who fail to report MSP situations, including defining noncompliance and penalty amounts. Suggestions are also requested on what actions qualify as \"good faith efforts\" to identify Medicare beneficiaries."
