    "content": "Widespread drought in the West, particularly in states like California, Oregon, Nevada, Washington, Montana, and Idaho, has led to extreme conditions. Congressional interest in managing water resources during drought has increased due to the impact on agriculture, communities, industry, recreation, and the environment. Federal government historically invested in water supply development, but defers to state and local governments for allocation. Federal efforts to address drought and water supply impacts have been limited due to deferring to state and local governments for allocation. Legislative proposals focus on managing water projects, supporting drought-related programs, and mitigating effects on agriculture, water supplies, and the environment. Bills introduced in Congress include S. 176, S. 1837, S. 1894, H.R. 2898, H.R. 2983, and H.R. 3045. H.R. 2898, the Western Water and American Food Security Act, passed the House on July 17, 2015. Negotiations are ongoing in the House and Senate to address concerns by federal and state governments regarding water resource management. A draft House bill was discussed during the FY2016 Omnibus, but no bill was introduced. Similarly, a new Senate bill addressing outstanding issues has not been introduced yet. New language is expected in the second session of the 114th Congress. Key provisions in H.R. 2898 and S. 1894 are being analyzed, including specific provisions for California and broader implications for nationwide water resources financing. The report discusses key provisions in H.R. 2898 and S. 1894 related to water resource management, including financing, permitting issues, project repayment policies, and support for new water storage and reuse. It does not cover every detail in the bills but refers to other CRS products for more comprehensive analysis. The California Emergency Drought Relief Act of 2015, represented by H.R. 2898 and S. 1894 in the 114th Congress, has garnered significant attention. These bills focus on water infrastructure and conveyance in California, as well as west-wide and national water management programs. The bills H.R. 2898 and S. 1894 in the 114th Congress focus on water infrastructure and conveyance in California, with provisions triggered by drought conditions and permanent changes in water management. Some provisions are specific to certain states while others have national application, with funding authorization varying between the bills. Many provisions relate to projects and programs of the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Reclamation, including the management of the Central Valley Project in California. The bills H.R. 2898 and S. 1894 focus on water projects and management during drought, specifically in California. They involve federal agencies like the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. These bills aim to amend existing programs and authorize new federal activities related to water supplies. Stakeholders have shown both support and opposition, with questions raised about their implementation. The bills direct water managers to maximize water supplies for users while adhering to laws and regulations. Some controversy surrounds how bills address implementation of the federal Endangered Species Act, specifically regarding water management under federal biological opinions designed to protect Delta smelt and salmon populations. Two federal BiOps currently limit operations of the federal CVP and the California State Water Project at certain times of the year, finding that proposed changes, including increased pumping, could jeopardize the existence of threatened species. The bills H.R. 2898 and S. 1894 aim to address water management for listed species under the federal Endangered Species Act. H.R. 2898 differs from S. 1894 by proposing changes to the implementation of federal BiOps for Delta smelt and salmon, including a new standard for determining species status and allowing higher levels of pumping. H.R. 2898 and S. 1894 aim to address water management for listed species under the federal Endangered Species Act. H.R. 2898 proposes changes to federal BiOps for Delta smelt and salmon, allowing higher pumping levels. Supporters believe it would improve flexibility, while opponents fear detrimental effects on species. S. 1894 also increases pumping but does not alter environmental laws. The bills aim to address water management for listed species under the federal Endangered Species Act by proposing changes to federal BiOps for Delta smelt and salmon. They contain provisions on nonnative species, environmental reviews, and data collection. The Administration expressed concerns with provisions in both bills and questioned the effectiveness of providing additional water supplies during a strong El Ni\u00f1o. H.R. 2898 and S. 1894 address drought-related water issues specific to California, focusing on the Central Valley Project (CVP) and potential water supplies during a strong El Ni\u00f1o. Despite the potential benefits of a strong El Ni\u00f1o, it is unlikely to end the current drought in California and the Southwest. These bills are likely to receive continued attention from Congress due to ongoing water management challenges in the region. The CVP and SWP are large water projects in California, delivering water to farms and cities. Legislation addressing their management is controversial due to water deliveries and pumping issues. Legislation addressing the management of the CVP and SWP in California is controversial due to the complex web of federal and state laws involved. H.R. 2898 and S. 1894 have raised questions among stakeholders about the potential impacts on water users, species, and water quality if water pumped from the Delta is increased. The proposed legislative changes aim to address the drought in California by considering the potential impacts on water users, species, and water quality. Questions arise regarding involuntary reductions to specified CVP and SWP users, potential reduced water supplies, changes in water availability timing, and implications of constructing the state WaterFix project. Legislative changes are proposed to address the drought in California, focusing on the CVP and SWP, as well as other projects. Topics include managing fish populations and water flows, operational flexibility during drought, water transfers, water rights protections, and new storage project studies. Operational changes to protect fisheries in the SWP and CVP are prominent issues in the proposed legislation. The proposed legislation aims to stabilize salinity levels in the Delta, protect water quality, provide adequate flows for aquatic species, and address water conveyance and flows in relation to fish populations listed under the ESA. H.R. 2898 and S. 1894 include provisions for managing water flows in operating the CVP and SWP in relation to fish populations. The bills aim to manage water flows in the CVP and SWP for fish populations, providing definitions for BiOps related to salmon and Delta smelt. The definitions in H.R. 2898 and S. 1894 codify the original BiOps, raising questions about potential updates or replacements in the future. The bill H.R. 2898 raises concerns about potential conflicts with earlier BiOps if updated or new ones are introduced. It addresses some issues, like considering relevant provisions of the Delta smelt BiOp. The bill also introduces a new standard for measuring the status of species, defining \"negative impact on the long-term survival\" as actions that significantly reduce the likelihood of a listed species' survival and recovery in the wild. The term \"negative impact on the long-term survival\" is used in H.R. 2898 to measure the effects of operational changes on Delta smelt and salmon. It raises questions about interpretation and implementation by water managers and potential litigation. This term is not found in the statutory language of the ESA but is similar to a phrase used in federal regulations. It means actions that reduce the likelihood of a listed species' survival and recovery in the wild by affecting reproduction, numbers, or distribution. The regulatory definition in H.R. 2898 may narrow the scope of the law by potentially excluding some actions covered by current regulations. Stakeholders are concerned that this new standard could negatively impact healthy fish stocks and species listed under the ESA. The regulatory definition in H.R. 2898 may narrow the scope of the law by potentially excluding some actions covered by current regulations. This standard complements existing standards and would likely require new determinations by DOI for listed species, with potential interpretations of terms like \"imminent\" negative impact on long-term survival. The curr_chunk discusses the potential effects of changes in water management on the Delta smelt, a threatened species. Both bills aim to increase water supplies while considering the impact on listed species. The long-term survival of the species is a key concern due to uncertainties in population reactions and unforeseeable stressors. H.R. 2898 proposes changes to how the Delta smelt BiOp are implemented, including a new method for calculating the incidental take level based on data since 1993. This differs from S. 1894, which aims to achieve the same objective within existing laws and regulations. The recalculated incidental take under H.R. 2898 is likely to be higher, allowing more agency flexibility due to higher Delta smelt levels. The proposed changes in H.R. 2898 suggest a new method for calculating the incidental take level based on data since 1993, which could potentially allow for increased pumping levels and more water for users. Some stakeholders are concerned about the impact on Delta smelt, while proponents argue that the new calculation method is based on up-to-date science and would not harm the species. The proposed changes in H.R. 2898 suggest a new method for calculating incidental take levels for Delta smelt, with a focus on data since 1993. This could potentially result in a lower incidental take level if population levels continue to decline. Both bills call for increased data collection and real-time monitoring of Delta smelt, but differ on how to implement changes to coordinated operations based on this data. The proposed changes in H.R. 2898 aim to refine the reasonable and prudent alternatives in the Delta smelt BiOp. It calls for increased data collection to inform managers on minimizing salvage and maximizing pumping. The Administration is concerned that these modifications may negatively impact long-term protection of Delta fish and wildlife. H.R. 2898 aims to refine the Delta smelt BiOp with increased data collection, but the Administration is concerned about potential negative impacts on long-term fish and wildlife protection. S. 1894 focuses on monitoring turbidity levels and identifying changes to improve water supply benefits, without a directive for immediate implementation of identified changes. The Old and Middle Rivers in the Delta can experience reverse flows due to high pumping levels, increasing the risk to fish. H.R. 2898 addresses negative OMR flows for listed species by setting a flow rate of -5,000 cfs unless data supports a lower rate. The Secretary of the Interior may require a lower flow rate to protect species, with H.R. 2898 outlining conditions for implementation based on real-time monitoring and forecasts. The bill also mandates increased flow rates if necessary to prevent negative impacts on Delta smelt survival. Supporters argue that these provisions would align with existing BiOps for Delta smelt and salmon. The change in flow rates for Delta smelt and salmon under H.R. 2898 has raised concerns among stakeholders. Some worry that setting higher flow rates could harm the species in the short term and decrease chances of long-term population mitigation. Critics argue that the high baseline approach may have detrimental effects on Delta smelt and other species. The use of undefined qualifiers in H.R. 2898 could impact the long-term survival of Delta smelt. S. 1894 mandates maximizing flows for water supply contractors without specifying flow rates in statute. Managers are directed to manage OMR flows to minimize water supply reductions for the CVP and SWP, in line with applicable laws. Both H.R. 2898 and S. 1894 aim to address salmon management in the Delta, with H.R. 2898 focusing on incorporating new science into salmon stock management and S. 1894 directing implementation of NOAA's Salmon Restoration Plan. The bills also aim to minimize water supply reductions for the CVP and SWP while providing legal protection for efforts to maximize water supplies. Section 202 of H.R. 2898 proposes adjusting RPAs in the salmon BiOp based on new science and data, with recommendations limited to actions reducing water supply impacts. Ambiguity exists regarding potential changes in pumping rates and flow reductions, leading to concerns about mandated increases rather than decreases in pumping rates. S. 1894 does not specify adjusting RPAs in the salmon BiOp based on new information, but requires identifying changes for increased water supplies. Stakeholders question if this would alter current flow management. However, the bill directs providing maximum water to contractors, potentially increasing pumping rates. Section 202(d) and (e) of H.R. 2898 discuss conservation measures to increase salmon population by evaluating physical habitat improvement, predation control, and hatchery programs. A framework in Section 202(e) identifies offsetting actions and their impact on salmon survival. Section 202(g) evaluates alternative management measures to increase pumping rates while maintaining salmonid survival. The curr_chunk discusses the potential for increasing pumping rates to offset the effects on salmon populations, with oversight responsibilities for adaptive management under the BiOp. Supporters argue that mitigating various factors could increase salmon survival and allow for more pumping, while critics may disagree with this approach. Critics may argue that associating conservation actions with increased salmon survival is challenging due to various factors affecting fish. They suggest that existing processes for calculating incidental take levels in the BiOps could already lead to greater abundance, allowing for more pumping. Section 202(f) of H.R. 2898 could help determine the percentage increase in salmon survival from alternative conservation measures. The directive in S. 1894 aims to quantify salmon survival due to conservation measures in the Delta. It allows for easier calculation of incidental take levels when pumping operations are adjusted. Adaptive management under both bills can assess the effectiveness of alternative management measures. S. 1894 is tied to the salmon BiOp and authorizes actions to help threatened and endangered fish populations. Both H.R. 2898 and S. 1894 propose conservation measures to increase salmon populations in the Delta, including nonstructural barriers, alternative hatchery salmon release strategies, and a trap-and-barge pilot project. S. 1894 authorizes $4 million per year through 2020 for the NOAA Salmon Recovery Plan. Both bills provide broad authority to address emergency drought conditions with limitations. Both H.R. 2898 and S. 1894 aim to streamline permit decisions and authorize expedited procedures for projects maximizing water supplies. H.R. 2898 includes a requirement for a drought operations plan, while S. 1894 does not have a similar provision. Both bills direct managers to approve projects and operations that provide additional water supplies to users, as long as they comply with applicable laws and regulations. The directive to maximize water supplies may have unintended consequences on species viability, recreation, and water quality. Requiring managers to prioritize water supplies could limit their flexibility in addressing long-term effects. While beneficial during drought conditions, the long-term impacts are uncertain. The provision in both bills regarding maximizing water supplies raises legal uncertainties and challenges in determining the maximum quantity of water supplies possible. Implementation of this directive could be difficult and contentious, as agencies and water users may not agree on what actions constitute maximizing water quantities. Some believe agencies are already maximizing water supplies to the detriment of species, while others argue they are not doing enough. Some advocates fear that maximizing water supplies may lead to reduced reservoir levels, causing larger water supply shortages in the future and jeopardizing urban water supplies. H.R. 2898 authorizes managers to increase OMR flows above the required levels under certain conditions. Section 306 of S. 1894 authorizes managers to increase OMR flows to -6,100 cfs or more if real-time monitoring shows no significant negative impact on Delta smelt survival. This provision raises questions about adjusting flow rates for other species and the definition of \"significant\" impact. Section 307 of H.R. 2898 authorizes temporary operational flexibility for CVP and SWP operations during the winter, allowing for increased flows on the Sacramento River under certain conditions. This could lead to more negative impacts on the OMR than allowed under the BiOps, raising concerns about potential effects on smelt and management decisions. The provision in Section 307(a) of H.R. 2898 may lead to increased pumping and water supplies for some CVP and SWP contractors. Concerns arise about potential water quality issues if additional water is exported from the Delta, impacting the ecosystem and water quality. Maintaining freshwater flows to the ocean is crucial for the Delta's salinity gradient and dilution of pollutants. Reducing water flows could have negative effects on the ecosystem and water quality. Increased pumping may have a diminished effect on water quality if salinity gradient is maintained. CVP and SWP operations' impact on water quality and species are regulated by SWRCB. H.R. 2898 limits water flows to address environmental effects, such as imposing requirements under BiOps to avoid negative impacts on listed species. The provision in H.R. 2898 aims to avoid negative impacts on listed species by limiting water flows for CVP and SWP users, as long as it does not reduce water supplies. Unclear baseline for water supplies and requirements under BiOps during temporary operational flexibility. Section 307(d) requires actions to align with state laws and regulations, allowing for \"less negative\" OMR flows. The provision in H.R. 2898 aims to limit water flows for CVP and SWP users to avoid negative impacts on listed species. Section 307(d) aligns actions with state laws and regulations, allowing for \"less negative\" OMR flows during sediment flushes. It also addresses the application of the salmon BiOp from April 1 to May 31 each year, with potential exceptions for emergency water supplies. The Commissioner of Reclamation, in coordination with FWS and NMFS, would conduct a monitoring program to identify any negative impacts of temporary flexibility authorized under the section, including exceeding incidental take levels under the ESA. The provision does not require modifying temporary flexibility if negative effects are found but does call for identifying actions to mitigate impacts. Section 307(e) states that CVP and SWP operations resulting in flows \"less negative\" than -7,500 cfs before the 56 cumulative days of operational flexibility authorized would not count toward the 56-day cumulative period in the legislation. H.R. 2898 allows for temporary operational flexibility in flow rates on the Sacramento River, with a focus on maintaining a daily average flow of -7,500 cfs for at least 56 days. If this requirement is not met within 56 days, emergency ESA consultation procedures would be implemented. The legislation also specifies that detailed supporting information may not be required within the given timeframe for making determinations. The provision in H.R. 2898 and S. 1894 aims to facilitate water transfers within the CVP system, allowing for more flexibility and expedited review processes. This includes transferring water to urban agencies and addressing San Joaquin River inflow-to-export issues. The bills aim to expedite water transfers within the CVP system, addressing San Joaquin River inflow-to-export ratios and requiring completion of NEPA and ESA requirements within 30 days. They also direct the Secretaries to adopt a 1:1 I:E ratio for increased river flows resulting from transfers. Section 308 of H.R. 2898 and S. 1894 aim to expedite water transfers within the Central Valley Project (CVP) system, requiring completion of NEPA and ESA requirements within 30 days. The bills also direct the Secretaries to adopt a 1:1 inflow-to-export ratio for increased river flows resulting from transfers. S. 1894 requires federal officials to complete NEPA and ESA requirements promptly for water transfers related to fallowing nonpermanent crops. It also mandates evaluation of proposals to increase flows in the San Joaquin River in a timely manner and adoption of a 1:1 inflow-to-export ratio during specific periods. Under H.R. 2898 and S. 1894, water transfer approval processes would be expedited, with H.R. 2898 proposing a 30-day limit for decisions and S. 1894 aiming for the \"shortest practicable time period.\" The bills address challenges faced by water agencies in transferring water, with a focus on the impact on threatened or endangered species listed under the ESA. Both H.R. 2898 and S. 1894 address San Joaquin River I:E ratios for water transfers, with H.R. 2898 allowing a 1:1 ratio unless a more restrictive ratio is deemed necessary to avoid negative impacts on listed salmonid species. S. 1894 also includes conditions for the 1:1 ratio and both bills implement it from April 1 to May 31 annually. Both H.R. 2898 and S. 1894 address San Joaquin River I:E ratios for water transfers. The current BiOp allows a 1:1 ratio in \"critically dry\" years, increasing up to 4:1 in \"wet\" years. S. 1894 includes language to protect California water rights priorities and obligations under existing law, while H.R. 2898 includes provisions related to altering obligations under the CVPIA. Title V of H.R. 2898 aims to protect California water rights priorities under state law, directing the Secretary of the Interior to adhere to California's water rights laws and honor water rights senior to those held by the United States for operation of the Central Valley Project. Specific requirements are set for Reclamation to provide water quantities to agriculture water service contractors in the Sacramento River Watershed during different water years. Section 505 of H.R. 2898 and S. 1894 address water rights protections under California law for the operation of the Central Valley Project. S. 1894 includes provisions on area of origin and water rights protections, with a focus on no redirected impacts and effects on existing obligations. The bill also references California Water Code citations to ensure no limitations on state water rights laws. S. 1894 includes provisions on water rights protections under California law, aiming to protect all water users under state law from direct involuntary reduction of water supply. S. 1894 includes provisions on water rights protections under California law, aiming to protect all water users from direct involuntary reduction of water supply. The bill also includes a provision requiring documentation and explanation of any secretarial determination that an action under Title I of the bill cannot be carried out without resulting in redirected adverse impacts. Additionally, S. 1894 explicitly states that federal officials cannot take actions that would jeopardize threatened or endangered species or cause adverse effects beyond existing BiOps, preempt state law obligations related to the CVP, or modify obligations under the CVPIA. Both bills address water allocation priorities for the Central Valley Project (CVP) and State Water Project (SWP) users south of the Delta, with concerns about unintended shortages for senior water users. S. 1894 includes provisions on complying with state law, avoiding jeopardy to species, and specific annual water allocations tied to different water year types. H.R. 2898 and S. 1894 aim to expedite completion of ongoing California surface water storage studies authorized under CALFED. The bills establish deadlines and processes for construction, with H.R. 2898 directing Reclamation to complete feasibility studies and imposing financial penalties for delays. The bills H.R. 2898 and S. 1894 aim to expedite completion of California surface water storage studies authorized under CALFED. They establish deadlines and processes for construction, with H.R. 2898 imposing financial penalties on Reclamation for delays. Construction authority would require 100% nonfederal funding, and there is a directive for Reclamation to complete the study for Temperance Flat Reservoir. Section 313 of S. 1894 directs Reclamation to complete CALFED studies by specified deadlines. The House bill H.R. 2898 and Senate bill S. 1894 aim to expedite completion of California surface water storage studies authorized under CALFED. S. 1894 stipulates that potential federal funding may be available for projects like Los Vaqueros, NODOS/Sites Reservoir, and Upper San Joaquin if specific requirements are met. Funding authorization would depend on the project's feasibility and benefits related to ecosystem, water quality improvements, and flood control. The benefits of federal involvement in CALFED surface water storage studies include ecosystem improvements, water quality enhancements, flood control, emergency response, water supplies, and recreational purposes. Congress may determine its interest in proceeding with these projects and the potential for specific provisions in the bills to facilitate their completion. The Administration's recommendation on construction will impact the studies' ability to further the goal of new water storage in California. There is support for expedited completion of the studies, but the Administration has expressed concerns with these provisions. The Administration highlighted that certain water storage projects in California require nonfederal funding and participation. There are differing opinions on federal involvement in these projects, with one bill proposing federal funding without authorization for construction, while another bill authorizes construction as a nonfederal responsibility. Both H.R. 2898 and S. 1894 aim to encourage federal involvement in new water storage projects by authorizing construction as a nonfederal responsibility. H.R. 2898 proposes expediting new storage projects through a reporting process and setting a three-year deadline for project studies costing no more than $3 million each. Section 805 allows the Secretary to enter agreements with nonfederal sponsors for project planning, design, and permitting. Section 806 aims to expedite construction authorizations by proposing projects in an annual report for congressional approval, including new projects and enhancements to existing ones. Congress would decide on funding for these projects, which could receive support from both federal and nonfederal sources. S. 1894 authorizes funding for federal and nonfederal storage projects under a new Reclamation Surface Storage Account. Unlike H.R. 2898, it does not include provisions for expediting project studies or a reporting requirement for new projects. Section 312 of S. 1894 allows federal funding for construction of authorized federal storage projects and participation in nonfederal projects under certain conditions. The bill authorizes $600 million in discretionary funding with a maximum federal cost share of 50% for federal projects and 25% for nonfederal projects. The bills address issues related to authorization of new storage projects, including funding, project leadership, and cost allocation. H.R. 2898 proposes a reporting process to facilitate project authorization and allows for a stronger nonfederal role in project implementation. The bills propose different approaches to funding new federal and nonfederal storage projects, with H.R. 2898 supporting projects based on existing Reclamation law and S. 1894 suggesting a new cost-sharing structure. The Administration prefers federal participation in state and locally led projects over perpetuating historical federal subsidies for water storage projects. The debate continues on the need for new projects and the appropriate split of responsibilities for new investments in storage. Congress is considering the federal roles in nontraditional water supplies, water efficiency, and conservation. This includes recycling wastewater, desalination, stormwater capture, and incentives for water-saving technologies. There is no comprehensive policy outlining the federal role in these activities, but some Congresses and Administrations have supported programs in this area. Current federal activities in nontraditional water supplies, efficiency, and conservation include programs like the U.S. Department of Agriculture's water conservation assistance, DOI's WaterSMART initiative, and EPA's WaterSense labeling effort. The focus is on augmenting municipal water supplies, historically federal actions have been more focused on water quality rather than quantity management. The federal government has supported nontraditional sources, conservation, and efficiency in areas like energy generation. H.R. 2898 does not specifically authorize new alternative water supply projects but includes water reuse in its definition of \"project.\" This allows reuse projects to be eligible for inclusion in the annual Report to Congress on Future Water Project Development. S. 1894 includes provisions for federal support for alternative water supplies, efficiency, and conservation. It authorizes funding for water recycling, desalination, and innovative water supply projects. Mandatory funding of $75 million for desalination projects is established under Section 301(c) for 25 years starting in 2026. Federal grant funding is also authorized for water recycling and reuse projects. S. 1894 authorizes federal grant funding for water recycling and reuse projects, prioritizing drought-affected areas. It establishes $40 million in funding for Title XVI projects for 25 years starting in 2026. The bill also allows the Secretary of the Interior to enter into voluntary agreements with water agencies for water conservation programs, with 75% of conserved water retained for wildlife refuges. Additionally, it amends the Secure Water Act to provide federal assistance for water management projects. The bill authorizes federal grant funding for water recycling, reuse, and other water management projects, including desalination. It includes new program authorizations for EPA, such as a grant program for desalination projects with federal cost sharing. EPA would be authorized to provide assistance for project studies and designs, with $10 million per year allocated for FY2016-FY2020. This authority is new for EPA, as it currently does not have experience with desalination projects. Section 321 authorizes the WaterSense program, a voluntary labeling program to reduce water use, with $5 million per year allocated to EPA for implementation. Section 327 establishes a new EPA program for research on innovative water supply and conservation technologies. The bill authorizes grants and contracts for innovative water supply and conservation technologies, with $35 million appropriated for FY2016-FY2020. It includes a new program within USDA's Rural Water and Waste Disposal Program to assist drought-stricken rural communities with up to 100% grants for projects such as point-of-use treatment and new water-source facilities, with $15 million authorized for pilot projects. The bill authorizes $15 million for up to 15 pilot projects to implement a new program for innovative water supply and conservation technologies. Federal support for nontraditional water supplies and efficiency measures may raise concerns about the expansion of the federal role and fiscal impacts. Challenges include fragmentation of water-related programs across federal agencies and differing eligibility criteria and technological emphases. Each technology and water supply source has its own trade-offs. H.R. 2898 and S. 1894 propose different approaches to federal support for nontraditional water supplies, efficiency, and conservation. S. 1894 would expand federal programs for various technologies, but it is unclear how these new activities would align with existing programs. Eligibility criteria for these programs vary, and interest in nontraditional water supplies exists beyond drought-affected western states. H.R. 2898 focuses on western U.S. water reuse projects, while S. 1894 expands support for alternative water supplies nationwide. The proposed programs in S. 1894 involve multiple federal agencies and aim to expedite decision-making on surface water supply projects. Funding availability, project complexity, and state/local support all impact the timing of these decisions. Efforts in H.R. 2898 and S. 1894 aim to streamline environmental compliance processes for water supply projects by making changes to federal agency procedures under NEPA. This includes analyzing and considering environmental impacts before final project decisions are made. Compliance under NEPA is required for projects on federal land or those needing federal authorization or financing. NEPA compliance for projects requiring federal authorization or financing involves preparing an environmental impact statement (EIS) or environmental assessment (EA). The lead agency responsible for the project must consult with other federal agencies and tribal or state agencies with jurisdiction over affected resources. Federal agencies follow regulations from the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) when implementing NEPA. The CEQ regulations guide agencies in documenting compliance with NEPA for projects requiring federal approval or funding. Different agencies may vary in how they demonstrate compliance, with some integrating NEPA into feasibility studies. Legislative options aim to speed up project delivery by involving cooperating agencies in the NEPA process and other environmental decisions. Environmental streamlining provisions in H.R. 2898 focus on coordinating actions and input from federal agencies, especially regarding consultations and approvals that impact project development. Provisions in H.R. 2898 aim to streamline environmental compliance, particularly in Titles III, VII, and VIII. Section 302 in Title III allows the governor to request expedited procedures for projects providing water supplies during emergency drought conditions in California. The agency responsible for the project must issue a final decision within 10 days of a meeting with other federal agencies involved. H.R. 2898 aims to streamline environmental compliance for projects not requiring congressional authorization. Title VII, the Water Supply Permitting Act, establishes new procedures for projects in Reclamation states on DOI or USDA lands by nonfederal entities. Approval decisions must comply with applicable law. Title VII of H.R. 2898 establishes Reclamation as the lead agency for coordinating federal approvals for new surface water storage projects, in compliance with applicable laws like the Federal Land Policy and Management Act and National Forest Management Act. The permit application process is integrated with NEPA compliance, and Reclamation must establish procedures similar to DOI or USDA for permit issuance. Sections 703, 704, and 705 of Title VII outline specific requirements for project approval. The provisions in Sections 703, 704, and 705 of Title VII establish responsibilities and requirements for lead and cooperating agencies, similar to those under NEPA regulations. Reclamation would coordinate a new review process without eliminating the existing one. Each agency's interpretation will determine how the Reclamation-lead process integrates with the existing process for NEPA compliance. Section 704 requires Reclamation to implement a coordination process, including a new pre-application process and a unified environmental document for project approval decisions. Title VIII, the Bureau of Reclamation Project Streamlining Act, aims to expedite project completion by accelerating feasibility studies and reports for surface water projects. Section 706 allows DOI to accept funds from nonfederal project applicants to expedite permit evaluations. The Bureau of Reclamation Project Streamlining Act aims to expedite project completion by accelerating feasibility studies, environmental reviews, and NEPA analysis for surface water projects. Section 805 would codify existing regulations and establish deadlines for comment periods and decision-making processes. The Senate bill on project streamlining includes reporting requirements to track project status, financial penalties for agencies missing deadlines, and a statute of limitations on project study claims. It has fewer provisions for environmental compliance compared to H.R. 2898. The bill allows for expedited decision-making by the governor of California and emergency environmental reviews for drought conditions. Reclamation is required to complete feasibility studies and environmental reviews. The Senate bill requires Reclamation to complete feasibility studies and environmental reviews for CALFED storage projects by specific dates. It authorizes states to assume NEPA compliance responsibilities and allows for expedited decision-making on California drought projects. Both House and Senate bills include deadlines for project decisions. The House and Senate bills include provisions for expedited decision-making on projects, with a 10-day deadline. The bills also require compliance with applicable laws before project approval. Titles VII and VIII of H.R. 2898 aim to accelerate federal decision-making, primarily implemented by Reclamation. It is unclear how Reclamation will implement the mandates in Title VII, the Water Supply Permitting Act. Currently, federal agencies must issue permits for water supply projects on their land. Title VII of H.R. 2898 does not explicitly waive NEPA requirements for permits or grants of right-of-way on federal land. It establishes procedures for Reclamation to coordinate environmental compliance but does not direct changes to DOI or USDA procedures. Reclamation's interpretation will determine integration with existing procedures and any differences in project coordination. The new project coordination procedures under Title VII may add steps to the project approval process, including requirements related to the pre-application process, preparation of an environmental document, and data monitoring. Title VIII establishes requirements for projects Reclamation can approve, with provisions similar to existing NEPA regulations. The impact on project delivery time depends on how the environmental review process is expedited. The environmental review process may impact project delivery time, with potential delays due to project economics and market challenges. Bills aim to provide federal financial support for water supply projects through new financing mechanisms. Federal funding for water supply projects has historically been provided through discretionary appropriations to Reclamation, the Corps, and USDA. However, demand typically exceeds availability, leading to backlogs for maintenance and construction. Due to fiscal constraints and budget caps, some support alternative financing methods like leveraging federal funds or directing federal receipts towards specific project types. Title IX of H.R. 2898 authorizes new discretionary funding for surface water storage projects while maintaining the traditional Reclamation financing model. It allows for prepayment by nonfederal Reclamation project users, conversion of water service contracts to repayment contracts, and accelerated repayment of construction costs. Title IX of H.R. 2898 authorizes new discretionary funding for surface water storage projects, allowing for prepayment by nonfederal Reclamation project users. This provision accelerates the repayment of construction costs and enables the conversion of water service contracts to repayment contracts. 50% of the prepayment proceeds would go towards funding projects in a new Surface Storage Account, with an estimated $360 million available for projects over the FY2016-FY2020 period. S. 1894 authorizes new financing provisions to address drought, including priority consideration for drought-related projects under EPA's state revolving fund programs, federal funding for innovative water supply projects in the western US, and mandatory funding for desalination and water reuse projects starting in FY2026. Section 103 addresses California's use of funds in its SRF programs for wastewater and drinking water infrastructure projects under the Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act. S. 1894 would direct the EPA Administrator to prioritize projects in California that provide additional water supplies to areas at risk of inadequate supply for public health and safety or to improve drought resiliency. It would also expedite Buy American waiver requests and authorize 40-year loan repayments to the State Revolving Funds. The SDWA SRF program allows for loans to be repaid within 20 years, extendable to 30 years for economically disadvantaged communities. The bill does not authorize EPA to modify state funding allocations or criteria for the CWA and SDWA SRF programs in California. It aims to prioritize existing SRF-eligible projects like water recycling and conservation, as well as source water and storage projects for public health. The California agencies administering the SRF programs have established procedures for identifying eligible projects, including those addressing public health priorities. The bill does not change these procedures, and Intended Use Plans are open to public participation. Priority is given to projects that provide additional water supplies or meet state objectives. The bill aims to expedite funding, but it is uncertain how quickly this can happen given existing priorities. The authority under the bill expires when a state-declared drought declaration is lifted or on September 30, 2017. The Reclamation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (RIFIA) would authorize $200 million in federal financing for water supply projects in western states, Alaska, Hawaii, and others. Projects costing a minimum of $20 million could receive up to 49% funding for water recycling, new infrastructure, and repair projects. Funding expires when the drought declaration is lifted or on September 30, 2017. The Reclamation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (RIFIA) authorizes $200 million in federal financing for water supply projects in western states, Alaska, Hawaii, and others. Projects costing a minimum of $20 million could receive up to 49% funding for water recycling, new infrastructure, and repair projects. Priority is given to areas facing water resource challenges, with consideration for projects that contribute to a safe water supply for various uses. The RIFIA provisions are similar to the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) but tailored for Reclamation projects. The Reclamation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (RIFIA) authorizes $200 million in federal financing for water supply projects in western states, Alaska, Hawaii, and others. RIFIA is narrower in scope than WIFIA, with assistance limited to areas facing water resource challenges and allowing irrigation districts to receive funding. States can lead NEPA processes under RIFIA. S. 1894, the Reclamation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (RIFIA), differs from WIFIA by not having a time limitation and allowing states to lead NEPA permitting for projects. It also includes mandatory funding for alternative water supply projects through the Federal Support for State and Local Drought Solutions Fund, receiving surplus receipts starting in FY2026 at $150 million per year for 25 years. The proposed bill would provide funding for various water projects, including desalination, Title XVI projects, and innovative finance projects. H.R. 2898 authorizes fewer new programs with adherence to previous funding models, while S. 1894 authorizes new appropriations and financing options. Congress may need to consider the overall spending on water projects and whether it is offset by other changes. S. 1894 authorizes new appropriations and financing options for water projects, with a federal cost-share of 50% for each project. The bill introduces new financing sources like RIFIA and the State and Local Drought Solutions Fund, without offsetting federal revenues. This contrasts with H.R. 2898, which accelerates revenue streams by allowing prepayment of construction costs and establishing a funding account for water project expenses subject to discretionary appropriations. Supporters argue that both bills have advantages that address concerns. The bills, RIFIA and the State and Local Drought Solutions Fund, offer advantages such as leveraging small federal appropriations and tapping into Reclamation fund balances. H.R. 2898 focuses on traditional surface water storage projects, while S. 1894 supports alternative water supplies like desalination and water reuse projects. S. 1894 also introduces new financing options and alters requirements for existing sources to prioritize drought projects. H.R. 2898 maintains traditional Reclamation law financing for drought projects, with beneficiaries responsible for repayment. The Administration opposes this approach due to perpetuating historical subsidies. The RIFIA approach in S. 1894 authorizes federal support for water storage projects, with costs shifted to nonfederal interests. Issues include state involvement, eligibility for assistance, and budgetary concerns. The RIFIA provisions in WRRDA 2014 raised federal budgetary and revenue issues, with concerns about revenue loss and pay-as-you-go procedures. The FAST Act repealed a provision prohibiting recipients of WIFIA assistance from issuing tax-exempt bonds for non-WIFIA project costs. The proposed RIFIA provisions in response to stakeholder criticism do not restrict the use of municipal tax-exempt bonds for project financing. However, S. 1894 requires offsetting funds to cover any decrease in federal revenue from using these bonds. The bill does not specify legislative offsets for this revenue decrease, posing a potential issue for Congress in implementing the RIFIA program. The broader issues raised by H.R. 2898 and S. 1894 could impact the ESA implementation. The bills H.R. 2898 and S. 1894 could impact the implementation of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) by potentially setting a precedent for how federal agencies manage endangered and threatened species. The provisions in the bills focus on managing water supplies for users, which could affect species like the Delta smelt and salmon. Proponents argue that these provisions would support the ESA without amending it. The bills H.R. 2898 and S. 1894 contain provisions that could limit federal agencies' discretion in managing water resources to conserve and recover listed species under the ESA. These provisions aim to maximize water supplies while remaining consistent with existing laws and regulations, potentially posing challenges for agencies in anticipating and responding to the water needs of species in the long term. The bills H.R. 2898 and S. 1894 aim to maximize water supplies for users while also monitoring and protecting listed species like Delta smelt and salmon. Real-time monitoring of species populations would be authorized to improve understanding of how water operations impact these species. Activities authorized in H.R. 2898 would increase real-time monitoring of listed species and measure the effects of water operations on their populations, potentially leading to adjustments in water operations to benefit both users and species. Proponents of provisions in H.R. 2898 believe they will enhance scientific support and transparency for water operations. DOI criticized some aspects but acknowledged improvements in data gathering and monitoring. Changes to the Delta smelt and salmon BiOps under H.R. 2898 have raised concerns about setting a new precedent for ESA implementation and politicizing the process. H.R. 2898 could create conflicting directives for ESA implementation, potentially harming listed species. Proponents argue it would not amend ESA and provisions for Delta smelt and salmon would be within existing BiOps framework. The bill may set a precedent for proposing exceptions to BiOps on a species-by-species basis. The provisions in H.R. 2898 aim to update the BiOps with new data and science to maximize water supplies for users. Supporters argue that the changes are necessary, while critics believe they could harm fish populations and have broad implications for listed species. The approach to addressing the needs of Delta smelt and salmon under H.R. 2898 contrasts with the current BiOps. H.R. 2898 proposes a new approach to determining the effects of water flows on listed species, shifting responsibility to water managers rather than relying solely on BiOps analyses. This method sets a baseline for water flows to maximize supplies to contractors and assesses harm to species from that baseline. The proposed approach under H.R. 2898 shifts responsibility to water managers for determining the effects of water flows on listed species, setting a baseline for water flows to maximize supplies to contractors. Critics argue that the baseline flows could have unknown environmental consequences for species and may harm them in the short and long term. DOI also states that the approach could be inconsistent with the Endangered Species Act. Both bills aim to increase water deliveries and reliability for contractors south of the Delta, lacking specifics on water amounts. They grant agencies discretion to maximize water use while complying with laws. Delivery uncertainties raise questions on the potential impact of the bills on water supply. The implementation of maximizing water supplies provision could be difficult and contentious, as agencies and water users may not agree on actions that would provide maximum water quantities. Some believe agencies are already maximizing water supplies to the detriment of species, while others argue they are not doing enough within existing laws. Questions arise about potential unintended consequences for species and ecosystems. Some argue that maximizing water supplies for users in the Bay-Delta may have unintended consequences for species and ecosystems. The federal government's role in addressing drought-related challenges is a major issue, with questions about its prominence and substance. Outside of federal agricultural assistance programs, most drought preparedness and response efforts have been at the state and local level. Some propose changes to the federal government's role in drought-related activities, suggesting a focus on strengthening specific areas like alternative water supplies and infrastructure investments. H.R. 2898 includes provisions increasing the nonfederal role in permitting and potentially transferring projects to the state. Some argue for altering traditional federal roles, such as setting nonfederal cost shares for projects. Coordination between federal and state governments is crucial for water deliveries in California's CVP and other projects. Issues related to federal, state, and local coordination, funding considerations, and governance structures play a significant role in determining water deliveries in California's CVP and other drought-affected areas. The federal government's involvement in decision-making processes and the allocation of funding for drought-related initiatives are key considerations for Congress, as highlighted in the two bills discussed. H.R. 2898 and S. 1894 propose different approaches to funding water projects. H.R. 2898 would use repayment revenues to offset limited new appropriations, while S. 1894 authorizes significant discretionary and mandatory funding, some of which does not need to be repaid. S. 1894 also includes federal credit support for projects, allowing for leveraging of federal funds at low interest rates. Nonfederal entities may also contribute to funding federal projects. The current legislative proposals focus on funding water projects and the extent to which nonfederal entities can contribute. Congressional discussions may arise regarding the geographic scope of federal actions and assistance in drought-affected areas. The policy question is whether Congress is addressing the current Western drought, drought in arid regions, drought nationwide, or gaps in water supply and demand. The recent legislation focuses on increasing water supply during drought. Factors like demographic trends, water demand, and management of water resources will shape the impacts of future droughts. Discussions include federal actions and assistance in drought-affected areas. Discussions on federal assistance and programs for drought preparedness and mitigation may broaden the legislative debate beyond water supply augmentation and federal water infrastructure operations."
