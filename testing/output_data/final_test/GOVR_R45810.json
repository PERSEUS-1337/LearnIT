    "content": "President Trump and U.S. lawmakers are concerned about the country's reliance on critical mineral imports, especially rare earth elements (REEs) controlled by China. Chinese export quotas and disruptions in supply chains have highlighted the vulnerability of the U.S. in defense, energy, and electronics industries. Legislators are considering bills to address these supply risks and vulnerabilities. Legislators deliberated on bills to address rare earth supply risks and promote domestic mine development. Policy questions arose regarding the necessity of a domestic supply chain and the reliability of alternative supply chains outside China. Concerns expanded beyond rare earths to include other essential minerals for the economy and national security. The Presidential Executive Order 13817 tasked the Department of the Interior to publish a list of 35 critical minerals used in various applications. Congress focused on rare earth supply after China's actions in 2010 led to price increases. Several bills have been introduced to address the issue, including streamlining permitting for rare earth production in the United States. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2014 included provisions for studying rare earth materials and purchasing heavy REEs for the national defense stockpile. The U.S.'s only rare earth mine in Mountain Pass, CA, owned by Molycorp, Inc., was dormant in 2010 due to China's dominance in rare earth oxide production. Between 2010 and 2012, Molycorp, Inc. faced challenges in reopening the only rare earth mine in the United States and establishing a vertically integrated operation. Questions were raised about developing a domestic supply chain, the necessity of a domestic supply chain to address supply risks, and the potential benefits of an alternative supply chain outside China. Concerns also focused on the investment and skill level required for building out the operation. In 2012, Molycorp, Inc. reopened its Mountain Pass mine and Lynas Corporation, Ltd. began production in Australia, adding more rare earth elements to the global mix. However, most production was in light rare earth elements (LREEs) instead of the heavy rare earth elements (HREEs) needed for permanent magnets. This led to lower demand as companies sought alternatives or diversified their raw material supply outside of China, where there was an oversupply of REEs due to illegal production. In June 2015, Molycorp filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection due to falling prices and debt, making the Mountain Pass mine unsustainable. MP Mine Operations LLC purchased the mine for $20.5 million in June 2017. Production reportedly restarted in 2018. In March 2019, the Chinese government announced reduced REE production quotas, causing concerns about supply vulnerabilities for critical minerals like REEs, cobalt, and tantalum. The National Research Council, DOE, and MIT conducted criticality assessments on minerals like REEs, cobalt, and tantalum. Various models have been proposed to analyze supply risk and vulnerabilities. Congressional findings highlight the increasing demand for minerals by emerging economies for economic growth. The United States is heavily reliant on mineral imports despite having vast resources. China's control over rare earth elements poses a national security risk. Developing a domestic industrial base for critical minerals is crucial, despite regulatory barriers. Domestic investment is necessary, even with associated risks. The United States must accept some risk in aiding domestic investment opportunities for minerals. Congressional hearings have addressed the issue of critical minerals and the need for reliable supply chains. Policy proposals aim to reduce import dependence and develop domestic mineral supply. Policy proposals are being considered to streamline the permitting process for domestic critical mineral production and potentially open more public lands for mineral exploration. A 2017 USGS report assesses 23 critical minerals for the nation, but does not specify availability on federal lands targeted by legislative proposals. Congress is also focused on maintaining environmental protection and public input in any new permitting process. The report examines the drafting of the critical minerals list, reasons for classification, current production locations, and countries with the largest reserves. The report discusses the largest reserves of critical minerals, materials needed for energy systems, supply chains for rare earth elements, and U.S. critical mineral policy. Policy issues like trade with China and conflict minerals are mentioned. Concerns over mineral shortages for national security have been ongoing in the U.S. since the early 1800s. The National Defense Stockpile was formed in response to shortages during WWII and the Korean War to address national security and defense emergencies. The Strategic Materials Act of 1939 and the Strategic and Critical Materials Stockpiling Act of 1946 authorized the establishment of the stockpile with a target of $2.1 billion in materials. Funding was increased to $4 billion over four years, and the Defense Production Act of 1950 added $8.4 billion. The Defense Production Act of 1950 added $8.4 billion to expand supplies of strategic materials. President Truman formed the Materials Policy Commission in 1951, recommending a stockpile for strategic materials. President Eisenhower established long term stockpile goals during national emergencies to prevent shortages. The 1979 Strategic and Critical Minerals Stockpiling Revision Act reestablished a three-year military contingency criterion for stockpile goals with increased funding to $20 billion. The National Defense Stockpile was crucial during the Cold-War era. In the early 1990s, after the Cold War, the U.S. Congress authorized a sell-off of 44 obsolete materials from the National Defense Stockpile, including aluminum, ferrochromium, and nickel. The majority of these materials were sold to the private sector, with proceeds transferred to other federal programs. Management of the stockpile was delegated to the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics in 1988. The Defense Logistics Agency manages the day-to-day operations of the National Defense Stockpile, which contains 37 materials valued at $1.152 billion, including processed metals like columbium, germanium, tantalum, and titanium. Congressional action in 2014 led to the acquisition of rare earth elements (REEs) and other materials. The DLA is acquiring six materials based on the NDAA for FY2014. In FY2016, progress was made on goals for high-purity yttrium and dysprosium metal. The NDS initiated a program to develop economical methods to recycle REEs from scrap and waste. The Defense Logistics Agency manages the National Defense Stockpile containing various materials. Congress approved a DOD proposal to sell excess materials. E.O. 13817 tasked the Department of the Interior to coordinate on critical minerals. Secretarial Order No. 3359 directed USGS and BLM to develop a list of critical minerals. The Department of the Interior, in coordination with other agencies, developed an unranked list of 35 critical minerals in May 2018. The list was created using specific criteria, including metrics like the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index and the Worldwide Governance Index to assess supply risk and political volatility. The early warning methodology used a two-stage process to determine the potential criticality of minerals. The USGS developed a list of potentially critical minerals based on a geometric mean of three indicators: supply risk, production growth, and market dynamics. They used various data sources and expert input to establish a threshold for critical minerals, including some below the threshold with critical applications. Supply chain analysis was used to include metals like aluminum due to import reliance on bauxite. The USGS developed a list of 35 potentially critical minerals, including aluminum due to import reliance on bauxite. Some minerals like platinum group metals, REEs, niobium, and manganese are more vulnerable than others. Research and development are crucial for supporting new technologies related to critical minerals. The USGS identified 35 potentially critical minerals, including aluminum, due to import reliance on bauxite. Research and development are essential for new technologies related to critical minerals. The DOE's \"Critical Materials Hub\" conducts R&D on challenges like recycling to address supply chain disruptions of rare earth elements. Funding for the program was approved by Congress despite the Trump Administration's proposal to eliminate it. The Critical Materials Hub, funded by the DOE's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Program, was proposed to be eliminated by the Trump Administration in FY2019 and FY2020. Despite this, Congress supported the initiative with $18 million in funding for FY2019, lower than the $30 million requested. The program aims to examine new technologies for recovering rare earth elements from coal and coal byproducts. DOE issued Critical Materials Strategy reports in December 2010 and December 2011, providing demand forecasts for rare earths and other critical elements. The USGS provides annual reports on critical mineral activity and mineral resource assessments. A 2017 collaboration with the State of Alaska identified critical mineral potential in Alaska through geospatial analysis. The DOD has been assessing critical minerals for national security, fulfilling stockpile goals, and funding R&D projects related to rare earths. Reports have been issued on the National Defense Stockpile and a plan for critical rare earth materials in defense applications. The DOD closely monitors rare earth materials market for any projected shortfalls or failures to meet mission requirements. The White House formed an Interagency Working Group on Critical and Strategic Minerals Supply Chains in 2010 to establish federal R&D priorities and review policies related to critical minerals. The White House National Science and Technology Council Subcommittee on Critical and Strategic Mineral Supply Chains developed a screening methodology for assessing critical minerals. China is the top producer of several critical minerals, including yttrium, gallium, and rare earth elements. In 2017, the United States had no primary production of 22 minerals and byproduct production of five minerals on the critical minerals list. China dominates the production of various minerals and is expanding its production capacity globally. Australia and South America are key regions for lithium production. Southern Africa dominates the production of chromium, manganese, platinum group metals, tantalum, and cobalt. Brazil is the top producer of niobium, while Australia leads in lithium production. Critical minerals like niobium, cobalt, platinum group metals, REEs, and tungsten are mainly produced by Brazil, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Africa, China, and other countries. The DOI lacks information on mineral production on federal lands, as mine operators are not required to report production data to the government. The General Mining Law of 1872 does not require operators to report production information to the federal government. Gold is the dominant mineral produced on federal lands, particularly in Nevada. Federal lands mineral production accounts for about 6% of all minerals produced in the United States. There is uncertainty about the extent of mineral production on federal lands, and comprehensive information on which minerals are located and produced remains incomplete. The DOI lacks information on mineral production on federal lands. The question revolves around the potential for critical mineral resources on federal land and the impact of opening it up for development. Some advocate for developing domestic supply chains for critical minerals, while others prefer a diversified portfolio of suppliers. Byproducts like indium, tellurium, gallium, germanium, cobalt, and rhenium have limitations based on the main product's output. The amount of indium recoverable in zinc ore is limited by the quantity present. Byproduct supply is relatively inelastic, not greatly influenced by price increases. The price of the main product drives efforts to increase byproduct supply. High byproduct prices may spur new technologies for greater recovery. Expansion of processing facilities may be needed if main product supply contains excess byproduct. Byproduct supply is not greatly influenced by price increases and may require expanded processing facilities. Byproducts are available at lower costs and are not free goods unless certain conditions are met. Joint costs do not affect byproduct supply. Table 2 shows global production data for critical minerals, with production increasing for most minerals since 2000. Secondary recovery can occur from waste products or discarded end-use products. In the United States, there is little to no production or reserves for many critical minerals, but there is significant secondary recovery for nine minerals according to USGS Mineral Commodity Summaries. The USGS Mineral Commodity Summaries list critical minerals for secondary recovery, including aluminum, chromium, cobalt, gallium, indium, magnesium metal, platinum group metals, tin, and titanium. While the US has established infrastructures for recycling selected metals like steel, copper, and aluminum, little recycling occurs for metals such as manganese, REEs, and niobium due to economic or technical constraints. Other countries like the EU, Japan, and South Korea are increasing efforts in secondary recovery as emerging markets like China and India seek primary materials. The lack of clear policies and programs at all levels of government in the United States hinders secondary recovery of critical minerals and metals. Without a national mandate, state and local governments continue to have a patchwork of programs. Data shows limited secondary recovery infrastructure for critical minerals and metals, with economic and technological factors needing evaluation. In 2018, the USGS reports varying recycling rates for base and precious metals, with rates ranging from 18% to 52%. Steel in the auto industry was recycled at 106% in 2014, and the recycling rates for steel in appliances and cans are 90% and 67% respectively. Additional research and development may be necessary to increase secondary recovery of critical minerals and reduce U.S. import reliance. Reserves and resources in the context of minerals refer to quantities of mineral resources anticipated to be recovered from known deposits. Proved reserves are estimated quantities of minerals commercially recoverable under current economic conditions. Resources are concentrations of naturally occurring minerals that can be discovered and recovered. Undiscovered technically recoverable resources are minerals that may be produced through natural means or secondary recovery methods. The USGS lists little to no reserves in most critical minerals except for helium and beryllium, with significant resource potential in tungsten, lithium, vanadium, uranium, and REEs. Some reserves are identified for REEs and vanadium, while resource potential is noted for cesium, manganese, and niobium. Byproduct resources of cobalt, germanium, tellurium, and rhenium are associated with main products like copper, zinc, and bauxite. Uncertainty exists about U.S. and global reserves of certain critical minerals due to insufficient data availability. According to the USGS, there is significant global resource potential for critical minerals, with China leading in reserves for several minerals. Global resource potential is uncertain for certain minerals like bismuth, cesium, germanium, indium, and tellurium. Exploration expenditures for minerals in the United States are also mentioned. Exploration expenditures for minerals in the United States have been increasing since 2001, with the country maintaining 8% of the global exploration budget from 1997 to 2017. In 2017, there were 225 exploration sites in the US, with 41% in Nevada, 14% in Alaska, and 11% in Arizona. The focus remains on minerals like gold, copper, molybdenum, silver, tungsten, and uranium, with some interest in expanding silica sand operations in Nevada and developing a copper-cobalt-gold project. Interest in expanding silica sand operations in Nevada, developing a copper-cobalt-gold project in Idaho on Forest Service land, and thorium production on federal lands along the Idaho/Montana border. Canada and Australia lead in active exploration sites for gold, base metals, and uranium. The locations and minerals being explored can shape critical mineral supply chains and have policy implications for the United States' long-term investment strategy in mineral extraction and downstream metal manufacturing capacity. Recent additions to the USGS mineral exploration review include data on lithium, niobium, and rare earth minerals. The annual USGS mineral exploration review now includes data on lithium, niobium, rare earth elements, and tungsten. Global exploration dollars for lithium, cobalt, and gold rose significantly in 2016. Lithium exploration expenditures increased four-fold since 2015, with the number of active exploration sites rising from 56 in 2012 to 167 in 2017. The price of lithium rose by more than 150% from 2007 to 2016. In the United States in 2017, gold remains the top spot for the number of exploration sites, followed by copper and then lithium. The USGS reported that in the United States, gold exploration sites account for 47%, followed by copper at 12% and lithium at 7%. Overall, 54% of the sites are for gold and silver, and 22% for base metals. The United States has accounted for 7-8% of the global exploration budget over the past 10 years, with a budget of about $611 million in 2017. Latin America attracts the most exploration dollars with $2.4 billion, mainly for gold, silver, and base metals. Chile and Peru receive the most investment in the region. Latin America is home to 70% of the world's lithium deposits, with the \"lithium triangle\" of Chile, Argentina, and Bolivia. In Argentina, lithium exploration sites lead in expenditures, followed by gold/silver and copper. Chile is the most developed in lithium mining. China invested $650 million in Australia in 2016 for lithium and gold exploration. The demand for mineral commodities, such as lithium and gold, is driven by the production of goods and services. As ore grades decline, exploration companies are seeking high-grade deposits in remote locations, including the ocean floor. The demand for critical minerals is derived from the demand for the final products they are used in, like flat panel displays and automobiles. When mineral prices rise, the quantity demanded depends on the extent of the price increase. The demand for critical minerals is influenced by the ability to pass on price increases to consumers and the proportion of the final product's price that is attributed to the mineral. Demand growth is driven by price and income growth, with varying trends for different minerals in the US market. Consumption has declined for some minerals like aluminum and chromium, while demand has grown slowly for others like lithium and graphite. Rapid demand growth relative to supply has been seen for tellurium, niobium, and indium. Global demand for critical minerals is driven by various industries such as electronics, automobiles, and steel production. Demand data for these minerals is crucial to understand their usage in metal alloying, manufacturing, and final products. Some minerals like manganese and tungsten are used in steelmaking and infrastructure projects, while others like REEs and lithium are essential for electronic products and renewable energy systems. China's demand for critical minerals, including niobium, manganese, and vanadium, has surged in recent years. The country accounted for a significant portion of global consumption for these minerals, driven by the growth in industries such as steelmaking and renewable energy storage. Vanadium demand in China is projected to double from 2010 to 2025 due to its use in steelmaking and potential applications in new battery technology. China's demand for critical minerals, such as chrome, cobalt, platinum, and palladium, has been on the rise. In 2017, China accounted for a significant portion of global supply and demand for these minerals, with a focus on stainless steel production, battery manufacturing, and jewelry making. The country's increasing demand for these minerals is driven by factors such as high-valued exports, urbanization, and future industrial practices. China's economic growth has slowed, but its demand for minerals continues to pressure U.S. access to reliable supplies. The United States heavily relies on imports for critical minerals like graphite, rare earths, and tantalum, crucial for the economy and national security. The United States heavily relies on imports for critical minerals like antimony, barite, bauxite, and uranium, with China being a primary provider. Import reliance may pose a security risk, but the reliability of suppliers is a more relevant measure of supply risk. The United States heavily relies on imports for critical minerals like antimony, barite, bauxite, and uranium, with China being a primary provider. Factors affecting mineral supplies include sole suppliers, export restrictions, bottlenecks, and potential disruptions. The U.S. is self-sufficient in minerals like iron ore and molybdenum, while Canada is a chief trading partner for aluminum, uranium, potash, cesium, and rubidium. Supply risks can arise from various factors such as limited power, labor shortages, and environmental opposition. Materials analysis is a useful tool to understand mineral demand and supply sources for the United States, which heavily relies on imports for critical minerals. The U.S. has diversified supply sources for some materials through overseas investments in mines, leading to higher quality and lower cost materials. This analysis can also help improve manufacturing efficiencies by using fewer materials for the same or better performance in various systems like solar arrays, wind turbines, and automobiles. Manufacturing firms can benefit from materials analysis to improve production processes by using fewer materials for the same or better performance. Despite materials efficiencies, overall demand growth often drives up mineral prices. For example, low-cost manufactured goods may contain high-cost materials due to the materials intensity of critical minerals being relatively low. The report provides detailed information on the materials content of lithium-ion batteries, solar energy arrays, wind technologies, and permanent magnets. The curr_chunk discusses the material requirements for solar energy arrays, wind technologies, and lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles. It focuses on the composition, cost, and supply chains of lithium-ion batteries, particularly the amount of cobalt, lithium, nickel, and other materials needed per battery. Analysts are interested in understanding the battery cost per electric vehicle and when material price increases would prompt a shift in material usage. The curr_chunk discusses the material requirements for lithium-ion batteries, including raw material needs, supply risks, and industry structure. Researchers examined the implications for a carbon-reduced environment and identified key features of li-ion batteries. The researchers analyzed supply risk indicators for different battery types, such as lithium-cobalt oxide batteries with high cobalt content. Due to the high country risk associated with cobalt production in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, they explored alternatives like manganese-oxide batteries with nickel and manganese replacing cobalt. The researchers identified the need for lithium in all battery types and noted that graphite is used in all battery types except for lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP-LTO), which uses titanium instead. They highlighted the importance of a market breakthrough by 2035 for electric vehicles with lithium battery technology, requiring a 7.5% annual growth rate for lithium supply and a 3% growth rate for cobalt supply to meet demand. Additionally, the USGS Minerals Information Center conducted a technical analysis of byproduct minerals in solar energy systems and wind turbine technologies, including silver, cadmium, tellurium, indium, gallium, selenium, germanium, dysprosium (Dy), neodymium (Nd), and terbium. The USGS analyzed the supply of rare earth elements (REEs) and germanium in wind technologies under Clean Power Plan (CPP) and no-CPP scenarios. They found that the transition to renewables will likely accelerate, but production of certain metals may need to increase to meet demand. Heavy REEs used in permanent magnets for wind turbines may not keep up with demand due to increased use in electric vehicles. There is uncertainty about whether there will be significant increases in REEs for magnets used in wind energy systems. The USGS analyzed the supply of rare earth elements (REEs) and germanium in wind technologies under Clean Power Plan (CPP) and no-CPP scenarios. They found that the transition to renewables will likely accelerate, but production of certain metals may need to increase to meet demand. There is uncertainty about significant increases in REEs for magnets used in wind energy systems, which may compete with usage in electric vehicles and consumer electronics. Key questions include the net material intensity and the impact of disruptions in critical mineral supply on manufacturing countries and firms. Materials analysis for end uses can inform understanding of critical minerals vulnerability. The Department of Energy Report, 20% Wind Energy by 2030, provides insights into the material requirements for wind power installations, including wind towers, rotors, electrical systems, and drivetrains. Large wind turbines have tower heights over 200 feet and rotor blades up to 150 feet long. The report also raises questions about the composition and costs of permanent magnets used in wind turbines and the potential for substitution. The Department of Energy Report, 20% Wind Energy by 2030, highlights the key materials needed for large-scale wind turbine manufacturing, including steel, fiberglass, resins, core materials, permanent magnets, and copper. While raw materials are generally in ample supply, there is a 100% dependency on permanent magnet imports, mainly from China. Concerns also exist regarding the need for increased manufacturing capacity for components like fiberglass, generators, and gearboxes in wind power development. The 20% Wind Energy by 2030 study emphasized the use of lighter-weight materials like glass fiber-reinforced plastic and carbon fiber-reinforced plastic for wind power development. Increased production of fiberglass, commercial-grade carbon fiber, and permanent magnets containing rare earth elements (REEs) would be necessary to achieve the 20% wind energy goal. Offshore wind turbines, which contain REEs, could drive demand for these materials. Silicon-based photovoltaic cells and thin film solar cells are the two main types used in solar panels. PV cells are combined into modules and mounted in an array. Thin-film solar cells use ultra-thin semiconductor materials for various applications. Concentrating solar power systems utilize mirrors to convert sunlight into electricity. Understanding the supply chain is crucial for both downstream and upstream capacities in solar technology. Production capacity for critical minerals is important for determining potential risks and mitigation efforts. Rare earth elements, often found with other elements like copper, gold, and uranium, are typically produced as byproducts. Lighter elements like lanthanum and neodymium are more abundant, while heavier elements like gadolinium and lutetium are scarcer but highly desirable. Most rare earth elements are found in bastnaesite and monazite deposits, with the largest concentrations in the United States, China, Australia, and South Africa. The supply chain for rare earth elements involves mining, separation, refining, alloying, and manufacturing. The lack of refining, alloying, and fabricating capacity in the United States hinders REE development. A GAO report from April 2010 highlights the absence of U.S. presence in the global REE supply chain. China dominates the production of rare earth elements, including refining oxides into metal, manufacturing alloys, and magnets. Despite efforts to increase rare earth production in the U.S., significant supply chain investments are needed to compete with China's processing and fabrication capabilities. According to rare earth analysts, vertically integrated companies may be more desirable for securing investor financing for REE production projects. Joint ventures, consortiums, and cooperatives could support production at various stages of the supply chain globally. U.S. firms and allies investing strategically could help ensure a stable supply of REEs and component parts. China's dominance in rare earths is attributed to its R&D efforts in basic and materials science. China's dominance in rare earths is supported by its R&D efforts in basic and materials science. Tantalum, a metallic element found in tantalite, is extracted from mineral deposits and has high melting point and corrosion resistance, making it super-capacitive. Tantalum, with a melting point of 3,000 degrees Centigrade and high corrosion resistance, is a conflict mineral sourced from Central Africa. It is used in high-tech electronic devices and subject to disclosure rules under the Dodd-Frank Act. Primary production accounts for 70% of tantalum market supplies. Tantalum, historically sourced from Malaysia, Thailand, and Brazil, is also a byproduct of niobium, titanium, tin, and uranium production in various countries. Recycled tantalum makes up 30% of global supply, with the US and Mexico leading in scrap recovery. Brazil, Canada, Mozambique, and Nigeria were primary producers in the 1970s and 1980s, with Australia taking the lead in the late 1980s. Since 2009, Australia's primary tantalum production has declined, with mines closing due to the 2008 recession and reopening briefly in 2012. The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has emerged as a leading producer, along with Rwanda, replacing Australia and Brazil. Data gaps have been noted in tantalum production reporting, with significant discrepancies between reported production and processor receipts. On average, reported production only represents about 27% of total processor receipts. The highly unregulated nature of tantalum ore production in Central Africa led to discrepancies in reported production and processor receipts, with an average material difference of 381 metric tons. The informal sector drove prices down, causing major production regions to close. Investor interest is limited due to low prices and high risks in greenfield projects. The USGS data lacks information on unauthorized mining operations, and the tantalum industry is considered opaque and lacking transparency. Insufficient data hinders definitive conclusions. Insufficient data and lack of transparency hinder definitive determinations on global tantalum production, capacity, and reserves. Reasons for supply/demand differences include nonreporting, high inventories, illicit mining, and dependence on Africa's supply. Africa provides 80% of primary tantalum production, with China dominating downstream processing. Disruption in Africa's supply could lead to price rises. The illicit mining component in the tantalum market makes it vulnerable and possibly unsustainable, hindering large-scale producers from entering the market. Illegal trade has long-term implications for the entire supply chain, leading to lower investment in all phases. Australia, Brazil, and Canada are listed as having the majority of the world's identified tantalum resources. Mancheri, et al., published a study in 2017 assessing the tantalum supply chain for regional production dependence and mechanisms to prevent disruptions. The study by Mancheri assesses the resiliency of the tantalum market, focusing on supply indicators like diversity, substitution, recycling, and stockpiling. It concludes that stockpiling and substitution can help mitigate disruptions. The tantalum supply chain involves crushing ore, refining it into oxides or K-Salt, and using it for various applications like capacitors and super alloys. China dominates the production of capacitors used by consumer product manufacturers like Motorola, Sony, Apple, and Dell. The U.S. mineral policy aims to ensure a stable supply of materials for national security and economic well-being, emphasizing the development of domestic supplies. The U.S. mineral policy aims to offset the disadvantage of potentially higher-cost operations by enacting public policies and executive branch measures. Congress has held legislative hearings on the impact of high import reliance on critical materials and potential federal investments to support increased domestic production. The General Mining Law of 1872 governs mining of locatable minerals on federal lands, granting free access to prospect for minerals and stake a claim upon discovery. Originally aimed at promoting mineral exploration and settlement in the West, the law excludes coal deposits. The General Mining Law of 1872 governs mining of locatable minerals on federal lands, excluding coal deposits. Public domain lands are retained under federal ownership, while acquired lands are obtained for specific federal purposes and subject to leasing. Mineral claims under the law can be held indefinitely without production, and once patented, the owner can use the land for various purposes. Critics argue that many mining claims are held for speculative purposes, while industry officials defend that claims may remain idle until market conditions are favorable for development. Congress has prohibited patenting lands since 1994, with mineral production primarily occurring on private land regulated by states. The debate over streamlining the permitting process on federal lands continues, with implications for the entire U.S. mining industry. The debate over streamlining the mine permitting process in the United States continues, with proponents arguing it would attract more investment. There is also a discussion on whether the federal government should impose royalties on minerals produced on public lands. Mineral development in the United States is subject to federal regulatory requirements, including environmental reviews, financing proof, permits, bonding, and public participation. Various federal regulations apply to mining on federal lands, in addition to the Federal Mining Law of 1872. Compliance with specific statutes and regulations will vary depending on the project, such as actions required for federally protected species. The Appendix lists selected statutes and regulations related to mineral development on federal land. Regulatory compliance involves federal, state, and other entities. The regulatory framework for mineral development on federal land includes acts such as the Multiple Use Sustained Yield Act, Wilderness Act of 1964, National Forest Management Act of 1976, NEPA, and FLPMA. These acts impose requirements on agency actions and impact mineral development under both leasing and the General Mining Law of 1872 claim-patent system. The General Mining Law lacks direct environmental controls, but mining claims are still subject to regulations. The General Mining Law does not have direct environmental controls, but mining claims on federal land are subject to general environmental laws. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) administers the mineral program on federal land, while other agencies like the Forest Service (FS) must approve surface disturbing activities on their land. The mine plan review process is used by BLM and FS to assess the validity of mine proposals and determine the extent of environmental review required under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. Resource Management Plans (RMPs) are mandatory for public lands before development, with environmental impacts considered during land-use planning. RMPs can cover large areas across multiple acres. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) administers the mineral program on federal land, with Resource Management Plans (RMPs) required for public lands before development. RMPs cover large areas and consider diverse uses such as timber, grazing, wildlife conservation, recreation, and energy. The plans reflect the needs of present and future generations and involve early identification of impacts for equitable consideration. The President and executive branch agencies historically issued orders to withdraw federal lands from mineral entry and other uses. Since 1976, withdrawals are governed by FLPMA, requiring congressional approval for parcels exceeding 5,000 acres. Withdrawals restrict land use under a multiple-use management framework for 20 years. The leasing laws allow for a 20-year withdrawal of federal lands for environmental review, subject to renewal by the Department of the Interior. The Secretary of the Interior has the authority to make, modify, extend, or revoke withdrawals, which may be temporary or permanent. Mineral industry representatives argue that federal withdrawals hinder mineral exploration and could lead to increased production costs without new reserves or technological advancements. Critics of U.S. mineral development argue that mining can limit land use options and lead to environmental damage. They highlight issues such as unreclaimed areas, Superfund sites, and potential harm to scenic and cultural resources on public lands. Congressional debate continues over the balance between extractive industries and other land uses. H.R. 2531, National Strategic and Critical Minerals Production Act, aims to streamline federal permitting for domestic mineral exploration. It defines critical minerals and sets responsibilities for the lead federal agency to minimize delays. The review process is limited to 30 months to prioritize mineral development while mitigating environmental impacts. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 in the House requires guidance on acquiring rare earth elements and establishing a secure supply chain in the US. It allows the acquisition of rare earth cerium and lanthanum compounds and electrolytic manganese metal, while prohibiting the acquisition of tantalum from nonallied foreign nations for DOD purposes. The Senate version of the NDAA does not have similar language. The American Mineral Security Act aims to define critical minerals and establish a methodology to identify qualifying minerals. The bill aims to establish a methodology to identify critical minerals, maintain a list of these minerals, conduct resource assessments, and improve the process for mineral exploration on federal lands. It also requires the Department of Energy to research alternatives to critical minerals and promote recycling. The bill proposes an R&D program to explore alternatives to critical minerals, establish an Annual Critical Minerals Outlook report, assess availability of trained personnel, design an interdisciplinary curriculum study, and create a competitive grants program for research and related activities. The bill proposes a grants program for new faculty positions, internships, equipment needs, and research related to critical minerals, with $50 million authorized annually for fiscal years 2020-2029. H.R. 520, National Strategic and Critical Minerals Production Act, introduced by Representative Mark E. Amodei on January 13, 2017, is similar to H.R. 2531 in the 116th Congress. H.R. 1407, METALS Act, introduced by Representative Duncan Hunter on March 7, 2017, would establish a strategic materials investment fund and support the development of new technologies for processing strategic and critical materials. The bill aims to establish a fund for processing strategic materials, with a portion of funds from covered programs allocated for this purpose. It also includes provisions to prohibit the sale of domestic rare earth mines to foreign firms and directs the Secretary of Defense to purchase certain minerals from non-China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran sources. Additionally, a related bill, S. 1460, focuses on critical minerals and was introduced by Senator Murkowski. The bill introduced to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources is similar to previous bills regarding critical minerals production. In earlier Congresses, bills such as the Critical Minerals Policy Act of 2013 and the National Rare Earth Cooperative Act of 2014 aimed to advance domestic refining of rare earth oxides and thorium storage. Thorium is linked to rare earth deposits and waste materials. A federal charter would have suppliers and consumers as owners. Policy options for critical minerals in legislation from the 115th and 116th Congresses are discussed. Policymakers can maintain current policies or consider new options. The USGS could create a Minerals Information Administration for global supply and demand analysis. Companies on public lands may need to report production data. Exploration for critical minerals in the US, Australia, Africa, and Canada could be part of an international strategy. Australia, Africa, and Canada, along with a few companies in China and other regions, may collaborate for critical mineral development worldwide. Congressional deliberations may consider restrictions on these cooperative efforts, as well as oversight of free trade issues. The World Trade Organization has addressed raw material issues related to China's export restrictions. The World Trade Organization ruled against China in two cases related to export restrictions on various minerals. China failed to demonstrate a link between conservation efforts and the need for export restrictions. The United States could support more trade missions and assist smaller countries in improving governance capacity. Trade tariffs with China may impact prices and availability of critical minerals and downstream metals. In China and other emerging economies, economic development will impact the world supply of raw materials and downstream products. Countries may need to secure raw materials for national security and economic development. China, Japan, and others are securing reliable mineral supplies. Many firms have moved to China for market access and lower-cost minerals production. China seeks technology transfer to expand its manufacturing capacity. Despite overcapacity, China may benefit from using its resources efficiently. In the long run, China may prioritize domestic manufacturing of higher-valued products using its minerals, leading to closures of inefficient facilities and increased imports. To maintain dominance in global raw materials supply, China must develop alternate sources, use alternative materials, improve efficiency, invest in R&D for new technologies, and enhance minerals information. This shift towards fewer raw material exports may prompt long-term planning by private and government sectors to address national security, economic, and energy challenges. Some stakeholders seek to address concerns through the WTO regarding U.S. national security, economic, and energy policy interests. Congress may deliberate on developing skills for downstream manufacturing, considering international educational exchange programs, and analyzing U.S. firms' capacity to adjust to supply bottlenecks. This analysis could inform public policy decisions as policymakers evaluate available options. Selected statutes that may impact mining activities on federal lands include the American Indian Religious Freedom Act, Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act, Federal Land Policy and Management Act, Federal Mine Safety and Health Act, General Mining Law of 1872, Historic Preservation Act, Mineral Leasing For Acquired Lands Act, Mining and Minerals Policy Act, National Environmental Policy Act, National Forest Management Act, and National Materials and Minerals Policy. These statutes are crucial for policymakers evaluating policy options to minimize the risk of potential supply interruptions of critical minerals and metals. The Forest Management Act, National Materials and Minerals Policy Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Toxic Substance Control Act, and Mining-Specific Regulations impact mining activities on federal lands. Bureau of Land Management and U.S. Forest Service have specific regulations on surface management and minerals."
