    "content": "American Indian women are victims of domestic and dating violence at more than twice the rate of non-Indian women, often involving offenders of a different race. This creates jurisdictional issues as tribal courts lack jurisdiction over crimes committed by non-Indians on tribal land. Federal prosecutors are often unable to prosecute these crimes, leaving American Indian women at a higher risk of domestic violence with less protection than non-Indian women. The Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act aims to address jurisdictional issues in cases of domestic and dating violence involving American Indian women. Proposed amendments would expand tribal courts' jurisdiction to include non-Indian-on-Indian crimes, but opponents are concerned about the constitutional protections for defendants. The Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act aims to expand tribal courts' jurisdiction over domestic and dating violence cases involving American Indian women. Jurisdiction in Indian country is complex, with different levels of jurisdiction depending on the crime and parties involved. The Act seeks to address issues of jurisdiction and constitutional protections for defendants. The Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act aims to address the jurisdictional void for domestic and dating violence cases between non-Indian perpetrators and Indian victims. Federal jurisdiction is exclusive unless a state has criminal jurisdiction under P.L. 280, leading to unprosecuted and unpunished crimes due to workload demands and investigative challenges. The Act proposes giving tribal courts jurisdiction to address this issue. The VAWA Reauthorization would grant tribal courts jurisdiction over domestic and dating violence cases involving non-Indians and Indians within tribal jurisdiction, with a focus on specific acts of violence and protection order violations. This does not transfer federal authority to tribes but recognizes their inherent power for self-government in handling such cases. The VAWA Reauthorization grants tribal courts jurisdiction over domestic and dating violence cases involving non-Indians with significant ties to the tribe. Special domestic violence jurisdiction is limited to cases where the defendant lives or works in the tribe's Indian country or is married to a tribe member. The VAWA Reauthorization grants tribal courts jurisdiction over domestic violence cases involving non-Indians with ties to the tribe. It aims to give tribes criminal jurisdiction over such cases if certain rights are guaranteed to the defendant. The interpretation of this provision is unclear, with two possible explanations suggested. The federal Bill of Rights did not initially apply against the states until the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court determines which rights should be \"incorporated\" by assessing if they are essential for justice. Under incorporation, all criminal procedure safeguards in the Bill of Rights apply to states except for the grand jury clause. The VAWA Reauthorization may require Indian tribes to guarantee these rights, except for a grand jury. The VAWA Reauthorization may require Indian tribes to guarantee all rights in the Bill of Rights except for a grand jury, potentially adding protections not currently provided in tribal court prosecutions. This provision could align tribal court protections with those in the Indian Civil Rights Act and the Tribal Law and Order Act, which are seen as similar to how the Constitution limits federal and state governments' powers. This recognition of tribal power could impact protections under the U.S. Constitution when applied against states. The VAWA Reauthorization would extend tribes' sovereignty to include criminal jurisdiction over non-Indians committing domestic or dating violence against Indians, recognizing tribes' inherent powers of limited sovereignty. The Supreme Court has acknowledged tribes' authority to enforce laws within their territory, although aspects of their full sovereignty have been restricted since their incorporation into the United States. Congress has the authority to relax restrictions on tribes' inherent sovereignty. In Duro v. Reina, the Supreme Court ruled that Indian tribes lost the authority to try nonmember Indians, leading Congress to amend the Indian Civil Rights Act to grant tribes jurisdiction over nonmember Indians. In United States v. Lara, the Court examined whether a nonmember Indian tried in tribal court could also be tried in federal court. Congress affirmed tribes' inherent power to prosecute nonmember Indians, not delegated federal power. The Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Lara that a defendant tried in tribal court could also be tried in federal court without violating double jeopardy. The Court determined that tribal courts exercise their own non-federal authority, allowing for separate prosecutions by the tribe and federal government. The VAWA Reauthorization aimed to expand tribal authority to include trying non-Indians involved in domestic and dating violence cases. The VAWA Reauthorization aimed to expand tribal authority to include trying non-Indians involved in domestic and dating violence cases, potentially challenging the Supreme Court's recognition of tribes' inherent sovereignty to try non-Indians. In Lara, Congress was found to have the authority to relax restrictions on tribes' inherent authority to try nonmember Indians, raising questions about the distinction between nonmember Indians and non-Indians in tribal court jurisdiction. The Supreme Court's recognition of tribes' inherent sovereignty to try non-Indians was challenged by the VAWA Reauthorization, which aimed to expand tribal authority. Justice Kennedy questioned whether Congress has the authority to subject citizens to a sovereign outside the Constitution's structure. Justice Kennedy raised concerns about Congress extending tribal criminal jurisdiction over nonmember Indians, stating that it may be unconstitutional to subject citizens to the criminal jurisdiction of tribes without their consent. The Supreme Court also considered tribal court civil jurisdiction over nonmembers in a separate case. In Plains Commerce Bank v. Long Family Land and Cattle Co., the Supreme Court ruled that tribal courts do not have civil jurisdiction over non-Indian entities without their consent. This decision emphasized the importance of nonmember consent in tribal court jurisdiction. The Bill of Rights does not apply to Indian tribes, and nonmembers have no part in tribal government. Laws and regulations may only be imposed on nonmembers with their consent, stemming from the tribe's sovereign authority. Congress may relax restrictions on tribes' authority to try nonmember Indians, but it is uncertain if the current Court would agree. The current Court's stance on Indian law is uncertain, with Justices expressing doubts and conflicting views on tribes' inherent sovereignty and Congress's authority to change it. Justice Thomas described federal Indian policy as \"schizophrenic,\" adding to the confusion in Indian law. The current Court's stance on Indian law is uncertain, with Justices expressing doubts and conflicting views on tribes' inherent sovereignty and Congress's authority to change it. It is unclear if the Court would uphold tribal authority to try non-Indian defendants under the VAWA Reauthorization. Justice Souter and Justice Scalia dissented in Lara, believing that tribes cannot exercise inherent authority to try nonmembers without Congress delegating such authority. The dichotomy between delegated and inherent power of tribes has constitutional implications. If Congress delegates power to tribes to prosecute crimes, defendants have rights under the Bill of Rights. If tribes exercise inherent sovereignty, defendants rely on statutory protections or tribal law. Federal statutory and constitutional protections are similar but have important distinctions. The distinction between federal statutory and constitutional sources is important in tribal prosecutions. While both offer similar protections, there are key differences. In cases where inherent sovereignty is recognized, defendants may face double jeopardy, limited right to counsel, no grand jury indictment, limited jury representation, and restricted appellate review. The Indian Civil Rights Act (ICRA) mirrors many U.S. Constitution protections but interprets them based on tribal values, potentially leading to different outcomes. The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment protects individuals from being tried twice for the same offense, preventing the state from subjecting them to repeated trials and potential conviction. This clause aims to avoid embarrassment, expense, and anxiety for the individual. The Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment protects individuals from being tried twice for the same offense, preventing repeated trials and potential conviction. It applies to second prosecutions after acquittal or conviction, and multiple punishments for the same offense. The clause considers whether the elements of the crimes are the same to determine if two prosecutions are for the \"same offense.\" However, separate prosecutions are allowed when different sovereigns have jurisdiction, as ruled by the dual sovereignty doctrine. This allows for two prosecutions for the same offense by different sovereigns. In United States v. Wheeler, the Court had to decide if the Double Jeopardy Clause applied to a second prosecution of an Indian in federal court after being convicted in tribal court for a related offense. The key issue was whether the tribe's authority to prosecute its members was inherent or delegated. If inherent, the tribe would be considered a sovereign, allowing for a second prosecution under the dual sovereignty rule. If delegated, the tribe's power would not be sovereign, and a second prosecution would be barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause. The Court in United States v. Wheeler determined that Indian tribes retained certain aspects of sovereignty, including criminal jurisdiction over their members. The tribes' sovereignty exists at the sufferance of Congress, and because Congress had not expressly granted criminal jurisdiction to the tribes, they retained this power. The Court deemed this power inherent, allowing the tribe to prosecute the defendant without violating the Double Jeopardy Clause. The prosecution of the defendant did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause. Double jeopardy implications arise from extending tribal jurisdiction to non-Indians. Under the delegation theory, a tribal prosecution may prevent a federal prosecution for a more serious crime. This could result in a lesser punishment for the defendant. Tribes can only sentence a defendant to a maximum prison term of three years under the Indian Civil Rights Act. The Indian Civil Rights Act limits tribal sentencing to a maximum of three years per offense or nine years total. The Sixth Amendment guarantees the right to counsel in criminal prosecutions to ensure a fair trial, but does not cover police interrogations. This fundamental right is protected by both federal and state governments. The Supreme Court mandates that counsel must be provided by federal and state governments for defendants who cannot afford one to ensure a fair trial. Counsel is required if the case may result in imprisonment, but not if imprisonment is unlikely. In tribal prosecutions, Indian tribes must allow individuals to have counsel at their own expense. The Constitution does not require Indian tribes to provide counsel to indigent defendants in all cases with potential imprisonment. The Tribal Law and Order Act of 2010 mandates free counsel for crimes with a sentence over one year, while the VAWA Reauthorization would require counsel if any imprisonment term is possible. Tribes may lack resources to provide counsel, leading to potential inadmissibility of evidence in federal prosecutions. For example, in United States v. Ant, a defendant faced both tribal and federal prosecution for the same crime. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that a guilty plea obtained in a tribal prosecution was inadmissible in a federal indictment against the defendant due to a violation of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. The court emphasized the importance of upholding constitutional rights and preventing evidence obtained unlawfully from being used in prosecutions. The Indian Civil Rights Act prohibits tribes from compelling self-incrimination. The Supreme Court's Miranda v. Arizona decision requires police to inform suspects of their right to counsel, regardless of financial ability. The privilege against self-incrimination applies to all individuals. Miranda rights require police to stop interrogation when suspect invokes right to counsel. If tribe cannot provide counsel, police cannot question suspect unless right is waived. Uncounseled statements would be inadmissible in tribal or federal prosecution. Congress may need to increase resources for tribal courts if jurisdiction expands. The Fifth Amendment requires a grand jury indictment for infamous crimes. Grand juries act as a buffer against government power. Federal law mandates grand jury indictment for felonies punishable by death or imprisonment over one year. Tribal prosecutions do not have the same requirement. In tribal prosecutions, there is no constitutional or federal statutory right to a grand jury indictment. The Supreme Court ruled in Talton v. Hayes that the Fifth Amendment right to grand jury indictment does not apply to tribes. The Indian Civil Rights Act also does not require a grand jury indictment for felonies, leaving accused individuals in tribal court subject to tribal criminal practices. The right to a jury trial in tribal prosecutions has a historical basis in Anglo-American tradition, dating back to the Magna Carta. This right, like the grand jury requirement, aims to protect individuals against arbitrary government power by ensuring a trial by impartial peers. After the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment, challenges were made regarding the racial composition of juries as a violation of the Equal Protection Clause. In Virginia v. West Virginia, the Supreme Court ruled that a statute requiring juries to consist only of white men violated a black defendant's equal protection rights. Subsequent cases have addressed equal protection challenges regarding jury diversity, with the \"fair cross-section\" requirement established in 1942. Peremptory challenges based on race were prohibited in Batson v. Kentucky, ensuring juries are representative and free from discrimination. The Civil Rights Act ensures the right to a trial by jury of at least six persons for individuals accused of offenses punishable by imprisonment in Indian tribes. However, there may be equal protection issues as some tribal courts do not allow nonmembers on juries, leading to unequal constitutional protections based on race. The Supreme Court has shown hesitation in subjecting non-Indians to Indian juries, highlighting concerns about fairness and impartiality in the justice system. The bill requires tribes to provide non-Indian defendants the right to a trial by an impartial jury that reflects a fair cross-section of the community. Some tribes may need to reconstitute their jury systems to accommodate non-Indian defendants if tribal criminal jurisdiction is extended under the VAWA Reauthorization. Significant differences exist in appellate review of criminal prosecutions between tribal and federal courts. While federal courts offer various statutory avenues for appellate review, tribal court decisions are not subject to direct federal appellate review. The Supreme Court has addressed the issue of what forms of review may be granted from a tribal court ruling in Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez. Congress chose habeas review as the sole form of relief under the Indian Civil Rights Act (ICRA), requiring defendants to exhaust all tribal remedies before seeking federal habeas review. However, there are potential defects with applying the habeas approach to cases involving non-Indians, as it can only be invoked when the defendant is in custody, limiting appeals to federal court. The Indian Civil Rights Act (ICRA) mandates habeas review as the only form of relief, requiring exhaustion of tribal remedies before federal review. However, concerns arise when extending tribal jurisdiction to non-Indians, as habeas review is limited to cases where the defendant is in custody. This could restrict federal oversight for criminal defendants, prompting a need for Congress to consider alternative forms of review to address domestic and dating violence against American Indian women. The VAWA Reauthorization aims to grant tribal courts jurisdiction to prosecute non-Indians for domestic and dating violence against Indians within their jurisdictions. This raises questions about whether this is a recognition of tribal sovereignty or a delegation of federal prosecutorial power. Indian tribes exercise their inherent sovereignty over member Indians and nonmember Indians, but it is unclear if this extends to prosecutions of non-Indians. If tribes are exercising delegated federal authority, the full protections of the Bill of Rights would apply against them."
