The Act titled \"Securing Energy Critical Elements and American Jobs Act of 2015\" defines key terms such as \"appropriate Congressional committees,\" \"Center,\" \"Department,\" and \"energy critical element.\" The Act \"Securing Energy Critical Elements and American Jobs Act of 2015\" defines terms like \"Hub,\" \"Institution of higher education,\" \"Program,\" and \"Secretary\" in relation to energy innovation and critical materials. TITLE I--ENERGY CRITICAL ELEMENTS\n\nSEC. 101. ENERGY CRITICAL ELEMENTS PROGRAM. The Energy Critical Elements Program authorizes research, development, and commercial application to secure a sustainable supply of energy critical elements for national security and economic needs. This program focuses on activities to improve extraction, processing, and recycling of these elements. The Energy Critical Elements Program aims to enhance the use, recovery, and recycling of energy critical elements, improve engineering designs, identify alternative materials, and promote applications using recycled elements or alternative materials. The program also encourages multidisciplinary collaborations, including student participation. The Energy Critical Elements Program aims to enhance the use, recovery, and recycling of energy critical elements, improve engineering designs, and promote applications using recycled or alternative materials. The program also encourages multidisciplinary collaborations, including student participation, and international collaboration with relevant foreign agencies. The Secretary is required to prepare and submit a plan to carry out the program biennially. The plan for the Energy Critical Elements Program includes research and development activities for the next 2 years, expected contributions to innovative methods and technologies for energy provision, and promoting participation from academic, industrial, and other contributors. The Secretary consults with industry, higher education institutions, national laboratories, and professionals in preparing the plan. The Department of Energy will collaborate with various organizations to carry out activities under this title, ensuring coordination and avoiding duplication with other federal programs. The Secretary is authorized to appropriate $25,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2016 to 2020 to implement this Act. For fiscal year 2020, $25,000,000 will be available until expended. SEC. 102. CRITICAL MATERIALS ENERGY INNOVATION HUB. The Secretary is authorized to maintain a Critical Materials Energy Innovation Hub and establish a Critical Materials Information Center to collect, disseminate, and archive information on energy critical elements. The Center will serve as a repository for scientific and technical data generated by research and development activities funded under this section. The Critical Materials Information Center will assist scientists and engineers in utilizing data, seek additional information on energy critical elements, provide advice to the Secretary, and host annual meetings for program participants and interested parties. The funds available for hosting conferences under subparagraph (A)(v) can be used as per this section. Awards to operate the Hub are for a maximum of 5 years, with the possibility of renewal after a rigorous review process. No funds from this section can be used for new building construction. Construction of new buildings or facilities for the Hub is not part of the non-Federal share of a Hub cost-sharing agreement. SEC. 103. SUPPLY OF ENERGY CRITICAL ELEMENTS. The President will coordinate federal agencies to ensure a stable supply of energy critical elements for national security and economic well-being. This includes identifying these elements, establishing supply problem scenarios, and evaluating federal programs related to energy critical elements. The evaluation of Federal programs with energy critical element needs aims to complement private sector efforts. It also promotes private enterprise in developing a stable domestic supply chain and encourages recycling of energy critical elements. Additionally, it assesses the availability of trained personnel for these elements. The curr_chunk focuses on the need for trained personnel in energy critical elements research, development, extraction, and production. It highlights the challenge of attracting and retaining high-quality professionals in this field and calls for reporting to Congressional committees on related activities and findings. Title II of the National Materials and Minerals Policy, Research, and Development Act of 1980 is amended to address the need for trained personnel in energy critical elements research, development, extraction, and production. Reporting to Congressional committees on related activities and findings is also emphasized. Title II of the National Materials and Minerals Policy, Research, and Development Act of 1980 is amended to update program plans, including changes to coordinating councils and emergency response agencies. Title II of the National Materials and Minerals Policy, Research, and Development Act of 1980 is amended to update program plans, including changes to coordinating councils and emergency response agencies. The amendments involve redesignating paragraphs, assessing the supply of materials for national security, and adjusting subsections. The National Materials and Minerals Policy, Research, and Development Act of 1980 is amended to update program plans, including changes to coordinating councils and emergency response agencies. Implementation of the Act is modified by adjusting subsections and directing departments and agencies to implement policies set forth in section 3. SEC. 202. REPEAL. The National Critical Materials Act of 1984 is repealed."
