    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"North Atlantic Right Whale Recovery Act of 2001\". The Congress finds that North Atlantic Right Whales are critically endangered due to anthropogenic causes, with ship collisions and fishing gear entanglement being the leading sources of mortality. The National Marine Fisheries Service is responsible for protecting North Atlantic Right Whales from anthropogenic threats such as habitat degradation, pollution, ocean noise, and climate change. A recent study warns that without reducing human-related mortalities, the species is at risk of extinction. Recent research has shown some success in reducing collisions with ships and interactions with fishing gear for North Atlantic Right Whales. The Mandatory Ship Reporting System, implemented in 1999, provides mariners with necessary information to prevent ship collisions in critical habitat. Efforts are also being made to develop gear and methods to reduce whale interactions with fishing gear along the Atlantic Coast. However, there is a lack of a coordinated Federal plan for recovering North Atlantic Right Whales. Greater management and research attention is needed to reduce mortality from ship collisions, entanglement in fishing gear, and other causes to reverse the population decline of North Atlantic Right Whales. The North Atlantic Right Whale Recovery Program is outlined in Section 3. The Secretary of Commerce will establish a North Atlantic Right Whale Recovery Program in collaboration with other agencies and teams. The program will focus on reducing whale mortality and injury from vessel collisions and fishing gear. The Secretary, in consultation with teams, will identify agencies, areas, and activities for the North Atlantic Right Whale Recovery Program, including gear development, population monitoring, and support for recovery plan implementation. The Secretary of Commerce, through NOAA, will develop agreements to involve State agencies in North Atlantic Right Whale recovery programs and determine annual funding needs for Federal support. Additionally, there will be a North Atlantic Right Whale Priority Action Program. The Secretary of Commerce and Transportation, in consultation with recovery teams, will identify projects to reduce mortality from ship strikes and fishing gear entanglement for North Atlantic Right Whales. Within 9 months, demonstration projects will be implemented for whale detection, tracking, and satellite monitoring. Projects to reduce North Atlantic Right Whale mortality include satellite tracking, deploying whale-friendly gear, testing disentanglement methods, and other initiatives with potential to decrease whale deaths. SEC. 6. REDUCING SHIP STRIKES. The Secretaries of Commerce and Transportation must develop a program by January 1, 2003, to prevent ship strikes of Northern Atlantic Right Whales. This program includes an Atlantic Coast vessel early warning system involving various government agencies and a clearinghouse for whale sightings. The development of a real-time information system using existing surveillance systems and innovative techniques to locate and track right whales, along with a coordinated vessel management system providing updated information to mariners and regional risk assessments for vessel management during North Atlantic Right Whale migration periods. The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of Transportation and the Secretary of the Navy, will create a detection technology program to develop, test, and evaluate technologies for tracking North Atlantic Right Whales during migration. The program will assess technologies for long-term whale tracking and ship detection to prevent collisions. The Secretary of Commerce will incorporate data from various sources into a geographic information system for analysis of interactions between whales and ships. The Secretary of Transportation will identify gaps in legislative authority to promote the recovery of North Atlantic Right Whales. The Secretary of Transportation may propose regulations affecting vessels in waters under United States jurisdiction to the International Maritime Organization. Transportation, through the Secretary of State, may propose regulations at the International Maritime Organization to implement recommendations from the North Atlantic Right Whale Recovery Plan. SEC. 7. NORTH ATLANTIC RIGHT WHALE RESEARCH GRANT PROGRAM. The Secretary of Commerce will design a comprehensive right whale research grant program in consultation with various teams and organizations. The program will focus on research areas such as detection and tracking of North Atlantic Right Whales, behavior of whales near ships, vessel speed and design impact on collisions, modeling ship traffic, and population studies. The right whale research grant program will include population studies, reproduction and genetic studies, development of a geographic information system database, response of right whales to ship-avoidance deterrence methods, habitat quality studies, and physiological condition studies. Peer review of grant applications will be conducted. Peer review teams for grant applications will include scientists, industry representatives, and technology experts to evaluate feasibility and scientific merit. SEC. 8. INTERAGENCY COORDINATION AND COST-SHARING. The Secretaries of Commerce and Transportation will ensure federal agencies cooperate and share resources to support the North Atlantic Right Whale Recovery Plan. A report on funding requirements must be submitted to Congress within 6 months. SEC. 9. INTERNATIONAL ACTION AND COORDINATION. The Secretary of Commerce will coordinate with Canada on North Atlantic Right Whales programs, including ship traffic management, whale tracking, disentanglement efforts, and information sharing. Discussions will also be held to reduce fishery interactions with relevant management organizations and nations operating in high use areas. The Secretary of Commerce, in collaboration with relevant scientific organizations and countries like Canada, Greenland, and Iceland, will initiate discussions to gather information for the development of a priority action plan or recovery plan for Right Whales in high use areas. SEC. 10. REPORT TO CONGRESS. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration must provide an annual report to Congress by March 1, detailing actions taken under the North Atlantic Right Whale Recovery Plan, funds spent, incidents involving collisions or entanglements with whales, causes of incidents, prevention measures, and new information on whale habitats. The annual report to Congress must include information on high-use areas of North Atlantic Right Whales, litigation status, additional action areas, funded projects, funding needs for recovery programs, and costs of demonstration projects. SEC. 11. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization of appropriations for the Department of Commerce, Department of Transportation, and State Cooperative Agreements under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 for fiscal years 2002, 2003, and 2004. The Endangered Species Act of 1973 authorizes appropriations for the North Atlantic Right Whale Research Grant Program, with $1,000,000 allocated for fiscal year 2002 and $2,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2003 and 2004."
