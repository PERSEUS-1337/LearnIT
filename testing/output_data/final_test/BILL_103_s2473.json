The Administrator of the Bonneville Power Administration defines \"capital investment\" as a cost funded by Federal appropriations for projects or facilities that require repayment through the sale of electric power or services, excluding certain types of investments. The Federal Columbia River Transmission System Act defines terms related to capital investments, including new and old capital investments, repayment dates, and the Treasury rate. The Federal Columbia River Transmission System Act defines the principal amount of a capital investment and the Treasury rate for old and new investments based on prevailing market yields. The Federal Columbia River Transmission System Act defines the principal amount of a capital investment and the Treasury rate for old and new investments based on prevailing market yields. The related project, facility, or separable unit is placed in service on outstanding interest-bearing obligations of the United States with periods to maturity comparable to the period between the beginning of the fiscal year and the repayment date for the new capital investment. SEC. 3. NEW PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS. Effective October 1, 1995, old capital investments have new principal amounts calculated based on the present value of old payment amounts and a specific formula. The Administrator, with approval from the Secretary of the Treasury, determines these new principal amounts and assigns interest rates. For the purposes of this section, \"old payment amounts\" refer to the annual interest and principal that the Administrator would have paid to the United States Treasury from October 1, 1995, if this Act were not enacted. This calculation assumes repayment of the principal on a specific date assigned by the Administrator and payment of interest. The interest rates assigned by the Administrator before October 1, 1993, or determined by the Secretary of the Treasury based on prevailing market yields for old capital investments. The interest rates assigned by the Administrator or determined by the Secretary of the Treasury are based on prevailing market yields for old capital investments, with periods to maturity comparable to the fiscal year start to repayment date. SEC. 4. The unpaid balance on the new principal amount for old capital investments bears interest annually at the Treasury rate until repayment. SEC. 5. The repayment date for the new principal amount is no earlier than the repayment date for the old capital investment. SEC. 6. The Administrator can prepay up to $100,000,000 of new principal amounts before their repayment dates from 1995 to 2000. SEC. 7. Interest rates for new capital investments during construction. Interest rates for new capital investments during construction are determined based on construction expenditures and accrued interest. The Administrator is not required to pay the calculated interest during construction. The \"one-year rate\" is determined by the Secretary of the Treasury based on prevailing market yields on outstanding interest-bearing obligations of the United States. The \"one-year rate\" is determined by the Secretary of the Treasury based on prevailing market yields on outstanding interest-bearing obligations of the United States with periods to maturity of approximately one year.

SEC. 8 states that the unpaid balance on a new capital investment bears interest at the Treasury rate until the investment is repaid. SEC. 9 discusses appropriated amounts. Notwithstanding any other law, $15.25 million is appropriated to the Administrator in fiscal year 1996, increasing annually until 2000, with $4.10 million in each succeeding fiscal year as long as payments are made to the Tribes under the settlement agreement signed in 1994. The docket has been transferred to the United States Court of Federal Claims. \"Tribes\" refers to the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation. SEC. 10. CONTRACT PROVISIONS. In contracts of the Administrator for selling electric power, transmission, or related services after September 30, 1995, rates and charges shall be based on new principal amounts and interest rates specified in the Act. In contracts for selling electric power, rates and charges are based on new principal amounts and interest rates specified in the Act. Payments of principal on old capital investments reduce the outstanding balance, while payments of interest on the unpaid balance are credited against the appropriate interest account. Apart from necessary charges for repayment and interest, no additional fees may be charged for return to the United States Treasury. The Act specifies that payments for old capital investments must be made to the United States Treasury as repayment, with no additional fees allowed. Amounts under section 1304 of title 31, United States Code, are the sole source for payment of judgments or settlements. The contract provisions in the Act do not prevent the Administrator from recovering taxes imposed on electric utilities or affect their authority under applicable law. The Act allows for the allocation of costs and benefits, such as fish and wildlife costs, to rates or resources, and the design of rates under applicable law. SEC. 11. SAVINGS PROVISIONS. This Act does not affect the Administrator's obligation to repay capital investments and pay interest from net proceeds. The Administrator retains authority to prepay capital investment principal amounts."
