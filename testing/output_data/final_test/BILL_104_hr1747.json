The remedy against the United States for such entities and individuals is also specified. In subsection (k)(3), add \"governing board member,\" after \"officer,\" for entities described in paragraph (4) under Section 224 (42 U.S.C. 233) to be considered employees of the Public Health Service. SEC. 4. COVERAGE FOR SERVICES FURNISHED TO INDIVIDUALS OTHER THAN CENTER PATIENTS. Section 224(g)(1) (42 U.S.C. 233(g)) is amended to include deeming certain individuals as employees of the Public Health Service for providing services to all patients of the entity and potentially to individuals who are not patients, based on the Secretary's determination of benefit to patients and the general population. The amended Section 224(g)(1) deems certain individuals as employees of the Public Health Service for providing services to patients and communities served by the entity, facilitating service provision, or as required under employment contracts. SEC. 5. APPLICATION PROCESS. The application requirement under Section 224(g)(1) is amended to include the approval by the Secretary for an application under subparagraph (D). The Secretary may not deem an entity or individuals as employees of the Public Health Service without a submitted application containing detailed information and supporting documentation. The Secretary must determine if an entity or its members are considered employees of the Public Health Service within 30 days of receiving an application. This determination will be valid for a specified period as specified by the Secretary. Once the Secretary determines an entity or individual as a Public Health Service employee, the decision is final and binding. If an entity described in paragraph (4) does not apply, the Secretary cannot consider it for estimates under subsection (k)(1). This section does not impact the entity's authority. The entity can purchase medical malpractice insurance with Federal funds under specific sections. An entity described in paragraph (4) can choose to terminate the applicability of this subsection by notifying the Secretary in writing. The election takes effect after a 30-day period and applies to the entity and its members. Upon election, clauses (i) and (ii) of subparagraph (G) apply to the entity as if no application was submitted. If an application is later submitted, the election does not prevent the Secretary from approving it. Section 224(h) is amended in the approval process.

The Attorney General must certify that an entity or individual was acting within their scope of employment. If the Attorney General fails to appear in State court, the civil action will be removed to the appropriate United States district court for a determination on the claim for damages. SEC. 7. APPLICATION OF COVERAGE TO MANAGED CARE PLANS. Section 224 (42 U.S.C. 223) is amended to include provisions regarding entities contracting with managed care plans. Entities described in subsection (g)(1) are deemed employees of the Public Health Service for services provided to enrollees of a managed care plan. Managed care plans must consider entities meeting malpractice coverage requirements for contracting providers.
