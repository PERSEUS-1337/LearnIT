    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Great Lakes Mass Marking Program Act\". Congress finds that the Great Lakes have experienced rapid changes in recent years due to the introduction of aquatic invasive species, alterations in the food web, and decreases in prey species abundance. A collaborative, science-based program is needed to assist in management actions for fish stocking rates, rehabilitation of important fish species, and habitat restoration. States and Indian tribes in the Great Lakes region have identified mass marking as a crucial component. The Great Lakes Fishery Commission and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service have identified mass marking as essential for balancing hatchery-produced fish with wild fish and achieving fishery management objectives in the Great Lakes. The USFWS initiated a mass marking program in 2010, tagging approximately 8,000,000 fish annually. The Great Lakes Fishery Commission annually tags 8,000,000 hatchery-produced fish in a basinwide cooperative effort with US Fish and Wildlife Service, Indian tribes, and State agencies. The data produced is used for management decisions. Federal, State, and tribal agencies stock 21,000,000 hatchery-produced fish to support native species recovery and fishing. Mass marking of fish is done using automated technology for efficient fishery management. The Great Lakes support a robust regional economy valued at over $7 billion and provide stability to the economy of the United States. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The term \"Director\" refers to the Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. The term \"Program\" refers to the Great Lakes Mass Marking Program established by section 4(a). The Great Lakes Mass Marking Program is established to assist in evaluating hatchery operations and fisheries management in the Great Lakes basin. Collaboration with various fish management agencies is required, and data collected will be shared to improve understanding of management outcomes. The Great Lakes Mass Marking Program aims to increase understanding of management outcomes, assist in meeting restoration objectives, balance predators and prey, support fisheries, and evaluate habitat restoration efforts in the Great Lakes. Authorization of appropriations for the Great Lakes Mass Marking Program is set at $5,000,000 annually from 2018 to 2022."
