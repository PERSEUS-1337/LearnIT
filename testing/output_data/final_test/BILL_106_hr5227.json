    "content": "The 21st Century Community Learning Centers Act is amended to include a new part titled \"21st Century Community Learning Centers Act\" with sections on short title and findings. \"Congress finds that millions of children return to unsupervised homes after school, leading to potential academic struggles and increased juvenile crime between 2:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. Parents are in favor of more after-school programs than are currently available.\" After-school programs are crucial between 2:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. to protect children from crime and enhance academic success. Community learning centers help develop tailored strategies for each community's youth. The Secretary is authorized to award grants to rural and inner-city schools or organizations for after-school projects benefiting youth. Grants must be distributed equitably among states and urban/rural areas, with a minimum amount of $40,000 per grant for up to 3 years. \"SEC. 10904. APPLICATION REQUIRED.\" To be eligible for a grant under this part, a school or organization must submit an application to the Secretary with a comprehensive local plan, evaluation of needs and resources, and a description of the proposed project. The application for a grant must include a mechanism for disseminating information, merging or coordinating programs, collaborative efforts with organizations, and serving as a delivery center for after-school services. The grant application must include a facility utilization policy outlining rules and supervision guidelines. Priority will be given to projects offering a variety of services for youth in after-school programs. Grants awarded under this part can be used to plan, implement, or expand community learning centers. A community learning center provides educational, recreational, health, and social service programs for youth within a local community. The term \"organization\" refers to various types of groups that can run these centers. The term \"school\" specifically means a public elementary or secondary school. An \"after-school program\" is defined as a child care program that helps working parents when school is not in session. Authorization of appropriations for community learning centers is set at $1 billion for fiscal year 2001, with additional funding for subsequent years as needed."
