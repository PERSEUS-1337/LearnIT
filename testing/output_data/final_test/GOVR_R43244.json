Currently, women make up 23.7% of voting Members in the House and Senate, with 131 women in the 116th Congress. This report provides historical data on women in Congress, including their means of entry and comparisons to other legislatures. Since the 65th Congress in 1917, the number of women serving in Congress has generally increased incrementally, with a few exceptions. For additional biographical information on women in Congress, including names, committee assignments, and service dates, refer to the CRS Report RL30261, Women in Congress, 1917-2019 by Jennifer E. Manning and Ida A. Brudnick. Since 1917, the number of women in Congress has generally increased incrementally, with exceptions. The 1992 elections saw a significant jump, known as the \"Year of the Woman,\" increasing the number of women by 58.8%. In the 116th Congress, there was a 13.9% increase in women members. Figures show the historical division of men and women in Congress. In the 116th Congress, 49 states, 4 territories, and the District of Columbia have been represented by women in Congress since 1917. Some states have never elected a woman to the House or Senate. The process of entering office differs for Representatives and Senators due to constitutional provisions. Since 1913, 39 women Senators entered through winning an election, while 17 were appointed. Of the appointed Senators, 10 served less than a year. Overall, 8.5% of appointed Senators have been women. The current female representation in Congress is 23.7%. The percentage of voting female representation in Congress (23.7%) is slightly lower than the global average of 24.3% of women in national legislative seats. The United States ranks 78th worldwide for women in the lower chamber. Nordic countries lead with 42.3% female representation. Women in Congress also have lower representation compared to state legislatures, where 28.7% of state legislators are women. Since the 92nd Congress, the percentage of women in state legislatures has surpassed that in Congress. In the early 1990s, there was a significant gap between female representation in Congress (6.0%) and state legislatures (18.3%). The first woman elected to Congress was Jeannette Rankin, while Rebecca Latimer Felton was the first woman to serve in the Senate. Rebecca Latimer Felton was the first female Senator, appointed in 1922 to fill an unexpired term. She holds the records for the shortest Senate tenure (one day) and oldest person to begin Senate service at 87. Hattie Caraway was the first woman to succeed her spouse in the Senate and first female initially elected to a full term. Margaret Chase Smith was the first woman elected to the Senate without prior appointment and served in both houses of Congress. Nancy Pelosi was the first woman elected Speaker of the House, holding the highest position of leadership by a woman in the U.S. government. Senator Barbara Mikulski holds the record for the longest total length of service by a woman in Congress. Currently serving Representative Marcy Kaptur holds the record for the longest length of service by a woman in the House. On March 18, 2018, Representative Marcy Kaptur (D-OH) surpassed the record for the longest length of service by a woman in the House, previously held by Representative Rogers. Kaptur has been serving in the House since January 3, 1983, for 36 years. Senator Mikulski holds the record for the longest length of service by a woman in the Senate, surpassing Senator Margaret Chase Smith's previous record. Sixteen women have served in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, with Margaret Chase Smith being the first woman to do so. In the 116th Congress, a record number of 25 African American women serve, along with 10 Asian Pacific American women. The first African American woman to serve in the Senate was Senator Carol Moseley-Braun. Representative Shirley Chisholm was the first African American woman to serve in Congress. In the 116th Congress, a record number of Hispanic or Latino women serve, with 15 in the House and one in the Senate. Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen was the first Hispanic woman in Congress, while Catherine Cortez Masto is the first Hispanic woman Senator. Representatives Sharice Davids and Deb Haaland are the first female enrolled members of federally recognized tribes in Congress. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi holds the highest position of leadership ever held by a woman in the U.S. government. In the 116th Congress, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi holds the highest leadership position ever held by a woman in the U.S. government. She is second in line for the presidency and has served as Speaker in multiple Congresses. Senator Margaret Chase Smith holds the Senate record for the highest leadership position held by a female Senator. In the 116th Congress, there are currently nine committees led by women: five standing committees in the House, one standing committee in the Senate, one select committee in the House, one select committee in the Senate, and one joint committee. In recent decades, the number of women in Congress has increased, leading to studies on their legislative behavior and impact. Questions include whether female Members differ in legislative behavior from males, the effects on descriptive and substantive representation, and if women sponsor more \"women's issues bills\" or speak more on women's issues on the House floor. Studies have examined the legislative behavior of female Members of Congress, including their effectiveness compared to male legislators. This includes bill sponsorship, success in passing legislation, committee work, securing federal funds, consensus building, and career trajectories. The curr_chunk discusses various factors influencing women's entry and success in Congress, such as professional backgrounds, the widow effect, reelection efforts, and decision-making regarding retirement or seeking other offices."
