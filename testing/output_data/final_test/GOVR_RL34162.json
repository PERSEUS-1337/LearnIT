    "content": "The federal government and some state governments implemented renewable energy policies in response to the energy crises of the 1970s. These policies supported research, technology demonstration projects, and commercial deployment of renewable energy equipment, focusing on liquid fuels and electricity production. The Energy Tax Act of 1978 established a 4 cents per gallon excise tax exemption for ethanol blended into gasoline, which was extended multiple times in the 1980s and 1990s. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 further extended the excise tax exemption and created a tax deduction for clean-fuel vehicles, including those using 85% ethanol (E85). It also mandated a growing percentage of alternative-fueled vehicles in federal, state, and other vehicle fleets. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 established various incentives for renewable fuels, including tax exemptions and credits for ethanol blends and biodiesel. The Renewable Fuel Standard set by EPACT Section 1501 requires increasing amounts of renewable fuel in motor fuels each year. The Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA, Section 210) created a policy framework requiring electric utilities to purchase electricity from renewable sources, with states setting the purchase price. This policy aimed to reduce oil use for power production, promote renewable energy, and introduce competition to lower electricity prices. In the early 1980s, PURPA regulation in California led to the commercial deployment of wind and solar energy, driven by federal and state tax credits for wind energy. The wind industry saw developments with firms taking advantage of tax credits and the need for power purchase agreements for financing. This led to the creation of production-oriented tax credits and \"standard offer\" contracts by the California Public Utility Commission. Meanwhile, oil and natural gas prices declined in the 1980s, and Congress allowed the residential solar investment tax credit to expire in 1985. Funding for Department of Energy renewable initiatives was affected. In 1985, the solar investment tax credit expired. Funding for Department of Energy renewable energy R&D programs declined until 1990. Interest in renewable energy was reignited during the Persian Gulf War in 1990-1991. Other countries like Japan and Germany began aggressive policies to subsidize wind and solar technologies. The US Congress increased funding for DOE renewable energy R&D in response. In 1992, the US signed the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, leading to the Energy Policy Act of 1992, which made the 10% business investment tax credit for solar and geothermal equipment permanent and introduced a new renewable energy electricity production tax credit. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 introduced a new renewable energy electricity production tax credit of 1.5 cents per kilowatt-hour for wind farms and biomass. Climate change concerns led to stronger renewable energy policies in industrialized nations, with the Kyoto Protocol setting emission reduction targets for greenhouse gases. The United States had concerns about the economic impact of emission reduction targets. The United States has shown limited effort in supporting renewable energy compared to other industrialized nations due to economic concerns about the impact of emission reduction targets. State actions, like California's aggressive programs for renewable energy, have often taken the lead in implementing new policies, such as the public goods charge on ratepayer electricity use. California implemented a public goods charge on ratepayer electricity use to fund renewable energy programs. Electricity shortages in 2000 and 2001 led to an expansion of renewable energy initiatives. Recent actions include a $3 billion solar deployment initiative and increasing the renewable portfolio standard to 33% by 2020. Policy proposals now focus on energy security, competitiveness, high prices, pollution, and climate change. Over 200 bills in the 110th Congress supported renewable energy, including the Energy Independence Act and the Consolidated Appropriations Act. The Energy Independence Act (P.L. 110-140) and the Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 110-161) increased support for renewable energy, while the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act (P.L. 110-343) provided tax incentives for renewables. Various bills in the 110th Congress supported renewable energy initiatives. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPACT, P.L. 109-58) created a DOE loan guarantee program for renewable energy technologies to improve energy security and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The program offers federal loan guarantees covering up to 80% of construction costs for innovative renewable energy projects, supporting the development of biofuels like cellulosic ethanol. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 established a DOE loan guarantee program for renewable energy technologies, including biofuels like cellulosic ethanol. The program supports projects that reduce air pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions, using new or improved technologies. DOE can issue loan guarantees for early commercial use of advanced technologies with a reasonable prospect of repayment. The program aligns with the President's Advanced Energy Initiative goals and distinguishes itself from other DOE activities focused on research and development. In October 2007, DOE issued final loan guarantee regulations allowing guarantees for up to 100% of project costs. The DOE loan guarantee regulations allow guarantees for up to 100% of the loan amount, with a limit of 80% of the total project cost. If a guarantee is issued for 100% of the debt, it must be funded by the Treasury Department's Federal Financing Bank. Borrowers and sponsors are required to pay the \"credit subsidy cost\" for the guarantee, which is the expected long-term liability to the government. No funds have been appropriated for this cost, so the borrower is expected to cover it. The DOE loan guarantee program allows for guarantees up to 100% of the loan amount, with a limit of 80% of the total project cost. Borrowers are responsible for paying the credit subsidy cost, and DOE does not plan to use taxpayer funds for this. Provisions in P.L. 110-140 expand eligibility for loan guarantees to include facilities manufacturing fuel-efficient vehicles, advanced vehicle batteries, and components. Funding for the DOE Loan Guarantee Program is detailed in Table 1. In FY2006, DOE used $500,000 from three accounts for start-up activities for $2 billion loan guarantee authority. FY2007 bill provided $7 million for program operating costs. P.L. 110-5 raised authority to $4 billion and required rulemaking. Concerns were raised in FY2008 about program implementation. FY2008 Act directed $38.5 billion in new loans. The Consolidated Appropriations Act (P.L. 110-161) directed DOE to issue $38.5 billion in new loan guarantee authority through FY2011. $10.0 billion is designated for renewables, energy efficiency, and other projects. DOE's FY2009 request includes $19.9 million for administrative expenses for the loan guarantee program. The request seeks to extend authority through FY2011, with $20.0 billion available for renewables and $18.5 billion for nuclear power facilities. The Continuing Appropriations Resolution for FY2009 (P.L. 110-329, H.R. 2638) provides funding at the FY2008 level through March 6, 2009 for nuclear power facilities. In February 2007, $4 billion in authority for loan guarantees was provided through the FY2007 Continuing Appropriations Resolution (P.L. 110-5). DOE announced a solicitation for renewable energy projects in May 2007, including biomass, solar, wind, and hydropower. In October 2007, DOE invited 16 pre-applicants to submit full loan guarantee applications, with eight proposing renewable energy projects such as biofuels and solar technologies. On June 30, 2008, the DOE announced three solicitations for loan guarantees totaling up to $30.5 billion for advanced energy technologies. One of the solicitations was for renewable energy and advanced transmission technologies. The deadline for applications for stand-alone and manufacturing projects was extended to February 26, 2009, while the deadline for large-scale integration projects remained set at April 30, 2009. Several biofuels programs authorized by EPACT have not been funded. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2008 authorized new programs and spending for renewable energy, but several provisions have not been funded or have been funded below authorized levels. Unfunded biomass provisions, technologies to address climate change, and distributed energy remain unfunded. Title VI of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2008 directs the Department of Energy to conduct new programs for renewable energy and hydrogen technologies, but many of these programs have not been funded as authorized. For example, funding for new geothermal programs and a hydrogen prize program have not been included in the FY2009 appropriations bill. Additionally, a new program for promoting clean and efficient energy technologies in foreign countries has been established, with the U.S. Agency for International Development tasked to report to Congress on their efforts in this area. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2008 directs various U.S. agencies to support clean and efficient energy technologies, including efforts to export these technologies. A multi-agency Task Force on International Cooperation for Clean and Efficient Energy Technologies is created to assist in implementing clean energy markets in developing countries. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $100 million for USAID programs supporting zero-carbon efficiency and renewables, but this funding was not provided in P.L. 110-329. Subtitle B establishes an \"International Clean Energy Foundation\" with the goal of reducing carbon emissions. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2008 establishes an \"International Clean Energy Foundation\" with the goal of reducing carbon emissions. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $200 million for an \"International Clean Energy Fund\" at the World Bank, but no appropriations were provided. Title X authorizes funding for national and state job training programs to support growth in green industries. The President's 2008 State of the Union address emphasized the importance of developing cleaner and more energy-efficient technology to strengthen energy security and address global climate change. The Administration proposed to continue support for the Advanced Energy Initiative (AEI) to reduce America's dependence on imported energy sources, including hydrogen, biofuels, and solar energy initiatives. The Hydrogen Initiative aims to develop technology for a cleaner and more secure energy future. The DOE's FY2009 budget request aims to advance hydrogen, biofuels, and solar energy technologies to achieve a cleaner and more secure energy future. Funding for EERE programs would be reduced by $467.0 million, with a goal to make solar power cost-competitive with conventional electricity by 2015. The DOE's FY2009 budget request aims to reduce EERE funding by $467.0 million, with key increases for Biomass Energy and Geothermal Energy. Funding for renewable energy technologies would increase by $20.7 million (4.6%), while the House Appropriations Committee recommended a $808.7 million (47%) increase for EERE programs in FY2009. The House Appropriations Committee recommended a $808.7 million (47%) increase for EERE programs in FY2009, which is a significant increase compared to the DOE request. The Committee also proposed additional funding for R&D programs, energy assistance programs, and new assistance programs authorized by the Energy Independence and Security Act. This includes $500.0 million for new programs and $25.0 million for the Renewable Fuel Infrastructure Program. The House Appropriations Committee recommended a $808.7 million increase for EERE programs in FY2009, with additional funding for R&D programs, energy assistance programs, and new assistance programs authorized by the Energy Independence and Security Act. This includes $500.0 million for new programs such as advanced biofuels and zero net energy commercial buildings, and $134.7 million for Congressionally-Directed Assistance. The committee also included policy directives for DOE, requiring annual reports on ROI for major EERE program funding accounts and making $20 million available for local projects reducing electricity demand. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $1,928.3 million for EERE, with a focus on projects with local cost-share, water use reduction, and minority outreach at educational institutions. This is $205.9 million more than FY2008 and $672.9 million more than the request. Compared to the House Appropriations Committee, the Senate recommended $602.8 million less for EERE programs, mainly due to a proposed increase of $500.0 million for a new EISA Federal Assistance Program by the House. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed funding increases for various technology programs, including a $50.0 million increase for a new Local Government/Tribal Technology Demonstration Program. They recommended lower funding for renewable energy R&D, with decreases for Geothermal, Bioenergy, and Water Energy. Energy efficiency programs also saw decreases, with cuts to Weatherization, Industrial Technologies, and Vehicle Technologies. Both the House and Senate committees recommended higher funding levels than the request, particularly for the Weatherization Program. Both the House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended increased funding for various technology programs, including the Weatherization Program. They disagreed with funding the Asia Pacific Partnership and called for the Biomass program to focus on non-food sources for biofuels. The Senate Committee emphasized algae as a biofuels source and proposed higher funding for the Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability. The House recommended $149.3 million, while the Senate recommended $166.9 million for OE. The FY2009 budget document includes $1.6 billion for renewable energy funding, targeting cellulosic ethanol projects. The USDA's FY2009 request includes funding for renewable energy loans, grants, and biomass research. The House adopted a substitute to the proposed Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2008. The Appropriations Resolution, 2009 would continue federal funding at FY2008 levels through March 6, 2009. It includes provisions for additional funding for energy efficiency, such as $7.51 billion for a DOE Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program and an additional $250 million for the DOE Weatherization Assistance Program in FY2009. The House passed the Supplemental Appropriations Bill for Fiscal Year 2009, providing additional funding for green schools initiative, efficiency, and renewables programs at DOE. $500 million for DOE's Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy to accelerate technology development for a diverse energy portfolio. $100 million for DOE's Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability to modernize the electric grid. The Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability (OE) aims to modernize the electric grid, enhance security and reliability, and facilitate recovery from energy supply disruptions. The bill authorizes $1 billion for loans under the Energy Independence Act, with $5 million allocated for administrative expenses. Leveraged loan guarantee commitments are capped at $3.3 billion. The Senate adopted the House-passed version of H.R. 2638 on September 27, 2008. The Improvement and Extension Act (EIEA) extends tax incentives for renewable energy, supporting electricity production, biofuels, transportation efficiency, buildings efficiency, and equipment efficiency. It includes incentives such as production tax credit, solar investment tax credits, and clean energy bonds. The law allocates $9.1 billion for renewable energy production tax incentives and $3.6 billion for energy efficiency tax incentives. The EIEA extends tax incentives for renewable energy, including production tax credits, solar investment tax credits, and clean energy bonds. It offsets costs by reducing existing subsidies, generating nearly $17 billion in revenue over 10 years. The largest offset comes from modifying broker requirements, with additional revenue from changes in foreign income taxes. The curr_chunk discusses additional revenue sources from changes in foreign income taxes, excise tax modification for the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, and an extension of the Federal Unemployment Tax Act surtax, totaling $4.91 billion. The primary issue revolves around House proposals to offset costs by reducing other tax subsidies, particularly focusing on the repeal of oil and natural gas subsidies. Opponents argue that this repeal would raise gasoline prices, increase energy costs, and lead to a decline in oil industry jobs. The proposed repeal of oil and natural gas subsidies is a contentious issue. Opponents argue it would raise gasoline prices and lead to job losses in the oil industry. Proponents believe the repeal would mainly affect the five largest oil companies, which have made significant profits and do not need the subsidies. They argue that the subsidies currently favor conventional fuels and that the repeal would help bring support into a more balanced approach, promoting the development of \"green jobs\" and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was established in 1992 by federal law and allows for income tax credits for renewable energy facilities like wind, biomass, geothermal, solar, and others. The credit can be claimed annually over a 10-year period starting from the facility's placed-in-service date. The PTC has expired and been reinstated multiple times, with adjustments made for inflation. In 2005, the Energy Policy Act extended the PTC for two years. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 extended the Production Tax Credit (PTC) for two years, until the end of 2007. The Tax Relief Act of 2006 extended it for one more year, until 2008. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act extended the PTC for windfarms until 2009, and for biomass, geothermal, solar, and other sources until 2010. The PTC was expanded to include marine and hydrokinetic power sources until 2011. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was extended until the end of 2011. The credit varies for different types of renewable energy sources, ranging from 2.1 cents/kwh for wind, closed-loop biomass, geothermal, and solar facilities to 1.0 cents/kwh for marine/hydrokinetic, open-loop biomass, small irrigation power, incremental hydropower, and municipal solid waste facilities. The credit may be reduced for facilities receiving other federal credits or grants. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) is available for renewable energy sources like wind, biomass, geothermal, and solar facilities. Claims for the PTC were low in 1993 and 1994 but increased significantly from 1995 to 2005, with wind farm developments making up over 90% of the claims. The PTC has positively impacted the wind energy industry but had little effect on baseload renewables like geothermal and biomass, and virtually no effect on solar energy development. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) has stimulated significant growth in wind capacity over the past 10 years, but its expirations in 2000, 2002, and 2004 caused sharp declines in annual capacity growth. The unpredictable nature of the credit led to periods of uncertainty, halting new wind construction, eliminating jobs, and driving up costs. The unpredictable nature of the Production Tax Credit (PTC) has hindered investment in U.S.-based facilities for wind power, leading to boom-and-bust cycles and under-investment in manufacturing capacity. This has also impacted transmission planning and development, restricting growth in the wind industry. The American Wind Energy Association has observed a decline in industry activity before PTC expirations. The wind industry experiences a cycle of decline before PTC expiration, impacting manufacturing production demands. The PTC was meant as temporary assistance but has been in place for 15 years. Geothermal power plants are similar to coal-fired plants, requiring capital-intensive facilities. Identifying geothermal resources is likened to oil prospecting. The geothermal industry faces high costs and risks similar to oil and gas exploration. Limited development of new geothermal facilities has been observed since 1992. The PTC incentive for geothermal facilities has not been effective due to short windows of availability. Industry representatives are concerned about meeting deadlines and future credit extensions. The geothermal industry, along with biomass, hydropower, and landfill gas industries, are advocating for longer-term PTC extensions to stimulate sustained growth. Short-term extensions have limited impact on technologies with long development periods like biomass and geothermal. Solar energy equipment, designed for on-site use, finds the PTC less valuable compared to investment tax credits. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) is less valuable for solar compared to the Investment Tax Credits (ITC) due to rules against using both credits. Solar industry prefers ITC over PTC. PTC was underutilized until states implemented Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) policies in the mid-1990s, leading to increased PTC claims. PTC combined with RPS policies has driven wind energy growth since the late 1990s. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) has driven wind energy growth, but its variability has caused dependency on European equipment. The PTC has not effectively stimulated other renewable energy development, leading to proposals for a longer-term extension, preferred by the wind industry for at least five years. Expansion of the credit to include a broader range of renewable energy resources has been considered in the past. The Production Tax Credit (PTC) was expanded to cover marine energy and hydrokinetic resources, with a 1.0 cent/kwh credit for a three-year eligibility window. Studies have shown that wind power would continue to see the largest gains with a 10-year extension, while biomass and geothermal facilities would also experience capacity expansion. The potential benefits of extending the PTC for 5 to 10 years include reducing the installed cost of wind by 5% to 15%, better transmission planning, increased private R&D spending, and boosting the domestic share of manufactured wind equipment to about 70%. A 10-year extension could reduce tax revenue by $5.8 billion over 10 years. MidAmerican Energy Company suggested that a 5-to-10 year PTC extension would encourage baseload renewables like geothermal and biomass, providing long-term certainty to utilities. Mid-American Energy Company proposed a long-term extension of the PTC coupled with a gradual phase-down of the credit to 1.5 cents/kwh to address budget-related cost concerns. They also suggested a conditional second deadline for projects under construction with signed power sales contracts to extend the placed-in-service eligibility period. The PTC was set to expire at the end of 2008, leading to proposals for extension in the 110th Congress. Various proposals were considered, with the House focusing on fully offsetting the cost of incentives by reducing tax subsidies for oil and gas, which the Administration opposed. H.R. 2776 proposed a four-year extension that was later included in H.R. 3221. In the 110th Congress, proposals were made to extend the Production Tax Credit (PTC) set to expire in 2008. Key bills included H.R. 5351, H.R. 6049, and H.R. 1424. Proponents argued that the PTC corrects market failures by providing economic value for clean energy sources. Opponents questioned extending the credit. Opponents of extending the Production Tax Credit (PTC) beyond 2008 argue that renewable energy subsidies distort the free market and should not receive special treatment. They suggest putting a tax on pollution from energy sources instead. Additionally, they point out that renewable energy production, particularly from wind and solar, is less valuable due to its fluctuating nature compared to conventional facilities. Energy Secretary Bodman testified at a Senate hearing in February 2007 that the Administration was unlikely to support a long-term extension of the Production Tax Credit (PTC) as it would not align with free market principles. The Administration's budget requests for FY2008 and FY2009 did not include provisions for a PTC extension. However, there were proposals in the Senate and House budget resolutions to create a deficit-neutral reserve for a five-year PTC extension. The Energy Tax Act of 1978 established an investment tax credit for solar and wind energy equipment, which expired in 1985 as energy prices declined. The Energy Tax Act of 1978 established an investment tax credit for solar and wind energy equipment, which expired in 1985. In 2005, EPACT (P.L. 109-58, \u00a71335) established a 30% residential solar credit with a cap at $2,000, through 2007. The Tax Relief Act of 2006 (P.L. 109-432, \u00a7206) extended the credit through 2008. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (P.L. 110-343, Div. B, \u00a7106) extended the residential solar tax credit at 30% for eight years, through 2016, with an increased cap to $4,000. Business investment tax credits were also established for solar, wind, geothermal, and ocean energy equipment. The solar business tax credit was increased to 30% in 2005 and extended through 2016. Public utilities became eligible for the credit, and it could offset the alternative minimum tax. The debate over extending the credit focused on market distortion versus correcting market failures. The solar industry views the business ITC as crucial, while proponents argue that the credits help correct market failures and establish equality with subsidies. The solar industry argued that business tax credits correct market failures and promote equality with subsidies. P.L. 110-343 established a 30% credit for wind machines and expanded the 10% credit to include geothermal heat pumps. Non-profit electric utilities, ineligible for the credit due to tax-exempt status, sought comparable incentives to develop renewable energy facilities. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 established a renewable energy production incentive (REPI) similar to the PTC, providing 1.5 cents/kwh. However, REPI receives limited funding of about $5 million per year, leading to underfunding and limited potential. Non-profit electric utilities proposed creating a \"clean energy bond\" to establish a more comparable incentive. Subsequently, clean renewable energy bonds (CREBs) were established to address this issue. Clean renewable energy bonds (CREBs) were authorized by EPACT in 2006 and 2007, with $800 million in bond authority. A second round of CREBs was authorized in 2008, adding $400 million more. P.L. 110-343 established \"New CREBs\" for state/local/tribal governments, public power providers, and cooperative electric companies, with differences in bond use period and tax credit rate compared to previous CREBs. The tax credit rate for New CREBs is set at 70% of the previous rate for CREBs. Taxpayers can carry forward unused credits into future years and the benefits can be separated from bond ownership. A national limit of $800 million was set for New CREBs, with allocations for state, local, and tribal governments, public power providers, and cooperative electric companies. The estimated revenue drain on the U.S. Treasury is $267 million from 2009 to 2018. The Administration opposes New CREBs, citing them as expensive and inefficient. The New CREBs, introduced with the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, aim to limit environmental consequences of fossil fuel reliance by attracting investment through tax-credit bonds. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act requires revenue offsets, including support for renewables and efficiency. Debate over revenue offset provisions in H.R. 1424 mirrored previous debates on similar bills. Opponents argue that reducing oil and gas incentives would have negative effects. Opponents argued that reducing oil and natural gas incentives would dampen production, cause job losses, and lead to higher fuel prices. Proponents countered that record profits show these incentives were unnecessary and that new incentives would promote \"green\" job growth. Over 28 states have implemented a Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard (RPS) requiring a minimum amount of electricity from renewable sources or tradable credits. Most states set targets between 10% to 20% by 2010 to 2025, using tradable credits to lower costs and ensure compliance. State RPS policies aim to lower costs and promote compliance with renewable energy requirements. Proponents argue that the costs of renewable energy are modest and that RPS creates jobs, reduces natural gas prices, and provides environmental benefits. The renewable energy production tax credit (PTC) is crucial for supporting state RPS policies, reducing costs by about $20/mwh. Federal agency involvement in state RPS programs is limited. State RPS policies aim to lower costs and promote compliance with renewable energy requirements. Proponents argue that a national system of tradable credits would enable retail suppliers to comply at the least cost. During the first session of the 110th Congress, RPS action began with Senate floor consideration of a 15% RPS target, which was ultimately ruled non-germane. Opponents argued that a federal RPS would be unfair and costly due to regional differences in renewable energy resources. Opponents in the Southeastern states argued that the region lacks enough renewable energy resources to meet a 15% renewables requirement, which would raise retail electricity prices. However, proponents cited an EIA study showing that the South has sufficient biomass generation to meet the requirement without being overly dependent on other regions. The study estimated a slight increase in retail electricity prices and a slight decrease in natural gas prices over the 2005 to 2030 period. The House approved an RPS amendment setting a 15% target for 2020, with up to four percentage points allowed for energy efficiency measures. Proponents acknowledged the need to expand biomass resources definition. The Senate passed H.R. 6 without an RPS provision, causing a discrepancy in the Energy Independence bill. During the 109th Congress, a debate arose over the proposal by Cape Wind Associates to develop a 420-megawatt offshore wind farm in Nantucket Sound, Massachusetts. Proponents argue it is a safe and clean way to create renewable energy and jobs, while opponents, including the Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound, raise concerns over safety, economic, and environmental impacts. The Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound opposes the Cape Wind offshore wind project due to threats to the ecosystem, maritime navigation, and the local economy. Regulatory responsibility for offshore wind developments lies with the Minerals Management Service (MMS). An environmental impact statement (EIS) was prepared in 2006, with findings of minor impacts on the environment, fisheries, and marine transportation. The Coast Guard is also involved in determining navigational safety aspects for the project. The status of navigational safety for the Cape Wind Project is being determined, with concerns about radar interference from tall wind turbines. Federal actions temporarily halted some wind farm developments until a DOD study was completed in 2006. The report allowed most projects to resume, but mitigation strategies may be needed on a case-by-case basis. Wildlife impact from wind turbines is also a concern. H.R. 3221 (\u00a77231-7234) aimed to address the impact of land-based wind turbines on wildlife by forming a committee to recommend guidance. However, this provision was not included in the final version of H.R. 6, the Energy Independence and Security Act. Technology for generating electricity from marine sources is advancing, with tax incentives in place to encourage commercial development in states like Florida, Maine, and New Jersey. MMS and FERC have authority to regulate ocean energy resources on the outer continental shelf. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) asserts authority to regulate marine and hydrokinetic power technologies as forms of hydropower. Environmental issues may arise as these technologies develop, with regulatory struggles between FERC and the Minerals Management Service (MMS) growing in importance. The 110th Congress took actions to promote marine and hydrokinetic power technologies through the Energy Independence and Security Act, directing the Department of Energy (DOE) to create an R&D program focused on electricity generation from waves, tides, currents, and ocean thermal differences. DOE is also instructed to award grants for establishing National Marine centers. The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act provided funding for DOE's Water/Marine Energy Technology Program and expanded the renewable energy electricity production tax credit to include marine and hydrokinetic sources. Ethanol is the main renewable fuel produced in the US, mainly from corn, and is often blended with gasoline. Ethanol, mainly produced from corn, is commonly blended with gasoline at a 10% ratio. A 51-cent per gallon tax credit has helped address its high cost barrier. National ethanol production in 2007 was estimated at 6.48 billion gallons, equivalent to about 4.34 billion gallons of gasoline. The rapid growth in agriculture-based biofuel production led to a surge in corn, grain, and oilseed prices in late 2006. Corn ethanol plant capacity expansion was on a record pace at the end of 2006, raising concerns about further acceleration of ethanol production. The expansion of corn ethanol plant capacity has raised concerns about the potential challenges of further accelerating ethanol production. Supporters argue that ethanol displaces petroleum imports, improving energy security and reducing emissions. Opponents claim that federal and state incentives for ethanol distort the market and provide corporate welfare for corn growers and ethanol producers. Proponents of ethanol counter-argue that it provides modest energy and emissions benefits compared to gasoline. Cellulosic ethanol can be produced from dedicated fuel crops like fast-growing trees and switchgrass. Cellulosic ethanol can be produced from fast-growing trees and switchgrass, which grow well on marginal lands and require little water and no fertilizer. While cellulosic feedstocks may be cheaper and more plentiful than corn, they require extensive and costly conversion to ethanol. Research is being conducted by DOE and USDA to improve technology and reduce costs. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 extends and increases the Renewable Fuel Standard, requiring minimum annual levels of renewable fuel in U.S. transportation fuel. The new standard starts at 9.0 billion gallons in 2008 and rises to 36 billion gallons. Commercial production facilities are in operation in the United States and Canada. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) was extended and increased by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, with a target of 36 billion gallons by 2022. Advanced biofuels like cellulosic ethanol must meet the increase in RFS targets starting in 2016. The EPA Administrator can waive part of the biofuels mandate in case of feedstock disruptions. New biorefineries must reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% compared to gasoline and diesel, with incentives for those displacing fossil-derived processing fuels. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) was expanded by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, aiming for 36 billion gallons by 2022. Concerns were raised about potential limitations on new technologies and feedstock sources. Studies on the RFS expansion's impacts on the economy were required. Senate Committee expressed concerns about the RFS implementation. Table 7 displays baseline EIA data on U.S. oil use and Persian Gulf imports in 2006. The table shows baseline EIA data for U.S. oil use and Persian Gulf Imports in 2006, along with EIA projections for future years through 2030. It also includes ethanol production estimates for the current RFS of 36 billion gallons by 2022, which would displace 1.57 million barrels per day of Persian Gulf imports. The Bush Administration's Biofuels Initiative aimed to increase funding for cellulosic ethanol development to achieve commercial use, with a joint research effort between DOE's EERE and Office of Science to develop cellulosic biotechnology for 60 billion gallons per year production. The DOE's Biomass Program aims to increase biomass quantity per acre and breed plants for more cellulose, cutting costs through biorefinery breakthroughs. The FY2009 budget request of $225.0 million supports the Biofuels Initiative and RFS goals, but funding remains at FY2008 levels due to the Consolidated Security, Disaster Assistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act. Tax incentives are provided for building cellulosic biofuel facilities. The legislation provides tax incentives for cellulosic biofuels production, biodiesel, small biodiesel producers, biomass-derived diesel fuel, and alternative refueling stations. These incentives are available for a limited time and aim to promote renewable energy production in the United States to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Renewable energy production can substitute for fossil energy in vehicle fuels and electricity, reducing CO2 emissions. Biomass combustion releases CO2, but re-growth of biomass material offsets this. Net emissions only occur with deforestation, but in a \"closed loop\" system with rotating energy crops, there is no net CO2 release. Since 1988, the federal government has supported renewable energy as a CO2 mitigation measure through various programs at DOE, USDA, EPA, AID, and the World Bank. States like California and New York have significant programs for R&D and market deployment of renewables, funded by a surcharge on electricity use. Many states have also enacted renewable portfolio standards to curb CO2 emissions. Many states have enacted renewable portfolio standards and climate programs that include renewables as a mitigation measure. The proposed Lieberman-Warner Climate Security Act aimed to establish a cap-and-trade system to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, with provisions for energy efficiency and renewable energy. Revenue from auctions would support accelerated deployment of renewables and energy efficiency. The Boxer substitute bill would have provided even broader incentives for renewables. The Boxer substitute bill aimed to establish incentives for energy efficiency and renewable energy measures, including grants, worker training, and private financing leverage. The FY2008 budget requested $1,236.2 million for DOE's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy programs, with the House approving $1,873.8 million and the Senate recommending $1,715.6 million. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2007 included $1,723.7 million for EERE. The 110th Congress enacted a major omnibus energy bill focused on improving energy efficiency and increasing renewable energy availability. Key provisions include setting a target of 35 miles per gallon for cars and light trucks by 2020, a Renewable Fuels Standard starting at 8.5 billion gallons in 2008 and rising to 36 billion gallons by 2022, and new efficiency standards for various types of lamps and consumer electronic products. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 set efficiency standards for various consumer electronic products. The Farm, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 extended renewable energy provisions from the Farm Security Act of 2002, providing grants, loans, and tax incentives to support renewable energy initiatives. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 established efficiency standards for consumer electronics. The Farm, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 extended renewable energy provisions, offering grants, loans, and tax incentives to support renewable energy initiatives. DOE's FY2009 budget requested $1.255 billion for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy programs. P.L. 110-329 provided additional funding for the Weatherization Assistance Program and a loan to help automakers produce energy-efficient vehicles. P.L. 110-343 included tax incentives for efficiency and renewables. The Senate responded to concerns about renewable energy provisions in the House-passed bill by enacting key provisions into law, including extensions for Renewable Electricity Production Tax Credit and Solar Investment Tax Credits. The law also authorized new rounds of state and local bond issuances for Clean Renewable Energy Bonds and Energy Conservation Bonds. The law authorizes a new state and local program with a total national value of $800 million for Energy Conservation Bonds. Revenue offsets include freezing certain oil and natural gas deductions, reducing foreign tax credits, and increasing the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund tax. Over 460 bills related to energy efficiency or renewable energy were introduced in the 110th Congress. The report categorizes bills by policy and issue areas, includes a table of recent actions, and discusses recent developments."
