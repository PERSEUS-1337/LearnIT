    "content": "Congress delayed action on the U.S.-Panama FTA for nearly four years due to various concerns. Changes were made to the FTA based on a bipartisan agreement in 2007, including enforceable commitments to labor rights, adherence to environmental agreements, provisions for pharmaceutical intellectual property rights, and clarification on investor-state issues. However, new issues arose that further delayed congressional action on the agreement. The U.S.-Panama FTA faced delays in Congress due to various concerns. Despite the inclusion of labor principles in the agreement, issues outside the scope of the FTA, such as the election of Pedro Miguel Gonz\u00e1lez Pinz\u00f3n as president of Panama's National Assembly, further hindered progress. Gonz\u00e1lez Pinz\u00f3n's alleged involvement in a 1992 murder of a U.S. serviceman raised concerns, but the issue was resolved when he declined to run for a second term in 2008. The 112th Congress raised concerns over specific labor statutes in Panama, including restrictions on striking, separate provisions for export processing zones, and limitations on union formation. These issues were addressed with legislation passed in April 2011. The Panamanian government did not act on the \"40/20 Issue\" due to lack of support from business, government, or labor constituencies. The United States has concerns over drug trafficking and money laundering through Panama, calling for greater tax transparency. Panama is on the OECD's \"Gray List\" for not implementing an internationally agreed tax standard. The GAO listed Panama as a \"tax haven\" or \"financial privacy jurisdiction.\" Panama was labeled as a \"tax haven\" by international organizations and was on the OECD's \"Gray List\" for lack of tax transparency. The US wanted Panama to sign a Tax Information and Exchange Agreement (TIEA) and implement tax agreements with other countries. Panama ratified the TIEA on April 13, 2011, allowing for tax information exchange with the US. Panama entered into double taxation agreements and a Tax Information and Exchange Agreement (TIEA) with the United States to address tax transparency issues and was removed from the OECD \"Gray List\" in 2011. The double taxation agreements aim to eliminate double national taxation and comply with the OECD international tax standard. Congressional action on the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Panama was part of a larger trade legislative agenda in the 112th Congress. In 2011, a compromise Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) bill was agreed upon by Congress to ensure bipartisan support. A legislative process was put in place to pass all implementing bills and the TAA legislation simultaneously. The House passed a bill to reauthorize the Generalized System of Preferences, which was amended by the Senate to include TAA reauthorization. The Senate amended the bill with TAA reauthorization and it was agreed to on September 22, 2011. The U.S.-Panama FTA implementing bill was signed into law on October 21, 2012, and entered into force on October 31, 2012. The United States and Panama have a long history of agreements regarding the Panama Canal, which has been a crucial factor in Panamanian domestic and foreign affairs. The Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between the two countries, in force since October 31, 2012, is significant due to Panama's economy being closely tied to the canal's operations. Panama's strategic geographic location as a crossroads between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans has made it a key hub for commerce since the 16th century. Panama's strategic position as a key hub for commerce has been influenced by foreign interests, particularly the United States. Panama gained independence from Spain in 1821 and became part of the Gran Colombia regional group. The United States displaced Britain as the dominant foreign influence and completed a cross-isthmian railroad in 1855, leading to armed interventions in Panama in the 19th century. The United States used military force to defend its interests in Panama, leading to the construction of a canal. After Colombia rejected a treaty, the U.S. supported Panama's secession in 1903. Panama became independent, signing a treaty giving the U.S. control of the canal in perpetuity. The Panama Canal was opened in 1914, giving the United States control of the canal \"in perpetuity.\" This led to U.S. dominance in Panama's economic and political life, causing resentment and periodic tensions over sovereignty. The canal was ceded back to Panama in 1977 under the Panama Canal Treaties. Tensions rose again in 1989 when the U.S. military invaded Panama to arrest General Manuel Noriega. The return of the Panama Canal to Panamanian control in 1977 proved to be a catalyst for the country's democracy and trade liberalization. The canal, which accounts for approximately 6% of Panama's GDP, plays a crucial role in global trade, especially along the U.S. East Coast-to-Asia route. Privatization and modernization of the major ports at each end of the canal have further boosted Panama's economy, supporting various industries and creating jobs. Panama has undertaken a $5.25 billion expansion of the canal to accommodate larger ships, which passed a national referendum in 2006. The privatization of former U.S. government facilities has benefited the Panamanian economy, including refurbishing the railroad and developing a foreign processing zone. The Panama-Pacific Special Economic Area (PPSEA) is a public-private partnership aiming to convert the former Howard Air Force Base into a \"world class business center\" with a focus on the export sector. The project offers fiscal incentives, regulatory streamlining, and requires businesses to adhere to international environment and labor standards. With assistance from the International Finance Corporation (IFC) of the World Bank, Panama is relying on global financing to cover initial investment needs for various businesses. The Panama-Pacific Special Economic Area (PPSEA) project aims to develop various businesses including computer technology, cell phone manufacturing, international call centers, and aeronautical industry support. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) supports the project for its forward-looking approach and not relying on the \"maquiladora\" business model. Panama's economy is defined by the canal and ties with the United States, hindering its participation in regional integration. Panama has declined to join the Central American Common Market, relying on the canal and the U.S. economy as economic anchors. Panama's economy is heavily reliant on the canal and its ties with the United States. The country has a fully dollarized monetary system and benefits from U.S. trade preferences. Panama's historical circumstances have limited its incentive to become a more open economy, but joining the WTO in 1997 led to a reduction in tariff rates in preparation for a Free Trade Agreement with the U.S. This agreement would support long-established commercial interests and deepen bilateral relations. The Panama Canal's importance for the United States as a strategic trade passage is reinforced by its locale and potential for expansion. A bilateral Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Panama aligns with the Bush Administration's trade strategy of \"competitive liberalization\" and aims to boost economic and political ties. This FTA is part of a multi-tiered negotiation approach due to slow progress in other trade agreements. The Panama FTA is part of the US trade strategy, but some question its bilateral approach due to asymmetrical negotiation power. For Panama, the FTA supports trade policy goals and foreign direct investment, with concerns about balancing openness for services, export growth for manufacturing, and competitiveness in agriculture. Panama, with a population of 3.5 million, has a stable economy that grew by 10.5% in 2011. Despite high per capita income, poverty and unemployment are persistent issues. Inflation rose in 2007-2008 but decreased in subsequent years. 77% of Panama's GDP is in services, particularly in transportation and commerce. Panama's economy relies heavily on services, with 77% of GDP coming from this sector, driven by transportation and commerce. Industry contributes 17% to GDP, while agriculture contributes 6%. The country faces a significant merchandise trade deficit, exporting less than it imports. This imbalance has been exacerbated by factors such as declining terms of trade and a surge in oil and construction machinery imports. Panama's trade policy focuses on increasing exports to drive economic growth, with a strong emphasis on the services sector. The country has historically maintained a large services trade surplus, balancing out merchandise deficits. However, since 2010, Panama has experienced larger merchandise trade deficits due to high energy and food prices and the acceleration of canal expansion. The government sees opportunities in the Panama Pacific Special Economic Area, Col\u00f3n Free Zone, and nontraditional agricultural products to boost exports. Panama's trade policy focuses on increasing exports, with a focus on the services sector. The country has ratified FTAs with various countries and is in negotiations with others. The United States was Panama's largest export market in 2011, but Canada and Asia have seen significant growth in recent years. This shift in export shares reflects a decline in the value of exports to the US. The shift in Panama's export shares has seen a decline in fish exports to the United States and increases in commodity exports to Canada, China, and Taiwan. High commodity prices, especially gold, have driven this change. Latin American countries are Panama's second-largest trading partner, while the United States remains the largest import supplier. The Colon Free Zone plays a significant role in Panama's imports, with petroleum products also being a key import category. Panama's imports include petroleum products from the Oil Import Zone (OIZ) and significant quantities of oil from Trinidad and Tobago. The country has a trade surplus with the United States and a deficit with Latin America. The Col\u00f3n Free Zone (CFZ) is a key feature of Panama's trade regime. Trade with Asia shows modest growth in imports. The Col\u00f3n Free Zone (CFZ) in Panama is the largest duty free zone in the world, serving as a hub for trade between Latin America, Asia, and the United States. It offers a variety of goods such as electronics, clothing, and jewelry, allowing buyers to make wholesale purchases without incurring taxes. The CFZ benefits from Panama's strategic location, modern infrastructure, and central position in the Americas. The Col\u00f3n Free Zone (CFZ) in Panama is the largest duty free zone globally, facilitating trade between Latin America, Asia, and the United States. Buyers enjoy purchasing luxury goods in small lots with reduced travel costs and improved shipping times. Sellers benefit from reaching smaller Latin American markets, while Panama gains from the 20,000 direct jobs and public revenue generated by the CFZ. However, the CFZ is linked to illicit activities like money laundering and illegal transshipment, tarnishing Panama's reputation. The Col\u00f3n Free Zone in Panama, the largest duty free zone globally, facilitates trade between Latin America, Asia, and the United States. Despite its benefits, the CFZ is associated with illicit activities like money laundering and illegal transshipment, tarnishing Panama's reputation. To counter this, the CFZ has strict regulations and monitoring systems in place to prevent illicit activities. U.S.-Panamanian merchandise trade is relatively small. In 2011, the United States had a trade surplus of $7,863.4 million with Panama, with major exports including oil, aircraft, machinery, pharmaceuticals, and motor vehicles. Panama is a small export market for the U.S., with imports mainly consisting of seafood and repaired goods. Precious metals, fruit, sugar, and coffee make up a third of total U.S. imports from Panama. Panama's agricultural exports, particularly sugar, posed negotiation challenges. Panama has no formal restrictions on capital flows and maintains bilateral investment treaties with the United States and European countries. Critics mention cumbersome legal environment, high labor costs, and inflexible labor laws as potential obstacles to U.S. foreign direct investment. U.S. companies are well represented in Panama, including a large container port facility, financial institutions, transportation firms, and manufacturing facilities. Panama seeks closer ties with the United States for increased foreign direct investment (FDI). U.S. FDI in Panama is significant, representing over a third of total FDI in the country. The widening of the Panama Canal presents opportunities for $5 billion in investment, with a significant U.S. presence in various sectors of the economy. Panama approached the United States for a stand-alone Free Trade Agreement (FTA) to boost economic ties. Panama sought a separate Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the United States to enhance economic relations, emphasizing the historical and strategic ties between the two countries. The negotiations were distinct from the U.S.-Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) and focused on Panama's service economy, limited integration with Central American economies, and unique considerations regarding the Panama Canal Area. The FTA was finalized in 10 rounds of negotiation, concluding on December 16, 2006, and followed the framework of earlier FTAs. The Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between the United States and Panama was signed on June 28, 2007, after last-minute changes to accommodate new commitments. Market access provisions reflect both countries' interests. The United States International Trade Commission (USITC) conducts an economic assessment of the FTA's impact on the U.S. economy, using general equilibrium and partial equilibrium models. In Panama's case, insufficient data prevented a meaningful estimate from a general equilibrium model. The USITC concluded that the FTA with Panama would have a minimal overall effect on the U.S. economy due to Panama's small economy relative to the United States. The main impact would be an increase in U.S. exports, with little growth in imports from Panama. This is consistent with expectations based on the small amount of goods imported from Panama and the existing duty-free access for most imports from Panama. The USITC concluded that the FTA with Panama would have minimal overall effect on the U.S. economy due to Panama's small economy. The main impact would be an increase in U.S. exports, with little growth in imports from Panama. Detailed estimates suggest that U.S. exports of rice, pork, beef, and passenger vehicles could potentially grow significantly. The gains for U.S. providers in services are expected to be small initially, but may increase with the Panama Canal expansion project. The U.S.-Panama Free Trade Agreement covers market access provisions, replacing previous trade preferences. Panamanian agricultural products, especially sugar, face high barriers to entry into the U.S. duty-free market. Panama imposes average tariffs of 7% on U.S. industrial and consumer goods, with peaks of 81% for certain items. Agricultural goods face an average tariff of 15%, reaching as high as 260% for specific products. Additionally, there is a 5% transfer tax on imports. The agreement includes national treatment for traded goods and outlines a schedule for the gradual elimination of customs duties. Most industrial and commercial goods have tariffs eliminated immediately, while the rest phase out over a 10-year period. Tariffs on U.S. farm exports phased out over 10 years, with some agricultural goods taking up to 17 years to be eliminated. Rules of origin determine duty-free eligibility based on content origin to prevent transshipment. The U.S. has a positive agricultural trade balance with Panama. The United States has a positive agricultural trade balance with Panama, capturing 51% of the Panamanian agricultural import market. Tariffs on U.S. agricultural products in Panama can reach as high as 260% for chicken leg quarters. Market access for pork, poultry, rice, and sugar was a challenging issue in the Free Trade Agreement negotiations. The focus was on tariff reduction, quota definitions, and sanitary and phytosanitary rules. Panama's position in the Free Trade Agreement negotiations was focused on limiting increases in U.S. exports of pork, poultry, and rice, while pressing to increase its sugar export quota. The U.S. sugar program aims to protect sugar beet, sugar cane, and sugar processing firms with below-prime-rate loans and tariff rate quotas. Panama plays a significant role in sugar production despite harvesting less than other Central American countries. Panama's sugar industry plays a significant role in the country's agricultural sector, with sugar exports constituting a third of total agricultural exports. The industry heavily relies on the U.S. market, with 76% of Panamanian sugar exports going to the U.S. Panama argued for an increase in their sugar export quota in bilateral FTAs, but faced resistance from the U.S. sugar industry. The WTO is the forum for addressing domestic support programs and TRQs in the agricultural sector, with pork, rice, and poultry being the most sensitive products for Panama. TRQs protect these products, with varying tariffs. The concern revolves around U.S. producers potentially selling dark meat cuts at low prices in foreign markets, impacting domestic producers in those countries. Panamanians argue that U.S. producers can afford to do so due to high profit margins on white meat. The cost accounting debate continues regarding U.S. producers selling dark meat below cost in the Panamanian market. Panama's rice industry is concerned about the impact of opening the market to U.S. subsidized rice, which could harm their industry. The FTA is expected to have the greatest impact on U.S. rice exports, with provisions not fully implemented until year 20. This could lead to rice growers shifting production to other crops or seeking alternative employment. Panama's agriculture sector represents 6% of GDP but 17% of employment, supporting 40% of the rural population living in poverty. Opening the sector too quickly to U.S. competition could lead to increased unemployment, poverty, and rural-urban migration. Panama seeks a slow transition to open markets and an increase in the sugar quota to boost employment. The FTA with the United States provides duty-free treatment for over half of U.S. farm exports to Panama, including high-quality beef, poultry products, soybeans, fresh fruits, and processed goods. Remaining tariffs will be phased out between years 7 and 17 of the FTA. Rice tariffs will remain in place until year 20. Panama will receive expanded quotas for rice and other products, with an additional 7,000 metric tons of sugar imports in the first year under a TRQ system. The FTA with the United States provides duty-free treatment for over half of U.S. farm exports to Panama, including high-quality beef, poultry products, soybeans, fresh fruits, and processed goods. Remaining tariffs will be phased out between years 7 and 17 of the FTA. Panama will receive expanded quotas for rice and other products, with an additional 7,000 metric tons of sugar imports in the first year under a TRQ system. The three-tiered TRQ system will grow by 1% per year, capped eventually for some types of sugar. Other protective measures for agriculture were negotiated, including TRQs, safeguards, and a sugar compensation mechanism. SPS standards were a challenging issue to resolve, with Panama's standards considered high and meeting or exceeding WTO standards. The USTR has raised concerns over procedural transparency regarding SPS standards. The USTR has concerns over Panama's procedural transparency with phytosanitary permits and inspection requirements for poultry, beef, and pork imports. The United States wanted Panama to recognize USDA certification for meat exports. Panama argued its SPS standards are among the highest globally and resisted changes to the SPS provisions during negotiations. The USTR had concerns over Panama's SPS provisions, but after Panamanian officials visited the US and found no sanitary threat, a bilateral agreement was signed in 2006. This agreement states that Panama accepts US sanitary, phytosanitary, and regulatory systems as equivalent to its own, leading to amendments in Panama's laws. Textiles and apparel remain challenging in market access negotiations with Panama. The FTA with Panama provides duty-free access for textile and apparel goods, with rules of origin requiring the use of fabric and yarn from Panama or the US. Safeguard measures protect US producers from sudden import volume increases. Customs cooperation is crucial to prevent illegal transshipment through Panama's duty-free zone. The FTA with Panama ensures duty-free access for textile and apparel goods, with rules of origin mandating the use of fabric and yarn from Panama or the US. Producers emphasize effective customs cooperation to combat illegal transshipment. Transparency in government contract bidding is a key concern, with improvements made in 2006 amendments to procurement laws. Panama has enhanced transparency in procurement regulations and established an administrative court for public contracting disputes. Panama has not yet joined the WTO Government Procurement Agreement. Panama has not acceded to the WTO Government Procurement Agreement, which the United States has encouraged. The government procurement chapter in the FTA emphasizes adherence to environmental and labor standards in the bidding process. It also allows for the promotion of conservation of natural resources and compliance with labor laws. Government procurement is crucial due to the Panama Canal expansion and potential long-term investments. The Panama Canal Authority operates independently and negotiated to maintain dispute settlement system within the FTA. Panama may set aside contracts for Panamanian firms for 12 years. The FTA addresses U.S. concerns over fair government procurement procedures. Subnational governments are not required to uphold the provisions but can voluntarily do so. Panama has a well-developed financial services industry and is a key regional financial center. U.S. firms heavily invest in Panama, and a permanent trade agreement could strengthen this relationship. Panama signed a bilateral investment treaty with the U.S. in 1991, which includes investor-state provisions. Concerns have been raised about investment in regulated industries, but the Panamanian government has been responsive. There is potential for significant foreign investment in Panama, including the canal expansion and reverted areas. The FTA text in Panama provides clear rules for foreign investments, including investor-state dispute settlement and compensation for expropriation. It allows investors to allege breaches in investment agreements. Investment treaties (BITs) and FTAs include investor-state rules for binding arbitration against states in case of investment breaches. U.S. investors seek recourse in countries with limited legal protection. NAFTA's investor-state provisions led to claims against U.S. state governments for \"indirect expropriation.\" Despite no successful claims, Congress addressed the issue. In response to concerns about investor-state disputes, the U.S.-Panama FTA includes provisions to ensure equal rights for foreign and U.S. investors. Annex 10-B states that regulatory actions for public welfare do not constitute indirect expropriation, with measures to eliminate frivolous suits. Annex 10-F reserves rights for disputes affecting the Panama Canal Authority. Despite no successful claims, Congress addressed the issue of investor-state arbitration. The U.S.-Panama FTA includes provisions to ensure equal rights for foreign and U.S. investors, with Annex 10-F reserving rights for disputes affecting the Panama Canal Authority. Services trade was negotiated in multiple chapters, covering financial services, shipping, telecommunications, professional services, and e-commerce in Panama's service-based economy. The U.S.-Panama FTA provides market access commitments in services exceeding the WTO GATS. Panama requires local licensing for professionals, with limited success in changing this. Panama was the first in Latin America to pass e-commerce legislation, recognizing electronic transactions and creating an oversight agency. The U.S. pushed for greater transparency in regulatory procedures, with services identified as a critical negotiating area. The U.S.-Panama FTA addressed market access in services, focusing on retail trade, express delivery, and financial services. Restrictions on investment in retail trade and access to contracts by the Panama Canal Authority were reduced. Greater access to professional services and transparency in licensing were clarified, benefiting U.S. firms in Panama's growing economy. Panama sought transparency in the U.S. financial services regulatory system for possible opening of Panamanian banks. The U.S.-Panama FTA addressed market access in services, focusing on retail trade, express delivery, and financial services. Panama sought transparency in the U.S. financial services regulatory system to help ease the possible opening of Panamanian banks in select U.S. states. Strengthening intellectual property rights (IPR) was a major U.S. priority, with a focus on harmonizing standards and securing Panama's commitment to join international agreements related to IPR protection. Contentious IPR issues included patent and data exclusivity related to pharmaceutical products and Internet piracy. Panama's IPR laws and institutional support have improved, with dedicated courts for IPR cases and updated patent and trademark laws. Panama also signed on to the WIPO Copyright Treaty and Performances. The 1994 copyright law in Panama improved protection and increased options to prosecute violators. The U.S. encourages Panama to adhere to additional IPR treaties as required in the FTA, with provisions exceeding those in the WTO. Trademark registration is better enforced through a transparent online process, and copyright provisions clarify the use of digital materials, including rights over temporary copies of works on computers. The U.S.-Panama FTA includes provisions on intellectual property rights (IPR) such as rights over temporary copies of works on computers, sole author rights for online availability, extended terms of protection for copyrighted materials, anti-circumvention provisions, requirements for legitimate computer software use, prohibition of unauthorized receipt or distribution of encrypted satellite signals, liability rules for Internet service providers, criminalization of end-user piracy, authorization for seizure and destruction of counterfeit goods, and statutory damages for abuse of copyrighted material. The U.S.-Panama FTA includes provisions on intellectual property rights, such as data exclusivity for patented drugs. Data exclusivity protects the data used to establish a drug's safety and effectiveness for five years, preventing regulatory agencies from using the data for generic versions until the period ends. This issue was raised during the CAFTA-DR debate and partially addressed in a side agreement. The U.S.-Panama FTA includes provisions on intellectual property rights, specifically data exclusivity for patented drugs. Critics wanted an explicit exception for compulsory licensing under WTO rules. Congressional input led to significant changes in the Panama text, allowing data exclusivity to begin when a drug is approved in the home country, not Panama, to speed up generic drug entry into Panama's market. The U.S.-Panama FTA includes provisions on intellectual property rights, specifically data exclusivity for patented drugs. The agreement aims to expedite the entry of generic drugs into Panama's market by encouraging quick approval processes. Countries must approve within a six-month rule to benefit from it, and there are provisions for waivers in cases of public health emergencies. The U.S.-Panama FTA includes provisions on intellectual property rights, such as data exclusivity for patented drugs. Waivers are allowed for public health emergencies. Patent term restoration and patent linkage are also key issues addressed in the agreement. The Panama FTA includes provisions on intellectual property rights, allowing for patent linkage to be voluntary. Public health advocates seek to introduce lower-cost generic drugs in developing countries, while pharmaceutical companies argue against changes, citing high research costs. The U.S.-Panama FTA includes new standards for labor and environmental provisions, reflecting a bipartisan understanding. Some Members express reservations about the effectiveness of labor provisions and overall benefits of bilateral FTAs, leading to a debate reflecting economic and political perspectives. From an economic perspective, developing country firms may have a competitive advantage due to lower standards leading to lower costs and prices. Critics argue against trade agreements supporting poor working conditions and environmental degradation. Some studies suggest cost differentials are not the sole factor in business location decisions, with productivity being more important. Trade liberalization is seen as promoting social and economic development. Trade agreements can impact social and economic conditions in developing countries. Concerns include the loss of sovereignty and potential misuse for protectionism. The U.S.-Panama FTA faced objections over labor standards enforcement and dispute resolution mechanisms. Critics argued that the labor dispute mechanism in bilateral FTAs was inadequate and unenforceable, failing to reflect Congress's intent on labor negotiating objectives. The labor provisions were seen as a step backward in U.S. policy, lacking credible enforcement and meaning without a proper mechanism. A new bipartisan consensus emerged with the 110th congressional leadership, leading to significant changes in the model for bilateral FTA labor chapters. The principles of this change were incorporated into the labor chapters for U.S. bilateral FTAs with Panama, Peru, Colombia, and South Korea, emphasizing the adoption and maintenance of the five core ILO labor principles. The labor chapter in bilateral FTAs now includes commitments to enforce labor laws effectively, with recourse to trade sanctions for non-compliance. This change aligns with the adoption of core ILO labor principles in recent FTAs. The labor chapter in bilateral FTAs includes commitments to enforce labor laws effectively, with procedural guarantees of transparency and fairness. Panama has higher wage rates and stronger labor laws compared to other countries in the region. The business community argues that labor laws in Panama are too generous, leading to unintended consequences like extended use of temporary workers. The Labor Ministry in Panama oversees workers' rights, with laws guaranteeing basic principles. Employees have the right to organize, bargain collectively, and strike. Concerns include the use of temporary workers to bypass labor laws, minimum requirements to form a union, child labor in agriculture and domestic work, and lax enforcement of health and safety standards. Environmental specialists stress the need to achieve multiple goals in U.S. reciprocal FTAs, including protecting existing domestic environmental standards, ensuring trade rules do not undermine multilateral environmental agreements, promoting strong environmental initiatives, providing capacity-building assistance, and ensuring environmental provisions in FTAs have the same dispute resolution mechanisms as other aspects of the agreements. The focus is on identifying and addressing the environmental effects of trade, especially in developing countries with weak laws and enforcement mechanisms. Some environmental experts suggest that trade agreements have not caused catastrophic pollution or a \"race to the bottom\" in regulations. Success has been seen in addressing environmental issues through FTAs, side agreements, and technical assistance programs for developing countries. Advocates call for improvements in clarifying obligations, enforcing rules, and providing financial resources for technical assistance. Revisions made in 2007 reflect bipartisan efforts to recognize sovereign rights and enhance environmental provisions in FTAs. The revisions made in May 10, 2007, strengthen commitments to environmental obligations in trade agreements, requiring countries to adopt, maintain, and enforce laws to fulfill their obligations under selected multilateral environmental agreements. The new language emphasizes the promotion of conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity. The revisions made in May 10, 2007, strengthen commitments to environmental obligations in trade agreements, promoting conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity. Panama faces challenges in protecting its environment due to deforestation, land degradation, loss of wildlife, threats to water quality, and severe water use requirements from the Panama Canal. The USTR conducted an environmental review of the potential effects of the FTA on Panama's environment. The Panama Canal imposes significant water use requirements on the country, leading Panama to establish environmental standards and cooperate internationally. The environmental review suggests that the FTA's impact on environmental standards would be minimal for both the United States and Panama. While the FTA may have positive and negative effects, increased agricultural trade and production could lead to pollution, environmental degradation, and harm to wildlife. The FTA could have positive effects on environmental standards in Panama, with increased oversight and policies to address potential harm to wildlife from agricultural trade. The agreement includes a Committee on Trade Capacity Building to assist Panama in transitioning to freer trade with the United States, providing technical assistance and financing to minimize adjustment costs. The TCB Committee assists Panama in meeting FTA obligations by coordinating technical assistance from various agencies. Panama's national TCB strategy focuses on sectoral adjustment and supporting businesses to meet commitments under the FTA. The national TCB strategy in Panama aims to support micro, small, and medium-sized businesses, improve government capacity for trade activities, and enhance trade-related issues such as market access, rules of origin, and trade agreement administration. Successful implementation requires financial and technical resources. The USAID project in Panama supports the country's transition to open trade through two major initiatives: explaining the benefits of the FTA and assisting sectors like agro-industry, ICT, and artisan products to increase market share in the U.S. The USAID project in Panama supports sectors like agro-industry, ICT, and artisan products to benefit from the FTA through targeted strategies and assistance in trade fairs and building business contacts."
