    "content": "The decision to renew military commission proceedings against Khalid Sheik Mohammad and four others for their alleged involvement in the 9/11 attacks required a policy reversal by the Obama Administration, which initially planned to transfer the detainees to federal court in New York. Congressional funding restrictions prevented Guantanamo detainees from being transferred to the US for prosecution. The Obama Administration faced obstacles in transferring Guantanamo detainees to the US for prosecution due to Congressional funding restrictions. As a result, military commissions became the primary option for trying detainees, leading to charges being reintroduced against Khalid Sheik Mohammad and his co-defendants. In contrast, the Administration chose to bring charges in federal criminal court against terrorist suspects held at locations other than Guantanamo, as seen with the case of Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame in 2011. The Obama Administration faced obstacles in transferring Guantanamo detainees to the US for prosecution due to Congressional funding restrictions. Military commissions became the primary option for trying detainees, with charges reintroduced against Khalid Sheik Mohammad and his co-defendants. In contrast, federal criminal court charges were brought against terrorist suspects like Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame in 2011. Warsame was held on a U.S. naval vessel for two months for interrogation, sparking controversy over the choice of forum for trying accused terrorists. The Military Commissions Act of 2009 amended rules for military commissions to align with federal court procedures. This comparison chart follows the format of previous reports for easy reference. For further details on comparisons with previous rules and the Uniform Code of Military Justice, refer to specific CRS reports. President Obama issued an executive order in 2009 to close the Guantanamo detention facility within a year. A task force was established to review detainee cases for potential transfer, release, or prosecution. Military commissions were put on hold. During a review period, military commissions were halted, but some pretrial proceedings continued. One detainee, Ahmed Ghailani, was transferred to federal court in New York for trial and was convicted. President Obama's Detention Policy Task Force reaffirmed military commissions as appropriate for some cases, with federal court preferred for trials. Cases referred for prosecution are handled by a team of DOJ and DOD personnel. The report provided criteria for handling Guantanamo detainee cases, including factors like strength of interest, efficiency, and other prosecution considerations. It outlined principles for prosecution involving a team of DOJ and DOD personnel. Attorney General Holder announced the decision to transfer five \"9/11 conspirators\" to the Southern District of New York for trial, withdrawing charges previously brought before military commissions. The Guantanamo Task Force's final report recommended criminal investigations for 36 detainees, preventive detention for 48, and transfer of others to foreign countries. Plans to bring Khalid Sheik Mohammed and other detainees into the United States were discussed. Plans to bring Khalid Sheik Mohammed and other Guantanamo detainees into the United States faced controversy, leading to funding restrictions by Congress. Military commissions became the primary option for trying detainees due to the lack of civilian courts at Guantanamo. In 2011, the government resumed filing charges before military commissions, reversing the decision to bring Mohammed to trial in federal court. In 2012, charges were referred to a military commission against Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and others for their alleged involvement in the 9/11 attacks. The U.S. Court of Appeals reversed the conviction of Salim Hamdan, stating that the crime of material support for terrorism did not exist as a war crime at the time. The Court of Military Commissions Review vacated Hamdan's conviction, raising concerns about the military commission system. The government is appealing a different case, Al Bahlul v. United States, based on the precedent set by Hamdan II regarding convictions for terrorism-related charges before the Military Commissions Act of 2006. The government sought a rehearing en banc in the Bahlul case, which involves the trial of suspected terrorists under U.S. law, including federal criminal court or military commissions. The Military Commissions Act allows for trials of detainees accused of violating the law of war or committing specified offenses. The Military Commissions Act authorizes trials of alien \"unprivileged enemy belligerents\" either by military commissions or general court-martial. Critics question the constitutionality of military commissions despite recent amendments enhancing due process. Proponents argue that federal criminal courts may grant accused terrorists additional constitutional rights. The MCA does not limit military commissions' jurisdiction within the U.S., and the Supreme Court has upheld their use against \"enemy belligerents\" under procedural rules. The Supreme Court has not settled the question regarding the extent to which constitutional guarantees apply to aliens detained at Guantanamo, making any difference in rights due to location of the trials difficult to predict. Some view the unpredictability of the Supreme Court's acceptance of the military commission procedures as a factor in favor of using civilian trial courts. The Fifth Amendment to the Constitution provides that \"no person shall be ... deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\" Due process includes the opportunity to be heard whenever the government places any of these fundamental liberties at stake. The Constitution contains other explicit rights applicable to various stages of a criminal prosecution. Criminal proceedings provide both the opportunity to contest guilt and to challenge the government's conduct. The system of procedural rules in criminal proceedings safeguards against violations of constitutional rights that may occur outside the courtroom. The jurisdiction of different entities trying a crime can impact the procedural rights of the accused, and the type of judicial review available varies and can be crucial to the outcome. The type of judicial review varies and is crucial to the outcome. International law guarantees human rights, including rights of criminal defendants and prisoners. Treaties are part of US law but do not take precedence over statute. The law of war applies to cases from armed conflicts, but its application to non-state terrorists is unclear. Accused terrorist/war criminals' rights may depend on their status under the Geneva Conventions. Al Qaeda fighters are entitled to certain rights according to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has ruled that Al Qaeda fighters are entitled to protections under Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions, which includes fair trial rights. The federal judiciary, separate from the executive and legislative branches, interprets and applies federal criminal law enacted by Congress. The federal judiciary interprets and applies federal criminal law enacted by Congress, with procedural rules for criminal trials established by the Supreme Court. Federal courts have historical precedent for trying terrorism or war-related offenses, as authorized by the U.S. Constitution. The First Congress authorized punishment for piracy on the high seas, with offenders being sentenced to death. Federal courts have jurisdiction over piracy cases, including recent terrorism-related prosecutions such as the 1985 Achille Lauro hijacking. Federal courts have handled high-profile terrorism cases, including the trials of Sulaiman Abu Ghaith, a former Al Qaeda spokesman, and the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. The Department of Justice reported 403 terrorism-related convictions from 2001 to 2010, with around 60% charged under criminal code provisions. These trials serve as test cases for the effectiveness of civilian courts in prosecuting terrorism suspects. Around 60% of the 403 terrorism-related convictions from 2001 to 2010 were charged under criminal code provisions not directly related to terrorism, such as fraud, firearms offenses, and drug-related offenses. The remaining 40% were labeled as \"Category I Offenses\" by the Justice Department, including crimes like Aircraft Sabotage, Animal Enterprise Terrorism, and the use of Weapons of Mass Destruction. The curr_chunk lists various criminal offenses related to terrorism, including possession of biological weapons, nuclear threats, conspiracy to harm individuals or property, hostage taking, terrorist attacks on transportation systems, and providing support to terrorists. The curr_chunk lists criminal offenses related to terrorism, including providing material support to terrorists, financing terrorism, receiving military training from terrorist organizations, narco-terrorism, sabotage of nuclear facilities, aircraft piracy, and violations of international economic powers acts. The President has the authority to convene military commissions to try offenses against the law of war as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces. Military commissions are externally directed at the enemy to punish and deter offenses against the law of war, different from military courts-martial which focus on maintaining discipline within the troops. Military commissions are used during times of war to try offenses under the law of war. They have historically been used in cases of occupation or martial law. While they have been used to try U.S. citizens as enemy belligerents in the past, the Military Commissions Act now only allows aliens to be tried. The United States first used military commissions in 1847 during the occupation in Mexico and has made heavy use of them in conflicts like the Civil War and the Philippine Insurrection. President Bush's Military Order of 2001 established military commissions for alien terrorism suspects. Military commissions are not Article III courts and are not subject to the same rules. The Military Commissions Act authorizes the Secretary of Defense to establish regulations for military commissions. There have been eight convictions of Guantanamo detainees by military commissions, with some rulings being appealed. Comparison charts show differences between military commissions and federal criminal court procedures. Chart 2 compares procedural safeguards in the Military Commissions Act to those in federal criminal cases, following a format for easy comparison with international military tribunals and ad hoc tribunals. For a comparison with previous rules under President George W. Bush's Military Order, refer to CRS Report RL33688. The MCA 2006 rules are compared with those in the MCA 2009 and the UCMJ for courts martial. For more details, refer to CRS Report R41163."
