    "content": "The Act titled \"Intercity Passenger Rail Trust Fund Act of 1996\" establishes a trust fund for intercity passenger rail. 0.5 cents of general revenue from highway motor fuel taxes will be deposited into this fund. The Intercity Passenger Rail Trust Fund is created in the Treasury, funded by a 0.5 cent tax on each gallon of fuel. The fund is available to finance qualified expenses for intercity passenger rail. The Intercity Passenger Rail Trust Fund is funded by a fuel tax and available to finance qualified expenses for intercity passenger rail. Appropriation Acts allocate funds to the National Railroad Passenger Corporation and eligible States. Specific amounts are appropriated for fiscal years 1997 to 2001. In 2001, eligible States receive funds from the Intercity Passenger Rail Trust Fund based on their qualified expenses for the fiscal year or a percentage of the aggregate amounts appropriated to the fund. The Passenger Rail Trust Fund allocates funds to eligible States based on qualified expenses and the number of months the State was eligible in the previous fiscal year. If the allocated amount exceeds the previous year's amount, it is increased for the following year. Definitions include qualified expenses for obligations made between December 31, 1996, and October 1, 2001. The Passenger Rail Trust Fund allocates funds to eligible States for capital improvements in intercity rail service certified by the Secretary of Transportation. Eligible States are those that do not receive intercity passenger rail service from the National Railroad Passenger Corporation. The Secretary will determine and retain the necessary amount in the Intercity Passenger Rail Trust Fund by October 1, 2001, to pay outstanding qualified expenses. Any remaining amount will be transferred to the Treasury's general fund. A conforming amendment is made to the trust fund code. Sec. 9512 establishes the Intercity Passenger Rail Trust Fund, effective for taxes imposed after December 31, 1996. Additionally, the remainder of the general revenue portion of highway motor fuel excise tax revenues will be deposited into the Highway Trust Fund. The amendment to section 9503(b) of the Internal Revenue Code excludes certain taxes from being transferred to the Highway Trust Fund. This includes taxes imposed by sections 4041(d) and 4081, with exceptions for amounts appropriated to the Intercity Passenger Rail Trust Fund. Conforming amendments are made to section 40(e)(1) of the Code. The amendments made by this section modify various sections of the Internal Revenue Code related to the Highway Trust Fund. The changes include adjusting tax rates specified in section 4081(a)(2)(A) and repealing subsection (f) of section 9503. These amendments will apply to taxes imposed after December 31, 1996."
