    "content": "In response to concerns raised by Admiral Mike McConnell, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) was modernized through the enactment of the Protect America Act of 2007. Introduced in the Senate by Senator McConnell, the bill was amended and passed on August 5, 2007. The Protect America Act of 2007, introduced by Senator McConnell, was amended and passed by the Senate on August 5, 2007. The House later passed the bill, which was signed by the President. On January 29, 2008, a 15-day extension to the sunset for the Act was passed by both the House and the Senate. The Senate passed a 15-day extension to the sunset for the Protect America Act, allowing more time to consider and pass legislation to amend FISA. The President signed the measure into law on January 31, 2008. On February 13, 2008, the House rejected a 21-day extension. Bills have been introduced in the Senate to extend the sunset further. This report discusses the impact of P.L. 110-55 on FISA provisions. The new provisions in the law clarify that electronic surveillance does not include targeting individuals believed to be outside the United States. This amendment affects the definition of \"electronic surveillance\" under FISA, emphasizing the need for a warrant when intentionally targeting a known U.S. person within the country. The law requires a warrant for electronic surveillance of wire or radio communications in the United States when there is a reasonable expectation of privacy. The law requires a warrant for electronic surveillance in the United States when there is a reasonable expectation of privacy, excluding wire or radio communications. Some definitions of \"electronic surveillance\" under FISA may cover surveillance of communications abroad that transcend U.S. borders, potentially including foreign to foreign communications in limited circumstances. Prior to the passage of section 105A of P.L. 110-55, some interceptions directed at a person abroad covered by FISA may have required court authorization. Electronic surveillance under subsection 101(f)(2) covers acquisition of wire communications to or from a person in the United States without consent, regardless of the person's identity or intentional targeting. Section 105A of FISA does not impact electronic surveillance under subsection 101(f)(2) when intercepting communications within the United States. However, it may restrict surveillance between a person in the United States and parties outside the country. This could affect the definition of \"electronic surveillance\" in FISA. The restrictions in Section 105A of FISA apply to acquiring information other than from wire or radio communication, where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy and a warrant would be required for law enforcement purposes. This could potentially impact communications between parties in the United States, between a party in the United States and a party outside the United States, or between parties abroad. Section 105A of FISA restricts acquiring information without a warrant for law enforcement purposes, potentially affecting communications involving parties in the United States or abroad. Section 105B allows the Attorney General and DNI to authorize acquisition of foreign intelligence information for up to one year if certain criteria are met. The acquisition of foreign intelligence information under this section involves persons believed to be outside the US, does not constitute electronic surveillance, and includes obtaining information from communications service providers. The purpose is to obtain foreign intelligence information, and minimization procedures must be in place. The procedures for acquisition activity must meet minimization criteria, certified by the Attorney General and DNI under oath. In urgent cases, certification must be provided within 72 hours. Specific locations need not be identified in the certification. The certification made under section 105B(a) must be transmitted to the FISC under seal and maintained securely. Acquisitions under section 105B of FISA must comply with the certification and minimization procedures. If a certification is not prepared in time, the acquisition must follow oral instructions from the DNI and Attorney General. Reports on compliance must be submitted to the House Permanent Select Committee. The DNI and Attorney General may issue a directive to a person for immediate assistance in authorized acquisitions under FISA. The person must maintain records under approved security procedures. P.L. 110-55 prohibits legal action against individuals providing information. P.L. 110-55 prohibits legal action against individuals for providing assistance under FISA directives. The FISC can compel compliance with directives and individuals can challenge their legality through the FISC petition review pool. The FISC judge has 72 hours to review a petition challenging a directive, if not found frivolous. If the directive is deemed unlawful, it can be modified or set aside. Otherwise, it must be affirmed and complied with. Any unchanged directive remains in effect. Within seven days, a review can be requested from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review. The Court of Review must provide a written statement on the record of the reasons for its decision. Judicial proceedings under this section are to be concluded as expeditiously as possible. All petitions are filed under seal and may contain classified information reviewed ex parte and in camera. The record of all proceedings must be maintained under security measures. Section 105B of FISA, added to title I, deals with acquisitions not considered electronic surveillance. It allows for the acquisition of foreign intelligence information from persons believed to be outside the U.S., including those within the country. Similar to electronic surveillance under section 102, it can be authorized by the President for up to one year without a court order if certified by the Attorney General. Section 105B of FISA allows for acquisitions of foreign intelligence information without a court order if certified by the DNI and Attorney General. It does not have the same requirements as section 102(a)(1)(B) regarding acquiring the contents of communications involving U.S. persons. Compliance with certification and minimization requirements is mandated, with the Attorney General reporting to intelligence committees. The House and Senate intelligence committees can direct communication carriers to provide assistance for electronic surveillance under FISA. The Attorney General and DNI can also direct individuals to provide aid, with the option to challenge the directive's legality before the FISC. The new section 105C of FISA creates a review process for directives issued by the House and Senate intelligence committees or the Attorney General and DNI, allowing for challenges to the legality of the directive before a court. Unlike electronic surveillance under FISA sections 104 and 105, the government does not provide substantive information about the acquisitions themselves to the court for review. Section 3 of the act establishes a review process for determining if foreign intelligence acquisitions outside the US constitute electronic surveillance. The Attorney General must submit procedures to the FISC within 120 days, to be updated annually. The FISC must assess the government's determination within 180 days to ensure compliance with the act. The FISC review process for determining if foreign intelligence acquisitions outside the US constitute electronic surveillance includes a procedure where the court must approve continued use of procedures deemed not clearly erroneous by the government. If the government's determination is found to be clearly erroneous, new procedures must be submitted within 30 days. Any FISC order issued under this process can be appealed to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review, and potentially to the U.S. Supreme Court. The review process under section 105C is unique to FISA and allows acquisitions to continue during the review. The Terrorist Surveillance Program involves intercepts of communications where one party is outside the US and has ties to al Qaeda. The Attorney General stated that electronic surveillances under the program would now be supervised by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court based on classified orders. A Judge authorized the Government to target international communications involving al Qaeda members. Electronic surveillance under the Terrorist Surveillance Program will now be overseen by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. The interpretation of \"electronic surveillance\" under FISA may impact the FISC's jurisdiction over interceptions. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court will designate 11 district court judges to hear applications for electronic surveillance in the US, with at least 3 residing near Washington, DC. The President must authorize the Attorney General to approve applications for court orders under FISA. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court can approve electronic surveillance of a foreign power or agent for foreign intelligence, but not if it solely targets a US person's communications. Jurisdiction depends on whether the surveillance is directed at someone outside the US. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court's jurisdiction is limited when it comes to authorizing electronic surveillance that involves US persons. The court's review is restricted to general procedures for determining if acquisitions constitute electronic surveillance, with challenges to directives for aid being considered by judges. The impact of narrowing the definition of electronic surveillance under FISA is also questioned. The interpretation of the definition of \"electronic surveillance\" under FISA could affect the scope of \"acquisitions\" under new section 105B of FISA. If interceptions of communications directed towards individuals outside the US are not considered electronic surveillance, they may be deemed \"acquisitions\" under section 105B. This would require authorization by the DNI and Attorney General, along with meeting specific criteria including minimization procedures. The new section 105A may reduce judicial review for interceptions of communications involving U.S. persons within the country without a court order, contrasting with the detailed process required for electronic surveillance under section 104 of FISA. This could impact the level of oversight previously provided by the FISC. The interpretation of the definition of \"electronic surveillance\" in new section 105A of FISA may eliminate concerns about its impact. Section 105B's statutory structure for acquisitions is similar to electronic surveillance under section 102 of FISA, allowing the President to authorize surveillance without a court order under certain conditions. The Attorney General must certify that surveillance will not acquire communication contents involving a US person, and must comply with minimization procedures. FISA denies jurisdiction for surveillance solely targeting foreign powers' communications or technical intelligence. Section 105B of FISA does not grant the FISC jurisdiction over acquisitions involving communications of a US person. Concerns regarding the impact of new section 105A on electronic surveillance may be alleviated if the interpretation aligns with prior practices. The exclusion of certain interceptions from the definition of electronic surveillance raises questions about potential violations of the prohibition against intentional interception of communications. The intentional interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications is generally prohibited under Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. However, electronic surveillance, as defined in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, is an exception to this rule. Violations of this prohibition would also extend to the intentional use or disclosure of intercepted communications. The Attorney General is required to report semi-annually to specific committees on such acquisitions. The Judiciary Committee and the House Judiciary Committee are to receive semi-annual reports on acquisitions under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The reports must detail incidents of non-compliance with directives issued by the DNI and the Attorney General, including noncompliance with guidelines for determining foreign intelligence acquisition. Additionally, the reports must include the number of certifications and directives issued during the reporting period. Technical amendments are made to reflect the jurisdiction of the FISC petition review pool over petitions. The amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) reflect the jurisdiction of the FISC petition review pool over challenges to directives and production orders. The amendments also include conforming changes to the table of contents of FISA. The effective date of the amendments is immediate after enactment, with existing FISA orders remaining in effect. The amendments to FISA grant the FISC jurisdiction over challenges to directives and production orders. Existing FISA orders remain in effect until expiration, with the option for reauthorization if justified. New applications can also be filed under FISA as long as they meet the requirements of the law prior to the amendments. The FISC has jurisdiction over challenges to directives and production orders under the amendments to FISA. Existing orders remain valid until expiration, with the option for reauthorization if necessary. New applications can be submitted under FISA, meeting pre-amendment law requirements. Additionally, under P.L. 110-55, authorizations for acquisition of foreign intelligence information remain in effect until expiration, governed by applicable FISA amendments. The House and Senate passed H.R. 5104 to extend the sunset for the Protect America Act, signed into law as P.L. 110-182. A bill to further extend the sunset was rejected, with new bills introduced in the Senate for various extensions. The President has indicated opposition to further extensions. The President has indicated opposition to further extensions of the sunset provision (S. 2557)."
