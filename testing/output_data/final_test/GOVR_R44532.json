    "content": "The Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA; H.R. 5278) establishes an Oversight Board with broad powers over Puerto Rico's fiscal affairs and debt adjustment procedures. It also expedites approvals for key projects in Puerto Rico. The current version of PROMESA differs from the previous version in the structure, appointment process for the board, and specified powers. The board's powers and appointment process were modified in H.R. 5278 compared to H.R. 4900. Changes included requiring all members to be appointed before major actions could be taken, empowering the board to investigate bond sales, and allowing the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court to appoint judges for debt adjustment cases. The Title VI collective action procedures and Title III debt adjustment process were modified in H.R. 5278. Changes included dropping a provision for transferring parts of Vieques Island to Commonwealth control, adjusting the time limit on a training wage provision, adding a provision to bar inter-debtor transactions violating applicable law, and including provisions to study fiscal issues in federal territories. Mandates for reports on economic growth in Puerto Rico and small business programs were also added. Title VII, added during the House Natural Resources Committee markup, emphasizes the need for permanent fiscal reforms in Puerto Rico's economic crisis. Representative Bishop's amendment made technical corrections, accelerated Oversight Board appointments, modified funding, treatment of creditors, and empowered the Board to rescind laws enacted by the Puerto Rico government. The board members were appointed, allowing them to rescind the Puerto Rico Emergency Moratorium and Financial Rehabilitation Act. Amendments emphasized the preservation of federally funded transportation assets and required regular reports on debt levels. The Oversight Board established by H.R. 5278 would be part of the federal budget, with estimated costs of $370 million. The territory's government must designate a dedicated funding source. Title I of PROMESA establishes a Financial Management and Oversight Board with broad fiscal powers, consisting of seven voting members and the Puerto Rico governor as a non-voting member. The President appoints one member, while Congressional leaders submit candidate lists for selection. Title II charges the Oversight Board with specific responsibilities. The Oversight Board established by PROMESA has powers to approve fiscal plans, budgets, agreements with bondholders, debt restructuring plans, and critical projects. It is similar to the DC Control Board but differs in structure and responsibilities. Title III of PROMESA sets up a debt adjustment process for territorial governments or their instrumentalities. The Oversight Board under PROMESA has the authority to approve fiscal plans, budgets, agreements with bondholders, and debt restructuring plans. H.R. 5278 outlines a restructuring process where the Oversight Board would take the place of the debtor government in adjusting debts. The process aims to ensure fair treatment of creditors, with potential study of underfunded pension systems. Title VI introduces a process for creditor collective actions. Title VI of H.R. 5278 introduces a process for creditor collective actions, similar to collective actions clauses (CACs) in sovereign debt contracts. The Oversight Board would set up voting pools for the CAC process, with separate pools based on bondholder priority or security arrangements. A two-thirds vote by value of eligible debt, with at least half of eligible debt holders participating, would trigger the Title VI CAC provision for a voting pool. Creditors not agreeing to a modification agreement would retain certain rights, potentially affected by a subsequent Title III debt restructuring. Title IV of PROMESA affirms Puerto Rico's right to determine its political status and includes provisions for reducing the minimum wage for workers under 25 with board approval. It also includes an automatic stay on litigation. H.R. 5278 lacks a provision for transferring parts of Vieques Island to Commonwealth control. Title V expedites infrastructure project reviews and permits, appointing a Revitalization Coordinator to oversee the process. The Revitalization Coordinator, appointed under H.R. 5278, would oversee the selection and review of Critical Projects in Puerto Rico, with a new provision for a public comment period. Previous difficulties in completing infrastructure projects and lack of environmental evaluations have been noted. H.R. 5278, also known as PROMESA, establishes the Oversight Board and contains seven titles. The bill known as PROMESA, or H.R. 5278, establishes an Oversight Board with seven titles. Title III applies to cases initiated after enactment, while Title IV applies to debts, claims, and liens created before or after that date. A severability clause ensures that if any provision is invalid, the rest of the bill remains intact, except for Titles I and II being inseparable from Title III. Title III of the PROMESA bill is not severable from Titles I or II. If a provision is found invalid for not treating territories uniformly, the court can extend it to other territories with a resolution from their legislature. The bill's provisions override any conflicting territorial or state laws. Section 5 provides definitions, and Section 6 specifies where the bill language should be placed in the United States Code. Title I of the PROMESA bill establishes a Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico and allows for similar boards in other territories with enabling legislation. Section 6 specifies the placement of the bill language in the United States Code, while Section 7 ensures compliance with federal laws and requirements in territories. The PROMESA bill establishes a Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico and other territories. The oversight board would have the power to designate territorial instrumentalities subject to its provisions. The governor would be required to include the budget of any covered territorial instrumentality at the discretion of the Oversight Board. The bill establishes a Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico and other territories, giving it the power to designate territorial instrumentalities subject to its provisions. The governor must include the budget of covered territorial instrumentalities in the Territory Budget, with monthly and quarterly reports required. The Oversight Board can require separate budgets and fiscal plans for instrumentalities not subject to legislative approval. The bill establishes a Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico and other territories, with the power to designate instrumentalities not subject to legislative approval. The Board members serve concurrent three-year terms and are selected by the President from recommendations submitted by House and Senate leadership. Senate confirmation is required for nominees not on the lists provided. The President selects individuals for the Financial Oversight and Management Board from lists submitted by Senate and House leaders. If appointments are not made by September 1, 2016, the President must choose nominees from appropriate lists by September 15, 2016. The governor of the territory or designee serves as an eighth non-voting member. The governor of the territory or his designee serves as an eighth non-voting member of the Oversight Board. The appointed members can conduct business in executive session, select a chair from among the voting members, and develop their own bylaws. Members serve without compensation but may be reimbursed for expenses. The President can only remove a member for cause. The Oversight Board may hire professionals to assist in its responsibilities under the bill. Adopted bylaws, rules, and procedures must be submitted to various government bodies as public documents. An affirmative vote of the majority of the members is required to approve fiscal plans, budgets, legislative acts, or infrastructure projects. The President must appoint individuals with expertise in finance, law, or government operations, who are not candidates for office. The Oversight Board, composed of professionals in finance, law, or government operations, must not be candidates for elected office or government employees. The board can include the governor or his designee as a nonvoting member. It is required to have offices in the territory and can request additional offices as needed. The bill allows the Oversight Board to request the use of federal agency facilities and hire an Executive Director. The ED can set salaries for additional staff but cannot be paid more than the ED. The bill also specifies the position of Revitalization Coordinator to be hired by the governor based on nominations from the Oversight Board. The bill grants the Oversight Board the power to hire staff, exempting them from procurement laws. They can hold hearings, obtain information, accept gifts, issue subpoenas, request support services from GSA, and enforce laws prohibiting public sector employees from striking. The bill grants the Oversight Board the power to investigate Puerto Rico government bonds sold to small investors, obtain creditor information for debt restructuring negotiations, and certify debt restructuring agreements for sustainability and compliance with Fiscal Plans. Title I of the bill includes provisions for penalties for providing false information to the Oversight Board, with fines and possible imprisonment. It also mandates reporting of violations by government officials to the Board and shields the Board from liability claims. Section 106 of the bill mandates legal actions against the Oversight Board to be brought before specific U.S. District Courts, providing expedited judicial review and prohibiting court orders from taking effect during pending challenges, except for constitutional violations. Oversight Board certifications of debt restructuring agreements are exempt from judicial challenges. The bill mandates the Oversight Board to submit an annual budget to various entities and allows it to ensure funding for its operations. Puerto Rico must designate a funding source within 30 days of the bill's enactment, which would not be subject to subsequent legislative appropriations. Unlike the District of Columbia control board, there are no target dates for submission. H.R. 5278 establishes an Oversight Board for Puerto Rico with exclusive control over its annual budget. The bill prohibits interference from the governor or legislature and imposes federal conflict of interest laws on board members. It is unclear if these provisions apply to the board. The Ethics in Government Act of 1978 would not apply to an oversight board for Puerto Rico as it is not a federal agency. The Oversight Board has the responsibility to develop, submit, approve, and certify fiscal plans for the territory. The fiscal plan must cover a minimum of five fiscal years and focus on improving Puerto Rico's financial situation. The bill outlines the requirements for a fiscal plan for Puerto Rico, which must cover a minimum of five fiscal years and focus on improving access to capital markets. It details three ways a fiscal plan can be certified as compliant, including submission by the governor and approval by the Oversight Board, or development and approval by the Oversight Board. If deficiencies are found, the Oversight Board can issue a \"notice of violation\" with recommendations for correction. The bill allows the Oversight Board and Governor of Puerto Rico to collaboratively develop a consensus fiscal plan, with the Board having the discretion to determine the number of fiscal years to be covered. If deficiencies are not addressed within the specified timeframe, the Board can submit a fiscal plan for approval by the governor and legislature. The Oversight Board, at its discretion, determines the fiscal years covered by the budget submission. It submits revenue estimates to the Governor and legislature for budget development. The bill outlines approval processes for compliant and non-compliant budgets. The bill outlines procedures for Oversight Board involvement in budget development, including submitting revenue estimates and issuing notices of violation for non-compliant budgets. If the governor or legislature fails to submit a compliant budget, the Oversight Board can develop and submit a revised budget. The bill allows the Oversight Board, Governor, and Legislature to collaboratively develop a consensus budget for the territory. If the Governor and Legislature fail to approve a compliant budget, the Oversight Board can develop and submit a budget that would be deemed approved. Only the Governor can submit a proposed budget for a territorial instrumentality. The bill allows the Oversight Board, Governor, and Legislature to work together on a consensus budget for the territorial government. It requires the Governor to submit quarterly financial reports to the Oversight Board to address inconsistencies in projected and actual revenues and expenditures. Failure to take corrective action could result in the territorial government being required to make changes. The Oversight Board can notify House and Senate committees if the territorial government fails to take corrective action. The Board has the power to direct corrective action and take remedial actions if necessary, such as reducing expenditures and implementing hiring freezes. Additionally, the Board can review proposed legislation and enacted laws for consistency with the budget and fiscal plan. The Oversight Board has the power to review contracts and rules for compliance with the approved fiscal plan, take necessary actions to ensure compliance, and prevent the transfer of funds or assets outside the normal course of business. The Oversight Board has the power to review contracts and rules for compliance with the approved fiscal plan, take necessary actions to ensure compliance, and prevent the transfer of funds or assets outside the normal course of business. During the interim period between the enactment of the bill and the appointment of all Oversight Board members, any action authorizing the movement of assets may be subject to review and reversal by the Oversight Board. The Board can submit recommendations to improve service delivery, ensure fiscal plan compliance, and promote financial stability and economic growth. If the territorial government rejects the management reform recommendations of the Oversight Board, they must explain why. The Oversight Board would review and approve debt restructuring agreements, with at least five out of six members' approval required. The government of Puerto Rico cannot issue or guarantee debt without Oversight Board approval. The Board cannot borrow on behalf of the Puerto Rico government. The Puerto Rico Legislature has the authority to contract debts as per the Constitution. The Oversight Board must submit annual reports on progress, assistance, and recommendations. The Governor must report existing tax abatement agreements. Quarterly reports on cash flows for debt service are required. The Oversight Board will terminate when the territorial government has access to necessary resources. The Oversight Board will terminate when the territorial government has access to credit markets and achieves balanced budgets for four consecutive years. The U.S. government is not responsible for any territorial government obligations, and federal funds cannot be used for territorial liabilities. The Oversight Board must analyze underfunded pension systems. The Oversight Board will analyze underfunded pension systems to determine their sustainability and funding sources over 30 years. An independent actuary will conduct the analysis, which includes reviewing benefit obligations, funding strategies, legal structure, and operational arrangements. The Board will also determine an appropriate discount rate for measuring future benefit obligations. Additionally, the Board may intervene in litigation against the territorial government, but this is not intended to provide an independent basis for injunctive relief. Title III of PROMESA includes provisions for debt adjustment similar to chapters 9 and 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. It allows for a plan proposed by the debtor, voted on by creditors, and confirmed by the court. The process involves making sections of the Bankruptcy Code applicable to debt adjustment under PROMESA. Title III of PROMESA allows for debt adjustment similar to chapters 9 and 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. The Bankruptcy Code sections applicable to Title III are listed in Appendix B. A territory or its instrumentalities must have an Oversight Board established under PROMESA to be eligible as a debtor. Section 303, similar to Section 903 of the Bankruptcy Code, ensures that Title III does not impair the territory's power to control itself or its instrumentalities. The bill's third subsection would preempt any \"unlawful executive orders\" altering the rights of creditors holding debt of the territory or territorial instrumentality. A voluntary case would begin when the Oversight Board filed a petition with the district court. The court may dismiss a petition after notice. The bill's third subsection would preempt any \"unlawful executive orders\" altering the rights of creditors holding debt of the territory or territorial instrumentality. A voluntary case would begin when the Oversight Board filed a petition with the appropriate district court. The court may dismiss a petition, after notice and hearing, to which an objection has been filed. However, such dismissal cannot occur during the first 120 days after the petition has been filed. The commencement of the case would constitute an order for relief. An appeal from an order of relief would not authorize a court to delay any proceeding in the case nor to order a stay of the proceeding pending the appeal. Any debt incurred that was authorized by the court would remain valid even after a reversal on appeal. This section would provide for joint filing of both petitions and plans as well as joint administration of affiliated cases when those cases are filed separately. Additionally, the section clarifies that PROMESA cannot be construed to permit discharge of various obligations arising under federal laws, including those related to the environment and public health or safety as well as to territorial laws enforcing federal. The section clarifies that nothing in Section 304 would prevent claim holders from voting on or consenting to a proposed modification of their claim under title VI of PROMESA. The court would not interfere with the debtor's political or governmental powers, property, revenues, or income-producing property unless allowed by the Oversight Board. District courts would have jurisdiction over cases under Title III, except as provided in paragraph (2) for civil proceedings related to these cases. The section clarifies that district courts would have exclusive jurisdiction over civil proceedings related to cases under Title III, with venue determined by the location of the territory or territorial instrumentality. If necessary for proper case management, venue could be outside the territory where the Oversight Board has an office. The Oversight Board would be the only party allowed to file a plan of adjustment in cases under Title III, with district courts having exclusive jurisdiction over related civil proceedings. Leases subject to termination for failure to pay rent would not be treated as executory contracts. The Oversight Board is the only party allowed to file a plan of adjustment after certification. The court sets the deadline for filing the plan if not done with the petition. Section 313 outlines plan modification conditions, similar to Section 943 of the Bankruptcy Code. Special taxpayers can object to the plan confirmation, but it must comply with the Bankruptcy Code and PROMESA provisions for court confirmation. Priority claim holders must receive full payment unless agreed otherwise. The plan of adjustment must meet certain conditions for approval, including full payment to priority claim holders unless agreed otherwise, obtaining necessary approvals, feasibility, being in the best interests of creditors, consistency with the Fiscal Plan certified by the Oversight Board, and disclosure of all amounts owed. The court must also consider if other remedies could provide greater recovery for creditors. The Oversight Board would represent the debtor in a Title III proceeding, taking necessary actions on behalf of the debtor. The court could confirm a plan even if a class of impaired creditors did not accept it, as long as it is fair and equitable. The court could authorize payments to professionals involved in the proceeding. Section 401 of H.R. 5278 clarifies that the bill does not limit Congress's authority over territories or alter existing agreements with territories like the Northern Mariana Islands and American Samoa. Section 402 reaffirms Puerto Rico's right to determine its political status, including through a future plebiscite. This includes provisions related to American Samoa's status as well. Section 401 of the bill clarifies Congress's authority over territories like American Samoa and the Northern Mariana Islands. Section 403 allows Puerto Rico's Governor, with Oversight Board approval, to set a lower minimum wage for workers under 25 for four years. Puerto Rico had a minimum wage for women since 1919, but enforcement was inconsistent. In the mid-1970s, Congress amended FLSA to align Puerto Rico's wage standards with mainland levels. By 1989, the special industry committee system was replaced to gradually reach federally established minimum wage levels by April 1, 1996. A report by former IMF economists highlighted the impact of the federal minimum wage on local employment. In 2015, a proposal suggested exempting workers under 25 from future federal minimum wage increases for a decade. The Department of Labor's proposed overtime rule in Puerto Rico is on hold until a report on the Commonwealth's economic conditions is completed. Congress also suggests expanding data collection in Puerto Rico and other territories. The new overtime rule affects exemptions for certain types of employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act. The Department of Labor's new overtime rule in Puerto Rico raises the salary threshold for exempt employees to $913 a week. This rule prevents actions against the Government of Puerto Rico before the enactment of PROMESA. The new overtime rule in Puerto Rico raises the salary threshold for exempt employees to $913 a week, preventing actions against the Government of Puerto Rico before the enactment of PROMESA, including recovering liability claims, enforcing judgments, obtaining property, creating liens, and collecting debts. The stay would continue until February. The Government of Puerto Rico would be subject to a stay until February 15, 2017, or six months after the Oversight Board is established. The stay may be extended by 60-75 days if needed for a voluntary process under Title VI of the bill. PROMESA ensures that the stay does not constitute a default under contracts or laws, but Puerto Rico must make timely interest payments on debts. Section 406 of PROMESA would allow the government of Puerto Rico to make purchases through the General Services Administration, while the Oversight Board is in operation. Territorial instrumentalities would be prohibited from transferring encumbered property during this time. The provision in Section 408 of PROMESA mandates the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to report to House and Senate committees on small business policy within 180 days after enactment. The report would focus on Administration contracting activities. Section 409 of PROMESA establishes a Congressional Task Force on Economic Growth in Puerto Rico with eight members appointed by various congressional leaders. The Congressional Task Force on Economic Growth in Puerto Rico, established by Section 409 of PROMESA, would issue a report by December 31, 2016, examining federal laws' relation to economic growth in Puerto Rico, the economic consequences of a Puerto Rico Department of Health Regulation, and recommending changes to federal laws to spur sustainable economic growth and reduce child poverty. The Task Force would provide a status update to Congress in September 2016 and consult with the Puerto Rico legislature. The Task Force established by Section 409 of PROMESA would consult with the Puerto Rico legislature, Department of Economic Development, and private sector. It would issue a report by December 31, 2016, and terminate thereafter. Various reports and studies have examined Puerto Rico's economic development since the 1970s, including studies by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the Brookings Institution, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The Puerto Rico government commissioned a report by former IMF economists on the competitiveness of Puerto Rico's economy, focusing on fiscal issues, budget execution, public administration, and tax structure. Section 410 of the report tasks the GAO to assess debt accumulations by territorial governments and recommend actions to prevent future indebtedness. Section 411 requires GAO to submit reports on territorial government debts and fiscal data. The proposed legislation, the \"Puerto Rico Revitalization Act,\" aims to overhaul the review and permitting processes for infrastructure projects in Puerto Rico. It includes the creation of a \"Revitalization Coordinator\" role, an expedited review process for \"Critical Projects,\" and provisions to ease the permitting process. The GAO is tasked with assessing debt accumulations by territorial governments and recommending actions to prevent future indebtedness. Additionally, the GAO is required to submit reports on territorial government debts and fiscal data. The \"Puerto Rico Revitalization Act\" aims to streamline infrastructure project review and permitting processes by creating a Revitalization Coordinator role. This role involves expedited review for Critical Projects and provisions to ease the permitting process. Project Sponsors can submit applications for classification as a Critical Project to the Revitalization Coordinator and relevant Puerto Rico agencies. The \"Puerto Rico Revitalization Act\" establishes a process for expedited review and permitting of Critical Projects related to emergencies, as defined by Act 76. Criteria for evaluating proposed Critical Projects include impact on the emergency, funding availability, project cost, environmental and economic benefits, project status, and other relevant criteria. The Puerto Rico Revitalization Act outlines criteria for evaluating Critical Projects, including impact on emergencies, funding availability, project cost, environmental and economic benefits, and project status. Agencies receiving a Critical Project submission must establish an Expedited Permitting Process within 20 days, prioritizing Critical Projects in each agency. Failure to comply triggers consultation with the Governor to develop the process. The Puerto Rico Revitalization Act requires agencies to prioritize Critical Projects and establish an Expedited Permitting Process within 20 days. The Revitalization Coordinator must consult with agencies to develop a \"Critical Project Report\" within 60 days, including a recommendation from the Governor and public comment period. The Report is then submitted to the Oversight board. The Oversight Board must take action within 30 days of receiving the Critical Project Report. Approval designates the project as Critical, while disapproval requires a statement to the Revitalization Coordinator. An Interagency Environmental Subcommittee evaluates environmental documents for Critical Projects. Agencies must expedite the permitting process for Critical Projects. Section 504 of Act 76 requires Puerto Rico agencies to operate as if there is a declared emergency for Critical Projects. The Oversight Board can enforce compliance with the Expedited Permitting Process, review laws affecting the process, and deem laws inconsistent with the Fiscal Plan. Section 504 of Act 76 requires Puerto Rico agencies to operate as if there is a declared emergency for Critical Projects. The Oversight Board can enforce compliance with the Expedited Permitting Process, review laws affecting the process, and deem laws inconsistent with the applicable Fiscal Plan. Section 504(e) prohibits including unnecessary terms in permits for Critical Projects, while Section 504(f) mandates public availability of project reports. Section 505 requires federal agencies to name a \"Point of Contact\" for projects in Puerto Rico, not limited to Critical Projects. Section 505 of Act 76 directs the Revitalization Coordinator to cooperate with the relevant Point of Contact for federal grants on Critical Projects. Federal agency reviews for Critical Projects will be expedited to meet deadlines set by the Expedited Permitting Process. Claims under Title V must be filed within 30 days, with expedited consideration in the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. Title V does not change other federal legal requirements. The first section of Title VI establishes a process for creditor collective action that could retroactively change individual creditor rights for Puerto Rico's debt. Collective action clauses (CACs) are used to expedite debt restructuring by allowing a supermajority of bondholders to agree to a legally binding restructuring. Debt restructuring with Collective Action Clauses (CACs) allows a supermajority of creditors to change terms binding on all bondholders, preventing delays in negotiations. CACs specify the majority action clause and the negotiation process between debtors and creditors, ensuring a smooth restructuring process. H.R. 5278 proposes a restructuring process for Puerto Rico's debt, borrowing from the Collective Action Clauses model. It establishes separate voting pools based on bondholder priority or security arrangements, aiming to facilitate consensus among creditors. H.R. 5278 proposes a restructuring process for Puerto Rico's debt, requiring two-thirds support from bondholders. Antonio Weiss criticized H.R. 4900 for creating multiple voting pools, hindering the restructuring process. H.R. 4900 is criticized for creating multiple voting pools, hindering debt restructuring. Critics argue for increased creditor protections and higher threshold for creditor acceptance of CACs. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew supports H.R. 5278 for providing comprehensive restructuring tools for Puerto Rico. Title VII emphasizes the need for pro-growth fiscal reforms in any solution for Puerto Rico's crisis. Representative Sean Duffy introduced the legislation. Representative Sean Duffy introduced the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA; H.R. 5278) on May 18, 2016, as a revised version of H.R. 4900. The House Natural Resources Committee marked up H.R. 5278 on May 25, 2016, with amendments including technical corrections and extensions of certain studies. The House passed the amended bill on June 9, 2016, by a 297-127 vote. The House passed H.R. 5278 on June 9, 2016, by a 297-127 vote, and the Senate approved S. 2328 on June 29, 2016, by a 68-30 vote. President Obama signed the measure into law on June 30, 2016. Other proposals to address Puerto Rico's fiscal crisis included bills introduced by Resident Commissioner Pierluisi, Senator Blumenthal, Representative Duffy, Senator Hatch, Representative Pelosi, and Senator Warren. Several measures have been introduced to address Puerto Rico's fiscal difficulties, including H.R. 4290 and S. 2436 introduced by Senator Warren, S. 2675 and S. 2676 introduced by Senator Menendez, and S. 3044 introduced by Senator Sanders. These measures aim to adjust Puerto Rico's debt and establish a Puerto Rico Reconstruction Finance Corporation. Additionally, other proposals have been made to alter federal programs' eligibility rules or benefits available to Puerto Rico residents. Commissioner Pierluisi has introduced measures (H.R. 1225, H.R. 1417, H.R. 1418, H.R. 1822, H.R. 2635, H.R. 3552, H.R. 3553, and H.R. 4163) to remove limitations on federal funding for health care, tax credits, and social insurance programs in Puerto Rico. Increased federal funding could help alleviate the territory's fiscal pressures, but would require additional federal revenues, reduced spending, or increased borrowing. Puerto Rico was acquired by the U.S. in 1898 and is under Congress's authority through the Territory Clause of the Constitution. The U.S. Constitution grants Congress authority over Puerto Rico and other territories, allowing them to make rules and regulations. Congress has passed laws addressing the island's political status, giving Puerto Rico control over internal governance. Despite efforts to reduce spending and increase revenue, Puerto Rico faces serious liquidity challenges due to long-standing issues. Puerto Rico faces liquidity challenges due to economic stagnation, budget imbalances, and governance issues. The government consists of various entities, including public corporations and municipalities. General obligation debt is backed by the Commonwealth government, while public corporations play a significant role in the economy. H.R. 5278 includes provisions for separate oversight of public corporations in Puerto Rico, which serve various purposes such as infrastructure, banking, real estate, and more. The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority has been negotiating with creditors since 2014, with the bill allowing for voluntary agreements between public corporations and creditors. The Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) reached a restructuring agreement with major creditors in 2014 to secure financing for fuel purchases. A surcharge on electricity bills was approved by the Energy Commission of Puerto Rico in 2016 to fund debt service payments for new bonds. This strategy may also be applied to Puerto Rico's water and sewer public corporation (PRASA). The Puerto Rico government, along with the Government Development Bank, is in negotiations with creditors to restructure debt. H.R. 5278 includes provisions for voluntary agreements between public corporations and bondholders. Puerto Rico faces challenges in meeting debt service payments. Puerto Rico defaulted on debt service payments for \"moral obligation\" bonds issued by the Public Finance Corporation in August 2015. Governor Garc\u00eda Padilla declared a moratorium on certain debt payments by the Government Development Bank in May 2016. The government's ability to make a larger debt service payment on July 1, 2016, is uncertain, with a government default considered \"virtually certain\" by Standard & Poors. The proposed FY2017 budget poses a choice between paying creditors and providing services to the people. Governor Garc\u00eda Padilla stated that Puerto Rico faces a choice between paying creditors or providing services to the people. A federal district judge declared the government insolvent and unable to pay its debts. The Puerto Rico Emergency Moratorium and Financial Rehabilitation Act was enacted to address the financial crisis. The Puerto Rico Emergency Moratorium and Financial Rehabilitation Act (PREMFRA) empowered the governor to declare a fiscal state of emergency and a moratorium on debt payments until January 2017. It also allowed for the modification of legal provisions regarding the GDB and the establishment of a bridge bank. Governor Padilla invoked emergency powers to allow the GDB to continue operations. An amendment proposed by Chairman Bishop would give the Oversight Board the authority to rescind laws enacted by the Puerto Rico government. The Puerto Rico Emergency Moratorium and Financial Rehabilitation Act (PREMFRA) allowed the governor to declare a fiscal state of emergency and a moratorium on debt payments. Lawsuits have been filed challenging PREMFRA, with concerns raised about prioritizing debt over essential services. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew warned of potential court orders to prioritize debt payments. In June 2014, Puerto Rico enacted Act 71 of 2014 to address PREPA's financial crisis, allowing public corporations to restructure debts. However, the U.S. District Court and U.S. Court of Appeals struck down the law in 2015. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld this decision in 2016, ruling that Puerto Rico cannot establish its own debt restructuring process. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled against Puerto Rico's attempt to establish its own debt restructuring process, pre-empting their efforts. Alternative approaches to address Puerto Rico's fiscal challenges are not included in H.R. 5278, but other federal responses could be considered in separate legislation. The Obama Administration's framework for responding to Puerto Rico's fiscal crisis included broad restructuring authorities, independent oversight, adequate funding for healthcare services, and incentives for economic growth. H.R. 4900, according to the U.S. Treasury, addresses the urgent elements of restructuring. H.R. 4900 addresses restructuring of obligations and oversight for Puerto Rico's fiscal crisis, but lacks health care funding and economic development provisions. The Obama Administration proposed extending the Earned Income Tax Credit for Puerto Rico. Some argue that an Oversight Board may not improve fiscal management, while Treasury Secretary Lew believes federal oversight is crucial for strengthening financial and governmental management capabilities. H.R. 5278 aims to enhance financial and governmental management capabilities in Puerto Rico without creating a Chief Financial Officer position. The bill provides $3 billion in appropriations for stability measures, with potential offsets from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. It does not offer direct support but includes provisions for debt restructuring and litigation stays. The stay on litigation and debt restructuring measures in H.R. 5278 could ease pressures on Puerto Rico's financial resources. The Bankruptcy Code establishes procedures for municipal debt adjustment in Chapter 9 and business reorganizations in Chapter 11. Adjustment or reorganization is typically done through a plan proposed by the debtor, voted on by creditors, and confirmed by the court. The Bankruptcy Code provides rules of construction, adjustment of dollar amounts, court powers, waiver of sovereign immunity, and public access to papers. The Bankruptcy Code includes provisions such as extension of time for actions, prohibition on disclosing minor children's names, appointment of patient care ombudsman, and self-incrimination immunity for those providing information in bankruptcy cases. 18 U.S.C. part V covers various aspects of bankruptcy cases, including unclaimed property, effects of dismissal, reopening cases, disposal of patient records, and adequate protection for debtors. The curr_chunk discusses the provisions related to adequate protection and obtaining credit in bankruptcy cases under the Bankruptcy Code.
