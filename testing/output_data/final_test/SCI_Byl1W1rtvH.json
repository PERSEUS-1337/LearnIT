    "content": "The proposed model captures syntax and semantics from text corpus using a dynamic deep topic model. It considers long-range word dependencies, sentence order, temporal transitions, and inter-sentence topic dependences. The model outperforms state-of-the-art language models, generating diverse and coherent sentences and paragraphs. Topic models like latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and its Bayesian generalizations extract word patterns into latent topics from text. Language models are crucial for NLP tasks like text summarization and speech recognition. In this paper, the focus is on improving RNN-based language models for NLP tasks like text summarization and speech recognition. RNN-based models capture word sequence distribution and assume sentences in a document are independent, simplifying the modeling task. To improve RNN-based language models for NLP tasks, researchers have proposed larger-context language models that consider the context of a sentence by using BoW vectors of preceding sentences. Another approach involves incorporating pre-trained topic model features into RNN hidden states and outputs. These methods aim to address the limitations of language models that assume sentence independence. Existing topic-guided methods in NLP combine predicted word distributions using variational autoencoders and attention-based convolutional neural networks to extract semantic topics. These methods aim to improve the global semantic coherence of documents and utilize Gaussian mixture models to specify latent topics. However, they still have limitations such as shallow topic models with only a single stochastic hidden layer in their data generation process.
