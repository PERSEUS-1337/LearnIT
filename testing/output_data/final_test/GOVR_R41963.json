The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act delegates rulemaking authority to federal agencies for provisions like Medicaid expansion and insurance exchanges. Over 40 provisions in the Act require or permit the issuance of rules for implementation. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act delegates rulemaking authority to federal agencies for provisions like Medicaid expansion and insurance exchanges. There are 40 provisions in the Act that require or permit the issuance of rules for implementation, which will have a major impact on how the legislation is implemented. The war to make health care reform a success has just begun and will require administrative determination and imagination. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act delegates rulemaking authority to federal agencies for provisions like Medicaid expansion and insurance exchanges. The success of health care reform will require administrative determination, imagination, and political resolve. Congress delegates rulemaking authority to agencies, determining their discretion in crafting rules. Some provisions in the Act are specific, while others permit agencies to issue rules at their discretion. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act delegates rulemaking authority to federal agencies for provisions like Medicaid expansion and insurance exchanges. By December 2010, federal agencies had issued 18 final rules implementing sections of the Act. Rulemaking is necessary to implement statutory provisions effectively. David H. Rosenbloom highlighted the equivalence of rulemaking and lawmaking, emphasizing that agencies legislate when issuing rules. Congressional oversight of rulemaking is crucial to ensure proper exercise of delegated authority. To oversee regulations for implementing PPACA, early knowledge of upcoming rules is essential. The CRS report can help identify provisions requiring rulemaking. The Unified Agenda published by the Regulatory Information Service Center can help Congress identify upcoming rules for implementing PPACA, ensuring transparency and oversight of agency rulemaking. The Act requires agencies to publish semiannual regulatory agendas in the Federal Register, as mandated by Executive Order 12866. This aims to involve the public and resolve conflicts early in the regulatory planning process. Agencies must prepare a regulatory plan for significant regulatory actions expected in the upcoming fiscal year. The Unified Agenda lists upcoming activities by agency in five categories: prerule stage, proposed rule stage, final rule stage, long-term actions, and completed actions. Entries include data elements such as the issuing department and agency. The Unified Agenda categorizes upcoming regulatory activities by agency and includes data elements like the department, agency, rule title, Regulation Identifier Number (RIN), action description, timetable, and priority level. It serves as a tool for Congress and the public to track regulatory actions, although some listed rules may never be issued due to the fluid nature of the rulemaking process. The Unified Agenda provides a systematic method for federal agencies to alert the public about upcoming proposed rules. A report analyzed the July 7, 2011, edition of the Unified Agenda to identify upcoming rules expected to be issued under PPACA in the next 12 months. Agencies submitted data to the Regulatory Information Service Center (RISC) for the Unified Agenda, with some items updated during the OIRA review process. The Unified Agenda is used by federal agencies to inform the public about upcoming proposed rules. A report analyzed the agenda to find upcoming rules under PPACA in the next 12 months. The search focused on proposed and final rules, including long-term actions. The results are provided in the report's appendix, listing the department, agency, rule title, RIN, abstract, and expected issue date. Abstracts were taken from the Unified Agenda entries. Entries are organized by agency in the table. The Unified Agenda is used by federal agencies to inform the public about upcoming proposed rules under PPACA. A report analyzed the agenda to find upcoming rules within the next 12 months. The report electronically searched the Federal Register for the most up-to-date information on proposed and final rules listed in the Unified Agenda. The July 7, 2011 edition listed 41 PPACA-related actions in the proposed rule stage, with 33 expected to be issued by components of the Department of Health and Human Services. Proposed rules were expected to be issued by various components of the Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Labor, Treasury Department, Internal Revenue Service, and Office of Personnel Management. 17 out of 41 items in the \"proposed rule\" section of the Unified Agenda were expected to be issued by the end of July 2011. As of August 3, 2011, 9 out of 17 anticipated notices of proposed rulemaking had been published, including rules on various topics such as food labeling and Medicare data availability. Some proposed rules expected to be published by the end of July 2011 had not been published yet, including rules on healthcare data banks and administrative simplification. Several proposed rules were issued in 2011, including rules on Medicaid eligibility expansion, uniform explanation of coverage documents, and standards for health care facilities. Additional rules were expected to be published later in the year, covering topics such as children's health insurance, nondiscrimination under the Affordable Care Act, and disputed claims in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. In September 2011, HHS agencies considered 4 out of 41 items in the proposed rule section of the Unified Agenda important enough to be included in the regulatory plan. These included rules on food labeling for vending machines and restaurants, Medicare Shared Savings Program for Accountable Care Organizations, and Community Living Assistance Services and Supports Program. The Unified Agenda listed several \"economically significant\" or \"major\" actions in addition to the PPACA-related proposed rule actions. Examples include rules on Medicaid eligibility expansion, requirements to implement health benefit exchanges, and public use files of health plan data. The Unified Agenda listed 27 out of 41 proposed rule actions as \"other significant,\" including rules on confidentiality of medical records, face-to-face requirements for home health services, and the CLASS Program. The Unified Agenda listed proposed rules on the CLASS Program, FDA food labeling for vending machines, and Black Lung Benefits Act amendments, which are expected to impact small entities and require regulatory flexibility analysis. The Unified Agenda included proposed rules on food labeling for vending machines and chain restaurants, as well as Medicaid eligibility expansion under the Affordable Care Act of 2010. Other actions listed were expected to impact small businesses, governments, or not-for-profits, but it was uncertain if they would trigger the Regulatory Flexibility Act requirements. These actions included rules on health plan identifiers, durable medical equipment, and cease and desist orders under ERISA Section 521. The Unified Agenda listed upcoming final rules related to PPACA, with various agencies expected to issue rules within the next 12 months. By August 3, 2011, four rules had been issued, including HHS/CMS rules on administrative simplification and payment adjustments for provider-preventable conditions. Several final rules related to PPACA were issued by HHS/CMS, including payment adjustments for provider-preventable conditions and enhanced federal funding for Medicaid eligibility determination. Two final rules were yet to be published as of August 3, 2011. Several final rules related to PPACA were issued by HHS/CMS, including payment adjustments for provider-preventable conditions and enhanced federal funding for Medicaid eligibility determination. Six other final rules were expected to be published in 2011, covering various aspects such as designation of medically underserved populations, electronic funds transfer, Medicaid recovery audit contractors, community first choice option, handling of retaliation complaints, and IRS regulations. The Unified Agenda listed three economically significant final rules related to CMS, including \"Medicaid Recovery Audit Contractors,\" \"Community First Choice Option,\" and \"Enhanced Federal Funding for Medicaid Eligibility Determination and Enrollment Activities.\" Additionally, eight other significant rules were mentioned in the final rule section. The final rules mentioned in the curr_chunk were considered \"other significant\" and were expected to be reviewed by OIRA under Executive Order 12866. These rules included various regulations from HHS/HRSA, HHS/CMS, DOL/OSHA, and the Social Security Administration. Two of these rules were expected to impact small businesses and trigger the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The CMS and IRS rules mentioned in the curr_chunk were expected to impact small businesses and trigger the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Additionally, three other CMS rules were identified to have effects on small businesses, governments, or other organizations, but were not expected to require a regulatory flexibility analysis. These rules were part of the Unified Agenda's \"long-term actions\" under development by the agencies. The Unified Agenda listed 27 long-term actions related to PPACA, with unclear timelines for 17 of them. Six actions were expected in June 2012, one in August 2012, one in 2013, and two in 2014. 15 upcoming final rules were expected, including an HHS/CMS rule on \"Requirements for Long-Term Care Facilities: Notification of Facility Closure\" to be published in February 2014. The Unified Agenda listed 27 long-term actions related to PPACA, with unclear timelines for 17 of them. Among the upcoming final rules expected were an HHS/CMS rule on \"Affordable Care Act Waiver for State Innovation; Review and Approval Process\" and an IRS rule on \"Requirements Applicable to Group Health Plans and Health Insurance Issuers Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, I.\" The Unified Agenda listed 27 long-term actions related to PPACA, with 10 identified as \"economically significant\" or \"major.\" These actions included HHS/CMS rules on various topics like \"Preventive Services Under the Affordable Care Act\" and a DOL/EBSA action on \"Group Health Plans and Health Insurance Coverage Relating to Status as a Grandfathered Health Plan Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\" The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) was a major long-term action identified, along with a CMS rule on \"Affordable Care Act Waiver for State Innovation.\" Other significant actions included rules on Catastrophic Health Emergency Fund, Health Care Reform Insurance Web Portal Requirements, Student Health Insurance Coverage, and Automatic Enrollment in Health Plans for Employees of Large Employers. These actions were considered significant but not economically significant. When federal agencies issue regulations, Congress should oversee to ensure consistency with legislative intent. The Unified Agenda can provide early information on rules, allowing Congress to use tools like oversight hearings. Members of Congress can also participate in the rulemaking process. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to oversee federal agencies' rulemaking activities by requiring them to submit final rules for review before taking effect. Members of Congress can participate in the process and request evaluations by the Government Accountability Office. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to disapprove covered rules through expedited procedures. Resolutions of disapproval must be presented to the President for signature or veto. However, the CRA has been rarely used in the past 14 years due to potential presidential veto and the difficulty of overturning it with a two-thirds vote in Congress. Regular legislative procedures can also be used to disapprove agency rules. Regular legislative procedures can be used to disapprove agency rules, but may be more challenging than the CRA due to lack of expedited procedures in the Senate and potential presidential veto. Congress often includes provisions in agencies' appropriations bills to direct or prevent specific regulations, such as prohibiting finalization of proposed rules or restricting regulatory activity. Appropriations provisions can also prompt agencies to issue regulations or require specific procedures before or after issuance. The inclusion of regulatory provisions in appropriations legislation is a legislative strategy driven by Congress's power to control agency actions and the necessity for appropriations bills to pass. The use of regulatory restrictions in appropriations has varied over time and may be less frequent when Congress and the President are of the same party."
