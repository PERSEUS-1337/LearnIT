The three major candidates were Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador of the PRD, Felipe Calder\u00f3n Hinojosa of the PAN, and Roberto Madrazo of the PRI. Calder\u00f3n won the election with just under 36% of the vote, defeating L\u00f3pez Obrador by less than 234,000 votes. Felipe Calder\u00f3n won the 2006 Mexican presidential election with a slight lead over Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador. Voter turnout was 59%, and despite allegations of fraud, the Federal Electoral Tribunal declared the election fair after annulling nearly 238,000 votes. The Federal Electoral Tribunal ruled the 2006 Mexican presidential election fair despite irregularities. Nearly 238,000 votes were annulled. President Fox's comments were deemed not illegal interference. Felipe Calder\u00f3n was named president-elect. L\u00f3pez Obrador led civil disobedience, costing Mexico City businesses over $500 million. PRD members prevented President Fox from delivering the state of the union address. L\u00f3pez Obrador rejected the election tribunal's ruling and was named the \"legitimate president\" of Mexico at a democratic convention. The PRD candidate is set to be sworn in as president of a \"parallel government\" on November 20, with committees established for political negotiation, civil disobedience coordination, and drafting a new constitution. Support for this parallel government and its operations remain unclear. Cuaht\u00e9moc C\u00e1rdenas criticized L\u00f3pez Obrador's tactics as undemocratic and questioned his advisors' role in past electoral fraud. Felipe Calder\u00f3n, a Harvard-trained economist and PAN presidential candidate, rose to prominence in Mexican politics despite being relatively unknown to the electorate in December 2005. By mid-June 2006, polls showed him in a tight race with PRD candidate Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, attributed to missteps by L\u00f3pez Obrador and negative advertisements labeling him a \"danger to Mexico.\" Felipe Calder\u00f3n, the PAN presidential candidate, focused on addressing Mexico's job shortage issue and reducing migration to the United States. He emphasized the importance of investment, competitiveness, and sound economic policies to create well-paid jobs. Calder\u00f3n proposed a development plan funded by NAFTA members to boost job creation and reduce migration from under-developed regions. Additionally, he suggested opening Mexico's oil sector to private investment through joint-ventures. Felipe Calder\u00f3n proposed opening Mexico's oil sector to private investment in joint-ventures with PEMEX to explore deep-water reserves in the Gulf of Mexico. He also pledged to address Mexico's public security crisis by combating corruption, creating an agency to combat drug trafficking, unifying federal police forces, and pursuing an active foreign policy. Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, the PRD presidential candidate, studied political science at UNAM and worked with the Chontal Indian community in Tabasco. Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, a former mayor of Mexico City and PRD party president, was a popular candidate for the presidency in 2006. Despite leading in the polls, he lost support due to comments about President Fox and refusal to participate in debates. His campaign focused on poverty alleviation with the slogan \"For the good of all, the poor first.\" Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador's campaign pledges in 2006 focused on poverty reduction, job creation, indigenous rights, and infrastructure investment. Measures included guaranteeing pensions for Mexicans over 70, protecting indigenous rights, improving education and healthcare access, and re-opening NAFTA negotiations. He opposed privatizing the state-owned oil company, PEMEX, and aimed for Mexico to be self-sufficient in gasoline within three years. L\u00f3pez Obrador focused on internal issues as president, aiming to reduce emigration by addressing poverty and job creation. He planned to advocate for Mexican migrants' rights in the US and increase the army's role in combating narcotics trafficking. Observers debated his potential alliance with Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, but L\u00f3pez Obrador emphasized his focus on Mexico, not foreign policy. Roberto Madrazo Pintado, a PRI candidate for president from Tabasco, has a political background as a federal deputy, senator, Governor of Tabasco, and national PRI party president. Despite being in third place in opinion polls, he faced internal division within the PRI, leading some leaders to shift support to other candidates. The PRI expelled 28 leaders who endorsed other candidates, prompting PRI voters to not \"waste\" votes on Madrazo. During his campaign, Madrazo promised to create jobs, improve security, facilitate remittances, modernize the energy sector, and increase. Roberto Madrazo Pintado, a PRI candidate for president, proposed economic reforms in the energy sector through joint ventures with private companies. He aimed to benefit more Mexicans through stable macroeconomic policies and export growth. Madrazo also focused on job creation to prevent Mexican emigration and improve public security by unifying federal police forces. Mexico's bicameral legislature consists of a 500-member Chamber of Deputies and a 128-member Senate, with deputies serving three-year terms. The Mexican bicameral legislature consists of a 500-member Chamber of Deputies and a 128-member Senate. Deputies are elected to three-year terms, with 300 elected directly and 200 proportionally from party lists in five districts. Senators serve six-year terms, with each state electing three senators and 32 senators elected from national party lists. The PRI lost significant representation in the new congress, with the PAN and PRD gaining influence. Despite being the largest party, the PAN did not secure a majority, leading to potential influence from the PRI in the upcoming congress. Some analysts believe the PRI will be influential in the upcoming congress as the PAN delegation seeks additional votes to pass legislation. The United States and Mexico have a multifaceted relationship, with recent emphasis on migration, border security, drug trafficking, trade, and energy policy. President-elect Felipe Calder\u00f3n is likely to continue Mexico's advocacy for immigration reform in the United States, opposing construction of additional barriers along the U.S.-Mexican border. In September 2006, Calder\u00f3n charged that the border fence under consideration by the U.S. Congress will be ineffective in combating illegal immigration. President Bush is expected to sign the Secure Fence Act of 2006, authorizing the construction of a border fence along 700 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border. The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act for 2007 provides $1.2 billion for the fence. President Calder\u00f3n supports extradition of drug kingpins to the U.S. and calls for legislative solutions to drug violence. Concerns arise in Mexico over NAFTA's impact on agricultural trade, particularly bean and corn crops. President-elect Calder\u00f3n plans to address concerns about NAFTA within the framework, unlike L\u00f3pez Obrador who wanted to renegotiate. He also aims to open Mexico's oil industry to private investment and continue active foreign policy, including restoring relations with Venezuela. Calder\u00f3n seeks to strengthen relationships with Central and South American nations and re-orient Mexico's foreign policy towards its southern neighbors."
