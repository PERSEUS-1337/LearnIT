    "content": "The \"United Nations Reform Act of 1997\" is the short title of this Act. It addresses the payment of United States arrearages in assessed contributions to the United Nations. The \"United Nations Reform Act of 1997\" limits funds available for the payment of United States arrearages to the United Nations for fiscal years 1998 through 2002. The President may release up to 20% of arrears for each fiscal year according to specific procedures. The \"United Nations Reform Act of 1997\" restricts US contributions to the UN if arrears exist, with the President certifying reform criteria annually to release funds. Relevant committees are defined, and reform criteria for fiscal year 1998 includes a zero nominal growth budget for the UN. The United Nations has maintained a zero nominal growth budget in US dollars and allows auditing by member states' agencies. The Office of Internal Oversight Services is fully funded, and its products are available to all member states. The criteria for fiscal year 1999 continue from fiscal year 1998. For fiscal year 1998, United States representation on the United Nations Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions has been restored. For fiscal year 2000, procedures for assessing contributions for United Nations peacekeeping activities have been reformed to ensure reimbursement or credit for aid provided by the United States. For fiscal years 2001 and 2002, the United Nations must meet specific criteria for its budget, including a core assessed budget for essential activities and a voluntary program budget for all other programs and activities. The United Nations has approved and implemented systemwide structural reform, reducing staff and eliminating outdated activities and program duplication across specialized agencies from fiscal years 1998 to 2001."
