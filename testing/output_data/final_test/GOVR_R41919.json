Addressing climate change in China also impacts broader economic and security concerns in the US. Scientific evidence shows that human-related GHG emissions drive climate change, leading to debates on controlling emissions. GHG persist in the atmosphere for years, trapping solar radiation and warming the Earth's surface. Maintaining a certain concentration of GHG is crucial for habitable temperatures, but there is uncertainty on the extent of warming from higher concentrations. In the late 1980s, scientific concerns about human-related greenhouse gas emissions led to inter-governmental discussions to stabilize concentrations and avoid dangerous global temperature rise. This resulted in the negotiation of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992, with industrialized countries emitting nearly 80% of global CO2 emissions. The UNFCCC was established in 1992 to address greenhouse gas emissions, with industrialized countries responsible for 80% of global CO2 emissions. The US and EU contributed 23% and 20% respectively, while China's share was 11%. Developing countries felt the impact of climate change caused by industrialized nations but were not included in Annex I of the UNFCCC. The principle of \"common but differentiated responsibilities\" was established, with industrialized countries expected to lead in emission control. The distinction between Annex I and Non-Annex I Parties was established under the UNFCCC to address greenhouse gas emissions. Scientific analyses show that major emitting countries like China and the US need to reduce their net emissions to near zero to stabilize GHG concentrations in the atmosphere. The effectiveness of the UNFCCC in achieving this goal has been questioned due to the rapid growth of emissions from these large emitters. China's share of global GHG emissions has increased from 11% in 1990 to 21% today, raising concerns about slowing human-induced climate change. Observers have concluded that slowing human-induced climate change depends on Chinese emissions reductions, along with reductions from the United States and other large emitters. U.S. congressional debate on climate change policies often mentions China's rising greenhouse gas emissions and questions if, how, and when China will change this trend. Concerns exist that U.S. GHG controls without similar actions from China could give China an unfair advantage in global trade and not effectively combat climate change. On the other hand, some highlight China's efforts to reduce emissions through non-fossil fuel technologies, warning that U.S. businesses could fall behind technologically and competitively in the energy sector and international trade. Chinese policies may also help buffer against climate change impacts. Some experts suggest that Chinese policies could protect their production from volatile fossil fuel prices, while the US may face fluctuating energy costs. China's GHG control policies are linked to global energy markets, rare earth metals, and climate change impacts on ecosystems and agriculture. This report provides a foundation for Congress to consider China's GHG policies, discussing economic and environmental contexts, emission estimates, and uncertainties. China's emissions magnitude and uncertainties are discussed, along with factors driving emissions and China's strategy to mitigate them. The Chinese economy grew significantly between 1980 and 2009, with a shift towards \"harmonious growth\" balancing GDP growth with improving living standards. China's annual growth rates varied between 8% and 14% in the past decade. China's economy has tripled in size over the past decade, with annual growth rates between 8% and 14%. It is now the second largest economy in the world, holding $3.2 trillion in foreign exchange reserves. Despite significant improvements in living standards for millions of Chinese, up to 200 million people still live in poverty. The Chinese government aims to continue raising average incomes and eliminating poverty to maintain its legitimacy. China's GDP per capita in 2009 was $6,800 in international dollars, reflecting a 22% increase from 2007. China's GDP per capita in 2009 was $6,800 in international dollars, up 22% from 2007 and 289% from 2000. Despite this growth, per capita incomes in China were still significantly lower than in the United States. China's population was more than four times that of the United States, with an economy just over half as large. It would take many years for average Chinese living standards to reach those of Americans, even with high projected economic growth rates. China's recent growth has been driven by industrial production, especially for export. China's recent growth in industrial production has shifted towards stimulating domestic consumption and improving quality of life. Policies have reduced incentives for export-oriented production and increased investments in higher value-added goods and services. Economic integration in Southeast Asia may decrease the share of heavy manufacturing in China's economy. Chinese policymakers are realizing the need to balance industrialization with environmental concerns. Chinese officials are aiming for a \"harmonious society\" with slower GDP growth to reduce environmental degradation. The World Bank estimated that pollution costs China's economy $100 billion annually, 5.8% of GDP. This has led to a shift in priorities towards balancing industrialization with environmental concerns. The Chinese government has prioritized environmental protection in its Five Year Plan. Despite efforts to control pollution, local officials may hinder enforcement of regulations to promote industrial growth. Achieving national environmental goals remains uncertain due to challenges in controlling pollutants like sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, particulates, and mercury. Controlling pollution in China, especially greenhouse gas emissions, is challenging due to differing priorities of local and central government officials, inadequate monitoring data, and enforcement of national requirements. Without shared international action, there is a risk of a \"tragedy of the commons\" scenario where some nations bear the costs of pollution while others become \"free riders\" on mitigation efforts. China's leadership has acknowledged its role in addressing climate change and balancing economic growth with environmental protection in its 12th 5-Year Plan. The nation faces challenges in reconciling domestic politics with international relations and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Data on China's emissions are uncertain, raising questions about its environmental impact. China has not reported its emissions estimates for any year later than 1994, causing contention in UNFCCC negotiations with the United States and other countries. China's lack of transparency and acceptance of international review of GHG emissions estimates has hindered its credibility in taking action to slow emissions growth. China has not reported emissions estimates past 1994, leading to disputes in UNFCCC talks. Lack of transparency and resistance to international review hampers credibility in emission reduction efforts. China plans biannual reporting and consultations since the Copenhagen Accord in 2009. Current preparations for the second GHG emissions inventory, estimated around 7-7.5 billion metric tons of CO2-equivalent in 2005, with CO2 making up 78-84% of total emissions. China's GHG emissions were partially offset by forest sequestration from 1980 to 2005. Land use, land use change, and forestry emissions are challenging to quantify globally. In 2005, China and the United States each accounted for about 17% of global GHG emissions. In 2009, China emitted around 21% of energy and cement CO2, while the United States emitted about 19%. China and the United States were responsible for 21% and 19% of global energy and cement CO2 emissions in 2009, respectively. Chinese GHG emissions have grown rapidly, with an annual average growth rate of around 4% from 1994 to 2004. China's CO2 emissions were estimated to be 8,333 MMT CO2 in 2010, showing a 339% increase from 1990. The sectoral contributions to China's national emissions are difficult to determine due to the lack of official data since 1994. China's GHG emissions in 2003 were mainly from electricity and heat (42%), industry (21%), agriculture (20%), households and services (9%), transportation (5%), and waste (3%). In 2005, 68% of China's GHG emissions came from fuel combustion, 5% from methane, 10% from industrial processes, and 14% from agriculture. China's high GHG emissions are due to its large economy, energy-intensive industry, and coal use, with a population of 1.3 billion contributing to its economic size. China's economy is the second largest globally due to its vast population of 1.3 billion people. China exercises strong policies to slow population growth, resulting in a relatively slow rate of population growth and diminishing national GHG emissions. Despite slow population growth, production per capita has grown rapidly, with annual growth rates ranging from 8 to 14% over the past decade. The Chinese economy, the second largest globally, has experienced annual growth rates of 8 to 14% over the past decade. It is valued at int$9.1 trillion in 2009, two-thirds the size of the U.S. economy. Recent growth in Chinese GHG emissions is driven by exports, capital investment, and increasing consumption. Energy production and use account for three-quarters of all GHG emissions in China, mainly due to energy-intensive industrial activity. China's heavy reliance on coal and high CO2 intensity of its economy are driven by manufacturing for export and construction of new infrastructure. Energy demand in China has surged since 1990, growing faster than the economy. Government control over the energy sector led to inefficiencies, with a reversal in the reduction of energy intensity in the early 2000s. This increased China's dependence on energy for economic growth, leading to energy shortages and concerns about access to oil supplies. China became a net importer of coal by 2007.

This increased China's dependence on energy for economic growth, leading to energy shortages and concerns about access to oil supplies. China became a net importer of coal by 2007, triggering public protests due to pollution levels and international pressure to control emissions. Reforms since the 1990s have been limited by weak implementation and a focus on economic expansion, leading to a revision of national energy policies in China's current 5-year plans. China's high use of coal in its fuel mix contributes to its high CO2 emissions relative to its economy size. China's heavy reliance on coal for energy, with coal providing 70% of total energy, explains why China's greenhouse gas emissions are high compared to the United States. China consumes three times more coal annually than the US, despite a slightly higher total energy demand in 2009. China's greenhouse gas emissions in China are high due to its heavy reliance on coal for energy, limited natural gas quantities, lower use of petroleum, and fewer nuclear power plants. The energy sector also emits methane from coal production, with efforts to control methane leaks in mines. Agriculture is the next significant sector for GHG emissions, with 17% of emissions in 1994, especially from rice cultivation and livestock. China has made efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, with a focus on methane emissions from rice cultivation and livestock production, as well as nitrous oxide emissions from fertilizer application. The government has implemented policies to improve energy efficiency and increase the use of non-emitting energy sources. Critics question China's ability to meet its targets, while others see its efforts as insufficient. China has implemented policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, focusing on energy efficiency and renewable energy sources. Analysts believe achieving carbon intensity targets is feasible with stronger policies. Despite efforts, China's GHG emissions are expected to continue increasing until around 2030. Enforcement and effectiveness of existing policies have been questioned. China released its National Climate Change Program to address climate change, with a goal to lower energy intensity by 20% by 2010. Despite falling just short of the target with a 19.1% improvement, there were concerns that energy managers met goals by stopping or slowing production rather than improving efficiency. This led to a slight rebound in energy intensity in early 2011. Chinese leadership tightened objectives in the 12th 5-Year Plan from 2011-2015, including the closure of thousands of small, inefficient, and polluting coal-fired power plants. China reported closures of old coal-fired power plants exceeding 71 GW of capacity in 2006-2010, and another 11 GW in the first half of 2011, which would have emitted 164 MMTCO2 annually. The share of non-fossil energy reached 9.6% in 2010, up from about 7% in 2005. China became the largest wind power market by 2010. The stock of carbon stored in forests increased by an estimated 13 billion cubic meters. The government stated that policies to achieve China's targets for 2010 will likely continue into the future, including investment in ultra-efficient coal-fired electricity generation and closure of inefficient energy and industrial production capacity. China's 12th 5-Year Plan includes measures such as closure of inefficient energy and industrial capacity, expansion of combined heat-and-power, improved industrial motor efficiencies, energy efficient standards for lighting, buildings, and appliances, financial incentives for renewable energy, feed-in tariffs, and vehicle efficiency standards. The plan also aims to reduce CO2 emissions and implement stricter efficiency standards for buildings and appliances, with a target of expanding forest coverage to 20% by 2015. China aims to reduce GHG emissions by improving energy and carbon intensity, increasing non-fossil energy share, expanding forest coverage, implementing CO2 cap and trade programs, and expanding high-speed railways. Legislation is being considered to support these targets, with a focus on economic restructuring and financial incentives for companies and institutions. China aims to reduce GHG emissions through various measures such as improving energy efficiency, increasing non-fossil energy use, and implementing carbon cap and trade programs. There are financial incentives for companies to save energy and shift to alternative fuels in the transport sector. China is also focusing on expanding the energy-saving service sector, particularly in transport and construction, to make energy efficiency a market entry criterion. Projections for future emissions are varied, with some suggesting possible absolute reductions in the long term. According to a recent report by the Chinese Academy of Engineering, China's energy development is expected to undergo a significant transition around 2030. This transition will involve a decrease in coal consumption, a peak in carbon dioxide emissions, and advancements in global energy-saving capabilities. Various analyses suggest that Chinese CO2 emissions could plateau around 2030 if current policies continue, with efforts to improve carbon intensity by 40-45% by 2020. China's current policies may lead to a doubling of CO2 emissions by 2035, as per the International Energy Agency's World Energy Outlook 2009. China and other low-income countries were exempted from GHG reduction obligations under the UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol. The 2009 Copenhagen Accord was a result of an impasse between countries on GHG emissions. China and other low-income economies resisted taking on GHG obligations, while the United States and others rejected commitments unless all major emitters participated. The Accord allowed countries to submit pledges to GHG targets and mitigation actions, which are politically but not legally binding. China's stance against legally binding commitments under the UNFCCC or the Kyoto Protocol is based on historical emissions from industrialized countries like the United States. The \"Brazil Proposal\" suggests that developing countries should not have GHG abatement requirements until their contributions to atmospheric concentrations equal those of Annex I Parties. China's growing emissions may soon match the historic contributions of smaller Annex I Parties, leading to a need for differentiation in obligations for GHG reporting and review. China and other lower income countries argue that industrialized economies should bear the responsibility for GHG emissions due to their historical use of energy. They believe that until their incomes catch up, they should not be constrained in their energy use. Additionally, they propose that each person should have an equal \"right\" to emissions, which would result in lower emissions for Americans and higher emissions for citizens of developing countries. China and other non-Annex I Parties argue that wealthier countries should bear the responsibility for GHG emissions due to their historical energy use. They propose that each person should have an equal \"right\" to emissions, which would result in lower emissions for Americans and higher emissions for citizens of developing countries. A rumored \"equity\" proposal from India, China, Brazil, and South Africa suggests that countries should not take on GHG abatement obligations until each citizen has access to energy and emerges from poverty, highlighting differing views on equity and potential conflicts with stabilizing GHG concentrations. China prioritizes poverty alleviation and raising incomes over GHG abatement. China prioritizes poverty alleviation and raising incomes over GHG abatement. Despite seeking financial and technological assistance, China's credibility in requesting aid has diminished due to its robust economy and advanced technology capabilities. Recent engagement in technology cooperation, including with the United States, has been observed. The Copenhagen negotiations in 2009 marked a shift in some countries' perceptions towards new commitments for developing countries, highlighting diverging interests in climate change negotiations. China continues to prioritize poverty alleviation and raising incomes over GHG abatement. Despite seeking assistance, China is unlikely to agree to legally binding GHG targets or enhanced reporting requirements. The Copenhagen negotiations in 2009 highlighted diverging interests in climate change negotiations."
