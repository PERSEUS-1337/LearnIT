The Congress acknowledges the importance of small business concerns in the US economy and their challenges in addressing climate change. The government's significant role as a purchaser of goods and services influences the business marketplace, with small businesses winning a substantial portion of contracts. The Small Business Act of 1953 aims to provide fair opportunities for small businesses to compete for Federal contracts. The US Environmental Protection Agency offers a directory to help small businesses access financial services for energy efficiency. Green business practices offer small businesses incentives and opportunities to penetrate the market with environmentally friendly products and services. However, many small businesses struggle with comparing costs and environmental impacts of alternatives, lacking the scientific expertise to address climate change issues. Additionally, barriers to market acceptance of green products and services exist. Small businesses face barriers to market acceptance of environmentally preferable products when competing with long-standing practices. It is crucial for the competitiveness of the United States that small businesses, including minority-owned and women-owned businesses, be given more opportunities to supply goods and services to Federal agencies. Utilizing energy-efficient technologies can help small businesses save on operating costs and become more competitive. Small businesses can save on operating costs, improve productivity, and reduce their carbon footprint by investing in energy-efficient programs. Despite the benefits, many small business owners have not taken advantage of these opportunities. For example, replacing incandescent bulbs with compact fluorescent bulbs can result in significant savings over time. Buildings account for a significant portion of energy consumption, making energy efficiency crucial for small businesses. Whole building design practices, also known as green buildings, have a positive effect on reducing carbon emissions and improving productivity. Studies show a 2 to 16 percent increase in productivity and a 2 percent upfront investment in these practices results in 20 percent life cycle savings in construction costs. Small businesses can utilize tools for designing energy-efficient programs. Small business concerns can utilize tools like green roofs, daylighting, on-site renewable energy, natural ventilation, and integrated design for designing energy-efficient programs. These tools offer cost-saving functions, improve indoor air quality, and enhance occupant comfort. The design team identifies systems early in the process to provide coordinated implementation of efficiency and building methods, resulting in exponential savings and comfort. The Small Business Act is amended to include a new section for the Office of Environment, Energy, and Climate Change. The Small Business Administration establishes the Office of Environment, Energy, and Climate Change, which oversees the Climate Change Center and Clearinghouse, promotes energy efficiency, reduces energy costs for small businesses, and supervises the development of renewable energy technologies. The Climate Change Center and Clearinghouse, established within the Office of Environment, Energy, and Climate Change, provides small businesses with information on assessing and managing the impacts of climate change, carbon credit trading opportunities, and renewable energy incentives. The Climate Change Center and Clearinghouse offers information on climate change impacts, carbon credit trading, and renewable energy incentives to small businesses. The Department of Energy coordinates workshops and provides information on programs, incentives, and rebates to small businesses through a website and nationwide workshops. The Environmental Protection Agency, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Small Business and Agriculture Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsman, and other federal agencies provide support to small businesses for developing green products, implementing green practices, and reducing pollution to maintain competitiveness. The Center will develop a baseline study to analyze small business energy consumption and emissions, coordinating with other federal agencies to reduce pollution. The Center will develop a carbon footprint website with educational information, tools, and a calculator to help small businesses reduce their carbon footprint. The Center will provide a carbon footprint calculator for small businesses to estimate emissions based on electricity, heating fuel, and fleet mileage. Additionally, they will develop a marketing plan to raise awareness among small businesses and coordinate with the Office of Small Business Development Centers. Heads of federal departments must provide information to the Center upon request. An Interagency Working Group will be established by the President. The President will establish an interagency working group co-chaired by the Assistant Administrator for Environment, Energy, and Climate Change and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. The group will include representatives from various agencies and may appoint advisors from environmental and climate change groups. The interagency working group will establish goals and priorities for the Center and provide interagency coordination, including budget coordination. The Administrator of the Small Business Administration will define 'green products or services' and 'green business practices' in consultation with relevant federal departments. The term 'greenhouse gas' will also be defined for the purposes of this section. The term 'greenhouse gas' is defined as carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, or sulfur hexafluoride. Authorization of appropriations is provided for the implementation of this section."
