    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Bovine Growth Hormone Milk Act\". It includes findings related to the use of bovine growth hormone in milk production. The Congress finds that synthetic recombinant bovine growth hormone (synthetic BGH) is the first genetically engineered food product in widespread use, with potential health concerns for infants and children. Injections of synthetic BGH in dairy cows lead to residues in milk and increased levels of bovine insulin-like growth factor, prompting the need for further safety studies on human consumption. The use of synthetic BGH injections in cows leads to health problems such as increased mastitis and antibiotic use, posing a risk of antibiotics entering the consumer milk supply. Consumers are concerned about hormones, antibiotics, and animal welfare in their food. Consumers overwhelmingly support labeling milk produced with synthetic BGH due to concerns about health, animal welfare, and budget impacts. European Community and Canada have moratoriums on synthetic BGH, while Australia and New Zealand refuse its approval. Consumers have a right to know about the use of synthetic BGH in milk production. Both States and companies are labeling products with synthetic BGH, leading to confusion and lawsuits. A common label is needed for consumers to easily identify milk with synthetic BGH. A synthetic BGH residue test is necessary to validate label claims and ensure truthfulness. Scientific organizations support the need for such testing. A synthetic BGH residue test is being developed with support from scientific organizations. Preliminary research has been completed, and claims suggest a successful test has been created in a lab. The Secretary of Agriculture will require labeling of milk and milk products produced by cows injected with synthetic BGH. The labeling must state if the milk or milk product was derived from cows treated with synthetic BGH. Records must be kept as per SEC. 102. The Secretary of Agriculture will issue regulations requiring individuals involved in the sale, purchase, distribution, or injection of synthetic BGH into cows to maintain records with specific information as outlined in the regulations. The Secretary of Agriculture will issue regulations requiring records to contain details on the quantity, source, and date of synthetic BGH obtained, as well as the identity of recipients and cows injected. Additionally, regulations will be established for the sale, distribution, and administration of synthetic BGH. The Secretary of Agriculture will determine additional requirements for the use of synthetic BGH to achieve the objectives of the Act. SEC. 103. DEFINITIONS. The term \"synthetic BGH\" refers to substances like bovine somatotropin, bST, BST, bGH, or BGH, produced through recombinant DNA techniques for use in bovine animals. The term \"cow\" means a bovine animal. SEC. 104. ENFORCEMENT. SEC. 104. ENFORCEMENT. If a person fails to comply with milk labeling or recordkeeping requirements, they may face a civil penalty of up to $10,000 per violation. The Secretary of Agriculture can enforce this in US courts. The Agricultural Act of 1949 is amended to include a reduction in price for milk produced by cows injected with synthetic Bovine Growth Hormone starting January 1, 1995. This reduction applies to milk produced in the 48 contiguous States and marketed for commercial use. The Agricultural Act of 1949 is amended to include a reduction in price for milk produced by cows injected with synthetic Bovine Growth Hormone. The reduction is based on the increased cost of purchasing milk and milk products due to the injection of cows with synthetic BGH. Synthetic BGH is defined as a substance described as bovine somatotropin, bST, BST, bGH, or BGH. The Agricultural Act of 1949 is amended to include a reduction in price for milk produced by cows injected with synthetic Bovine Growth Hormone, also known as somatotropin, bST, BST, bGH, or BGH. This includes milk commingled with milk from cows injected with synthetic BGH. Subsection (g) of the Act is amended to address excess purchases. The Agricultural Act of 1949 is amended to include a reduction in price for milk produced by cows injected with synthetic Bovine Growth Hormone. Subsection (g) is amended to exclude Commodity Credit Corporation purchases covered by the price reduction received by producers who inject cows with synthetic BGH. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will develop a synthetic BGH residue test to detect residue in milk from cows injected with the hormone and ensure compliance with labeling laws. The test will be made available to public health and agricultural agencies at a low cost to dairy producers and processors."
