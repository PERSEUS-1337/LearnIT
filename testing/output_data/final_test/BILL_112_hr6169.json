    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Pathway to Job Creation through a Simpler, Fairer Tax Code Act of 2012\". Congress finds that the tax code is unfair, benefiting certain special interests and creating winners and losers. It violates the principle of equal justice by imposing different tax bills on families in similar circumstances. Many tax preferences act like government spending, diverting resources from efficient uses and hindering economic growth and job creation. Tax expenditures total over $1 trillion annually, almost matching income tax revenue. Some tax subsidies function as spending through the tax code, redistributing taxes from some Americans to those who don't pay income taxes. The lack of a stable tax code has led to economic uncertainty, with tax rates set to increase and numerous tax provisions expiring. The tax code's complexity leads to high compliance costs for individuals, families, and employers, with over 4,500 changes made since 2001. Nearly nine out of ten families hire tax preparers or use software to file taxes, while small businesses spend an average of $74 per hour on tax compliance. Compliance with the tax code is a financial burden, costing over six billion hours and $160 billion annually. Small businesses spend an average of $74 per hour on tax compliance, the most expensive paperwork burden they face. Two-thirds of jobs created in the US over the past 15 years are from small businesses, with half of their profits taxed at the top 2 individual rates. The Federal government historically collected 18-19% of GDP in tax revenues, but it will rise to 21.2% under current law, the highest level in the nation's history. The current tax code has a top Federal individual income tax rate of 35%, set to increase to over 40% in 2013. The tax code in the United States has harmful provisions like the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) and the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world. The top Federal individual income tax rate is set to increase to over 40% in 2013, potentially leading to a combined tax rate of 50% for some Americans. The United States' outdated tax code, including the highest corporate tax rate and a \"worldwide\" system of taxation, discourages employers and investors from operating in the country. This system leads to double taxation for American companies competing globally and reinvesting their earnings domestically. The world's largest companies are increasingly headquartered overseas, with only six out of the top 20 based in the United States in 2010. The US has high levels of capital taxation, surpassing most OECD and BRIC countries. The purpose of this Act is to enact comprehensive tax reform in 2013. The enactment of comprehensive tax reform in 2013 aims to create a fairer, simpler, and flatter tax code for individuals and families by lowering tax rates, eliminating loopholes, reducing complexity, repealing the Alternative Minimum Tax, maintaining progressivity, promoting savings, and reducing tax burdens on married couples and families. The comprehensive tax reform aims to benefit employers and employees, increase economic activity, and make American workers and businesses more competitive by creating a stable tax code, keeping taxes low for small businesses, and reducing the corporate tax rate. The comprehensive tax reform aims to benefit employers and employees by reducing America's corporate tax rate, maintaining parity between individual and corporate rates, promoting innovation, transitioning to a globally competitive territorial tax system, minimizing double taxation of investment, and reducing the impact of taxes on business decision-making. SEC. 3. EXPEDITED CONSIDERATION OF A MEASURE PROVIDING FOR COMPREHENSIVE TAX REFORM.
