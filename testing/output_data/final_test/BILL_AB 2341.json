    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature's intent is not to limit the creation of new judgeships, the Governor's authority to appoint judges, or the Chief Justice's authority to assign judges. Section 69614.5 is added to the Government Code. Section 69614.5 of the Government Code allows for the reallocation of up to five vacant judgeships from superior courts with more judgeships than needed to those with fewer judgeships, based on approved methodology by the Judicial Council. This aims to achieve a more equitable distribution of judgeships among superior courts. If a judgeship in a superior court becomes vacant, the Judicial Council will determine if it can be allocated to another court. A judgeship becomes vacant when an incumbent judge resigns, retires, dies, is removed, or confirmed to an appellate court judgeship before the deadline to file a declaration of intention to become a candidate for a judicial office.
