    "content": "The Act titled \"Growing Farm to School Programs Act of 2010\" aims to provide access to local foods through the Farm to School Program. The Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act is amended to establish the Farm to School Program, providing access to local foods for eligible schools participating in certain programs. The Farm to School Program provides grants and technical assistance to eligible schools, agencies, tribal organizations, producers, and nonprofits to improve access to local foods. Grants can be used for training, operations, planning, equipment purchase, school gardens, partnerships, and program implementation. The Farm to School Program provides grants up to $100,000 with a federal share not exceeding 75% of the total project cost. The Secretary aims for geographical diversity and equitable treatment of urban, rural, and tribal communities in awarding grants. The Farm to School Program requires grant recipients to provide matching support and gives priority to projects benefiting local small- and medium-sized farms, offering local food products in schools, and serving a high proportion of children. The Farm to School Program requires grant recipients to serve a high proportion of children eligible for free or reduced-price lunches, incorporate nutrition education activities, demonstrate collaboration with various organizations, include evaluation plans, show potential for long-term sustainability, and meet additional criteria determined by the Secretary. The Farm to School Program requires grant recipients to cooperate in program evaluation and receive technical assistance from the Secretary to facilitate coordination, share information, collect best practices, and disseminate research on existing farm to school programs. The Farm to School Program receives $50,000,000 in funding from the Treasury on October 1, 2010, to support underserved areas. Additionally, a pilot program is established for high-poverty schools. In paragraph (1), subparagraph (F) is amended to remove a specific reference and replace it with a more general one. Additionally, paragraph (4) is renumbered as paragraph (2). The budgetary effects of this Act will be determined by the latest statement submitted by the Chairman of the House Budget Committee for compliance with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010."
