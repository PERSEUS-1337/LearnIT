    "content": "President Bush signed the Department of Defense Appropriation for FY2006 (P.L. 109-148) on December 30, 2005, affecting Foreign Operations spending in three ways. This legislation includes $3.8 billion for addressing the avian influenza virus, with $131.5 million available to USAID for international surveillance and response. Additionally, $25 million was rescinded from the Export-Import Bank to offset costs for Hurricane Katrina relief. A 1% across-the-board reduction in non-emergency discretionary appropriations resulted in a $209 million reduction in Foreign Operations spending for FY2006. The Foreign Operations appropriation for FY2006 (P.L. 109-102; H.R. 3057) totaled $20.83 billion after adjustments. The House and Senate approved the conference report, with a significant cut of $2.1 billion (9.3%) below the President's request. This represents the largest reduction in regular Foreign Operations spending during the Bush Administration. The total amount is still $1.4 billion higher than FY2005 foreign aid. The FY2006 Foreign Operations appropriation totaled $20.83 billion, $1.4 billion higher than FY2005. The conference report cut $2.1 billion from the President's request, reducing the Millennium Challenge Account to $1.77 billion. Aid for core development accounts increased, while Iraq funding was reduced to $61 million. Aid to former Soviet states also increased. The FY2006 Foreign Operations appropriation totaled $20.83 billion, $1.4 billion higher than FY2005. The conference agreement adds $514 million for former Soviet states, increases funding for African and Inter-American Foundations, establishes a new Democracy Fund of $95 million, and allocates $2.82 billion for HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis programs. Additionally, $466 million is provided for family planning, including $34 million for the U.N. Population Fund. Key policy changes include deleting provisions on the Mexico City family planning policy and Kemp-Kasten restrictions. The enacted measure includes changes to U.S. contributions to the UNFPA and requires a portion of aid to Egypt to support democracy and human rights. The majority of the International Affairs budget goes to Foreign Operations and State Department programs. House and Senate Appropriations Committees reorganized subcommittee structures at the start of the 109th Congress, but Foreign Operations and State Department programs remain unchanged. The House Foreign Operations Committee's jurisdiction remains the same, with State Department and Broadcasting programs now funded under the Subcommittee on Science, State, Justice, Commerce, and Related Agencies. The Senate combined Foreign Operations with the State Department and Broadcasting under the Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations and Related Programs. State Department funds were moved from the Senate-passed legislation to the SSJC measure for FY2006. The report covers funding and policy issues related to Foreign Operations in H.R. 2862, the SSJC measure. It tracks the House Foreign Operations Appropriation measure and the Senate State, Foreign Operations spending bill for FY2006, with a request of $22.8 billion. Congress reviews and votes on U.S. foreign assistance through Foreign Operations. The Foreign Operations legislation is the primary vehicle for Congress to review and vote on the U.S. foreign assistance budget. It funds bilateral development assistance programs managed by USAID and other aid agencies. This includes humanitarian aid, disaster relief, refugee support, and aid programs in the former Soviet Union. The Foreign Operations legislation funds aid programs in the former Soviet Union, Central/Eastern Europe, Israel, Egypt, Afghanistan, Iraq, and countries affected by the Indian Ocean tsunami. It also supports U.S. contributions to the World Bank, regional development banks, international organizations, and export promotion agencies. The legislation includes appropriations for export promotion agencies like OPIC, Export-Import Bank, and Trade and Development Agency. It also funds the State Department, embassy construction, public diplomacy, BBG, U.N. contributions, and various educational and exchange organizations. The Foreign Operations appropriations bill funds international commissions and foreign policy agencies. Congress must pass foreign policy authorization bills before aid can be distributed. If authorization measures are not passed, appropriations bills waive the requirement for agencies to function. This adds importance to appropriation bills in funding and setting policy priorities for U.S. foreign policy. The Foreign Operations appropriations bill has been crucial for congressional oversight of foreign affairs and policy making since 1985. It has played a significant role in shaping foreign aid and policy initiatives, especially after the Cold War. The Foreign Operations appropriations bill has been vital for congressional oversight of foreign affairs since the end of the Cold War. It has been used to allocate foreign aid for global terrorism efforts post-9/11 and for Afghan and Iraqi reconstruction. Congress has utilized this legislation to impose restrictions on the Administration's management of foreign assistance, leading to clashes over presidential prerogatives in foreign policy. The FY2006 budget request raised key issues for the 109th Congress to debate, including a 15.7% increase in funding for Foreign Operations programs. The FY2006 Foreign Operations budget request raised major issues including the size of the request, funding for the global war on terror, the Millennium Challenge Account, HIV/AIDS funding, and core development programs. The FY2006 Foreign Operations budget request raised major issues including a $15 billion initiative for core development and humanitarian aid programs. Key policy and funding issues included funding for the U.S. embassy in Iraq, public diplomacy, international peacekeeping contributions, and democracy promotion activities. The rationale for foreign aid and diplomatic efforts shifted from defeating communism to addressing new global challenges. The focus of foreign aid and diplomatic efforts shifted from defeating communism to promoting economic development, policy reforms, and strengthening alliances to confront the Soviet threat. Aid programs also aimed to gain access to military bases worldwide and support secondary U.S. policy goals in the developing world. During the 1990s, American foreign policy shifted towards supporting various U.S. national interests such as preventing weapons proliferation, combating illegal drug production, promoting peace in the Middle East, resolving global conflicts, protecting human rights, and addressing human trafficking. Foreign assistance underwent significant changes with expansive aid programs in Russia and eastern-bloc states. Despite new elements in American foreign aid, no broad consensus was reached. During the 1990s, American foreign aid saw changes with a focus on sustainable development as the main strategy. Despite efforts to overhaul aid programs, a consensus on the new rationale for U.S. aid was not reached. The Clinton Administration emphasized economic assistance to achieve goals like economic growth, democratic development, population stabilization, health protection, and environmental management. The Bush Administration modified foreign aid goals to focus on economic growth, global health, and democracy. USAID identified core operational goals including promoting development, strengthening fragile states, providing humanitarian assistance, supporting geostrategic interests, and mitigating global issues like HIV/AIDS. Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, U.S. foreign policy shifted towards a strategic focus on global development as a key pillar of national security, alongside defense and diplomacy. Foreign aid priorities began to emphasize the war on terrorism, with significant assistance directed towards countries cooperating in this effort or facing terrorist threats. Reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq were also highlighted. The emphasis on using foreign aid to combat terrorism increased following the September 11, 2001 attacks. Reconstruction programs in Afghanistan and Iraq received substantial funding in FY2004. Efforts were made to build coalitions and promote American views through public diplomacy. The Bush Administration also focused on promoting economic growth, reducing poverty, and combating HIV/AIDS globally. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) was established in 2004 to deliver higher amounts of aid. The U.S. government established the Millennium Challenge Corporation in 2004 to concentrate resources in low-income countries committed to reforms. $5 billion was allocated by FY2006 to support economic growth and reduce poverty. Global health issues, including HIV/AIDS, received increased funding, with a $15 billion effort announced by President Bush in 2003. Foreign Operations funding levels have fluctuated widely over the past 30 years, with key objectives including supporting peace in the Middle East, fostering democratization and stability in crisis countries, facilitating democratization in Central Europe and the former Soviet Union, suppressing international narcotics production, and alleviating famine and refugee situations worldwide. Foreign Operations appropriations have fluctuated over the past 30 years, peaking in FY1985 at over $35 billion and hitting a low of $14.6 billion in FY1997. The Clinton Administration and outside groups campaigned to reverse the decline in foreign policy budget, leading to a slight increase in FY1998 and a continued upward trend in funding since then. Foreign Operations appropriations saw a significant increase in funding for special foreign policy contingencies and new initiatives, including aid for Central American hurricane relief, Kosovo emergency assistance, counternarcotics initiatives in Colombia, and support for the war on terrorism. Funding reached unprecedented levels in FY2003 and FY2004, with substantial supplementals approved for assistance to front line states in the war on terrorism and Iraq-war related assistance. Foreign Operations spending for FY2004 reached $41 billion, the highest level since the early 1960s. The enacted level for FY2005 was $22.75 billion, the largest in over a decade. Supplemental resources have become a significant channel of funding for U.S. international activities due to rapidly changing overseas events. Foreign aid and defense resources often lead to supplemental spending outside the regular appropriation cycle. Supplementals have funded major foreign policy events such as the Camp David accords, Central America conflicts, Africa famine, Panama and Nicaragua government transitions, the Gulf War, and Bosnia relief and reconstruction. In recent years, Congress has approved Foreign Operations supplemental appropriations exceeding $1 billion annually, including relief for Hurricane Mitch victims, Kosovo refugees, and embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. In FY1999, $1.6 billion was allocated for foreign aid, followed by a $1.1 billion supplemental in FY2000 for counternarcotics in Colombia. Additional funds were provided in FY2001 and FY2002 for foreign aid activities, with a $1.15 billion supplemental in FY2002 for Afghan reconstruction and frontline states in the war on terrorism. The $7.5 billion Iraq War supplemental in FY2003 represented nearly one-third of the Foreign Operations budget for that year. The Foreign Operations budget saw a significant increase in funding over the past three decades, with spikes related to overseas security issues. American embassies have increasingly become targets of hostile action since the Vietnam War, with terrorist attacks growing in number in the 1970s and culminating in the taking of American hostages in Tehran in 1979. In the 1980s and 1990s, there were several major attacks on U.S. embassies, leading to increased funding for security measures. This included the 1983 bombing of U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut, the 1984 bombing of the embassy annex in Beirut, and the 1998 attacks on embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Congress provided emergency supplemental appropriations to raise State Department funding levels to all-time highs by FY2004. The Clinton Administration sought to increase U.N. involvement in international peacekeeping, requesting supplemental funding in 1994. Congress appropriated $670 million for peacekeeping efforts, doubling the international peacekeeping account. During this time, efforts were made to reduce the Federal deficit, with some suggesting a peace dividend could be used to trim foreign policy agency funding. Reorganization of international broadcasting entities began in 1994. The consolidation of foreign policy agencies into the Department of State in 1999 aimed to streamline operations and save money. Secretary of State Colin Powell advocated for increased funding to address neglected technology and staffing needs. State Department spending for Administration of Foreign Affairs rose from $4 billion in FY2000 to nearly $6.8 billion in the FY2006 request, a 70% increase in real terms. Appropriations Committees typically begin markups of spending bills after Congress adopts a budget. After Congress adopts a budget, Committees start markups of spending bills. Funds are distributed to Appropriations panels through the Section 302(a) allocation process. House and Senate Appropriations Committees then decide how to allocate funds among subcommittees, following the Section 302(b) allocation. Foreign Operations and State Department funds are part of the International Affairs budget function. The allocation of International Affairs money among subcommittees is a key decision. The budget resolution for FY2006 reduced discretionary budget authority for International Affairs funding compared to the President's request. The House cut Function 150 by $1.6 billion, while the Senate set spending $350 million below the Administration's proposal. The final agreement on the budget resolution cut deeper into funding. The final agreement on H.Con.Res. 95 for FY2006 reduced the International Affairs budget by $2.4 billion, 7% less than the President's request. House and Senate Appropriations Committees have the flexibility to allocate the budget differently, creating a challenging budget picture for appropriation subcommittees. The House Appropriations Committee announced subcommittee allocations on May 5, providing $20.27 billion to the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, 11% below the Administration's recommendation. Despite a substantial increase sought for the Millennium Challenge Account, the House Subcommittee recommended a cut to $1.75 billion to meet its allocation target. The House Subcommittee allocated $20.27 billion to the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, 11% below the Administration's recommendation. The House SSJC Subcommittee received $57.5 billion, 5.2% less than requested, with State Department programs absorbing a $272 million reduction. In contrast, the Senate allocated $31.67 billion to the State, Foreign Operations Subcommittee, $1 billion less than requested. The Senate allocated $31.67 billion to the State, Foreign Operations Subcommittee, $1 billion less than requested. The Senate passed a bill providing $1.8 billion for the MCA, $1.2 billion less than the request. The budget authority cap for Foreign Operations was set at $20.94 billion, about $670 million higher than the original House amount. The Senate bill included funds for State Department/Broadcasting, which were later moved to the SSJC appropriation. The President's FY2006 budget request included $22.8 billion for Foreign Operations and $9.8 billion for State Department and Related Agencies, marking a significant increase from FY2005. Total Foreign Operations for FY2005 increased with the passage of the FY2005 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations. The FY2006 budget proposed a 2.5% increase in Foreign Operations funding and an 8.7% decrease in State Department and related programs. The budget highlighted foreign aid for the war on terrorism as a top priority, with increases in aid to front-line states and global counter-terror programs. The President's budget also included significant funding for two new foreign aid initiatives. The President's FY2006 budget proposed increased funding for foreign aid initiatives, including the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) and the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). The MCA request doubled to $3 billion, while PEPFAR funds would rise to $2.56 billion. Additionally, a Crisis Response Fund of $100 million was proposed, along with increased funding for the International Narcotics and Law Enforcement program to combat opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan. The Administration proposed a nearly three-fold increase in programs to combat opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan and sought to transfer $300 million in food assistance to enhance flexibility and lower costs for emergency food relief overseas. The total funding for these initiatives was $12.5 billion, 26% higher than FY2005. The House passed a foreign aid budget of $20.27 billion, $2.55 billion less than the President's request. The House proposed a foreign aid budget of $20.27 billion, which was $2.55 billion less than the President's request. The House measure included reductions in various areas such as the Millennium Challenge Account, aid to Iraq, Conflict Response Fund, Global Environment Facility, and refugee aid. However, funding for HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis was increased to $2.696 billion, with $400 million allocated for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Malaria, and Tuberculosis. Additionally, $466 million was proposed for family planning programs. The House proposed $466 million for family planning programs and the U.N. Population Fund in H.R. 3057. The bill also included $367 million for Sudan, with $69 million for Darfur. An amendment earmarked $50 million of Egypt's $495 million economic aid package for democracy and governance activities, and $50 million for basic education programs. U.S. economic assistance to Egypt included cash transfers and commodity import programs for job creation and trade enhancement. The Committee rejected amendments to shift $40 million of Egypt's military aid to economic programs and to require a report on Israel's West Bank settlements policy. The legislation provided full funding for Israel and Egypt as requested. House Members approved amendments including barring Export-Import Bank loans for nuclear power plants in China, prohibiting military training funds for Saudi Arabia, and banning aid to countries that refuse to extradite individuals accused of certain crimes. The Beauprez amendment blocked aid to countries that did not extradite individuals accused of killing American law enforcement officers. The House approved the Deal amendment banning assistance to nations that do not extradite individuals charged with crimes resulting in life imprisonment without parole. The amendment added $9 million to the State Department's Human Rights and Disarmament Fund and prohibited aid to Romania. Additionally, the House rejected amendments, including transferring military aid to Egypt for malaria programs and reducing funds by $100 million. The Senate passed H.R. 3057 on July 20, recommending a $31.67 billion combined measure for State Department and Foreign Operations activities. The bill proposed $22.16 billion for Foreign Operations programs, $664 million less than the President's request. For State Department activities, the measure recommended about $9.5 billion, 3.4% less than the request. Major changes included reducing funding for the Millennium Challenge Account to $1.8 billion and increasing funding for HIV/AIDS programs by $400 million. The Senate passed a $31.67 billion combined measure for State Department and Foreign Operations activities, with key details including increased funding for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, full funding for counter-terrorism and counter-narcotics accounts, aid to strategic states, and adjustments to refugee aid, development programs, and international family planning programs. The Senate passed a $31.67 billion combined measure for State Department and Foreign Operations activities, with increased aid for states of the former Soviet Union to $565 million, $83 million higher than the request. A new account\u2014the Democracy Fund\u2014provided $175 million, including $80 million for the National Endowment for Democracy. The Senate measure included $1.45 billion for democracy and human rights activities. Full funding was provided for the Global Environment Facility ($117 million) and State Department activities, including Diplomatic and Consular programs, International Broadcasting, Educational and Cultural Exchanges, and the National Endowment for Democracy. Funding for embassy security was reduced by $22 million. The Senate passed a $31.67 billion combined measure for State Department and Foreign Operations activities, with increased aid for states of the former Soviet Union to $565 million. Major amendments approved included adding $100 million to the U.S. contribution to the Global ATM Fund, barring aid for State Department programs for countries refusing to extradite criminals to the U.S., and setting aside $50 million of Egypt's economic aid for education programs. The House measure allocated $100 million for democracy and education, transferred $50 million for aid to the African Union's mission in Sudan, and made $105 million available for malaria programs. U.S. funds for UNFPA were limited to specific activities, and the Senate defeated proposals including a ban on Eximbank loans for nuclear projects. The Senate rejected proposals including a ban on Eximbank loans for nuclear projects in China and funding cuts for television broadcasting to Cuba. The House approved $20.94 billion for Foreign Operations in FY2006. Congress also approved additional funding for USAID programs addressing the avian influenza virus. In FY2006, $131.5 million was allocated for USAID programs addressing the avian influenza virus, with a $25 million offset from the Export-Import Bank for Hurricane Katrina costs. Most discretionary budget authority accounts were reduced by 1%, resulting in an approximate $209 million cut in Foreign Operations accounts. The net Foreign Operations total, after adjustments, is $20.83 billion, falling $2.1 billion below the President's request. This represents the largest cut in regular Foreign Operations spending during the Bush Administration. The conferees reduced the President's proposed Millennium Challenge Account to $1.77 billion and cut security-related economic aid by $400 million. They provided only $61 million in ESF aid for Iraq instead of the $360 million requested. Other major ESF recipients received the requested amounts: Israel\u2014$240 million; Egypt\u2014$495 million; Pakistan\u2014$300 million; Jordan\u2014$250 million; and Palestinians\u2014$150 million. The conference agreement allocated funds for various countries: Pakistan received $300 million, Jordan received $250 million, and Palestinians received $150 million. Specific allocations were made for democracy, education, and other programs. Reductions were made in various areas, such as USAID operating expenses, conflict response fund, refugee aid, and debt reduction. Some programs received additional funds, while others were cut. The conference agreement allocated funds for various countries, with boosts in core bilateral development aid accounts for Child Survival/Health, Development Assistance, and the Global AIDS Initiative. The total amount for HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis programs increased to $2.82 billion, including $450 million for the Global Fund. Family planning received a total of $466 million, with $34 million as a contribution to the UN Population Fund. Conferees expressed concern over proposed reductions for African countries and added funds accordingly. The conference agreement allocated funds for various countries in Africa, with boosts in core bilateral development aid accounts. The agreement does not include the Senate provision transferring $50 million for military aid to support the African Union's mission in Sudan. Conferees increased aid to former Soviet states by 6.6% to $514 million. Funding was also added for the African and Inter-American Foundations, as well as voluntary contributions to international organizations like the U.N. Development Program, UNICEF, and the U.N. Development Fund for Women. The conference agreement includes funding for various international organizations like UNICEF and the U.N. Development Fund for Women. It establishes a new Democracy Fund account and increases democracy-promotion activities funding. Key policy issues addressed include the Mexico City family planning policy and aid restrictions on countries. The conference agreement includes restrictions on aid to countries that refuse to extradite individuals to the US, with a waiver for national interest. Aid to Saudi Arabia is banned unless they cooperate in combating terrorism. Indonesia can receive military financing and arms sales with certain determinations and a waiver for national interest. American foreign aid has shifted towards supporting coalition countries and counter-terrorism efforts since 2001. Congress has allocated $46.2 billion in Foreign Operations funding from FY2002-FY2005 to support key coalition countries in the war on terrorism and address post-conflict needs in Iraq and surrounding nations. Nearly half of the appropriations in the past four years have been for terrorism or Iraq war-related purposes. While there is debate on the direct impact of foreign aid on reducing terrorism, most agree that economic and security assistance can indirectly help by reducing poverty, promoting jobs, and stabilizing conflict-prone nations. The FY2006 budget allocated $5.8 billion for fighting terrorism, with key recipients including Afghanistan, Pakistan, Jordan, and Iraq. Questions were raised about the aid package for Afghanistan, which did not include military assistance for training and equipping the Afghan army. The Administration proposed shifting military aid programs to the Defense Department and sought $1.3 billion for Afghan military aid in the FY2005 Emergency Supplemental. Congress approved the shift but required the Secretary of State to concur with DOD decisions on programming funds. The FY2006 request for front-line states included Iraq reconstruction funds for the first time. The Administration's $414 million proposal for Iraq reconstruction funds in FY2006 focused on democracy, governance, and economic reconstruction activities. Critics argued that there were sufficient unobligated funds from previous allocations. By October 26, 2005, 81% of the funds from P.L. 108-106 had been obligated, with 49% spent. In FY2006, 49% of the $18.44 billion allocated for anti-terrorism programs had been spent. The House bill did not specify assistance amounts for front-line states in the war on terror, reducing proposed aid to Iraq and Pakistan. Pakistan's funding was cut due to concerns about incremental military procurement. Turkey's funding was also reduced, and military assistance to Uzbekistan was prohibited. The House recommended funding levels for Turkey, Jordan, and Afghanistan, with added conditions for Afghan aid due to concerns over government cooperation and support for anti-narcotics efforts. Afghan counter-narcotics aid was reduced to $135 million, requiring a report on the U.S. strategy for combating poppy cultivation and heroin trafficking. The House recommended funding levels for Turkey, Jordan, and Afghanistan, with added conditions for Afghan aid due to concerns over government cooperation and support for anti-narcotics efforts. The House fully funded the $430 million ESF request for Afghanistan but barred the expenditure of $205 million until certification of full cooperation on narcotics eradication. The Senate bill fully funded country aid levels for key partners in the global war on terrorism, including Afghanistan at $920 million. A Senate floor amendment cut $100 million from ESF appropriations, potentially impacting assistance in the war on terror. The conference agreement on H.R. 3057 places constraints on assistance in the war on terror from the ESF account. The ESF funding for Iraq is reduced to $61 million instead of $360 million, while Afghanistan receives $931.4 million in total assistance. $225 million in ESF funding is withheld until cooperation with U.S. counter-narcotics efforts in Afghanistan is certified. H.R. 3057 proposed $147 million for specific counter-terrorism programs. The FY2006 Foreign Operations budget proposed $147 million for counter-terrorism programs, slightly higher than FY2005 but $12 million less than the President's request. The Senate fully funded the executive's proposal, while conferees set levels at $146 million, $13 million below the request. The largest funding increase is for the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA), a program aimed at transforming how the US provides economic assistance to developing nations. The Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) is a program that aims to provide economic assistance to developing nations pursuing political and economic reforms in areas such as good governance, healthcare, education, and promoting open markets. If fully funded at $5 billion per year, it would be one of the largest increases in foreign aid spending in half a century. The Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) is a $5 billion commitment program that rewards countries for past actions with 16 performance indicators. It segregates funds from U.S. foreign policy objectives and requires program proposals from qualifying countries with civil society involvement. The FY2006 request was $3 billion, less than the $5 billion target set in 2002. The MCC's Board selected 23 countries for the program in FY2004-FY2006 and signed five Compacts. Some Members of Congress are concerned about the slow start of the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) program, which has only spent a small portion of the $2.5 billion allocated for FY2004 and FY2005. They question the doubling of the budget for the untested program while other development assistance programs face cuts in FY2006. The MCC argues that more Compacts will be signed soon, existing resources will be fully utilized by the end of 2005, and an additional $3 billion is needed for new countries in FY2006. The House-passed bill recommended $1.75 billion for the MCA. The House-passed bill recommended $1.75 billion for the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) in FY2006, $262 million higher than FY2005 but $1.25 billion below the President's request. The House Appropriations Committee noted the reduction was due to budget constraints and recommended maximizing resources for new compacts. The Senate measure provided a slightly higher MCA appropriation of $1.8 billion, citing budget constraints as well. The MCC had obligated less than $34 million of the nearly $2.5 billion in existing funds, with concerns about coordination and consistency with other U.S. aid programs in MCA countries. The conference agreement provides $1.77 billion for the MCA. President Bush pledged $15 billion over five years for HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment in heavily affected countries in Africa and the Caribbean. President Bush pledged $15 billion over five years for HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment in heavily affected countries in Africa and the Caribbean. The funds are channeled through the State Department's Global HIV/AIDS Initiative, aiming to prevent new infections, provide anti-retroviral drugs, and care for infected individuals in 15 focus countries. These nations include 12 in sub-Saharan Africa, Haiti, Guyana, and Vietnam, where half of the 39 million HIV-positive people reside. For FY2006, the President requested $3.16 billion for international HIV/AIDS initiatives, with a focus on the State Department's GHAI program in 15 countries. Funding for non-focus countries remained stable, while USAID's malaria and tuberculosis assistance would decrease by 35%. Allocation of PEPFAR budget for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria has been a contentious issue. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria is an international organization established in 2001 to receive contributions from countries to finance health programs in nations facing health crises. Congress has increased funding for the Global Fund to between $350 million and $550 million annually since FY2003. The President proposed $300 million for the Global Fund for FY2006, below congressional appropriations in previous years. The House-passed measure provided $2.695 billion for PEPFAR programs, including $2.32 billion for the Global Fund. The House recommended $2.32 billion for HIV/AIDS activities, with additional funds for malaria and tuberculosis programs under PEPFAR. The Global Fund received $400 million, double the President's request. The Senate provided $2.97 billion for PEPFAR, $400 million more than requested. The House also increased USAID bilateral HIV/AIDS programs for non-focus countries to $350 million, reducing funds for focus countries by about $150 million. The total funding for PEPFAR in FY2006 was $2.82 billion, with $450 million allocated for the Global Fund. The funding included $2.43 billion for HIV/AIDS programs, $151 million for tuberculosis, and $242.5 million for malaria activities. When combined with other appropriations, the total PEPFAR funding for FY2006 was $3.45 billion. In FY2006, total funding for USAID development assistance and global health programs reached $3.45 billion, contributing to the President's $15 billion, five-year plan. Congressional priorities include child survival, basic education, and combating HIV/AIDS and infectious diseases. Disagreements arise over how to allocate the $3 billion \"core\" budget, with Congress pushing for increased funding in certain areas at the expense of others like economic growth and the environment. In the mid-to-late 1990s, development aid funding worldwide decreased significantly, impacting resources for sectors like economic growth and the environment. Despite increased development assistance since FY2003, there are concerns about resource allocation flexibility. USAID Administrator Natsios highlighted issues with development contractors, NGOs, and other groups implementing USAID programs. Administrator Natsios criticizes major implementors of USAID programs for lobbying Congress to earmark higher funds for certain sectors, leading to funding gaps in other areas. Despite increased overall funding for development aid, concerns remain about resource allocation flexibility. In FY2006, development assistance would grow by over $1.7 billion, or 29%, under the President's request. Concerns were raised about the new initiatives not being a substitute for traditional programs. The State Department's Global AIDS Initiative and the MCA program saw significant increases in funding, while traditional USAID accounts received about $370 million less than in FY2005. Comparing funding levels for individual components is recommended for a more informative analysis of the FY2006 proposal. The FY2006 budget proposal shows a mixed picture with substantial increases in Economic Growth, Higher Education, and Conflict Management activities, but large cuts in most health categories. Comparing funding levels for individual components is recommended for a more informative analysis. The House passed H.R. 3057, restoring funding reductions proposed by the Administration for various development and health accounts. The bill provided nearly $1.5 billion for the Child Survival and Health account, with increased levels for vulnerable children, infectious diseases, reproductive health, and child survival and maternal health. Total funding in the bill amounted to $1.74 billion, $245 million higher than the President's request. The House proposal increased funding for the Development Assistance account by $82 million, with a total of $500 million allocated for the Child Survival and Health account, 40% higher than the request. The Senate bill further raised these amounts, with the Development Assistance account growing by $300 million over the request. Both House and Senate bills restored most of the spending reductions recommended by the executive branch. Child Survival programs receive $1.585 billion, 26% higher than the request, while Development Assistance activities are funded at $1.524 billion, 11% higher than proposed. Key development and health funding additions and earmarks specifically proposed in House, Senate, and conference versions H.R. 3057 are outlined in Table 10. The Administration proposed realigning four appropriation accounts for FY2006 to provide USAID with greater flexibility in responding to changing development needs. The State Department created the Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization to address the needs of fragile, failing, and post-conflict states, which can threaten U.S. interests. Legislation is being considered to expand this office, and funding is included in the State Department appropriations budget. USAID is proposing to transfer economic growth and democracy program resources for four \"fragile\" states. The FY2006 USAID request recommended shifting $275 million in development aid for Ethiopia, Sudan, Haiti, and Afghanistan to the Transition Initiatives (TI) account, totaling a $325 million TI appropriation request. The TI account supports countries in crisis or transitioning from conflict to stable development, bridging the gap between humanitarian intervention and long-term development. This marked the first time USAID would manage a core appropriation to the TI Office. The FY2006 USAID request proposed shifting $275 million in development aid to the Transition Initiatives (TI) account, totaling a $325 million TI appropriation request. This would allow USAID greater flexibility in designing programs to achieve results in a shorter time frame. The TI account does not include congressional earmarks and permits a shorter congressional review period for new activities, avoiding delays in the contracting and congressional notification processes. Some Members questioned the necessity of the account realignment for USAID program funding priorities in FY2006. Concerns were raised about potential erosion of congressional oversight in fragile state programs. USAID planned to manage TI programs similarly to regular development assistance activities. The Administration aimed to transfer $300 million from the PL480 Title II food assistance program to the International Disaster and Famine Assistance account in Foreign Operations, without affecting resources for international food aid. The Administration proposed transferring $300 million from the PL480 Title II food assistance program to the International Disaster and Famine Assistance account in Foreign Operations. This change would allow the funds to purchase commodities in developing nations, providing additional markets and income sources to local farmers and potentially reducing transportation costs. Some in Congress opposed the realignment of PL480 and IDFA accounts, fearing it would weaken support for American farmers. Critics raised concerns about the quality of foreign-purchased commodities and the lack of proper standards and inspections. They suggested pre-positioning food near famine-prone regions for immediate access. House, Senate, and conference measures rejected the Administration's account realignment proposals. The House Appropriations Committee noted that the Transition Initiative proposal was meant for targeted situations, not total USAID aid in a specific country, due to funding constraints. The House Appropriations Committee rejected the Administration's proposal to realign PL480 and IDFA accounts, citing concerns about weakening support for American farmers. The Committee did not recommend moving $300 million from the PL480 program to USAID's disaster and famine assistance account due to funding constraints. The Senate increased funding for regular disaster and famine assistance by $44.5 million. The FY2006 Agriculture Appropriations bill provided $1.107 billion for title II of PL480, $222 million more than requested. However, the combined House action would result in a $78 million cut to the Administration's food aid request. The Senate recommended a higher PL480 funding level of $1.15 billion. Population assistance and family planning programs overseas have been controversial during Foreign Operations debates for nearly two decades. The Administration requested $425 million for these programs in FY2006. The Administration requested $425 million for international reproductive health and family planning programs in FY2006, including $25 million for the UN Population Fund (UNFPA). This represents an 8% cut from the previous year's funding. Congress debates whether to support UNFPA due to allegations of coercive family planning in China and whether abortion-related restrictions should be applied to USAID population aid grants. Restrictions on USAID population aid grants, known as the \"Mexico City\" policy, have been debated due to concerns over UNFPA's practices in China. The Kemp-Kasten amendment bars U.S. funds to organizations involved in coercive abortion or sterilization programs. President Clinton determined UNFPA's lack of involvement in coercive programs in China. Congress appropriated around $25 million for UNFPA annually, with reductions based on spending in China. The U.S. contribution to UNFPA has fluctuated between $21.5 million and $25 million due to concerns over its practices in China. Despite Congress earmarking funds for UNFPA, the Administration has found it ineligible under the Kemp-Kasten restrictions and redirected the funds to other women's programs. The State Department has repeatedly determined UNFPA to be in violation of the Kemp-Kasten provision. The UNFPA was found in violation of the Kemp-Kasten provision on September 17, 2005. The $34 million earmarked for UNFPA will now be used by USAID for family planning and health programs. The debate over international family planning and abortion policies dates back to 1973 when Congress prohibited the use of U.S. funds for abortion-related activities. The Mexico City policy, initiated in the mid-1980s, restricted funds for foreign NGOs involved in abortion activities. President George W. Bush reversed President Clinton's decision in 2001, reinstating the Mexico City Policy to prohibit the use of U.S. funds for abortion-related work both domestically and abroad. This decision aimed to ensure taxpayer funds were not used to pay for abortions or promote abortion. President Bush's press secretary confirmed the commitment to maintain $425 million for population assistance to prevent abortion through family planning services. USAID implemented policy language aligning with the Mexico City policy, allowing organizations to provide post-abortion care. Critics oppose the certification requirement, fearing service cutbacks due to uncertainty. Opponents fear that planning organizations may reduce services due to uncertainty over restrictions, risking USAID funding eligibility. They argue that the new conditions strain relations with the U.S. Government and impose restrictions on foreign NGOs' ability to advocate for changes in abortion laws. Critics note that this would be unconstitutional if applied to American groups. Supporters of the certification requirement argue that money is fungible despite the ban on using USAID funds for abortions. Since the reinstatement of the Mexico City policy in early 2001, there have been attempts to reverse the ban on USAID funds being used for abortions. Despite several bills introduced, only the Senate FY2004 Foreign Operations appropriations bill included language to overturn the policy. An amendment by Senator Boxer to S. 600 was approved by the Senate in 2005, but the bill is still under consideration and has not received a final vote. The House bill, H.R. 3057, earmarked $432 million for bilateral family planning aid for FY2006, with an additional $34 million for UNFPA. The Senate bill provided higher funding levels, with $450 million for USAID programs and $35 million for UNFPA. The House maintained restrictions on funds, while the Senate altered key conditions for funding availability. The Senate bill allocated $35 million for UNFPA, with funds to be kept separate, not spent in China, or used for abortions. If UNFPA is deemed ineligible, $20 million will be transferred to USAID for family planning. Contributions are limited to six purposes including safe childbirth, contraceptive supplies, and maternal health care in disaster areas. The Senate bill, H.R. 3057, included modified Kemp-Kasten language regarding UNFPA funding eligibility, specifying that funds cannot be given if the organization \"directly\" supports coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization. It also introduced exceptions to past applications of the Kemp-Kasten language and rejected the President's Mexico City policy. The Senate bill included provisions regarding foreign NGOs receiving U.S. funds for health services, with exemptions for advocacy and lobbying activities. This could potentially lift current restrictions on American NGOs. The White House opposed changes to the Kemp-Kasten and Mexico City policies, threatening to veto H.R. 3057. Conferees dropped Senate-passed modifications, maintaining current restrictions. The conference agreement allocated $432 million for bilateral family planning programs, with an additional $34 million for UNFPA if eligible under Kemp-Kasten. If ineligible, funds would go towards bilateral family planning. Specific activities for UNFPA contributions were not outlined, and a $100 million contingency fund was proposed within the State Department. The Administration proposed a $100 million contingency fund within the State Department to respond quickly to foreign crises, focusing on stability and reconstruction needs. This fund would allow for the mobilization of emergency civilian presence in the field. Unlike previous requests, the Conflict Response Fund is part of a broader State Department strategy to address security risks in weak, fragile, and post-conflict states. Senator Lugar played a significant role in encouraging this initiative in mid-2004. The Department created the Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization in mid-2004 with encouragement from Senator Lugar to manage the U.S. government's response to crisis situations. The Conflict Response Fund was proposed to be used in international crises threatening American interests, but the House denied the $100 million funding. However, the Administration was granted authority to reprogram funds from other accounts for similar purposes with congressional notification. The Senate proposed $24 million for the Fund, but an amendment transferred $50 million to the FMF account for African Union's mission in Sudan. The conference agreement denied funding for the Conflict Response Fund and requested a specific strategy for coordinating post-conflict efforts. The Foreign Operations proposal for FY2006 seeks to increase aid activities in some areas while cutting resources for others. Significant appropriation increases and key congressional actions include the Export-Import Bank resources increasing to $226 million, allowing for $13.76 billion in loans. H.R. 3057 reduced the request to $158 million but permitted the use of remaining funds for tied aid purposes. Conferees set Eximbank funding at $139 million, below the requested levels. Congress rescinded $25 million of Eximbank appropriations in P.L. 109-148 for Hurricane Katrina relief costs. The House measure provided $630 million for USAID administrative costs, $17 million higher than FY2005 levels but over $50 million less than the request. The Senate bill set appropriations at $620 million, with the conference agreement providing $630 million. Peace Corps spending would have increased by 9%, falling below the level needed to double volunteers by FY2007. H.R. 3057 proposed $325 million for the Peace Corps in the House, while the Senate recommended $320 million. Conferees approved $322 million. Refugee assistance was also mentioned. The Senate recommended $320 million for refugee assistance, while conferees approved $322 million. The funding would have increased by 17% over FY2005 regular appropriations, with one-third allocated for overseas programs and two-thirds for refugee admissions into the United States. H.R. 3057 passed the House with $791 million, slightly above FY2005 levels but lower than the FY2006 request. The denial of refugee funds for Iraq would help offset the gap between the request and the House recommendation. The Senate bill provided $900 million, slightly higher than the request, and the conference agreement settled on $791 million. Peacekeeping funds would have grown by 10%, including the expansion of the Global Peace Operations Initiative. The House bill included $178 million for peacekeeping, $74 million more than FY2005 regular funding but $18 million less than the request. The House Appropriations Committee supported the Global Peace Operations Initiative (GPOI) proposal but reduced the request by $18 million, citing implementation challenges beyond Africa. The Senate bill recommended $196 million for peacekeeping, slightly more than the request, with $114 million allocated for GPOI. The conference agreement includes $175 million for the PKO account, which is slightly below the request. It also includes $950 million for the World Bank's International Development Association (IDA) and $135.7 million for the African Development Fund, as requested. Additionally, $107.5 million is proposed for the Global Environment Facility (GEF). The President proposed $107.5 million for the Global Environment Facility (GEF) in FY2006, slightly higher than FY2005. The House deleted all GEF funds due to lack of performance-based allocation system. The Senate fully funded GEF at $80 million, while other Foreign Operations accounts saw reductions in funding, including a $85 million cut for assistance to former Soviet states and Eastern Europe. The Senate set funding at $960 million, $84 million higher than the request for former Soviet states and $13 million more for Eastern Europe. Major additions include those for Russia (+$37 million), Armenia (+$20 million), Georgia (+$8 million), Ukraine (+$7 million), Kosovo (+$8 million), and Serbia (+$15 million). The Senate measure also reduced economic assistance for Uzbekistan by $1.5 million. The conference agreement provides $361 million for Eastern Europe and $514 million for former Soviet States. Worldwide totals for Foreign Military Financing (FMF) would have declined by over $150 million under the request, but this was due to military aid for Afghanistan shifting to DOD appropriations. Adjusting for this transfer, the FMF request was 5% higher than FY2005 regular levels. The House provided $4.44 billion in FMF funding, $146 million below the request. The Senate provided $4.5 billion in FMF funding, with adjustments for Pakistan, Turkey, and Uzbekistan. The Senate also included additional funding for the Philippines, regional states in Asia, and the African Union's mission in Sudan. Voluntary contributions to international organizations would have decreased by 13% under the request. Voluntary contributions to international organizations would have decreased by 13% under the request, with proposed reductions for UNICEF and the U.N. Development Program. H.R. 3057, as passed in the House, restored the proposed cuts, raising amounts to $329 million, $3 million more than FY2005 and $47 million more than the request. The House bill provided $110 million for UNDP, $20 million more than requested, and $127 million for UNICEF, $3 million more than FY2005 and $13 million higher than the Administration. The Senate measure provided $330 million for the account, including $128 million for UNICEF, $110 million for UNDP, and $20 million \"reserved\" for UNFPA. The conference agreement includes $329.5 million, with $110 million for UNDP, $127 million for UNICEF, and $22.5 million for UNFPA. Since FY2003, Iraq has been the largest recipient of U.S. assistance, with Israel and Egypt also receiving significant aid. Changes in aid allocations have occurred due to events like the September 11 attacks, the Iraq war, and the PEPFAR program. The FY2006 aid request follows similar patterns from previous years, with additional PEPFAR countries becoming top recipients. Countries receiving over $100 million in FY2005 and requested for FY2006 are listed, reflecting shifts in U.S. aid distribution strategies. The Administration uses economic and military assistance to maintain an international coalition for the war on terrorism. Pakistan, Jordan, Indonesia, and the Philippines are key aid recipients. The Andean region countries also receive significant aid. The Administration provides economic and military assistance to countries in the Andean region like Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia for counternarcotics efforts and alternative development programs. The President's international HIV/AIDS initiative has also influenced aid allocations, with countries like Uganda, Ethiopia, Kenya, Zambia, South Africa, and Nigeria receiving significant assistance. Some countries in the Balkans and former Soviet Union are not among the top recipients of U.S. aid. Several countries in the Balkans and the former Soviet Union, including Serbia, Montenegro, Kosovo, Russia, Armenia, and Georgia, have seen declining aid levels. Armenia and Georgia, as MCA-eligible countries, may receive grants that could increase aid to $100 million annually. Turkey, a long-time aid recipient, is no longer on the list. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees have different jurisdictions for spending measures, with budgets for the Department of State, Broadcasting Board of Governors, and U.S. contributions to international organizations falling under the Science, State, Justice, Commerce, and Related Agency appropriations. Under the new Senate Appropriations Committee organization, the State Department and BBG programs were combined with Foreign Operations programs. Committees agreed to include State Department and BBG spending for FY2006 in the SSJC Appropriation. Senator Lugar introduced a State Department authorization bill for FY2006 and FY2007, while Representative Chris Smith introduced a House version. The Administration requested a funding level of $9.15 billion for the Department of State. The Administration requested a funding level of $9.15 billion for the Department of State in 2005, representing a 13.6% increase over the previous year. Additionally, the request for international broadcasting was $652 million, a 10.2% increase. The State Department's mission is to advance and protect U.S. interests worldwide through various responsibilities. The State Department's staff size has increased due to the integration of ACDA and USIA. Currently employing approximately 30,000 people, 60% work overseas. The FY2006 appropriations proposals include funding for overseas operations, conducting foreign policy activities, passport and visa applications, regional bureaus, and post assignment travel. The Administration requested $4.47 billion for D&CP in the FY2006 budget, a 7.2% increase. The FY2006 budget requested $4.47 billion for D&CP, with $334 million for public diplomacy and $690 million for security upgrades. The House recommended $4.44 billion, including $689.5 million for security upgrades and $340 million for public diplomacy. The Senate recommended $4.44 billion, with $328 million for public diplomacy and $689.5 million for security upgrades. The final conference report allocated $4.37 billion for D&CP, with $334 million for public diplomacy and $689.5 million for security upgrades. In early 1998, Congress allocated $640 million for the Security and Maintenance account for U.S. diplomatic missions abroad. After the embassy bombings in Africa, Congress approved over $1 billion for security upgrades. The President requested $616 million for regular expenditures and $910 million for worldwide security upgrades in FY2006, totaling $1.52 billion. Funding for U.S. embassies in Iraq and Afghanistan was not included in the President's FY2006 budget but was proposed in the FY2005 Emergency Supplemental Appropriation. The President signed a Supplemental Appropriation on May 11 (P.L. 109-13; H.R. 1268) for embassy security upgrades. The House recommended $603.5 million for regular ESCM and $910.2 million for worldwide security upgrades, while the Senate recommended $603.8 million for regular ESCM and $900.2 million for security upgrades. The conference report allocated $598.8 million for regular ESCM and $910.2 million for worldwide security upgrades. This funding supports programs authorized by the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961. The Office of U.S. Government International Exchange and Training Coordination was created in July 1997. Congress allocated $237 million for the FY2002 budget, with $125 million for the Fulbright programs. Funding for FY2003 was $244 million, including $132 million for Fulbright. The FY2004 budget set funding for Educational and Cultural Exchanges at $317 million, with $150 million for Fulbright. The FY2006 request totaled $430 million, with $180 million targeted for key Muslim populations. The FY2006 budget request included $180 million targeted for key Muslim populations. H.R. 2862 provided $410.4 million, $20 million below the President's request but $54.5 million above FY2005. The Senate recommended $440 million for exchanges, while the conference report settled on $431.8 million, $1.4 million more than the President requested. The CIF was established to purchase information technology and capital equipment for efficient resource management. In FY1998, Congress approved a 250% increase in the fund. For FY2006, the Bush Administration requested $133 million for CIF. The Centralized Information Technology Modernization Program funding request for FY2006 saw a 3.7% increase compared to FY2005. The House recommended $69.1 million, the Senate recommended $58.9 million for CIF and $74.1 million for the program. The final conference report allocated $58.9 million for CIF and $69.4 million for the program. U.S. contributions to U.N. international organizations have faced challenges due to various issues, including funding related to international family planning policies and disagreements over the U.N.'s role in global disputes like Iraq. The U.S. faced challenges with U.N. contributions due to disagreements over Iraq and loss of seat on the U.N. Commission on Human Rights. Legislation allowed arrearage payments after 9/11. Membership in international organizations benefits U.S. interests and shares costs with other countries. The U.S. faced challenges with U.N. contributions due to disagreements over Iraq and loss of seat on the U.N. Commission on Human Rights. Legislation allowed arrearage payments after 9/11. Membership in international organizations benefits U.S. interests and shares costs with other countries. Payments to various international organizations were included in the FY2006 budget, with President Bush requesting $1.3 billion for these organizations, representing full funding of U.S. assessed contributions. The House-passed bill provided slightly less funding than requested, while the Senate measure included the same amount as FY2005. The final conference report settled on $1.166 billion for international organizations and $1.04 billion for U.N. assessed peacekeeping efforts. The U.N. assessed peacekeeping budget saw a significant increase in the President's FY2006 request, totaling $1.04 billion, a 114.2% increase over the previous year. Concerns were raised about the lack of appropriations for new peacekeeping missions voted for by the Administration. The FY2006 request was more than double the FY2005 funding level. Additionally, $780 million was proposed for CIPA in the FY2005 emergency supplemental request. The House, Senate, and conference bills recommended $1.035 billion for the FY2006 CIPA account. The FY2006 CIPA account received recommendations of $1.035 billion from the House, Senate, and conference bills, as requested by the President. The International Commissions account includes various commissions such as the U.S.-Mexico Boundary and Water Commission. The FY2006 request of $70 million was an 11.1% increase from the previous year. The House recommended $63.8 million, the Senate approved $70 million, and the conference report included $67.3 million for international commissions. The Asia Foundation supports democratic processes in Asia. The Asia Foundation receives government and private sector contributions to support democratic processes and institutions in Asia. Congress funded the Foundation at $12.8 million for FY2005, exceeding the President's request of $8.9 million. The Administration requested $10 million for FY2006, a 22% decrease from FY2005 funds. Additionally, a trust fund was established for the International Center for Middle Eastern-Western Dialogue with $6.9 million for perpetual operations in Istanbul, Turkey. Despite no FY2005 funding request for the Center, Congress provided support. The National Endowment for Democracy (NED) received $7.3 million in FY2005 funding from Congress, despite the Administration not requesting any funds. NED supports democratic institutions in over 90 countries and operates as a private nonprofit organization. Critics argue that NED duplicates U.S. government democracy programs and could operate solely on private funding. President Bush proposed doubling NED's funding to $80 million in FY2005, but Congress provided $60 million instead. The National Endowment for Democracy (NED) received $60 million for FY2005 from Congress, with a focus on democracy promotion activities in the Middle East. The Administration's FY2006 budget request for NED remained at $80 million, representing a 35.1% increase over the previous year. The East-West Center's FY2006 request decreased by 32.3% to $13 million. The Asia Foundation received $10 million in funding, while the Middle Eastern-Western Dialogue Trust was denied funding. The Asia Foundation received $14 million in funding from Congress, which was between the House and Senate's proposed amounts. The National Endowment for Democracy (NED) received $8.8 million for administrative expenses and $80 million in program funds under the Democracy Fund account. The East-West Center was allocated $20 million, nearly 50% above the request. The Middle Eastern-Western Dialogue Trust Fund received $8 million, eight times more than the initial request. The Asia Foundation received $14 million in funding from Congress, which was higher than the request. The Middle Eastern-Western Dialogue Trust Fund and the East-West Center also received funding, slightly below Senate levels but above House amounts. The United States International Broadcasting Act of 1994 reorganized all U.S. government international broadcasting entities. In 1999, Congress decided to maintain the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) as an independent agency to preserve the credibility of U.S. international broadcasting. The 9/11 Commission recommended increased funding for international broadcasting in 2004, with a focus on strengthening free and independent media in countries with Muslim populations. In FY2005, Congress allocated $592 million for international broadcasting, $30 million more than the President's request. Concerns were raised about the overlap between BBG and DoD broadcasting. For FY2006, the President requested $652 million for broadcasting activities, with a focus on the war on terrorism and modernization for Cuba Broadcasting. The House allocated $630.9 million, while the Senate approved $651.9 million for international broadcasting. The Senate approved $651.9 million for international broadcasting, including $37.6 million for Cuba Broadcasting. An amendment to cut $21.1 million for television broadcasting to Cuba was defeated. The conference report allocated $652.4 million for international broadcasting, with $641.5 million for broadcasting operations and $10.9 million for capital improvements. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 now gives the Secretary of DHS exclusive authority over visa issuance. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 grants the Secretary of DHS exclusive authority over visa issuance, including assigning DHS employees to overseas posts and training them. The act also allows the Secretary of State and consular officers to refuse visa applications. Within a year of the act being signed, both Secretaries must report to Congress on visa issuance implementation and propose any necessary improvements. In Saudi Arabia, the third-party screening program will end, and DHS personnel will review visa applications on-site before adjudication. The DHS reviews visa applications before adjudication. Machine readable visa fees are used for State Department expenditures. The fees have increased over the years, with a gap between estimates and actuals. The visa issuance process is longer due to the war on terrorism. Emergency funding helped fill the gap in funding. President Bush requested an $82 billion supplemental appropriation for FY2005 to fund military operations, reconstruction in Afghanistan, Tsunami relief, and other activities. The request included $6.3 billion for foreign policy activities such as diplomatic costs, reconstruction in Iraq and Afghanistan, counternarcotics programs, humanitarian relief in Darfur, and assistance for countries like Jordan, Pakistan, and Ukraine. Lawmakers approved $5.78 billion in new appropriations for the State Department. In H.R. 1268, lawmakers provided $5.78 billion in new appropriations for State Department, foreign aid, and tsunami relief, representing an 8% reduction from the President's request. The $512 million cut may impact Congress's consideration of FY2006 appropriations for Foreign Operations and the State Department. Congress approved a budget resolution for FY2006 that assumes a reduction in the President's foreign policy funding request of about $2.4 billion, or 7%. House and Senate Appropriation Committees may add items not approved in the FY2005 supplemental conference agreement, making it challenging to meet the budget resolution target for international affairs programs. Major recommendations in P.L. 109-13 include $1.78 billion for Afghanistan reconstruction and police training, $262 million less than requested. The budget resolution for FY2006 approved by Congress includes $1.78 billion for Afghanistan reconstruction and police training, which is $262 million less than requested. The funding level falls between the House-passed measure and the Senate version. Additionally, there is at least $238 million allocated for Darfur humanitarian aid, with the conference agreement adding $90 million in food aid worldwide. The House had initially increased funding for Darfur to $342.4 million, while the Senate approved $242 million with additional funds for food assistance. The conference measure for FY2006 budget includes funding for Sudan peace implementation aid, Palestinian aid, Pakistan military aid, Jordan economic and military aid, Iraq embassy, and peacekeeping. Sudan aid was reduced by $63 million, Palestinian aid set at $200 million with restrictions, Pakistan aid at $150 million, Jordan aid at $200 million, Iraq embassy funding at $592 million, and peacekeeping at $680 million. The conference agreement for the FY2006 budget includes funding for various purposes: Peacekeeping received $680 million, below the request; Tsunami relief and prevention got $656 million for relief and $25.4 million for prevention; no funds were provided for the Partners Fund, while the full $200 million request for the Solidarity Fund was included. Additionally, $30 million was added for other Global War on Terror security assistance as determined by the President. The conference agreement for the FY2006 budget includes funding for various purposes: Ukraine aid of $60 million was approved by the Senate, while the House had approved $33.7 million. $10 million was allocated for regional aid in Belarus and the North Caucasus. Haiti assistance received $20 million, with $2.5 million for criminal case management. $20 million was allocated for Iraqi families affected by military operations, drawn from the FY2004 emergency supplemental for Iraq reconstruction.
