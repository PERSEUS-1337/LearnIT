    "content": "Congress has broad authority to impose requirements on federal procurement, including promoting contracting with small businesses. This includes setting goals for small business contracts, conducting competitions for small businesses, and involving the Small Business Administration. The report discusses measures enacted by the 112th Congress in response to issues related to small business contracting and subcontracting, such as increasing SBA's size standards and government-wide goals for contracting with small businesses. It also analyzes changes to existing laws to maximize opportunities for small business participation in federal procurement. The report analyzes changes to existing laws related to small business contracting and subcontracting, discussing legal issues potentially raised by certain measures. It presents examples of approaches to issues of interest to Congress but does not address all bills or provisions. The report's discussion of legal questions should not be construed to apply to specific bills cited. It will not be updated, and a separate report will address issues. The Small Business Act gives the Administrator of Small Business discretion to determine which firms qualify as small. Regulations specifying size standards were first established in 1956. Between the 1980s and 2007, SBA did not conduct comprehensive reviews of size standards, only making intermittent changes for specific industries. The Small Business Administration did not conduct comprehensive reviews of size standards between the 1980s and 2007, only making intermittent changes for specific industries. Legislation in the 111th Congress required SBA to conduct regular reviews and make adjustments to reflect market conditions, resulting in thousands of additional firms becoming eligible for small business programs. Legislation in the 112th Congress required the Small Business Administration to consider certain factors when revising size standards, prohibiting limitations on the number of standards and requiring justification for single standards for multiple industry codes. Members of the 112th Congress proposed changes to the Small Business Administration's classification system, including replacing NAICS codes, repealing the \"nonmanufacturer rule,\" and excluding publicly traded or foreign-owned firms from small business programs. They also suggested creating set-aside programs for very small, new, and mid-sized firms. Proposals were made to create set-aside programs for very small, new, and mid-sized firms in response to concerns about size standards affecting eligibility for small business programs. The aim was to address the challenges faced by firms that are too big to qualify as \"small\" but too small to compete with larger government contractors. Concerns were also raised about the current size standards encompassing firms of varying sizes, making it difficult for the smallest firms to compete effectively. Depending on the eligibility criteria, new set-aside programs could face challenges on equal protection or other grounds. The 8(a) Program, with a presumption of disadvantage for certain racial and ethnic groups, may face challenges for violating equal protection laws. Similar programs with racial classifications could also be at risk. Congress amended the Small Business Act in 1978 to set goals for federal contract awards to small businesses, and in 1988 to establish government-wide goals for contract dollars awarded annually. The Small Business Act sets goals for federal contract awards to small businesses, including 23% to small businesses, 5% to women-owned small businesses, 5% to small disadvantaged businesses, 3% to HUBZone small businesses, and 3% to service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses. Meeting these goals is crucial for indicating the implementation of congressional policy to encourage contracting with small businesses. Critics argue that the current government-wide goals are too low. The 111th and 112th Congress enacted legislation to improve agencies' performance in achieving small business goals, including those for minority-, women-, and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses. The legislation requires senior officials to communicate the importance of meeting these goals and directs agencies to meet or exceed annual prime contract goals. The 112th Congress enacted legislation requiring agencies to meet or exceed annual prime contract goals for small businesses, including minority-, women-, and service-disabled veteran-owned businesses. Agencies must separately address prime and subcontract awards for each category of small businesses and make a consistent effort to expand participation. SBA is directed to review its \"Goaling Guidelines\" to ensure realistic improvements in subcontracting levels and to establish goals that do not exclude certain contract categories. The 112th Congress enacted legislation requiring agencies to meet or exceed annual prime contract goals for small businesses, including minority-, women-, and service-disabled veteran-owned businesses. The legislation also calls for an independent assessment of the small business procurement goals; increases agency and SBA reporting regarding the small business goals; and requires that programs established for the training of senior executives address contracting requirements under the Small Business Act. Some Members of the 112th Congress also introduced legislation that would have increased the goals, or created greater incentives for agencies to meet their goals. Some bills aimed to exempt certain entities from Small Business Act requirements for contracting goals. Other measures focused on improving government performance in meeting existing goals by increasing reporting and publicizing information, or by requiring the Government Accountability Office to study federal agency activities and provide recommendations for improvement. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) was tasked with studying federal agency activities and providing recommendations to improve goaling performance. Some provisions aimed to penalize agencies for not meeting goals, potentially raising constitutional issues if penalties were seen as quotas for contracting and subcontracting with minority- or women-owned small businesses. Courts have generally upheld aspirational goals based on race or gender classifications among small businesses, but mandatory goals could raise questions about disparate treatment by the federal government. During the 112th Congress, concerns arose about eligibility for set-aside programs like the 8(a) and HUBZone programs. There were discussions about creating new set-aside programs for \"early stage\" small businesses or mid-sized firms. Additionally, proposals were made to grant agencies more authority to conduct competitions exclusively for women-owned small businesses or to make sole-source awards to them. The Small Business Act requires SBA to establish a \"small business and capital ownership development program\" to provide non-financial assistance to certain small businesses owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. This forms the basis for SBA's 8(a) Program, which defines socially disadvantaged individuals as those who have faced prejudice or bias and economically disadvantaged individuals as those with limited capital and credit opportunities. The Small Business Act establishes the 8(a) Program to assist socially and economically disadvantaged individuals with limited capital and credit opportunities. The program has discretion in eligibility criteria, including net worth standards that may exclude some potential beneficiaries. The 8(a) Program excludes firms due to outdated net worth standards, leading to concerns about competitiveness and unequal contract distribution. Congress has taken steps to address eligibility issues and assess program effectiveness in supporting small business participation in government contracting. The 8(a) Program faced concerns about outdated net worth standards and unequal contract distribution. Congress considered legislation to restrict participation for certain owners and firms, including Alaska Native Corporations, to address the reported increase in federal contract dollars awarded to them. The legislation proposed changes to the 8(a) Program, including amending the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act to exclude ANCs from being considered socially or economically disadvantaged, limiting sole-source awards for ANC-owned firms, and restricting their participation in the program. The proposed legislation aimed to restrict ANC-owned firms from receiving sole-source awards over $4 million ($6.5 million for manufacturing contracts) under the Section 8(a) authority. It also sought to count all affiliations of ANC-owned firms when determining their size, potentially excluding some from the 8(a) Program. Other proposals included disclosing information on contracting with ANCs through additional reporting obligations or including ANC contract information in SBA reports. Some Members of Congress have shown interest in ensuring eligibility for the HUBZone program due to fraud concerns and the 2010 Census results. GAO reports highlighted vulnerabilities to fraud in the program, prompting calls for measures to verify eligibility. The 2010 Census results led to discussions on allowing firms to maintain HUBZone status for a limited time despite census changes affecting eligibility. The HUBZone program eligibility is based on census data, requiring firms to have their principal office and 35% of employees in a HUBZone. HUBZones include qualified census tracts and nonmetropolitan counties meeting specific criteria. The HUBZone program designates difficult development areas within Alaska, Hawaii, or territories outside the 48 contiguous states. This includes \"redesignated areas\" that ceased to qualify but were allowed to remain HUBZones until the release of the 2010 census results. Legislation enacted by the 112th Congress allows certain base closure areas to continue as HUBZones for an additional period. The 112th Congress enacted legislation allowing certain base closure areas to be treated as HUBZones for up to five years, addressing reported fraud and loss of HUBZone status by some firms. The 112th Congress enacted legislation addressing reported fraud and loss of HUBZone status by firms, including measures to update the HUBZone map, prevent unqualified businesses from participating, ensure timely processing of applications, and assess program effectiveness. Other proposals aimed to extend eligibility for redesignated areas based on the 2010 census results. The 112th Congress enacted legislation to address fraud and loss of HUBZone status by firms, including updating the HUBZone map and preventing unqualified businesses from participating. Legislation was also introduced to designate HUBZones based on new census data or specific counties for a set time period. Additionally, there were proposals to expand eligibility for HUBZone small businesses to include Native Hawaiian Organizations. The Small Business Act requires agencies to promote subcontracting with small businesses, including incorporating subcontracting plans in prime contracts and setting goals for awarding subcontract dollars. Proposed legislation aimed to align treatment of small businesses owned by Native Hawaiian Organizations with other entities like Alaska Native Corporations and Indian tribal governments. The 111th Congress amended Section 8(d) of the Small Business Act to require agencies to include terms in prime contracts obligating contractors to make a \"good faith effort\" to acquire goods and services from small businesses used in preparing bids, and to notify the contracting officer if they pay reduced prices to subcontractors. The 112th Congress enacted legislation requiring agencies to collect data on subcontractor compliance with goals, review data for good faith compliance, consider non-compliance in past performance evaluations, notify small businesses before identifying them as potential subcontractors, and establish a mechanism for subcontractors to report fraud or bad faith. The 112th Congress enacted legislation requiring agencies to collect data on subcontractor compliance with goals, review data for good faith compliance, consider non-compliance in past performance evaluations, notify small businesses before identifying them as potential subcontractors, and establish a mechanism for subcontractors to report fraud or bad faith by a contractor with respect to a subcontracting plan. SBA is directed to modify the electronic subcontracting reporting system to identify contractors who fail to submit required reports and provide annual reporting on subcontracting activities. Some Members of Congress also proposed legislation to hold prime contractors accountable for failure to report subcontracting activities and withhold a percentage of the contract price for non-compliance with subcontracting goals. The proposed legislation aims to fine contractors who fail to notify small businesses identified as potential subcontractors in their bids. This expands upon current law, which requires contractors to report on subcontracting performance semiannually. However, certain proposals could raise contract and constitutional law issues regarding the imposition of liquidated damages for non-compliance. Provisions for withholding or liquidated damages may be considered punitive and not enforceable if they are disproportionate to the offense. Fines for contractors failing to meet goals or notify subcontractors could violate the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on excessive fines. Courts have ruled that fines must be proportional to the offense to avoid being deemed unconstitutional. Equal protection issues may arise if penalties are overly severe, especially in relation to subcontracting with minority- or women-owned small businesses. The penalties for subcontracting with minority- or women-owned small businesses were seen as quotas. Congress imposed limitations on subcontracting for 8(a) firms in 1986 to ensure capacity development. 8(a) firms were required to perform at least 50% of service contracts and 50% of goods contracts. Similar requirements were imposed on other contracts under the Small Business Act in 1987, with SBA also setting limitations on subcontracting for construction contracts. The 112th Congress enacted legislation in 2012 to restate limitations on subcontracting, ensuring small businesses do the majority of the work by subcontracting no more than 50% of the amount paid under the contract. SBA is granted authority to establish similar limitations for construction contracts. The legislation enacted in 2012 restates limitations on subcontracting for small businesses, allowing SBA to modify statutory limitations if necessary. Contractors exceeding these limits may face fines up to $500,000 or the amount spent in excess on subcontractors. This provision helps address issues of misrepresentation in federal contracts. The Prompt Payment Act of 1982 requires federal agencies to pay interest on late payments to contractors and subcontractors. Small businesses are particularly vulnerable to cash flow issues, and timely payments are crucial. Amendments in 1988 extended protections to subcontractors, mandating prompt payment and interest on overdue amounts. The 1988 amendments to the Prompt Payment Act protect small businesses by requiring prompt payment and interest on overdue amounts. Legislation enacted by the 111th Congress addresses concerns about payment to small business subcontractors, requiring prime contractors to notify the contracting officer of late or withheld payments to subcontractors. The SBA is considering requiring prime contractors to enter into \"funds control agreements\" if they fail to pay subcontractors. The Obama Administration issued guidance for agencies to pay small business contractors within 15 days and accelerate payments to prime contractors to ensure prompt payments to small business subcontractors. Legislation in the 112th Congress aimed to address these issues. The Prompt Payment Act introduced in the 112th Congress aimed to ensure quick payment to small business contractors without explicit sanctions for non-compliance. The SBA administers a surety bond guarantee program to support small businesses in obtaining bonds for contracts under $2 million. The 111th Congress temporarily increased the maximum bond amount for the surety bond guarantee program in response to the 2007-2009 recession. The program's size standards were also temporarily modified to allow more businesses to qualify. Despite concerns, small businesses continued to struggle to secure surety bonds after the recession ended in 2009. The 112th Congress enacted legislation permanently increasing the maximum bond amount to $6.5 million ($10 million with certification). This legislation also allows for periodic inflation adjustments and restricts bundling and consolidation of requirements by federal agencies to support small businesses. In 1997, Congress defined \"bundling\" as consolidating procurement requirements into a single contract unsuitable for small businesses. In 2003, defense agencies were prohibited from executing acquisition strategies that include contract consolidation. In 1997, Congress defined \"bundling\" as consolidating procurement requirements into a single contract unsuitable for small businesses. In 2003, defense agencies were prohibited from executing acquisition strategies that include contract consolidation. Later, in 2010, Congress imposed restrictions on the \"consolidation\" of requirements valued over $2 million by non-defense agencies. Concerns about limiting opportunities for small businesses persisted despite amendments to the Small Business Act. The 112th Congress amended the definition of \"consolidation of contract requirements\" to include construction projects at multiple sites and goods/services from separate contracts. This legislation repealed 2003 provisions on consolidation, which previously only applied to defense agencies. The 112th Congress amended the definition of \"bundling\" to include construction projects and specified criteria for contract requirements. The legislation also required the GAO to review data on consolidation, savings from consolidated contracts, small business subcontracting plans, and data collected on bundling. The legislation amended the definition of \"bundling\" to include construction projects and specified criteria for contract requirements. It also authorized SBA to delay solicitation issuance for up to 10 days in case of disagreement with the procuring agency. Additionally, the legislation strengthened the responsibilities of Procurement Center Representatives and small business advocates regarding bundled solicitations. The legislation introduced new requirements for procuring activities to involve the Procurement Center Representatives (PCR) in bundled solicitations. It also allowed the Administrator of Small Business to appeal to the agency board of contract appeals in case of disagreement. Legislation was also proposed to address bundling of requirements by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Legislation introduced in the 112th Congress aimed to address bundling of requirements by DHS, with a focus on small businesses' ability to compete. Recent insourcing efforts by the Department of Defense raised concerns among small business contractors, leading to legal challenges based on violations of agency guidelines and the APA. Recent legal challenges have arisen regarding the jurisdiction of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims over insourcing determinations under the Administrative Disputes Resolution Act. Questions have been raised about the standing requirements for interested parties and vendors with expired contracts, as well as the legality of guidelines for determining government personnel or contractor employees for certain functions. The Obama Administration addressed small businesses' concerns about insourcing by including protections for them in its final policy letter on \"inherently governmental functions.\" This policy directs agencies to prioritize reviewing work performed by small businesses and give them preference for work that remains in the private sector after functions are insourced. The 112th Congress also enacted legislation for the Office of Management and Budget to establish procedures for agencies to decide on insourcing functions performed by small businesses. The legislation enacted in the 112th Congress provides procedures for agencies to decide on insourcing functions performed by small businesses, including identifying contracts for conversion, determining critical functions, and comparing costs. Agency Offices of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBUs) and SBA procurement center representatives (PCRs) are required to review and advise on insourcing determinations, but do not have authority to delay or block them. Other legislation introduced in the 112th Congress aimed to amend 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3551(1) to include objections to insourcing determinations as protests. The legislation in the 112th Congress provided procedures for agencies to decide on insourcing functions performed by small businesses. It included defining contracts for conversion, determining critical functions, and comparing costs. The legislation aimed to amend U.S.C. \u00a7 3551(1) to include objections to insourcing determinations as protests and required agencies to make their insourcing procedures publicly available after a notice-and-comment period. The legislation in the 112th Congress provided procedures for agencies to decide on insourcing functions performed by small businesses, including defining contracts for conversion, determining critical functions, and comparing costs. Questions about prudential standing could potentially remain despite the enactment of this legislation, as prudential standing is a limit on federal jurisdiction. SBA and agency personnel, such as PCRs and OSDBUs, are tasked with protecting small businesses' interests in the federal procurement process. The 112th Congress enacted legislation addressing the training, experience, and responsibilities of PCRs and OSDBUs in facilitating contracting between agencies' prime contractors and small businesses. This legislation requires PCRs to have a Level III certification. The legislation requires PCRs to have a Level III certification and outlines their responsibilities, including reviewing barriers to small business contracting and advocating for maximum utilization of small businesses. OSDBUs must have relevant federal contracting experience and are tasked with advising on insourcing determinations, acquisition strategies, and providing training. The legislation enacted by the 112th Congress clarifies reporting requirements for OSDBU Directors, mandates small business contracting courses for FAI and DAU, requires Level I certification for agency small business opportunity specialists, and directs reviews of OSDBUs for compliance and best practices. The Competition in Contracting Act (CICA) of 1984 allows agencies to use \"other than full and open competition\" for small business awards. The Small Business Act was amended in 2010 to authorize agencies to set-aside multiple-award contracts for small businesses. The 112th Congress expanded agencies' authority to conduct competitions. The 112th Congress enacted legislation expanding agencies' authority to set aside contracts for women-owned small businesses (WOSBs) of any value, previously limited to contracts below $4 million. The legislation also requires SBA to identify industries where WOSBs are underrepresented for set-asides. Additionally, there was a proposal to authorize sole source contracts for small businesses owned by women under certain conditions. The Small Business Act does not currently allow sole-source awards to women-owned small businesses, unlike HUBZone small businesses. Sole-source awards can be made to HUBZone small businesses if certain conditions are met, including the contract being under $4 million ($6.5 million for manufacturing contracts) and at a fair price. Legislation in the 112th Congress proposed requiring the VA to make sole-source awards to veteran-owned small businesses under specific conditions. The VA has authority to make sole-source awards for contracts exceeding $150,000 but less than $5 million if deemed fair and reasonable. Other measures exempt contracts under the Small Business Act from certain limitations and require set-asides under multiple-award contracts. The proposed measures would require set-asides under multiple-award contracts to increase small business participation. Federal law currently distinguishes between different purchase thresholds for small businesses. The 111th Congress enacted legislation to increase small business participation in micro-purchases by requiring OMB to issue guidelines for identifying opportunities and best practices. Agencies holding government-wide purchase cards should consider small businesses to the maximum extent practicable for micro-purchases. The 112th Congress introduced legislation to expand the value of small purchases for small businesses, requiring agencies to award contracts between $3,000 and $500,000 to small businesses to the extent practicable. This legislation would also allow sole-source awards within this range to women-owned small businesses or other small businesses not classified as 8(a), HUBZone, or service-disabled veteran-owned. The Small Business Act does not allow sole-source awards to veteran-owned small businesses, only contract set-asides. Mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 programs pair new businesses with experienced ones to promote contracting/subcontracting. The DOD and SBA have different mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 programs focusing on subcontracting and prime contracting, respectively. The DOD and SBA have mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 programs that focus on subcontracting and prime contracting, respectively. Other agencies have also implemented similar programs with varying eligibility requirements and types of assistance. Concerns about parity, duplication, and confusion for small businesses have led to legislation authorizing SBA to establish mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 programs. The 112th Congress addressed concerns about parity by enacting legislation authorizing SBA to establish mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 programs for various small businesses. This legislation also directs GAO to study existing mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 programs to determine their effectiveness in increasing small business participation in Government contracting. The 112th Congress enacted legislation prohibiting federal agencies from implementing mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 programs for small businesses without SBA approval to prevent disparities and duplication. Fraud in small business contracting programs is a concern due to the advantages firms gain by misrepresenting their size, leading to civil and criminal penalties under the Small Business Act. Recent concerns about fraud in small business contracting programs have led to questions about the adequacy of existing penalties and protest provisions. The 111th Congress enacted legislation to prevent ineligible small businesses from receiving credit for goods or services supplied. The legislation aims to prevent ineligible small businesses from receiving credit for goods or services supplied to the government. It also requires companies to certify their size and status when bidding for contracts set aside for small businesses, encourages government awards based on size, or registers for federal contracts. Additionally, the legislation mandates a government-wide policy on prosecuting size and status fraud, and requires annual re-certification of size for businesses certified as small. The 112th Congress enacted legislation requiring small businesses to annually re-certify their size in the ORCA database. Misrepresentation of size or status can lead to debarment or suspension under FAR procedures. SBA must report annually to Congress on debarments or suspensions for violations. Additionally, firms can be debarred for five years for misrepresenting their status as veteran-owned. The 112th Congress enacted legislation requiring small businesses to annually re-certify their size in the ORCA database. Misrepresentation of size or status can lead to debarment or suspension under FAR procedures. Firms can be debarred for five years if they misrepresent their status as veteran-owned for programs under the act, departing significantly from previous law. Other legislation introduced in the 112th Congress addresses fraud in small business contracting programs by imposing imprisonment for up to five years for knowingly making misrepresentations to obtain federal contracts. The 112th Congress enacted legislation imposing penalties for fraud in small business contracting programs, including imprisonment for up to five years and/or a fine of $1 million. This legislation also requires service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses to register in the VA's VetBiz database for contracting preferences. Additionally, GAO is required to report periodically on the effectiveness of the 8(a) Program. The 112th Congress enacted legislation imposing penalties for fraud in small business contracting programs, including imprisonment for up to five years and/or a fine of $1 million. This legislation also requires service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses to register in the VA's VetBiz database for contracting preferences. Additionally, businesses may be debarred from government contracting for no less than five years if they fraudulently represent themselves as small businesses. Any person can file a complaint with the SBA or procuring agency regarding firms' status, which must be resolved promptly. The Contractor Central Registration must include a warning of criminal penalties for misrepresenting firm size or status. The 112th Congress enacted legislation imposing penalties for fraud in small business contracting programs, including imprisonment for up to five years and/or a fine of $1 million. This legislation also requires service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses to register in the VA's VetBiz database for contracting preferences. Additionally, businesses may be debarred from government contracting for no less than five years if they fraudulently represent themselves as small businesses. Any person can file a complaint with the SBA or procuring agency regarding firms' status, which must be resolved promptly. The effectiveness of any changes in awarding contracts under the Small Business Act could depend on implementation by SBA and VA. Measures enacted by the 112th Congress include appropriating $15 million to the Department of Defense for \"incentive payments\" to contractors or subcontractors using Indian-owned small businesses. The 112th Congress enacted legislation to improve DOD's contracting and subcontracting with small businesses by designating officials as \"Small Business Ombudsmen\" and extending the Comprehensive Small Business Subcontracting Program. The 112th Congress enacted legislation to improve DOD's contracting and subcontracting with small businesses by designating officials as \"Small Business Ombudsmen\" and extending the Comprehensive Small Business Subcontracting Program. Additionally, legislation was introduced to ensure DHS's website includes information on programs, policies, and initiatives to encourage small businesses to participate in agency acquisitions. The 112th Congress enacted legislation to improve DOD's contracting and subcontracting with small businesses by designating officials as \"Small Business Ombudsmen\" and extending the Comprehensive Small Business Subcontracting Program. The legislation also established preferences for local contractors in awarding contracts to veteran-owned small businesses and allowed surviving spouses or dependents of fallen Armed Forces members to be treated as veterans for contracting goals. DOD was prohibited from outsourcing certain functions until an assessment is conducted. The 112th Congress enacted legislation to improve DOD's contracting and subcontracting with small businesses, including designating officials as \"Small Business Ombudsmen\" and extending the Comprehensive Small Business Subcontracting Program. The legislation also established preferences for local contractors in awarding contracts to veteran-owned small businesses and allowed surviving spouses or dependents of fallen Armed Forces members to be treated as veterans for contracting goals. Additionally, DOD was prohibited from outsourcing certain functions until an assessment is conducted, and other measures were discussed to address specific aspects of contracting with small businesses."
