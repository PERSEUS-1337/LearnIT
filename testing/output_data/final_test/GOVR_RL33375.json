    "content": "The FIRE Act established the Assistance to Firefighters Grants program, providing federal funding for equipment and training to local fire departments since FY2001. This program has helped fire departments purchase firefighting equipment, personal protective gear, and vehicles. Fire-service advocates argue for an additional federal grant program to assist fire departments in hiring firefighters and retaining volunteers. They highlight the need for federal assistance to meet staffing standards and cite the success of the Community Oriented Policing Services program as a precedent. Studies by various organizations support the need for the proposed grant program. Studies by the Boston Globe and NIOSH found that many fire departments have inadequate personnel levels, leading to issues like delayed response times and increased firefighter fatalities. Opponents of SAFER grants argue that funding for firefighter salaries should not be the federal government's responsibility, and some believe that below-standard staffing levels are not a major concern due to a decline in structural fires over the past 20 years. The SAFER Act, enacted in response to concerns over firefighter staffing, authorizes grants to fire departments to increase the number of firefighters for 24-hour staffing to enhance protection from fire hazards. The Fire Grants Reauthorization Act of 2012, part of the FY2013 National Defense Authorization Act, amended the SAFER statute to provide grants for firefighter staffing and recruitment. Hiring grants cover a three-year term with federal cost-sharing up to 75% in the first two years. The SAFER Act specifies that hiring grants for firefighter staffing shall not exceed 75% in the first two years and 35% in the third year. Additionally, 10% of the total SAFER appropriation is awarded to volunteer departments for personnel hiring, and 10% is set aside for recruitment and retention grants for volunteer and combination fire departments. No local cost sharing is required for recruitment and retention grants. On September 30, 2017, the 115th Congress considered reauthorization legislation for the AFG and SAFER programs with sunset dates of January 2, 2018. S. 829, introduced by Senator McCain, was passed by the Senate on August 2, 2017. A hearing on U.S. Fire Administration and Fire Grant Programs Reauthorization was held on July 12, 2017. H.R. 4661, the United States Fire Administration, AFG, and SAFER Program Reauthorization Act of 2017, was passed on December 15, 2017. The United States Fire Administration, AFG, and SAFER Program Reauthorization Act of 2017, introduced by Representative Comstock, extended the sunset dates to September 30, 2024. H.R. 4661 reauthorized the USFA through FY2023 and was passed by the House and Senate in December 2017. Another related legislation, H.R. 3881, was identical to S. 829 and was signed into law as P.L. 115-98 on January 3, 2018, extending SAFER and AFG authorizations. The United States Fire Administration, AFG, and SAFER Program Reauthorization Act of 2017 (P.L. 115-98) extends SAFER and AFG authorizations through FY2023, with sunset provisions extended to September 30, 2024. It allows for online training courses, expands SAFER hiring grant eligibility, and directs FEMA to develop a grant monitoring framework. The SAFER grant program's annual appropriation is managed by House and Senate Appropriations Subcommittees on Homeland Security. The SAFER grant program's annual appropriation is managed by the House and Senate Appropriations Subcommittees on Homeland Security. SAFER is listed under \"Firefighter Assistance Grants\" in the appropriations bills, along with the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program. The Administration requested $335 million for SAFER and $335 million for AFG for FY2017, a reduction of $10 million for each program from the previous year. The proposed budget reflects FEMA's successful investments in prior year grants awarded. SAFER and AFG grant accounts would be transferred to the Preparedness and Protection activity under FEMA's broader \"Federal Assistance\" account. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved $680 million for firefighter assistance, with $340 million allocated for SAFER and $340 million for AFG. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved $680 million for firefighter assistance, with $340 million allocated for SAFER and $340 million for AFG. The committee directed DHS to continue funding applications according to local priorities and to maintain direct funding to fire departments. The House Appropriations Committee approved transferring the Firefighter Assistance budget account into a broader Federal Assistance account. The Firefighter Assistance budget account was transferred into a broader Federal Assistance account in FEMA. The bill provided $690 million for firefighter assistance, split evenly between SAFER and AFG. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017 allocated the same amount for FY2017. The Administration requested slightly less for FY2018. SAFER and AFG are under Grants in the Federal Assistance budget account. On July 18, 2017, the House Appropriations Committee approved the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2018 (H.R. 3355; H.Rept. 115-239) providing $690 million for firefighter assistance under the Federal Assistance budget account. This includes $345 million each for SAFER and AFG. The bill report urged FEMA to prioritize grants for firefighter planning, training, and equipment for crude oil-by-rail and ethanol-by-rail incidents. On September 14, 2017, the House passed H.R. 3354, adding $20 million to SAFER for a total of $365 million, and maintaining $345 million for AFG. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141) allocated $700 million for firefighter assistance. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 allocated $700 million for firefighter assistance in FY2018, split evenly between SAFER and AFG. The Administration requested a similar amount for FY2019. Both the Senate and House Appropriations Committees approved bills for FY2019 with $700 million for firefighter assistance, maintaining the split between SAFER and AFG. The House bill for firefighter assistance in FY2020 includes $350 million for SAFER and $350 million for AFG, with no request for SAFER waiver authority. The Administration requested $688.688 million for FY2020, a 1.6% reduction from FY2019, without SAFER waiver authority. In 2009, economic downturn led to concerns about SAFER statute modifications for fire departments. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 waived matching requirements for SAFER grants in FY2009 and FY2010. The FY2009 Supplemental Appropriations Act gave the Secretary of Homeland Security authority to waive certain limitations in the SAFER statute for grants in FY2009 and FY2010. Waivers allowed the use of SAFER funds to rehire firefighters, extend grant durations, and exceed funding limits per position. The Department of Defense and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 (P.L. 112-10) removed cost-share requirements for SAFER grants, allowing funds to rehire firefighters and fill positions. However, the law maintained the requirement for a five-year funding commitment and a $100,000 cap per firefighter. This could deter communities from applying for grants due to future local funding obligations. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, FY2012 (P.L. 112-74) lifted SAFER restrictions since FY2009 and reinstated DHS waiver authority for remaining restrictions. The Fire Grants Reauthorization Act of 2012 (P.L. 112-239) removed the $100,000 cap per firefighter hired, shortened grant period to three years, and provided economic hardship waivers for SAFER funds. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, FY2012 (P.L. 112-74) and the Fire Grants Reauthorization Act of 2012 (P.L. 112-239) removed various restrictions on the SAFER program. The waiver authority granted to DHS allowed for exemptions from cost sharing requirements, grant term limits, cost limits per firefighter hired, and prohibitions on using funds for rehiring laid-off firefighters. This waiver authority has been available since FY2009 and was included in subsequent budget proposals and appropriations bills. The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2015 (P.L. 114-4) provided FEMA with permanent authority to waive certain requirements for grantees based on economic hardship criteria. The Administration's FY2016 budget and S. 1619 would have continued waiver authority for future fiscal years. The Department of Homeland Security Act, 2016, would have continued waiver authority for FEMA to grant SAFER funds for retaining and rehiring firefighters. However, the final Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 did not contain the SAFER waiver provision for FY2016. The Administration's budgets for FY2017, FY2018, and FY2019 did not request SAFER waiver authority, and neither did the House nor Senate Appropriations Committee bills. Nonetheless, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 included the previous waiver authority provision for FEMA to grant SAFER waivers. The 2018 round of SAFER awards did not provide grants for retaining or rehiring firefighters. The FY2019 Homeland Security appropriations bill included waiver authority for SAFER grants, but the FY2020 budget proposal does not request this authority. For updates on SAFER grants, visit the official program website. State-by-state distribution of SAFER grant funds from FY2005 to FY2017 is shown in Table 4. During 2014 and 2015, the DHS Office of the Inspector General audited SAFER grants for fiscal years 2010 through 2012, finding that 63% of recipients did not comply with grant requirements. The report recommended FEMA's Grant Programs Directorate to manage the risk of waste, fraud, and abuse of grant funds. The Grant Programs Directorate implemented an organizational framework to address fraud, waste, and abuse. FEMA concurred with OIG findings and took corrective actions. The Fire Grants Reauthorization Act directed GAO to assess changes' effectiveness on fire grants administration. GAO's report concluded that FEMA's fire grant policies generally reflected the changes made in FY2013 and FY2014. The GAO found that FEMA's fire grant policies in FY2013 and FY2014 aligned with changes in the fire grant statute. However, performance measures lacked measurable targets linked to program goals. Integrating a more objective approach could enhance national preparedness efforts and assess the impact of fire grants. Firefighter assistance grants were affected by the partial government shutdown. During the partial government shutdown, firefighter assistance grants were impacted as FEMA personnel administering the grants were furloughed. The application and awards process for AFG, SAFER, and FP&S grants were delayed, affecting grant recipients' ability to draw down funds and continue grant-funded activities. The disruption in firefighter assistance grants, covered by SAFER grant awards, may persist post-government shutdown due to a backlog of payment requests. SAFER grants are distributed to various types of fire departments, raising concerns about equitable distribution and budget appropriations. Federal budget deficit worries could impact grant levels, while local budget shortfalls may lead to heightened scrutiny of firefighter assistance budgets."
