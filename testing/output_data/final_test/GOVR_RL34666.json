    "content": "Between FY1998 and FY2007, the Department of Defense (DOD) Science and Technology (S&T) Program's budget increased from $7.7 billion to $12.8 billion. In constant FY2009 dollars, the total increase was $22.5 billion. This report analyzes the budget increase by department, agency, budget activity, and program element to determine if all programs benefitted or if certain priority areas were focused on. With higher budget deficits and the need to sustain military spending levels, policymakers may scrutinize the allocation of S&T resources more closely. This report specifically focuses on DOD's base Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation Program (RDT&E). The DOD's Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation Program (RDT&E) funds activities from basic research to testing of weapon systems. It is divided into seven budget activities, with activities 6.1-6.3 focusing on science and technology, 6.4-6.5 on new weapon systems, 6.6 on management support, and 6.7 on system improvements. The S&T program is crucial for developing a science and technology base for the DOD. The DOD's Science and Technology (S&T) program, known as the \"seed corn,\" supports the development of a technology base for future military systems. The value of S&T investments is long-term and hard to measure, but crucial for maintaining U.S. military capabilities. Budgets for S&T remained flat in the 1960s and 1970s but increased in the late 1970s and 1980s. In the 1980s, S&T budgets increased but became more erratic in the 1990s. Congress aimed to increase S&T funding by 2% per year after inflation, with limited success. The DOD set a goal to stabilize base S&T funding at 3% of overall funding. After 9/11, defense budgets increased. Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, defense budgets began to rise quickly, with S&T funding reaching historic levels. Congressional appropriations played a significant role in the increase in S&T funding from FY1998 to FY2007, surpassing DOD's requests. This report focuses on the growth in base S&T budgets during this period, which includes a transition to a period of significant growth and strategic changes due to the War-on-Terror era. The analysis in this report is based on data from two primary DOD sources: the DOD R-1 document and the RDT&E descriptive summaries of the departments and agencies. The R-1 is an annual budget document released by the DOD Comptroller that summarizes all the Program Elements (PEs) that make up the base Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) program. Program Elements are the building blocks of DOD's budget. In the case of the base RDT&E program, each PE represents an aggregation of research activities in a particular area. In the base RDT&E program, each Program Element (PE) represents research activities in a specific area like materials science or electronic warfare. The R-1 document lists all PEs by department and agency, with 712 PEs in the FY2009 budget request. Descriptive summaries are released annually, detailing goals, objectives, and accomplishments of each PE. Funding amounts are not examined below the PE level. The report focuses on total obligational authority (TOA) in DOD financial measures, which equals budget authority (BA) granted by Congress. Changes in appropriations are accounted for differently when modifying TOA and budget authority figures for prior years. The R-1 and RDT&E summaries list the current year's budget request, estimated TOA for the prior year, and actual TOA for two years prior. The report analyzed actual TOA data from FY1998 to FY2007 in constant FY2009 dollars, comparing cumulative funding with inflation-adjusted amounts by department, agency, budget activity, and individual PE. The report analyzed funding data from FY1998 to FY2007 by department, agency, budget activity, and individual PE in dollars and percentages. Limitations include how to account for PEs initiated after FY1998, where the baseline funding is zero, making percentage comparisons meaningless. The analysis of percentage changes in individual PEs is limited to those in existence in FY1998, excluding PEs established after that time. Some PEs were reorganized or terminated during the 10-year period, making direct comparisons challenging. Funding comparisons in constant FY2009 dollars show a baseline of $9.6 billion. In FY1998, baseline funding was $9.6 billion in constant FY2009 dollars. Actual funding increased to $14.3 billion in FY2005 before decreasing to $13.4 billion in FY2007. The total funding exceeded baseline by $22.5 billion in FY2009 dollars. The Army received the largest increase of $6.6 billion, while defense agencies saw the smallest increase of $5.2 billion. In terms of percentage increase above baseline, the Army, Navy, and Air Force fared similarly, with increases of 34%, 32%, and 36% respectively. Defense agencies as a whole only increased by 11%. In terms of budget activity, $2.3 billion went to basic research (6.1), $10.0 billion to applied research (6.2), and $10.1 billion to advanced technology development (6.3). Concern exists about maintaining adequate basic research funding. Basic research increased less than 6.2 or 6.3, but the percentage increase was 18% for 6.1, 27% for 6.2, and 21% for 6.3. Defense agencies' 6.2 funding had the largest absolute increase, but the percentage increase was not as significant. The largest funding increases were in the departments' 6.3 programs, with defense agencies receiving a lower percentage increase. Variations in basic research funding were observed among departments and agencies, with the Army and Air Force seeing higher increases compared to the Navy and defense agencies overall. Out of 101 program elements analyzed, 74 exceeded their baseline funding levels. New program elements established after FY1998 also showed increases above their baseline. Some program elements did not keep up with inflation after establishment, and some were eliminated during a 10-year period. The size and distribution of funding increases and decreases varied across program elements. Tables show program elements with the greatest funding increases in absolute dollars and percentages. The Combat Vehicle and Automotive Advanced Technology program element supports the Army's Future Combat System. The Advanced Aerospace Systems PE, part of the Army's Future Combat System, saw significant funding increases from $48 million in FY1998 to $353 million in FY2003. Funding in FY2007 was $210 million. DARPA split the PE into two separate PEs in FY2005. Funding for Aerospace Systems and Space Programs and Technology peaked at $343 million in FY2004, with new PEs totaling $292 million in FY2007. The Materials and Electronics PE split into two in FY2005, receiving $554 million together. The Air Force's Special Programs PE was established in FY2003. The Air Force's Special Programs PE was established in FY2003 with funding increasing from $105 million in FY2003 to $408 million in FY2004. The PE focuses on classified activities related to counter-proliferation and sustainment, including modeling, simulation, and testing of WMD effects. The PE focuses on developing vulnerability assessment tools and technologies to improve survivability of U.S. weapon systems and capabilities. It also supports targeting operations of U.S. deterrent forces. The original PE was split into two new PEs: WMD Defeat Technology and Strategic Defense Technologies. Funding for the original PE peaked at $458 million in FY2002. The Chemical and Biological Defense Program and DARPA's Biological Warfare Defense program received high increases in funding, indicating a focus on countering weapons of mass destruction. In FY1998, the Army's 6.2 Computer and Software Technology PE funding exceeded its baseline by nearly five times due to a decrease in funding the previous year. The PE's priorities changed, with funding increasing to $4.7 million in FY1999 and $6.9 million in FY2007. The Army's 6.3 Combat Vehicle and Advanced Automotive Technology PE transitioned to an Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration program in FY1998. The Air Force's Aerospace Technologies Development/Demonstration PE, previously known as Aerospace Structures, focuses on developing and integrating technologies for aerospace vehicles. Funding for this program increased from $12.0 million in FY1998 to $50.5 million in FY2004 before dropping to $47.4 million in FY2007. The Army's 6.3 Night Vision PE saw steady growth in funding from $22.1 million in FY1998 to $111.7 million in FY2005, then declined to $77.0 million in FY2007. Funding for the Army's 6.2 Computer and Software Technology PE also increased significantly in FY1998. The increase in S&T funding over the 10 years from FY1998 to FY2007 was broadly distributed across the Army, Navy, Air Force, and defense agencies. The Army's Night Vision program and the Air Force's Aerospace Technologies Development/Demonstration program experienced steady increases, indicating sustained interest. The overall increase in funding was distributed equally in dollar terms among departments, but variably across their budgets. The increase in S&T funding over the 10 years from FY1998 to FY2007 was broadly distributed across the Army, Navy, Air Force, and defense agencies. While the overall increase in funding was distributed equally among departments, the increases were distributed variably across their budget activities. Applied research of each department increased the most, with basic research increasing the least in dollar terms. 73% of PEs exceeded their baseline funding, with a growing emphasis on countering weapons of mass destruction possibly reflecting a shift in threat perception. The Congress has three options to consider when funding S&T going forward - increase, reduce, or keep funding flat. Allocation of resources may also be adjusted. The Director of Defense Engineering and Research advocates for more basic research. In a flat or declining budget, growth in one area would require decreases elsewhere. The Director of Defense Engineering and Research advocates for more basic research in S&T funding. If more growth is needed in certain areas, decreases would have to come from elsewhere within the program, potentially impacting lower priority programs. Further reductions could make the program inefficient in achieving its goals, or decreases could be evenly spread across all other programs to minimize the impact on any particular area."
