    "content": "The \"Hydropower Regulatory Efficiency Act of 2012\" includes provisions for promoting small hydroelectric power projects, conduit hydropower projects, extending preliminary permit periods, developing hydropower at nonpowered dams and closed-loop pumped storage projects, and conducting a study on pumped storage and potential hydropower from conduits. Congress acknowledges the significant role of hydropower in the United States, with 300,000 workers employed in the industry. Hydropower is the largest source of clean, renewable electricity, providing nearly 7 percent of the nation's electricity and 100,000 megawatts of electric capacity. There is potential to expand hydropower generation to nonpowered dams, with only 3 percent currently utilized. By tapping into untapped resources, the U.S. could add approximately 60,000 megawatts. By utilizing untapped resources, the United States could add 60,000 megawatts of new hydropower capacity by 2025, potentially creating 700,000 new jobs in the next 13 years. The Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 is amended to increase the threshold for small hydroelectric power projects from 5,000 to 10,000. Additionally, there are efforts to promote conduit hydropower projects. The Federal Power Act is amended to exempt qualifying conduit hydropower facilities from licensing requirements. Those proposing to construct such facilities must file a notice of intent with the Commission to determine if the facility meets qualifying criteria. The Federal Power Act exempts qualifying conduit hydropower facilities from licensing requirements. If no entity contests whether the facility meets the qualifying criteria within 45 days of public notice, it is deemed to meet the criteria. A conduit is defined as a manmade water conveyance for water distribution. The term 'qualifying conduit hydropower facility' refers to a facility that is operated for water distribution for various purposes, excluding electricity generation. It must meet specific criteria, including using non-federally owned conduits for power generation, having a capacity not exceeding 5 megawatts, and being in operation before a certain date. The Hydropower Regulatory Efficiency Act of 2012 allows the Commission to grant exemptions from license requirements to hydroelectric facilities using conduit-generated power with a capacity not exceeding 40 megawatts. Subsection (c) is amended to refer to subsection (b). The Hydropower Regulatory Efficiency Act of 2012 allows exemptions from license requirements for hydroelectric facilities using conduit-generated power under 40 megawatts. Section 405 of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 is amended to replace subsection (a) with subsection (b). FERC has the authority to extend preliminary permit periods under the Federal Power Act for up to 2 additional years if the permittee has conducted activities in good faith and with reasonable diligence. Additionally, there are provisions in place to promote hydropower development at nonpowered dams and closed-loop pumped storage projects. To expedite hydropower development at nonpowered dams and closed loop pumped storage projects, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) will explore the feasibility of issuing licenses within a 2-year process. FERC will conduct workshops and develop criteria for identifying suitable projects. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) aims to expedite hydropower development at nonpowered dams and closed loop pumped storage projects by exploring the feasibility of licensing within a 2-year process. FERC will also collaborate with relevant agencies through a memorandum of understanding and conduct pilot projects to test the effectiveness of the process. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) will submit a report to Congress on the impracticability of a 2-year licensing process for hydropower development, detailing public comments and issues identified, along with recommendations for addressing them. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) will submit a report to Congress on pilot projects involving a 2-year process for hydropower development, outlining outcomes, public comments, and plans to adopt policies for a 2-year process. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) will submit a report to Congress on pilot projects involving a 2-year process for hydropower development, outlining outcomes, public comments, and plans to adopt policies for appropriate projects. The report will address the process, legal, environmental, economic, and other issues that justify a determination of the Commission that no 2-year process is practicable, with recommendations on how Congress may address or remedy the identified issues. DOE will conduct a study on pumped storage and potential hydropower from conduits. The Secretary of Energy will conduct a study on the technical flexibility of existing pumped storage facilities for supporting renewable energy generation and grid reliability. The study will also identify opportunities for hydropower from conduits in the United States. The Secretary of Energy will conduct a study on the technical flexibility of existing pumped storage facilities for supporting renewable energy generation and grid reliability, as well as identify opportunities for hydropower from conduits in the United States. A report detailing the study's results and recommendations must be submitted to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce and the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources within one year of the Act's enactment. The House of Representatives passed the bill on July 9, 2012, as attested by Karen L. Haas, Clerk."
