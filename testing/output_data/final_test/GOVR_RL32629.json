Courts show extra deference to government measures in regulatory takings cases related to international threats, making it difficult for such claims to succeed. In cases involving national security, courts show extra deference to government measures in regulatory takings cases related to international threats, making it difficult for such claims to succeed. Statements of judicial deference are found in numerous cases rejecting regulatory takings claims against the United States during wartime, such as temporary shutdowns of non-essential gold mines and wartime rent controls. The Condor Operating Co. and Paradissiotis decisions illustrate heightened judicial deference in cases involving national security, where courts are more inclined to support government measures in regulatory takings related to international threats. The general regulatory takings analysis involves balancing governmental interests with burdens on property owners, especially in cases of major threats to national security. Courts consider the extent to which government actions frustrate property owners' reasonable investment-backed expectations. The courts have rejected takings claims of property owners whose relations with foreign countries were affected by deteriorating or hostile relations with the United States. Decisions state that in foreign commerce, one should expect changing world circumstances and government interference, making government noninterference unreasonable. Various court cases support this stance. Most court cases cited involve property interests acquired amidst international tensions, such as ethnic strife in Yugoslavia or Libyan support of terrorism. Pre-acquisition stormclouds are not required for courts to consider takings claims. Courts may deny a taking claim even without pre-acquisition stormclouds if the property interest was acquired when the President had authority to impose measures against foreign assets. Courts have also rejected taking claims when the government action conferred substantial benefits on the plaintiff, as seen in cases like YMCA v. United States. Deference to government conduct of foreign policy and the President's role as commander in chief is a recurring hurdle for plaintiffs in taking claims. Judicial intervention in matters related to foreign policy and national security is rare, with courts showing deference to the President's constitutional role. This deference affects the reviewability of government actions in taking claims and is a factor in the analysis itself. Government actions related to national emergencies, war, and foreign relations are often considered beyond judicial reach due to the political question doctrine. This doctrine, as outlined in Baker v. Carr, specifies that certain cases are not within the jurisdiction of the judicial branch. Takings claims involving international conflicts have faced challenges under this doctrine, with courts deferring to the President's role in foreign policy matters. In El-Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries Co. v. United States, the Federal Circuit used the political question doctrine to reject a taking claim by the owner of a manufacturing plant in Sudan destroyed by U.S. cruise missiles ordered by President Clinton. The court concluded that reviewing a policy decision made by the President during an international crisis is barred as a political question. The Federal Circuit rejected a taking claim by the owner of a manufacturing plant in Sudan destroyed by U.S. cruise missiles ordered by President Clinton. The court found that the President has the power to designate enemy property in foreign territory, making the matter a nonjusticiable political question. The court emphasized that its ruling was limited and might have been different if the plant was in the U.S. or if there was no evidence of the President's determination. The political question defense was rejected in Langenegger v. United States, where the taking claim was based on El Salvador's confiscation of U.S.-citizen-owned land. The court emphasized that resolution of the case did not require a determination of El Salvador's sovereignty or question the executive's authority. In Rockefeller Center Properties v. United States, the Treasury Department's blocking of assets under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act was found to serve the public interest. The Takings Clause protection depends on the owner's legal status and the property's location. The Takings Clause protects the property of U.S. citizens against takings by the United States regardless of its location. Exceptions include property in enemy territory. Friendly aliens, like a Russian corporation, also have their property protected by the Takings Clause. The Russian Volunteer Fleet v. United States case clarified that aliens can invoke Takings Clause protection for property located within the United States, regardless of reciprocity with their home country. The decision also highlighted the requirement for foreign citizens to have the right to sue the U.S. government in their own courts to file a claim in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. In United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, the Court ruled that the Fourth Amendment does not apply to property owned by nonresident aliens in a foreign country. The decision clarified that aliens only receive constitutional protections when they have substantial connections within the United States. However, the authoritativeness of this ruling in relation to Russian Volunteer Fleet and the Takings Clause remains uncertain. The effect of Verdugo-Urquidez on the Takings Clause is uncertain. Recent case law has addressed alien-filed claims, ruling that the substantial connections rule applies. Cases involving German and Somali nationals suing the United States for takings were dismissed due to lack of connections. The case of Rosner v. United States involved Hungarian Jews alleging that their valuables confiscated by the pro-Nazi Hungarian government in 1944 were seized by the U.S. army while being shipped to Germany. The Federal Circuit declined to overrule its precedent in Turney v. United States, where U.S. seizure of radar equipment in the Philippines after World War II was considered a taking. The Takings Clause lacks extraterritorial application. The Federal Circuit has not ruled definitively on whether there is a substantial-connections prerequisite for takings claims by friendly aliens against the United States. However, case law suggests that such a prerequisite may be endorsed in the future. Enemy aliens do not receive Takings Clause protection for their property. Enemy aliens do not receive Takings Clause protection for their property located in enemy territory, which is considered enemy property and can be destroyed without compensation. There may be exceptions for confiscations unrelated to military necessity, such as in cases where the property is owned by a non-enemy national. The United States froze assets of hostile foreign nations under the Trading with the Enemy Act until 1977 when the International Emergency Economic Powers Act took over. This act limited the emergency authority to reach only specific circumstances. The International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) replaced the Trading with the Enemy Act in 1977, limiting emergency authority to specific circumstances. Under IEEPA, the President can prohibit actions related to property with foreign interests, but court decisions show that asset freezing orders under IEEPA or TWEA have not resulted in successful taking claims due to the temporary nature of the asset freeze. Court decisions have shown that asset freezing orders under IEEPA or TWEA have not resulted in successful taking claims due to the temporary nature of the freeze. The term \"temporary\" has been loosely interpreted, with the passage of considerable time not necessarily raising the taking specter if hostile relations are equally longstanding. Court decisions have shown that prolonged asset freezes may be viewed as takings, similar to land-use planning moratoria. The rationale for ruling against the claimant includes the potential need for the frozen assets to satisfy claims of U.S. citizens or to use as leverage in negotiations with a hostile nation. In a recent case, the U.S. used IEEPA to prevent a Cypriot citizen with Libyan ties from exercising stock options in a U.S. company due to Libya's support of terrorism. The stock options expired during the freeze, resulting in a loss to the plaintiff. The trial court found no taking of the option contract, citing the contingent nature of foreign commerce. On appeal, the plaintiff argued that the Treasury Department should have allowed him to exercise the options and retain the proceeds in a blocked account, claiming failure to do so was a taking. The TWEA and IEEPA authorize the vesting of foreign assets during wartime or armed hostilities. Vesting involves the U.S. taking ownership of the property for various purposes. The Supreme Court has emphasized the importance of providing a non-enemy claimant with a judicial hearing regarding the seizure of property believed to be enemy-owned. The President has authority to suspend judicial process against foreign assets and settle claims in the name of foreign policy. The IEEPA and Algerian Accords were key in blocking Iranian assets and substituting arbitration for private litigation. Some courts found no ripe taking issue in the suspension of private claims against Iran. Courts have addressed the issue of executive cancellation of private claims by settlement, with some suggesting it could be considered a taking in certain cases. Examples include cases such as Langenegger v. United States and American Int'l Group. Courts have addressed the issue of executive cancellation of private claims by settlement, with some suggesting it could be considered a taking in certain cases. Examples include cases such as Langenegger v. United States and American Int'l Group. Research shows no instances of a taking being found in cases such as the Algerian Accords extinguishing causes of action by former Iranian hostages against Iran. Similarly, no taking resulted when the President vacated pre-judgment attachments of Iranian assets. Holders of small claims against Iran also asserted a taking based on the United States' settlement of their claims, but no taking was found. The court in Langenegger v. United States addressed the issue of executive cancellation of private claims by settlement. In a case where disappointed contract parties asserted takings, the court ruled that the settlement sought to benefit the claimants whose claims had languished for many years. The $50 million fund available to successful claimants resulted in each claimant receiving the full amount of principal awarded but only a third of the interest accrued. The court stated that international commerce participants must be aware of potential strains in international relations, which could lead to federal measures against foreign governments affecting contract performance. In the international realm, takings plaintiffs face obstacles when contract performance relies on friendly relations between nations. Courts have noted that the U.S. may frustrate contract performance but not take a contract right. No successful takings claims have been found in this area, as seen in cases like Chang v. United States, 767 Third Avenue Assocs. v. United States, and Paradissiotis v. United States. In Chang, U.S. nationals entered into employment contracts with a Libyan oil company, but an executive order issued by the President interfered with the contracts. In 1985, U.S. nationals entered into employment contracts with a Libyan oil company. The President's executive order under IEEPA declared a national emergency due to Libyan support of terrorism, prohibiting U.S. persons from performing contracts in Libya. The court rejected the claim that the U.S. took their employment contracts, citing the expectation of contract performance relying on friendly relations between nations. Law enforcement personnel may damage or seize private property in pursuit of criminal suspects, often affecting innocent parties. The majority view is that these actions constitute a tort rather than a taking. Federal agencies combating terrorism have faced takings claims in non-terrorism-related law enforcement cases. The U.S. Customs Service's seizure of a private airplane was not considered a taking, even though the plane was damaged while in government storage. Forfeiture of private property, even involving innocent owners, is also rarely seen as a taking. The CIA and FBI have faced takings claims for financial losses caused by businesses created as fronts for intelligence gathering. The CIA and FBI have faced takings claims for financial losses caused by businesses created as fronts for intelligence gathering. In one scenario analyzed by the court, losses were not extensive enough to meet the takings threshold, and the character of the government action cut against a taking. However, a cautionary note was raised in Janowsky v. United States, where a business turned over to the FBI for investigating police corruption had its taking claim rejected due to the voluntary turnover. The Federal Circuit questioned if FBI statements coerced the owner into voluntary turnover, remanding the case. Takings claims based on physical takings have succeeded when private property is impressed into public service, not destroyed in hostilities. Military actions cannot evade the Takings Clause by using military forces as cover for actions that would be actionable if done by civilian agencies. The rule that military appropriations must be compensated, at least when not demanded by the immediate needs of battle, is illustrated by takings decisions on military flights over private property in both wartime and peacetime. Military actions cannot evade the Takings Clause by using military forces as cover for actions that would be actionable if done by civilian agencies. In Portsmouth Harbor Land & Hotel Co. v. United States, a servitude may be considered if U.S. guns were installed to subordinate adjacent resort to government's right to fire across it at will. United States v. Pewee Coal Co. found a taking based on the government's seizure and operation of coal mines during World War II to prevent a strike. The compensable expropriation of U.S.-citizen property for military use dates back to the nineteenth century. In Portsmouth Harbor Land & Hotel Co. v. United States, a servitude may be considered if U.S. guns were installed to subordinate adjacent resort to government's right to fire across it at will. United States v. Pewee Coal Co. found a taking based on the government's seizure and operation of coal mines during World War II to prevent a strike. The compensable expropriation of U.S.-citizen property for military use dates back to the nineteenth century. Discussing Russell and Mitchell, a court isolated the distinction between compensable and noncompensable military actions, stating that destruction of property in connection with actual battle is usually noncompensable. The wartime destruction of private property by the United States to prevent capture by an advancing enemy is usually noncompensable. Property damage due to battlefield operations is also noncompensable. The destruction or injury of private property in war, including in battle or bombardment of cities, had to be borne by the sufferers alone as a consequence. This noncompensability is similar to the common law's recognition that in times of imminent peril, the sovereign could destroy property to save lives."
