    "content": "The Act titled \"Incentivize Growth Now In Tomorrow's Entrepreneurs Act of 2013\" establishes Small Business Start-up Savings Accounts under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Incentivize Growth Now In Tomorrow's Entrepreneurs Act of 2013\" establishes Small Business Start-up Savings Accounts, which are exempt from taxation but subject to unrelated business income taxes. These accounts are trusts created for qualified start-up expenditures by the designated beneficiary, meeting specific requirements. The \"Incentivize Growth Now In Tomorrow's Entrepreneurs Act of 2013\" introduces Small Business Start-up Savings Accounts, where contributions must be in cash and limited to $10,000 or the individual's gross income. The trustee must be a bank or meet specific criteria, funds cannot be invested in life insurance, and assets cannot be commingled. The trust assets must not be commingled with other property except in a common trust fund or common investment fund. Qualified start-up expenditures include those defined by section 195 and the taxpayer's share in entities where they hold stock or interest. However, this term does not apply if the business has over 50 full-time employees in a taxable year. Tax Treatment of Distributions: Any distribution is taxable under section 72. No income tax is due if qualified start-up expenses equal or exceed distributions. Excess distributions reduce taxable income. The tax treatment of distributions under section 72 includes the exclusion of qualified start-up expenditures from gross income. No deduction, credit, or exclusion is allowed for these expenditures. Excess contributions must be returned before the due date of the return for small businesses. For a taxable year, distributions from small business start-up savings accounts are exempt from excess contributions if received by the individual before the tax return deadline and accompanied by the net income attributable to the excess contribution. Excess contribution refers to any contribution exceeding the allowable amount for the taxable year. Rollover contribution allows for the transfer of funds from a small business start-up savings account to another account for the beneficiary within 60 days. Transfer of an individual's interest in a small business start-up savings account to a spouse or former spouse under a divorce or separation instrument is not taxable. After the transfer, the account is treated as if the spouse is the beneficiary. If the designated beneficiary is the surviving spouse, specific treatment applies. If a surviving spouse acquires the interest in a small business start-up savings account after the account beneficiary's death, the account is treated as if the spouse were the beneficiary. In other cases where someone else acquires the account beneficiary's interest, the account ceases to be a small business start-up savings account. If a surviving spouse or other beneficiary acquires a small business start-up savings account after the original beneficiary's death, the fair market value of the assets in the account on the date of death is includible in the beneficiary's gross income for the taxable year. Special rules apply in such cases. Special rules apply for reducing inclusion of predeath expenses in gross income and allowing deductions for estate taxes under certain circumstances. The section allows deductions for estate taxes under certain circumstances, excluding the decedent or spouse. Community property laws are disregarded, and custodial accounts are treated as trusts if held by a bank or person meeting specific criteria. The section discusses small business start-up accounts and custodial accounts treated as trusts. It also mentions adjustments for inflation in dollar amounts for taxable years after December 31, 2014.
