    "content": "Policymakers have focused on drug compounding and pharmaceutical supply chain security, leading to the creation of the Drug Quality and Security Act (H.R. 3204). The bill covers the Compounding Quality Act and the Drug Supply Chain Security Act. The House passed H.R. 3204, awaiting Senate action. The report outlines the provisions in the bill without discussing policy implications. The federal government currently regulates drug manufacturing under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The federal government regulates drug manufacturing and sales within the United States under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Compounding Quality Act (H.R. 3204) addresses issues related to drug compounding, maintaining FDA authority over the process. The Compounding Quality Act (H.R. 3204) addresses issues related to drug compounding by maintaining FDA authority, establishing outsourcing facilities for compounding sterile drugs, requiring labeling of compounded drugs, dictating user fees for registration, advisory committee activities, annual reports, regulations, and enhanced communication among state boards of pharmacy and the FDA. H.R. 3204 proposes amendments to FFDCA Section 503A, allowing compounders to advertise compounded drugs and removing the \"unsolicited\" modifier from the valid prescription requirement. It includes a severability provision and outlines circumstances for state-regulated pharmacies to compound drugs. The pharmacy may compound drugs, referred to as traditional compounding, by a licensed pharmacist or physician in response to a prescription for an individual patient. Proposed Section 503B would allow facilities to register as outsourcing facilities for compounding drugs beyond FFDCA Section 503A circumstances, waiving certain requirements for drug manufacturers. The proposed Section 503B would waive certain requirements for drug manufacturers, focusing on drug compounding in registered outsourcing facilities. Requirements include limitations on bulk drug substances, ingredients, and compliance with Title II activities. The bill outlines restrictions on the use of bulk drug substances and ingredients for compounding in outsourcing facilities. Drugs must not be withdrawn from the market for safety reasons, be copies of approved drugs, or on a list of drugs with compounding difficulties. Outsourcing facilities must comply with REMS if applicable and can only sell or transfer compounded drugs. Outsourcing facilities must comply with REMS and can only sell compounded drugs with specific labeling requirements, including a statement indicating it is a compounded drug, identifying information, and directions for use. Outsourcing facilities must register annually with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, submit reports twice a year on compounded drugs, be subject to inspections based on risk factors, and report adverse events. The Secretary will make registration information public and issue regulations on drugs causing difficulties. The proposed Section 503B would define compounding, approved drugs, outsourcing facilities, and sterile drugs. It would amend FFDCA sections on prohibited acts and misbranded drugs related to compounded drugs. H.R. 3204 would introduce user fees for outsourcing facilities, including an annual establishment fee and reinspection fees. The bill introduces user fees for outsourcing facilities, including establishment and reinspection fees. The Secretary would establish fee amounts, inflation adjustments, and exceptions for small businesses. Fees collected would be used for oversight of outsourcing facilities, with annual reports to Congress on fee usage and inspections conducted. The bill H.R. 3204 \"Enhanced Communication\" directs the Secretary to receive information from state boards of pharmacy regarding actions taken on compounding pharmacies or concerns of non-compliance with FFDCA Section 503A. The Secretary must consult with the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy and notify state boards promptly. The Comptroller General would review pharmacy compounding in each state, state laws, tools for drug safety assessment, and the effectiveness of compounding. The bill H.R. 3204 \"Enhanced Communication\" aims to evaluate the safety and quality of compounded drugs, improve communication about compounding, and assess FDA's implementation of FFDCA Sections 503A and 503B. Various stakeholders in the drug supply chain are seeking a system to trace and verify the identity of drugs to prevent contamination, diversion, counterfeiting, and adulteration. The proposed Drug Supply Chain Security Act, Title II, aims to establish a national policy for drug supply chain security. It requires transaction information, history, and statements, a product identifier on each package, and verification of the product identifier at the package level. Starting dates for compliance vary for manufacturers, wholesale distributors, repackagers, and dispensers. Title II of the proposed Drug Supply Chain Security Act establishes a national policy for drug supply chain security. It includes requirements for registration of wholesale distributors and third-party logistics providers, development of standards for registration, implementation of an interoperable unit-level traceability system, and maintenance of a uniform national policy for tracing drug products through the supply chain. Amendments to the FFDCA are proposed to support these measures. Proposed FFDCA Section 582 outlines requirements for entities in the drug supply chain, including manufacturers, wholesale distributors, dispensers, repackagers, and drop shipments. The Secretary would issue draft guidance within one year for the exchange of transaction information and finalize it within two years. The proposed FFDCA Section 582 outlines requirements for entities in the drug supply chain, including manufacturers, wholesale distributors, dispensers, repackagers, and drop shipments. The Secretary would issue guidance within two years to specify exemptions for products in the supply chain from product identifier requirements. Exemptions or alternative start dates are provided for certain transaction information, transaction history, or transaction statements, and licensing requirements for products in the supply chain before January 1, 2015. The proposed FFDCA Section 582 sets requirements for entities in the drug supply chain, including manufacturers, wholesale distributors, and repackagers. It includes regulations for product tracing, product identifiers, and verification of suspect products using human- or machine-readable methods. The proposed FFDCA Section 582 outlines requirements for entities in the drug supply chain, including product tracing, identifiers, and verification. It also describes enhanced drug distribution security provisions such as electronic package-level tracing and national standards for wholesale distributors and third-party logistics providers. The bill aims for interoperable electronic tracing of products at the package level. The bill proposes electronic tracing of products at the package level to be implemented 10 years after enactment. It involves exchanging transaction information securely and electronically, using standardized identifiers to verify products and respond to requests by the Secretary. The process aims to protect confidential information and enable saleable returns. The proposed section allows dispensers to enter agreements with third parties for maintaining required information and statements. The Secretary can provide alternative methods of compliance for small businesses or in cases of economic hardship. A contract for a technology and software assessment for electronic tracing of products at the package level must be initiated within 18 months after final guidance, with completion within 8\u00bd years. The assessment content and public comment requirements are specified in the bill. The bill specifies assessment content and public comment requirements for regulations on small businesses and dispensers. The Secretary must issue guidance on identifying suspect products within 180 days of enactment. The bill requires the Secretary to identify suspect and illegitimate products within 180 days of enactment, recommend unit level tracing within 18 months, and finalize guidance on data exchange standards within the same timeframe. At least five public meetings must be held to enhance pharmaceutical supply chain safety, with the first meeting scheduled one year after enactment. Additionally, pilot projects will be established to explore methods for improving supply chain safety and security. The bill directs the design of pilots for an interoperable unit-level tracking system in the pharmaceutical supply chain. It specifies that certain requirements of the act would have \"no force or effect\" 10 years after enactment, including the exchange of transaction histories among supply chain entities. Amendments to FFDCA Section 503(e) would require licensing for wholesale distributors and maintenance of a list of authorized distributors of record by manufacturers. The proposed amendment to Section 503(e) would require licensing for wholesale distributors, with the Secretary having the authority to provide licensure if the state does not require it. Wholesale distributors must meet specified conditions and report annually to the Secretary. A database of authorized wholesale distributors would be established by January 1, 2015. The bill would amend the definition of wholesale distribution to include additional exclusions and establish national standards for prescription drug wholesale distributors, including storage and handling requirements, mandatory background checks, and facility inspections. The Secretary would provide state officials with access to licensing information without disclosing protected trade secrets or confidential information. The bill proposes national standards for third-party logistics providers, requiring state or Secretary licensure, annual reports, and inspections. The bill mandates national standards for third-party logistics providers, including licensure, annual reports, and regulations for licensing. The Secretary must issue regulations within two years, covering accreditation, storage practices, inspections, background checks, and license renewal. Regulations will undergo a notice and comment period before becoming effective. H.R. 3204 proposes national standards for third-party logistics providers, including regulations for licensing and accreditation. It prohibits states from imposing additional requirements for tracing products through the distribution system. The proposed legislation prohibits states from imposing additional requirements for licensing and accreditation of third-party logistics providers, aligning with national standards and regulations. The proposed legislation would prohibit states from regulating third-party logistics providers as wholesale distributors and allow them to collect fees for licensure. States would have enforcement powers consistent with product tracing requirements. The bill also includes an exception for state requirements unrelated to product tracing or licensure. The bill would amend FFDCA Section 301(t) to make it a prohibited act to fail to comply with transaction requirements in the supply chain and national standards for third-party logistics providers. It would also deem a drug as misbranded if it lacks the required product identifier."
