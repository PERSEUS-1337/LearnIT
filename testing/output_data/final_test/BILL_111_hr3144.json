    "content": "The \"Healthy Communities Act of 2009\" may be cited as the official title of this Act. The Act includes findings related to healthy communities. According to Congress findings, the prevalence of overweight children aged 6-11 years and 12-19 years was 17% and 17.6% respectively. Overweight adolescents have a 70% chance of becoming obese adults and are at risk for various health issues such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and psychological disorders. Obesity may contribute to an estimated 300,000 deaths per year in the United States. In 2000, the total cost of obesity in the United States was estimated to be $117 billion. Dietary Guidelines recommend increasing fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and calcium-rich foods while reducing fats, sodium, sugars, and calories to improve health. The Surgeon General notes that nearly half of young people aged 12-21 are not regularly active, but physical activity can improve strength, muscle, and decrease body fat. SEC. 3. COMMUNITY OBESITY PREVENTION PROGRAM. Part P of title III of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include a new section 399U for the Community Obesity Prevention Program. The Secretary will provide 5-year grants to community partnerships for obesity prevention programs. Partnership members must include representatives from hospitals, school districts, early childhood care providers, local governments, health insurance companies, pediatricians, other health professionals, and local employers. Programs seeking funding must have an executive council with members from each of these areas. The executive council is responsible for governing, overseeing, and managing the program, meeting monthly to discuss program governance, and having subcommittees with partnership members representing various community participants. The program also includes a steering committee composed of local health and environmental groups. The steering committee, part of the program on urban planning and forming livable communities, includes representatives from local recreational facilities, restaurants, grocery stores, farmers, and other relevant groups. They meet at least 10 times per year to assess program progress and provide recommendations. The program on urban planning and forming livable communities includes a steering committee that meets regularly to assess progress and make recommendations for improvements. The program components focus on physical exercise, community events, nutritional counseling, and healthy meal ideas. The curr_chunk discusses ideas for promoting healthy eating habits in various settings such as home, school, early childhood care, and workplace. It also mentions alternatives to unhealthy food choices and the availability of nutritious foods, including evaluating food deserts and farmers' markets. Additionally, education is emphasized to provide information on the importance of healthy eating, maintaining a balanced diet, being physically fit, and promoting community wellness. The program aims to promote physical fitness by providing strategies for individuals with varying capabilities. It utilizes the National Institutes of Health's Ways to Enhance Children's Activity and Nutrition program as an evidence-based curriculum. Best practices, communication plans involving the community, and in-school/workplace wellness programs are also emphasized. The program includes a Wellness Coordinator to ensure healthy lifestyle promotion and monthly progress updates. An assessment of the obesity problem in the community is conducted by the executive and steering committees. The executive committee, steering committee, and Wellness Coordinator collaborate to set achievable goals for reducing childhood obesity, including specific percentage decreases in rates of obese and overweight individuals, increases in physical activity levels, and improvements in nutrition. The Wellness Coordinator must submit reports on program success and effectiveness to the Secretary annually. Funds awarded under this section cannot be used for administrative expenses, except for staff salaries and benefits. The Secretary gives preference to communities with high levels of obesity and related chronic diseases when selecting grant recipients. Grant funds can be used to pay staff salaries and benefits for program implementation or for assessment costs. To continue receiving assistance, a community partnership must submit an application each fiscal year detailing progress in reducing obesity. The funding for the program aims to reduce obesity by promoting healthy eating and physical activity. $10,000,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2010, with additional funding for 2011-2015. Grants up to $100,000 can be awarded to community partnerships, with matching funds required. The Secretary may grant funds to combat obesity to community partnerships if they provide non-Federal contributions of at least $1 for every $4 of Federal funds."
