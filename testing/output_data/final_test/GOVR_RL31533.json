    "content": "Prior to the 2003 war against Iraq, the United States intervened in conflicts in the Gulf to counter Iranian or Iraqi aggression. The Iran-Iraq War lasted from 1980 to 1988, with the U.S. supporting Iraq to combat Iran's Islamic revolutionary government. In 1987-1988, there were naval skirmishes between the U.S. and Iran, culminating in the destruction of almost half of Iran's largest naval vessels in Operation Praying Mantis. On July 3, 1988, the U.S. mistakenly shot down an Iranian passenger plane. The Iran-Iraq war ended in August 1988 after heavy casualties, with Iraq emerging victorious. Saddam Hussein then invaded Kuwait in 1990, leading to a coalition of over 700,000 troops, including 500,000 U.S. soldiers, to liberate Kuwait. The 1991 Gulf War, known as Operation Desert Storm, involved over 500,000 U.S. troops and 200,000 troops from 33 other countries. It resulted in casualties, reduced Iraq's military capabilities, and highlighted the use of weapons of mass destruction. Iraq's advanced missile and nuclear programs were a concern, leading to Israel conducting an air-strike on Iraq's nuclear reactor in 1981. During the Iran-Iraq war, both countries fired enhanced Scud missiles at each other's cities, leading to casualties. Iraq used chemical weapons on multiple occasions, killing thousands of Iranians and Kurds. In the 1991 Gulf War, Iraq fired Scud missiles at Israel and Saudi Arabia, causing casualties, including an attack on U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia. In Saudi Arabia, a bombing at a barracks killed 28 military personnel and wounded 97. U.N. weapons inspectors worked to dismantle Iraq's WMD infrastructure from 1991-1998, but left in 1998 due to Iraqi obstructions. New inspections began in 2002 but were ended as the U.S. believed Iraq was not fully disarming, leading to Operation Iraqi Freedom. The Clinton Administration's \"dual containment\" policy aimed to weaken both Iran and Iraq. Saudi Arabia and Kuwait were concerned about Iraq's conventional threat and saw Iran as a counterbalance. The Gulf states viewed Iran as a greater danger than Iraq, with Bahrain accusing Iran of plotting to destabilize the country. UAE became alarmed when Iran took control of Abu Musa island. Relations improved with Iran in the late 1990s after the election of President Mohammad Khatemi, who reduced support for Shiite dissidents in the Gulf states. Despite attempts by the Clinton Administration to engage in direct talks with Iran, the United States maintained a cautious approach. The United States tried to constrain Iran's WMD programs with mixed success, as Iran faced no mandatory international restrictions on importing advanced conventional weapons or dual-use technology. Iran's WMD programs advanced in the 1990s with help from various countries and entities. The dual containment policy had little success in curbing Iran's support for international terrorism, as Iran has been on the U.S. list of terrorism state sponsors since 1984. The Islamic regime in Iran has been described as the most active state sponsor of terrorism. They held American diplomats hostage in 1979-1981 and supported Hizballah in holding Americans hostage in Lebanon from 1984-1991. Iranian operatives may have been involved in the 1996 bombing in Saudi Arabia, and Iran has been on the U.S. list of terrorism state sponsors since 1984. Iran supports groups opposing the U.S.-sponsored Arab-Israeli peace process, including Hizballah, Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Al Aqsa Martyr's Brigade, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command. Iraq's former regime also supported Palestinian violence against Israel. Iran and Saddam's Iraq were not linked to the September 11 attacks but had some connections with Al Qaeda, including limited contacts with the Saddam Hussein regime. The new government in Iraq, friendly towards the US, was removed from the terrorism list in 2004. Iran is not expected to be removed from the US list of state sponsors of terrorism. The Gulf threat profile has changed after Saddam Hussein's regime fell, with new security concerns emerging for the Gulf states. The Gulf states fear Iran's increasing influence in Gulf security, exacerbated by the hardline Iranian presidency of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Iran's long coastline and sense of nationhood drive its desire for a major role in Gulf security. GCC leaders have not specified their concerns about Iran's actions. The Gulf states and the United States have renewed discussions on joint defense initiatives in response to concerns about Iran's WMD programs, particularly its nuclear program. GCC states are wary of Iran's potential to intimidate them and may support U.S. military action to halt Iran's nuclear program. Iran's military capabilities in the Gulf, including coastal missiles, patrol boats, mines, aircraft, submarines, and other equipment, could be used to block the key oil shipment route through the Strait of Hormuz. However, U.S. officials are confident that their military presence in the Gulf could quickly overpower Iran's older equipment and prevent any such action. There are concerns that even a failed attempt by Iran to block the strait could lead to increased shipping insurance rates and higher oil prices. The Gulf states are concerned about the rise of Shiite Islamist factions in post-Saddam Iraq, led by figures like Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani and Moqtada Al Sadr. Iraqi Shiite parties dominating elections are fueling Shiite demands for power in the Gulf states, where Shiite populations feel under-represented. In Bahrain, where Shiites are the majority, there are plans for Shiite groupings to participate in upcoming parliamentary elections. In Bahrain, Shiite groups are preparing to compete in the 2006 parliamentary elections to assert their rights against the Sunni-dominated government. Reconciliation efforts are underway to prevent Sunni-Shiite tensions, including ending the distinction between Sunni and Shiite mosques. Kuwait remains cautious of potential Shiite militance, engaging with Iraq's Shiite clerics and providing humanitarian aid. Saudi Arabia has not fulfilled its $1 billion aid pledges to Iraq and has not appointed an ambassador. Gulf states were hesitant to support the U.S. intervention in Iraq, preferring UN authorization and international support. The Gulf states, including Kuwait and Qatar, supported the U.S. intervention in Iraq by hosting U.S. forces and equipment. Saudi Arabia was opposed to the offensive but eventually allowed the redeployment of U.S. personnel after Saddam Hussein's fall. Gulf leaders expressed concerns about potential spillover from the Iraq war at a summit in Abu Dhabi in December 2005. The Gulf states are concerned about potential spillover from the Iraq war, with Sunni militants targeting them for supporting the U.S. invasion. They fear that if the U.S. withdraws from Iraq, it could become a safe haven for militants. Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states' efforts to promote ethnic and sectarian balance in Iraq may also increase the risk of spillover. The potential for spillover from Iraq is increasing, with Saudi Arabia possibly allowing some Saudis to assist the Sunni insurgency there. King Abdullah has decided against providing more active support to Sunnis to avoid stimulating Iran's aid to Shiite groups in Iraq. U.S. military officers report that Saudi fighters accounted for half of foreign insurgents killed in Iraq in 2005. Saudi clerics called on Iraqis to fight U.S.-led forces in 2004, but Saudi Arabia has also pursued diplomacy to increase Sunni Arab involvement in Iraq's government. The Saudis played a role in persuading Iraqi Sunni clerics to attend a reconciliation meeting in Cairo. The U.S.-GCC relationships have enabled military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. Gulf states hosted U.S. forces for combat missions in Afghanistan after 9/11, but were less enthusiastic about the war in Iraq. The Gulf states were less enthusiastic about the war in Iraq, but still provided facilities for Operation Iraqi Freedom. U.S.-Gulf defense relations include bilateral defense pacts with access for U.S. forces, training, equipment pre-positioning, and arms sales. These pacts do not guarantee U.S. aid in case of attack or automatic permission for military operations from Gulf facilities. The Gulf states allow U.S. military operations from their facilities on a case by case basis. Despite Saddam Hussein's removal, formal defense pacts remain in place. The number of U.S. military personnel in the Gulf has decreased since the 1990s, with a significant presence in Kuwait supporting Operation Iraqi Freedom. U.S. forces in Iraq total around 130,000. Saudi Arabia did not sign a formal defense pact with the United States but has limited defense procurement and training agreements. U.S. combat aircraft in Saudi Arabia enforced a \"no fly zone\" over southern Iraq. Most U.S. personnel and combat aircraft were withdrawn in September 2003. Saudi Arabia did not offer to allow U.S. pilots to fly missions for Operation Enduring Freedom. In September 2003, Saudi Arabia allowed the United States to use the Combined Air Operations Center at Prince Sultan Air Base for coordinating air operations over Afghanistan. Bahrain has hosted the headquarters for U.S. naval forces in the Gulf since 1948 and signed a defense cooperation agreement with the U.S. in 1991. The U.S. Navy reestablished its Fifth Fleet responsible for the Persian Gulf region in June 1995. The U.S. Navy reestablished its Fifth Fleet in Bahrain for the Persian Gulf region. Bahrain allowed U.S. combat aircraft missions and deployed its naval vessel in support of operations. Oman signed agreements for U.S. access to airbases, while Kuwait signed a defense agreement due to concerns of Iraqi aggression. In 1991, Kuwait signed a 10-year pact with the United States to preposition equipment for two U.S. brigades. Joint exercises were held regularly, with 4,000 U.S. military personnel stationed in Kuwait during the 1990s. The U.S. spent $170 million to upgrade Kuwaiti air bases for U.S. aircraft. Kuwait also closed off a portion of its territory for the U.S.-led invasion force in OIF. Qatar was also strengthening its defense relationship with the U.S. before OEF and OIF. Qatar signed a defense pact with the United States in 1992, allowing the prepositioning of armor for two U.S. brigades at As Saliyah site. The U.S. built an air operations center at Al Udeid air base, now hosting U.S. Central Command forward headquarters. Qatar supports U.S. operations in OEF and OIF. In contrast, the UAE sought closer defense ties with the U.S. after the 1991 Gulf War to deter Iran. The UAE signed a defense pact with the United States in 1994 to deter Iran. There are differences in legal jurisdiction of U.S. military personnel in the UAE. The UAE allows U.S. pre-positioning and ship port visits at Jebel Ali port. They host U.S. refueling aircraft at Al-Dhafra air base for OEF and OIF. The UAE limited the U.S. to conducting support air operations during OIF. Gulf states, including Saudi Arabia, are considering new arms purchases to counter the perceived threat from Iran. Saudi Arabia agreed to buy 72 Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft in a deal worth $18 billion, amid concerns in Congress about sales of sophisticated weapons to Gulf states. Some worry about eroding Israel's military edge or violating international conventions, but experts doubt Gulf states would join in military action against Israel. The Gulf states are dependent on U.S. training and arms, but U.S. arms sales are restricted due to the Arab League boycott of Israel. Despite their wealth, GCC states have received increased U.S. aid for promoting anti-terrorism capabilities and military ties. The Gulf states rely on U.S. training and arms, with Saudi Arabia receiving discounted International Military Education and Training funds. President Bush waived restrictions on aid to Saudi Arabia in 2005. Bahrain and Oman are eligible for U.S. military items on a grant basis. The UAE is eligible to buy or lease Excess Defense Articles (EDA), which are U.S. military items declared surplus but still usable. Bahrain and Oman have received EDA such as tanks, frigates, and air defense batteries. Bahrain is seeking a second frigate under this program. In FY2007, both Bahrain and Oman will receive EDA to enhance military mobility and border monitoring. U.S. arms sales to Gulf states are seen as crucial for cementing alliances and promoting inter-operability. The Gulf states are looking to cement alliances and promote inter-operability with the U.S. through arms sales, particularly combat aircraft to deter Iran. Some states may seek arms from non-U.S. sources to diversify defense relationships or gain leverage. The UAE has historically purchased major combat systems from France but now believes arms purchases from the U.S. enhance security commitment. In 2000, the UAE signed a contract to purchase 80 U.S. F-16 aircraft with advanced missiles. The UAE has purchased a range of missiles and helicopters from the U.S., including the AMRAAM, HARM, and Harpoon systems. The total sale value is over $8 billion. Additionally, there are plans for the purchase of JAVELIN anti-tank missile launchers and UH-60M helicopters. Saudi Arabia has also made significant arms purchases from the U.S., including F-15S aircraft and Abrams tanks. Saudi Arabia has made significant arms purchases from the U.S., including F-15S aircraft, Abrams tanks, Patriot firing units, and Apache helicopters. They are now considering new purchases, such as a new generation fighter aircraft. Additionally, they have signed an agreement to buy Eurofighter Typhoon jets and intend to purchase armored personnel carriers and upgrades for military equipment. Saudi Arabia has made significant arms purchases from the U.S., including F-15S aircraft, Abrams tanks, Patriot firing units, and Apache helicopters. The total sales amount to $3.3 billion. Kuwait has bought AH-64 \"Apache\" helicopters, F/A-18 aircraft, Patriot firing units, and M1A2 Abrams tanks. Both Kuwait and Bahrain have been designated as \"major non-NATO allies\" by the U.S., facilitating future arms sales. Bahrain purchased 10 F-16s in 1998. In late 1999, Bahrain purchased 26 AMRAAMs for $69 million with congressional approval. In August 2000, Bahrain requested to buy 30 Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMs) for short-range ballistic missiles. The Defense Department assured Congress that the sale would not violate the rules of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR). Bahrain agreed to a joint U.S.-Bahraini control system for the weapons, with delivery starting in October 2002. In October 2002, Bahrain began receiving Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMs) after agreeing to a joint control system with the U.S. In July 2006, DSCA reported a sale of up to 180 Javelin missiles and nine Blackhawk helicopters to Bahrain. Qatar, traditionally armed by France and Britain, has shown interest in U.S. systems like ATACM and Patriot missile defense. Oman's arms purchases have been traditional. In August 2005, a possible sale of weaponry to India collapsed over pricing issues. Oman has traditionally purchased British weaponry, but in October 2001, they announced the purchase of 12 F-16 A/B aircraft from the United States. In April 2003, Oman decided to buy a podded airborne reconnaissance system for the F-16's. In July 2006, a possible sale of up to 250 Javelin missiles to Oman was notified to Congress. The United States has been encouraging Gulf states to increase military cooperation. The Gulf states have superior military equipment compared to Iran, with technology purchased from the US and Europe. However, the Peninsula Shield force, formed in 1981, has faced challenges in coordination and command. Despite plans to increase its size to 22,000, no timetable has been set. The Gulf states have advanced military equipment purchased from the US and Europe. Plans to increase the Peninsula Shield force to 22,000 have no set timetable. The US is shifting focus to improving GCC naval and air cooperation due to growing threats from Iran and terrorist infiltration by sea. The Bush Administration is working to revive the Cooperative Defense Initiative to integrate the GCC. The Bush Administration is reviving the Cooperative Defense Initiative to integrate GCC defenses with the United States, focusing on joint training for defense against chemical or biological attacks and enhancing missile defense capabilities in response to Iran's growing threat. The Bush Administration is reviving the Cooperative Defense Initiative to integrate GCC defenses with the United States, focusing on joint training for defense against chemical or biological attacks and enhancing missile defense capabilities in response to Iran's growing threat. The idea of an integrated TMD network in the GCC states faced financial constraints and differing threat perceptions among the Gulf states. U.S. officials are encouraging GCC states to close Iranian companies that could be used to procure WMD technology and track shipments to Iran as part of the joint U.S.-GCC security initiative. The Combined Task Force, consisting of U.S. and allied warships, patrols the Gulf to prevent smuggling and terrorist movement. CTF-152, responsible for the central and southern Arabian Gulf, came under Italian command in 2006. Gulf state suspicions hindered military cooperation with Syria and Egypt as outlined in the Damascus Declaration. Political disputes within the GCC have eased, with border disputes mostly resolved. The GCC states have settled most border disputes, with the exception of the UAE's claim against Saudi Arabia. Bahrain and Qatar resolved their territorial dispute over the Hawar Islands with the construction of a causeway. Gulf states are exploring security cooperation with Western powers, focusing on issues like drug trafficking and human trafficking. NATO launched the \"Istanbul Cooperation Initiative\" in 2004 for greater cooperation with Gulf states. Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, and the UAE have shown interest in this initiative. Some Gulf states have joined the Istanbul initiative for cooperation with NATO, but the absence of Saudi and Omani participation could slow its development. NATO Secretary General attended a meeting with Gulf defense officials in Qatar to promote greater interaction. In 2005, NATO naval units, including some Gulf forces, held exercises in the Arabian Sea in support of the Proliferation Security Initiative. The Gulf monarchies have not faced regime-threatening instability from external threats. The Gulf states have not faced regime-threatening instability from external threats, but there are domestic forces that could potentially destabilize the region, especially if influenced by outside powers like Iran. Bahrain and Saudi Arabia have seen periodic unrest since the 1990s, but have largely quelled it. The Gulf states are implementing gradual political and economic reforms to appease pro-reform elements while maintaining tradition. Several Gulf states have undergone leadership transitions in recent years, allowing for progress on dormant reforms. King Fahd of Saudi Arabia suffered a stroke in 1995 and passed away in 2005, succeeded by his half-brother and heir. King Fahd of Saudi Arabia passed away on August 1, 2005, and was succeeded by his half-brother Crown Prince Abdullah. Abdullah, who is about 81 years old, has been more willing to question U.S. policy in the region but maintains a cooperative relationship with the United States. He is popular among Saudi tribes and religious conservatives, giving him legitimacy to combat Al Qaeda. The new heir apparent is Prince Sultan, Fahd's full brother, but succession could be affected by family factional politics. The post-Fahd cabinet remains largely unchanged, with Sultan still serving as Defense Minister. In Bahrain, the sudden death of Amir Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa on March 6, 1999 led to the accession of his son, Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, who became King and named his son Salman as Crown Prince. In the UAE, the transition was completed upon the death of Shaykh Zayid bin Sultan al-Nuhayyan in 2004, with his eldest son, Crown Prince Khalifa, taking over. In 2006, Sheikh Maktum bin Rashid Al Maktum of Dubai died suddenly and was succeeded by his brother, Sheikh Mohammad bin Rashid Al Maktum, who had been de facto ruler for years. The UAE is stable with a high GDP per capita and minimal societal divisions. Qatar's Amir, Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, took power in a bloodless coup in 1995 and has been a leader in political reform and women's rights in the Gulf. His foreign policy is independent from Saudi Arabia, and he enjoys wide internal support. However, concerns arise about potential lack of dynamic leadership if he were to leave unexpectedly, as seen in his sudden change of crown prince in 2003. Following the death of Kuwait's long-serving Amir Jabir al-Ahmad Al Sabah in January 2006, a succession struggle among Al Sabah factions was resolved in favor of Sabah al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, who was serving as Prime Minister. Tensions within the ruling family and with other elites lingered after the struggle, affecting the leadership futures of potential successors. Despite political skirmishes, anti-regime violence in Kuwait is minimal, with most opposition expressed within the National Assembly. The Sultanate of Oman has remained relatively stable under Sultan Qaboos bin Said Al Said since 1970. Despite concerns about succession due to the lack of a clear heir, the country has seen little unrest. In 1995, there was a potential succession crisis when Sultan Qaboos was involved in a car accident. Recent arrests in 2005 suggest a possible radical Islamist element in the country, following a similar incident in 1994. In January 2005, thirty-one Omanis were convicted of subversion but pardoned in June 2005. Gulf leaders are opening the political process for modernization and globalization. The Bush Administration supports political liberalization in the Gulf to address root causes of the September 11 attacks. Gulf reform efforts predate US urging and continue without substantial prodding. Some leaders fear rapid liberalization could empower Islamist extremists. Gulf states, except UAE and Saudi Arabia, allow full female electoral participation. Kuwait has made progress in political liberalization, expanding the all-male electorate for its National Assembly. The Assembly wields significant power, reviewing and vetoing governmental decrees. In 2006, Shaykh Sabah was confirmed as Amir after a succession struggle, and as Prime Minister in 2005, he secured Assembly approval for female suffrage. Despite this, no women were elected in the 2006 elections. The newly elected Assembly, with a majority of reformists, continues efforts for political reform. The newly elected Assembly in Kuwait, with a majority of reformists, successfully pushed for the consolidation of election districts from 25 to five. This reform aimed to reduce corruption by limiting vote-buying opportunities. In Qatar, women were granted full suffrage in municipal elections in 1999, but none were initially elected. However, in 2003, one woman won a seat. A constitution was adopted in 2003 through a national referendum, with overwhelming approval paving the way for elections to a one-chamber assembly in 2007. In Oman, direct elections were introduced for the Consultative Council in 2000, with 25% of citizens over 21 years old eligible to vote. The State Council, with five women members, serves as a check on the elected Consultative Council, forming a bi-cameral \"Oman Council.\" Voting rights were extended to all citizens over 21 in 2002, starting with the 2003 Consultative Council elections. The Consultative Council elections in Oman began in 2000, with voting rights extended to all citizens over 21 in 2002. The Oman Council lacks legislative powers, with no evident factions. In Bahrain, a new national assembly was established through a referendum in 2002, leading to peaceful election competition. In late October 2002, elections were held in Bahrain for the National Assembly, resulting in a split between moderate Islamists and secular Muslims. None of the eight female candidates were elected. Some Shiite critics boycotted the elections, claiming it went against promises to restore the 1973 parliamentary process. The major Shiite opposition bloc, Wifaq, plans to participate in the October 2006 elections to assert their demands. King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia is pushing for political liberalization, expanding the Consultative Council during King Fahd's reign. During Fahd's reign, Saudi Arabia expanded its Consultative Council to 150 seats by 2005, granting it new powers to initiate legislation and veto governmental laws. In 2005, elections were held for half of the seats on local municipal councils, excluding women from voting. However, two Saudi women were elected to the Jeddah Chamber of Commerce in November 2005, marking a significant step towards female participation in elections. The UAE government announced in November 2005 that half of the seats on the Federal National Council (FNC) would be selected by a limited electorate in each emirate, with the possibility of women being included in the selection process. Since the death of Shaykh Zayid in November 2004, two women have been appointed to cabinet positions, indicating a move towards political openness in the Gulf states. The Gulf states have made moves towards political openness, with some progress in labor rights for foreign workers. However, human rights organizations and U.S. reports criticize the Gulf states for religious discrimination, arbitrary arrests, and suppression of free expression. The State Department has condemned the UAE for arresting same-sex couples. The State Department condemned the UAE's arrest of same-sex couples and their announcement of hormone treatment. Saudi Arabia faces U.S. criticism for prohibiting non-Muslim religions, while Qatar and Kuwait allow private worship. Gulf states fall short of U.S. expectations on religious freedom. The Gulf states, including Qatar and UAE, are making efforts to end trafficking of young boys as camel jockeys. Saudi Arabia remains in the worst category for not addressing human trafficking, while other Gulf states are on the \"Tier 2 Watch List\" and risk being downgraded to Tier 3 if they do not improve their efforts. Oman's performance has been downgraded, while Kuwait, Qatar, and UAE have taken steps against trafficking since 2005. The Bush Administration has expanded programs to promote political and economic reform in the Gulf states through diplomatic exchanges and new initiatives by USAID and the State Department. These programs focus on rule of law, economic transparency, judicial reform, civil society strengthening, education improvement, media openness, and women's empowerment. The U.S. has funded programs in the Gulf region to promote education, media openness, and women's empowerment. These programs are generally supported by Gulf governments and aim to bring officials, students, journalists, and civil society participants to the U.S. for training. MEPI funds have also been used to help Gulf countries comply with trade agreements. The Gulf region holds a significant amount of oil and natural gas reserves. The Gulf region, including Iran and Iraq, holds significant reserves of oil and natural gas, making it a major source of energy for the world. Saudi Arabia and Iraq have the largest proven reserves of oil, while Iran and Qatar have the second and third largest reserves of natural gas. This concentration of resources ensures that the Gulf will remain an important energy source well into the 21st century. The Gulf states heavily rely on oil export revenues, which constitute a high percentage of their GDP. The United States is concerned about the stability of the Gulf's energy infrastructure, as Gulf oil exports make up about 20% of its net imports. Despite a past oil price decline prompting economic reevaluation, Gulf regimes are reluctant to reform their generous social benefit systems due to the expectation of continued benefits. The Gulf leaders are determined to continue economic reform despite high oil prices, focusing on reducing underemployment by training nationals for high-wage industries. They aim to decrease the reliance on foreign workers and diversify their economies by attracting international capital and technology. Some Gulf states have successful tourism industries, with laws allowing foreign investment. The Gulf states, including UAE, Qatar, and Oman, have implemented economic reforms to attract foreign investment and allow foreign ownership of projects and real estate. U.S. officials have praised their progress in eliminating restrictions on U.S. firms and protecting intellectual property rights. Several Gulf states now host globally impactful companies, such as Kingdom Holding Co. in Saudi Arabia and Dubai Ports World. Bahrain has regained its status as a financial hub. Critics argue that Dubai has moved away from its Arab roots. The UAE emirate of Dubai has been criticized for moving away from its Arab roots by focusing on Western expatriates with projects like huge towers, hotels, and malls. This shift has led to social issues like crime, drugs, and human trafficking. Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have not developed substantial tourist industries to avoid these consequences, while Qatar has partnered with foreign investors to develop the world's largest non-associated gas field. The gas field in the UAE serves customers in Asia and sells LNG to the United States. The \"Dolphin Project\" aims to connect gas supplies in Qatar and Oman to the UAE, with potential links to South Asia. Bahrain and Oman are facing declining oil sectors, with Bahrain expected to exhaust its oil supplies in 15 years and Oman in 20 years. Kuwait and Saudi Arabia are in talks with Western oil companies to develop their reserves, but face internal opposition to foreign investment. The Kuwaiti government's \"Project Kuwait\" to develop oil fields has been delayed due to National Assembly approval. Similarly, King Abdullah's initiative to open Saudi Arabia's gas reserves to Western development faced delays over commercial issues. Gas development deals collapsed in 2003, but agreements were signed in 2005 with international energy companies. The Gulf states, including Shell, Totalfina Elf, Lukoil, Sinopec, ENI, and Repsol, are working towards economic integration. They agreed to implement a customs union with uniform tariff rates by 2007. Saudi Arabia joined the WTO in 2005 to address U.S. concerns. The Bush Administration is negotiating bilateral free trade agreements with Gulf states instead of pursuing an overall U.S.-GCC FTA. An FTA was signed with Bahrain. Negotiations for free trade agreements (FTAs) with Gulf states have been ongoing for about a decade. FTAs were signed with Bahrain and Oman in 2004 and 2006, respectively. The US is also making progress on an FTA with the UAE, while Kuwait and Qatar have shown interest in similar agreements. Gulf states are being looked to for support on US policy initiatives. The United States has sought support from Gulf states on various regional and international issues, including the Arab-Israeli dispute, counter-terrorism, and crises like the Israel-Hezbollah conflict. Gulf states have shown solidarity with the US, offering financial assistance during events like Hurricane Katrina. Since Iran's 1979 revolution, Gulf states have shifted focus away from the Arab-Israeli dispute towards other priorities. The Gulf states have supported U.S. mediation efforts in the Arab-Israeli dispute and have tried to shape U.S. policy on this issue. They participated in multilateral peace talks after the 1993 Israeli-PLO agreement and relaxed their enforcement of the Arab boycott of Israel in 1994. The Gulf states have supported U.S. mediation efforts in the Arab-Israeli dispute and have tried to shape U.S. policy on this issue. Oman and Qatar opened low-level direct trade ties with Israel in 1995 and 1996. Qatar hosted the Middle East/North Africa economic conference in November 1997, despite Arab opposition. Saudi Arabia, under King Abdullah, has taken a more active role in guiding Arab League approval of a peace vision between Israel and Arab states. The Gulf states endorsed the Bush Administration's \"road map\" for Israeli-Palestinian peace in September 2005. In 2005, Gulf states like Qatar and Oman showed support for Israel by hosting meetings and donating money. They also endorsed the Bush Administration's peace plan for Israeli-Palestinian relations. After the latest Palestinian uprising in 2000, Gulf states like Oman and Qatar closed Israel's trade offices in their countries. The Arab League, with Gulf financial support, established funds to aid the Palestinian Authority, with Saudi Arabia pledging $270 million. Other Gulf states have been slow in fulfilling their commitments to the funds. The United States and Gulf states differ in their approach towards Palestinian militant groups, particularly Hamas. While the US views Hamas as a terrorist organization, the Gulf states see it as a legitimate defender of Palestinian interests. Saudi Arabia and Qatar pledged funds to help the Hamas-led Palestinian Authority cope with reduced Western aid. In July 2006, Saudi Arabia pledged $250 million for reconstruction aid in the Palestinian territories. The United States supported Israel in combating Hezbollah during the Israel-Hezbollah conflict of July-August 2006. Gulf states criticized Hezbollah's actions but also denounced Israel's raids on civilian targets, calling for an immediate ceasefire. Qatar and the UAE played a role in negotiating U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701, which called for a ceasefire and the withdrawal of Hezbollah militia from the border with Israel. The UAE provided humanitarian aid to Lebanon during this time. In August 2006, GCC states agreed on reconstruction efforts in Lebanon after the conflict, with Saudi Arabia pledging $500 million, UAE assisting in rebuilding schools and hospitals, Qatar focusing on Bint Jubail, and Kuwait donating $800 million. Tensions arose post-9/11 between the US and Gulf states, particularly Saudi Arabia, over alleged support for Al Qaeda-linked groups. Many experts believe Gulf states tolerated militants to avoid backlash from citizens with anti-U.S., anti-Western views. Saudi Arabia faced criticism for links to September 11 hijackers, while Qatar hosted Khalid Shaykh Mohammad and Islamic cleric Yusuf al-Qaradawi. In September 2004, Shaykh Yusuf al-Qaradawi stated that Muslims have a religious duty to fight U.S. forces and civilians in Iraq. Despite his controversial statements, Qaradawi has met with Qatari senior officials. Some Saudi clerics and officials have also been criticized for blaming the U.S. for Islamic terrorism. Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Pakistan recognized the Taliban regime in Afghanistan from 1996-2001, but cut ties after September 11, 2001. The UAE had ties with the Taliban from 1996-2001, refusing to break them despite U.S. requests. The September 11 Commission report highlighted the UAE's financial networks' role in the attacks. Gulf states, including the UAE, have been U.S. partners against Al Qaeda since 2001. Since the Iraq war in March 2003, Gulf states have partnered with the United States against Al Qaeda and pro-Al Qaeda movements. The U.S. has increased anti-terrorism assistance to help Gulf states counter terrorist threats. By mid-2006, the domestic Al Qaeda-related terrorist threat in Gulf states has decreased as they have taken action against militants. Attacks in Saudi Arabia targeted Westerners, regime installations, and those linked to the U.S. military or the Iraq war. Notable attacks include the May 12, 2003 attack on a Western housing complex in Riyadh and the December 2004 attack on the U.S. consulate in Jeddah. Saudi authorities have captured or killed several Al Qaeda leaders. Saudi authorities have captured or killed several Al Qaeda leaders in Saudi Arabia, including Abdul Aziz al-Muqrin and Saleh al-Oufi. Kuwait and Qatar have also faced sporadic attacks, with Kuwait convicting six men of belonging to a terror group planning attacks on U.S. troops. Qatar experienced a bombing in 2005 but has since remained peaceful. The Bush Administration praises Gulf state cooperation in combating terrorism, noting measures taken to combat terrorism financing and track suspicious financial transactions. U.S. officials urge Gulf states to enforce these measures rigorously, with some criticism directed at Saudi Arabia for failing to prosecute. Some Gulf states, including the UAE, Bahrain, Qatar, and Oman, have been praised for their cooperation in terrorist investigations and arrests of suspected Al Qaeda figures. However, Bahrain has released many suspects due to a lack of legal justification. The 2005 State Department terrorism report commends Qatar and Oman for supporting U.S. counter-terrorism efforts. The 2004 and 2005 State Department reports did not repeat language from the 2003 report about terrorist groups in Qatar. Gulf states like the UAE and Oman are assisting with port and container security. Concerns have been raised in Congress about GCC firms investing in U.S. ports through FTAs, following the Dubai Ports World controversy in 2006. The Dubai-owned firm, Dubai Ports World, faced controversy in 2006 when attempting to take over operations at six U.S. ports. U.S. officials can block such investments on security grounds under FTA agreements with Gulf countries."
