    "content": "The \"Consumer Assurance of Radiologic Excellence Act of 2006\" aims to enhance healthcare quality by improving the safety and accuracy of medical imaging and radiation therapy, reducing duplication of services, and lowering costs. This Act amends the Public Health Service Act to address the quality of medical imaging and radiation therapy. The Secretary, with expert input, will establish standards for the safety and accuracy of medical imaging and radiation therapy services, focusing on personnel rather than equipment. Expert advisers will represent various healthcare sectors to ensure balanced input. The Secretary will establish standards for medical imaging and radiation therapy services, focusing on personnel qualifications. Exemptions include physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. Compliance with standards is required before performing these services. The standards for therapy services must be met through certification, licensure, examination, coursework, experience, or other approved methods. These standards may vary by discipline and reflect expert consensus on excellence in practice. The Secretary will provide a method for recognizing individuals with extensive practical experience equivalent to a graduate of an accredited program. Approved bodies will be certified by the Secretary by a specified date. The Secretary will certify approved bodies for accrediting mechanisms to demonstrate compliance with standards. Minimum standards will be set for recordkeeping, curricula, fees, and conflict of interest prevention. The Secretary will certify approved bodies for accrediting mechanisms by requiring nonprofit organizations to comply with set standards and provide necessary information. The Secretary may withdraw approval if the body fails to meet the standards. The withdrawal of certification of an approved body will not affect the certification status of individuals or persons certified by that body. State standards for licensure, accreditation, and examinations will be considered compliant unless deemed otherwise by the Secretary, who will establish a process for states to respond or appeal such determinations. The Secretary may evaluate approved bodies periodically and include the results in a report to specific committees. States can require higher education and training standards, but individuals providing mammogram services must meet the standards of the Mammography Quality Standards Act of 1992. The Secretary will promulgate regulations to ensure medical imaging and radiation therapy programs comply with established standards. Alternative standards may apply in rural or underserved areas designated by the Medicare Geographic Classification Review Board. The Secretary may develop alternative standards for rural or health professional shortage areas to ensure access to quality medical imaging. States have the discretion to reject these alternative standards with proper notice. General implementation regulations must be in place within 18 months of the section's enactment. The Secretary will promulgate regulations within 18 months to implement standards in this section, excluding those in subsection (d)(2). Minimum standards for certification of approved bodies must be established within 24 months, and regulations for delivery of services within 36 months. Federal assistance may be withheld for non-compliance. The provision of Federal assistance under subsection (h) will begin 48 months after enactment. Definitions include 'approved body' as an entity certified by the Secretary and 'medical imaging' as procedures for diagnosing illness in humans. Medical imaging involves the use of various technologies like ionizing radiation, radiopharmaceuticals, MRI, or ultrasound to produce images for disease diagnosis. The term 'perform' refers to directly exposing a patient to radiation or positioning them for imaging, while 'plan' relates to the preparation for medical imaging or radiation therapy. The term 'plan' in medical imaging or radiation therapy involves preparing for a procedure by customizing it for the patient based on specific information. 'Radiation therapy' refers to procedures using radiation for disease treatment. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will submit a report on the effects of the Act, including provider standards, diagnostic accuracy, patient safety, and service availability. Entities reimbursed for technical services must contribute data to the report.
