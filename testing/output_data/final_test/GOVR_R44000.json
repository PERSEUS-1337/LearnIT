    "content": "This report provides background information and analysis on various aspects of U.S.-Turkey relations, including Turkey's strategic orientation, U.S./NATO cooperation, the situation in northern Syria, criminal cases post-2016 coup attempt, and congressional proposals. It also covers domestic Turkish developments under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's rule and significant economic concerns. Numerous points of bilateral tension have raised questions about the alliance between the United States and Turkey. Turkey's actions and statements on foreign policy issues have strained its relationship with the United States and other NATO allies, raising concerns about its commitment to the alliance. President Erdogan may be using the Jamal Khashoggi incident to gain leverage in dealings with the U.S. and enhance Turkey's global standing. Various factors drive the complex dynamics of Turkey's international relationships. Turkey's history as a regional power and target of great power aggression fuels nationalistic sentiment in Turkey. This sentiment raises concerns about the country's reliance on other key nations for security, trade, and energy. Turkey's cooperative relationships with countries with conflicting interests require a delicate balancing act, especially with threats from Syria and Iraq. Involvement in these countries by the United States, Russia, and Iran further complicates Turkey's situation. President Erdogan and his supporters express grievances against domestic foes, adding to the complexity of Turkey's international relationships. Turkey's efforts to increase influence in the Middle East and offer a model for regional states have been hindered by conflict, instability, and domestic polarization since 2011. Turkey's relationships with traditional Sunni Arab powers like Saudi Arabia and Egypt are influenced by these challenges. Turkey shares interests with Sunni Arab powers in countering Iran, but they view Turkey suspiciously due to its Islamist sympathies and ties with Qatar. Turkey's relations with Israel have become distant under Erdogan's rule. Its strategic location makes it valuable for the US and NATO for stationing arms and personnel. NATO has helped Turkey mitigate concerns about neighboring threats since post-World War II. Key US/NATO sites in Turkey include Incirlik air base and a missile defense radar. Turkey's strategic importance for the US and NATO is highlighted by key sites like Incirlik air base and a missile defense radar. Recent tensions have raised concerns about continued use of Turkish bases by the US/NATO, with historical precedents of military asset withdrawals or restrictions by Turkey. The United States and Turkey have a history of tensions affecting military operations, including incidents in Cyprus, Iraq, and a coup attempt in 2016. This has led to concerns about the trust between the two countries and the safety of using Turkish territory for U.S. and NATO assets. Some suggest exploring alternative basing arrangements in the region due to these tensions. The potential replacement of Incirlik Air Base in Turkey for U.S. military operations depends on various factors such as functionality, location of alternatives, future military engagements, and political/economic challenges. Reports indicate that the U.S. may not leave Incirlik but could expand military presence in Greece and Jordan due to concerns about Turkey. Evaluating the costs and benefits of a U.S./NATO presence in Turkey revolves around questions regarding strengthening Turkey, reliance on Turkish territory/airspace, and potential changes in posture. Turkey's plans to acquire an S-400 air defense system from Russia in 2019 may impact its purchase of U.S.-origin F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft. Turkey justified its decision by claiming NATO allies rejected its attempts to buy an air defense system from them. Turkey's decision to purchase an S-400 air defense system from Russia in 2019 has raised concerns about technology transfer, defense coverage, and geopolitical implications. There are worries that this move could increase Turkish dependence on Russia and potentially weaken NATO alliance. Turkey had previously considered buying a Chinese air defense system but withdrew due to NATO concerns and China's reluctance to share technology. The U.S. is concerned about Turkey operating the S-400 alongside the F-35, fearing it could compromise sensitive technology. Turkey has taken steps to address these concerns by proposing an arrangement that allows Turkish technicians to operate the S-400 without Russian involvement. Congress has enacted legislation to subject the F-35 transfer to greater scrutiny. The FY2019 John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act requires DOD to report on issues affecting U.S.-Turkey defense cooperation, including the S-400 and F-35. The report warned Turkey of negative consequences for purchasing the S-400, including potential sanctions under CAATSA, risks to the F-35 program, and NATO interoperability. In July 2018, U.S. officials tried to persuade Turkey to buy a Patriot air defense system instead of an S-400 due to concerns about NATO interoperability and increased dependence on Russia for military equipment. However, talks with U.S. and European suppliers did not result in a deal, leading Turkey to announce plans to deploy the S-400 in October 2019. The U.S. continued to offer the Patriot system to Turkey as an alternative. The Administration has developed an alternative package to provide Turkey with a strong, capable, NATO-interoperable air and missile defense system that meets all of Turkey's defense requirements. Congressional support for Foreign Military Sales and Direct Commercial Sales to Turkey is essential to provide a real alternative that would encourage Turkey to walk away from a damaging S-400 acquisition. Discussions between U.S. and Turkish officials over a Patriot sale are ongoing. Turkish officials have stated their interest in the Patriot system. Turkey's negotiations with the U.S. over a Patriot sale are ongoing, but Turkish officials plan to proceed with the S-400 purchase regardless. Turkey has sought air defense systems since 2007 but has not finalized a transaction. Turkey's involvement in Syria's conflict has evolved, with a mix of coordination and competition with Russia and Iran. Turkey's military involvement in Syria since August 2016 aims to protect borders, project influence, counter regional ambitions, and thwart the Syrian Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) from establishing an autonomous area along the border with Turkey. The YPG, linked to the PKK, is seen as a top security threat by Turkey due to its potential support for the PKK's insurgency. The YPG is part of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which includes non-Kurdish elements. The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), including Arabs and non-Kurdish elements, have been the main U.S. ground force partner against ISIS since 2014. U.S. support for the SDF, particularly the YPG, has strained relations with Turkey. The U.S. armed the YPG during operations in Raqqah but later stopped direct arming. This cooperation with the YPG contrasts with the long-standing alliance with Turkey. Turkey launched an offensive against the YPG in Afrin province in January 2018, occupying areas with the help of Syrian opposition militias. Questions remain about Turkey's influence on future governance in these areas. President Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria in December 2018 has significant implications for Turkey and the YPG. Turkey accepted Erdogan's offer to counter the Islamic State in Syria, leading to U.S. troops redeploying by summer 2019. Turkey refused to guarantee the YPG's safety, with Erdogan wanting control over the YPG. President Trump threatened to devastate Turkey economically if it harmed the Kurds and proposed a 20-mile \"safe zone\" in Syria. The U.S. aims to ensure security for those who helped defeat the IS caliphate and prevent further conflict. Turkey's military intervention in Syria aims to secure the region and prevent terrorist attacks. There is uncertainty about the US withdrawal and how Turkish forces will operate. Analysts suggest focusing on areas like Tal Abyad to reduce YPG control. Concerns exist about Turkish-supported militias' effectiveness against ISIS compared to the YPG-led SDF. One journalist expresses concerns about the fate of IS foreign fighters held by the SDF if Turkey clashes with the YPG. Turkish officials seek U.S. support for potential operations despite differing views on the YPG. President Erdogan envisions Turkish-backed forces governing Kurdish areas in Syria with local councils advised by Turkey. Analysis suggests a U.S. troop withdrawal could push the YPG towards Russia and the Syrian government. Putin's mention of the 1998 Adana Protocol hints at limiting Turkish involvement in Syria. Syria's government may take more responsibility for controlling YPG actions, impacting Turkey's presence in key contested areas like Manbij and Idlib. Russia and Syrian forces near Manbij could be a check on Turkish efforts to remove YPG influence. In Idlib, Turkey-backed forces have not stopped gains by HTS jihadists, potentially leading to a Russian-backed Syrian military operation and increased refugee flows to Turkey. Controversies between the U.S. and Turkey over criminal cases have arisen since the 2016 coup attempt in Turkey. Since the 2016 coup attempt in Turkey, tensions between the United States and Turkey have escalated. Turkey has called for the extradition of Fethullah Gulen, leading to increased criticism of U.S. actions in Turkish media. The Turkish government has implemented widespread crackdowns, detaining thousands and targeting individuals not connected to Gulen. Pastor Andrew Brunson and other U.S. citizens were also detained, causing further strain in relations. The U.S. is working to secure the release of detained American citizens in Turkey, including dual citizens and U.S. government employees. Sanctions on Turkish officials were lifted after Pastor Brunson's release. Two Turkish citizens were arrested in the U.S. for evading Iran sanctions, with one receiving immunity and the other sentenced to prison. Turkish leaders expressed concerns about potential economic implications if U.S. officials penalize Turkish banks. Bilateral tensions led to legislative proposals by Congress. In the 116th Congress, legislative proposals against Turkey include an arms embargo and restrictions on arms transfers to the Turkish Presidential Protection Directorate. The House-passed Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 requires the Department of Defense to update a report on Turkey's possible S-400 acquisition by November 1, 2019, before funding can be used to transfer F-35 aircraft to Turkey. Turkey. Restricting arms transfer to Turkish Presidential Protection Directorate (TPPD) unless members involved in violent incident against protestors in May 2017 are brought to justice. H.R. 648 is less strict than previous legislation against Turkey. President Erdogan has been in power since 2003, aiming to increase his authority through a \"presidential system\" of governance. Erdogan has been in power since 2003, aiming to increase his authority through a \"presidential system\" of governance. He has consolidated power amid concerns about growing authoritarianism in Turkey, surviving a coup attempt and winning key elections to expand his powers. Allegations of voter fraud and manipulation have surfaced, while US and EU officials have expressed concerns about rule of law and civil liberties in Turkey under Erdogan's leadership. Turkey under Erdogan has distinct factors that set it apart from countries like Russia, Iran, and China. Unlike them, Turkey's economy is not reliant on natural resources, does not possess nuclear weapons, and has strong ties with Western institutions. Erdogan's rule is polarizing, with support split in the country. In the 2018 elections, his party formed a coalition with the Nationalist Action Party to secure a parliamentary majority. The Turkish economy is facing challenges with slowing growth, high inflation, and a depreciating lira. Local elections in March 2019 will gauge domestic support for Erdogan's coalition with the Nationalist Action Party, known for its opposition to Kurdish accommodation. In August 2018, amid U.S.-Turkey tensions, President Trump doubled tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminum imports, leading to retaliatory actions. The lira's value plunged but partially recovered after Turkey's central bank raised interest rates. Turkey was granted a six-month exception from U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil. Speculation arose about Turkey seeking IMF financial assistance, posing a sensitive challenge for President Erdogan due to his past efforts to make Turkey independent from IMF interventions. Before the central bank's rate hike in September 2018, concerns were raised about Erdogan's interference in monetary policy. In January 2019, Erdogan was granted broader emergency powers by parliament. The government is attempting to boost consumer demand to stimulate growth, but a former official warns that the debt crisis may worsen. Austerity measures may be necessary after the local elections in March 2018."
