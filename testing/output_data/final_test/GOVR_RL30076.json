    "content": "Colonel David Humphrey believed that medals were a valuable way to honor illustrious individuals and events, as they preserved knowledge and memory. The Continental Congress saw medals as a rare and prestigious distinction, enhancing their value. Humphrey's words captured the sentiment behind choosing medals as the highest form of national appreciation. The Continental Congress commissioned gold medals as tributes for distinguished achievements, with silver and bronze medals for less notable accomplishments. Only the gold medal has been continuously awarded. George Washington received the first Congressional Gold Medal in 1776 for his leadership in the British evacuation of Boston. Additional gold medals were awarded to Revolutionary military and naval leaders. Horatio Gates, Major General Anthony Wayne, Major Henry Lee, Brigadier General [author name scrubbed], Major General Nathaniel Greene, and John Paul Jones were all honored for their courageous efforts during the Revolutionary War. The Continental Congress approved gold medals for their valor, but faced delays in having the medals struck due to seeking advice and assistance from Paris. After facing delays in having the gold medals struck, Thomas Jefferson presented George Washington with his gold medal in March 1790, 14 years after approval. Washington also received a box of gold medals ordered by Congress, which he then distributed to recipients. The first gold medal struck in the United States was awarded to Major Henry \"Light Horse Harry\" Lee for his bravery during a raid in New Jersey. Captain Thomas Truxtun received the first gold medal authorized by Congress in 1800 for his gallant effort. In 1800, Captain Thomas Truxtun received the first gold medal authorized by Congress for his gallant effort during a naval battle. Commodore Edward Preble was awarded a gold medal in 1805 for his bravery during the War with Tripoli. Congress commissioned 27 gold medals for notable victories in the War of 1812, surpassing the number awarded during the American Revolution. The final naval gold medal awarded by Congress until World War II was given to Captain James Biddle in 1816 for capturing a British ship. Gold medals continued to be awarded for military achievements until the Civil War, but with less frequency due to minimal naval operations during the War with Mexico. During the War with Mexico, naval operations were minimal, with military actions led by Major Generals Zachary Taylor and Winfield Scott. Taylor earned gold medals for his heroics, while Scott received one in 1848. Additional gold medals were awarded to officers and seamen from French, British, and Spanish ships for rescuing crew members from a wreck. In 1854, Commander Duncan N. Ingraham was praised for rescuing Martin Koszta from illegal imprisonment aboard an Austrian war-brig. This marked a departure from Congress's tradition of honoring heroism. In 1858, Dr. Frederick A. Rose, an assistant-surgeon in the British Navy, was recognized by Congress for his kindness to sick American seamen aboard the U.S. steamer Susquehannah during a yellow fever outbreak. President Abraham Lincoln applauded Cornelius Vanderbilt in 1864 for donating a steamship to the nation. Cyrus W. Field was praised for laying the transatlantic cable, and Private George F. Robinson was honored for saving Secretary of State William H. Seward from an assassin in 1865. Congress also established the Medal of Honor as the first permanent American military decoration. The Medal of Honor was established as the first permanent American military decoration in the early 1860s. It is a military award presented in the name of Congress, but the regulations for awarding it have always been the responsibility of the armed services. The distinction between the Medal of Honor and Congressional Gold Medals is that the former is a military award, while the latter is authorized by Congress to honor specific individuals and events. During the Civil War, over 1,500 Americans received the Medal of Honor, with Ulysses S. Grant being the only one to receive a Congressional Gold Medal. Congress waited 35 years before bestowing the award on another military leader. In the 1860s, the Medal of Honor was established as the first permanent American military decoration. Congress expressed gratitude for lifesaving contributions on multiple occasions, awarding gold medals to individuals such as three merchant sea captains in 1866 and Joseph Francis in 1888. In 1873, Congress admired the heroics of 10 men from Westerly, RI, and in 1890, George Wallace Melville was recognized for his service aboard an Arctic exploring steamer. In 1890, George Wallace Melville and his shipmates were praised for their efforts to assist their commanding officer after a shipwreck. Philanthropists George Peabody and John F. Slater were recognized for their financial support for education in the South and Southwest. Congress has broadened the scope of honors to include excellence in various fields such as arts, athletics, aviation, diplomacy, entertainment, exploration, medicine, politics, religion, and science. Nineteen Americans from the arts and entertainment have received Congressional Gold Medals, starting with composer George M. Cohan in 1936. Composer George M. Cohan was the first to receive a Congressional Gold Medal in 1936 for his patriotic songs.

The process of designing and minting a Congressional Gold Medal involves meetings with sponsors, family members of the honoree, and Mint engravers to discuss possible designs. The final design is decided by the Secretary of the Treasury, with input from the honoree's family. The cost, around $30,000, is covered by the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund. The medal is struck at the Philadelphia Mint and presented by the President. The United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund covers the cost of designing and minting Congressional Gold Medals. The fund is available to the Secretary for numismatic operations without fiscal year limitations. Monies from sales of bronze duplicates are deposited into the fund. House rules do not specify procedures for gold medal bills. The House rules direct the Secretary of the Treasury to strike a Congressional Gold Medal for individuals who have made significant achievements in American history and culture. Recipients must not have received a medal previously for the same achievement, be living or deceased for a specific period, and have received high honors in their field. The rules indirectly limit the number of medals awarded. The House Republican Conference rules indirectly restrict the number of gold medals awarded annually by limiting the total number of measures authorizing the striking of such medals. A waiver can be granted by the majority of the elected leadership. The restriction applies only to bills considered under suspension of the rules, allowing otherwise-prohibited bills to be brought to the floor under alternative procedures. In the Senate, the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee requires 67 Senators to cosponsor any Congressional Gold Medal bill before consideration. Congress approves legislation for creating gold medals on an ad hoc basis without permanent statutory provisions. There are no restrictions on the number of gold medals awarded by Congress or struck by the U.S. Mint. Each award made by Congress is considered statutory law, allowing for additional medals to be authorized annually. Gold Medals could prevent new legislation for additional medals. In the 109th Congress, a bill was approved to limit the number of medals struck to 2 per year. The Secretary may only award congressional gold medals to individuals, not groups, within a specific time frame after their death. The purpose is to limit the number of medals awarded each year to maintain the medal's prestige and honor recipients like presidents, civil rights leaders, military heroes, inventors, or healers. The Congressional Gold Medal is a unique honor bestowed by the United States Congress, with efforts to maintain its prestige by limiting the number of medals awarded each year to individuals. The proposed legislation aims to preserve the integrity of the gold medal by requiring a minimum co-sponsorship level and ensuring recipients are worthy of the honor. Representative Joseph Crowley opposed the legislation, questioning the rush to act on an issue that he believes does not represent a problem. Representative Crowley expressed dismay over the Committee on Rules' refusal to consider an amendment to strike a section of the bill allowing Congressional Gold Medals to be granted to individuals. He acknowledged the importance of preserving the symbolic worth of the gold medal but argued that there are occasions when multiple individuals deserve the honor. Crowley highlighted examples of historical figures who would not have been eligible for the medal if this bill had been law. The House adopted an amendment to make the legislation effective immediately upon passage. The House adopted an amendment to make the legislation effective immediately upon passage, instead of the original effective date of January 1, 2006. Representative Crowley proposed amendments to increase the number of Gold Medals approved and ensure equitable distribution between parties.
