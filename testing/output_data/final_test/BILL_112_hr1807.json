    "content": "The \"Enhanced Supply and Price Reduction Act of 2011\" defines the term \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of Energy and amends the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to include 1,000,000,000 barrels of petroleum products in the petroleum product reserve. It also addresses the sale of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and the acquisition of refined petroleum products. The Secretary, as defined in the \"Enhanced Supply and Price Reduction Act of 2011,\" has the authority to sell petroleum from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and acquire refined petroleum products. The cash proceeds from sales are deposited into the SPR Petroleum Account to cover administrative costs. The Secretary has the authority to sell up to 30,000,000 barrels of petroleum from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve within 180 days to 3 years after the enactment of the Act. The sale must not reduce the Reserve below 90% of its total barrels. The Secretary shall acquire refined petroleum product in a cost-effective manner to minimize market disruption, beginning 180 days after the enactment of the Act and ending within 5 years. SEC. 5. REPORT TO CONGRESS. Within 18 months of the sale authorized in section 4, the Secretary must report to Congress on the amounts and types of petroleum sold, actions taken for storage, efforts to maintain supplies, and measures to ensure the quality of refined petroleum products in the Reserve. The Secretary must report to Congress on the sale of petroleum in the Reserve, storage actions, supply maintenance efforts, and effects on oil markets. SEC. 6. STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE DRAWDOWN AND EXCHANGE IN PUBLIC INTEREST. Section 161 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act is amended to allow the President to instruct the Secretary to drawdown and sell or exchange petroleum product from the Reserve if a circumstance of significance and scope exists that warrants action to address market manipulation or serve the public interest. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act allows the President to authorize the Secretary to drawdown and sell petroleum products from the Reserve under certain conditions. The Secretary must report to Congress after any drawdown and sale, and must ensure that the Reserve is not depleted below 600,000,000 barrels of petroleum product. The Secretary must ensure timely replenishment of the Reserve in accordance with set objectives and procedures."
