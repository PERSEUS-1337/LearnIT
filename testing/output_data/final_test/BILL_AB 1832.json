    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The State of California enacts Section 399.13 of the Public Utilities Code, amending the renewable energy procurement plan requirements for electrical corporations and retail sellers to comply with the renewables portfolio standard. The commission will direct each electrical corporation to annually prepare a procurement plan, which must be proposed, reviewed, and adopted as part of the general procurement plan process. Retail sellers are also required to submit renewable energy procurement plans addressing specific requirements. Every electrical corporation owning transmission facilities must annually submit a report to the commission identifying necessary upgrades to meet renewable energy procurement requirements. The report must include a schedule for applying for necessary permits within five years. Electrical corporations owning transmission facilities must ensure timely completion of project-specific interconnection studies. The commission requires retail sellers to submit an annual compliance report detailing progress in procuring renewable energy resources as a percentage of sales, including necessary approvals and compliance with portfolio content requirements. The commission requires retail sellers to submit an annual compliance report detailing progress in procuring renewable energy resources and recommendations to remove impediments. The commission shall adopt rules for construction and upgrades to transmission and distribution facilities for interconnecting renewable energy resources. The commission will adopt rules for selecting renewable energy resources based on cost and viability, considering indirect costs, cost impact on the electricity portfolio, and project viability. The commission will consider workforce recruitment, training, and retention efforts for renewable energy resources, estimate electrical corporation expenses for integrating these resources, and take into account statewide greenhouse gas emissions limits. Rules allowing retail sellers to carry over excess procurement from one compliance period to the next starting in 2011. The rules apply equally to all sellers and consider the capacity and reliability of renewable energy resources for grid stability. Contracts of any duration can count as excess procurement for subsequent compliance periods if they meet portfolio content requirements. Retail sellers can carry over excess procurement from one compliance period to the next starting in 2011. Contracts meeting portfolio content requirements are not counted as excess procurement. Retail sellers complying with provisions for the period beginning January 1, 2017, will be subject to these rules. Standard terms and conditions for contracting renewable energy resources include performance requirements for generators and must disclose key agreement details within six months of approval. The renewable energy procurement plan includes assessing annual or multiyear portfolio supplies, determining the optimal mix of eligible renewable energy resources, and addressing potential compliance delays. An appropriate minimum margin of procurement above the minimum level required by the renewables portfolio standard is also recommended to mitigate project delays or cancellations. The procurement plan includes soliciting eligible renewable energy resources with specific deliverability characteristics, development schedule updates, price adjustment mechanisms, risk assessments for project delays, and a requirement for contracts of at least 10 years duration. Each electrical corporation must prioritize renewable energy projects benefiting communities in need and reducing air pollutants. Retail sellers should consider resource types that maintain grid reliability. Beginning January 1, 2021, a retail seller must procure at least 65 percent of renewable energy from contracts lasting 10 years or more. The commission will review and approve each electrical corporation's renewable energy procurement plan to ensure compliance with the renewables portfolio standard. The commission requires electrical corporations to submit renewable energy contracts for review and approval. If bid prices are deemed inflated due to lack of competition, renegotiation or a new solicitation is mandated. Failure to comply with the commission's renewable energy procurement plan results in enforcement action. The commission may authorize a procurement entity to enter into contracts for electricity products from eligible renewable energy resources to meet renewables portfolio standard requirements. The entity can recover costs through retail rates of end-use customers benefiting from the renewable energy procurement. The commission authorizes procurement entities to enter contracts for renewable energy resources to meet standards. Costs associated with approved contracts are recoverable in rates. Construction work on renewable energy resources receiving incentives is considered \"public works\" under labor laws."
