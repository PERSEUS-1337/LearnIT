    "content": "The \"Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2000\" (H.R. 3194, H.Rept. 106-479) was enacted into law on November 29, 1999 (P.L. 106-113), providing $14.928 billion in Interior appropriations for FY2000, an increase of $630.6 million from the previous year. The FY2000 Interior appropriations total is $14.959 billion after adjustments. This amount does not include the government-wide cut of 0.38% in discretionary appropriations for FY2000. The Interior appropriation portion was introduced as a separate bill (H.R. 3423) and enacted by cross-reference in the consolidated measure. The annual Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations bill provides funding for agencies and programs in four federal departments. The President's FY2000 budget request totals $15.27 billion, compared to $14.30 billion enacted for FY1999. Title I includes agencies within the Department of the Interior, while Title II includes the Forest Service of the Department of Agriculture and research programs of the Department of Energy. Title II of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations bill includes agencies such as the Smithsonian Institution, National Gallery of Art, and National Endowment for the Arts. The FY2000 budget request totaled $15.27 billion, an increase from the $14.30 billion enacted for FY1999. The FY2000 budget request totaled $15.27 billion, an increase from the $14.30 billion enacted for FY1999. Significant increases included various agencies such as the National Park Service, Indian Health Service, and Bureau of Indian Affairs. The Clinton Administration proposed a $1 billion Lands Legacy Initiative in the FY2000 budget. The FY2000 budget request included a $1 billion Lands Legacy Initiative, with Department of the Interior agencies receiving $579 million, mostly through the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The U.S. Forest Service received $198 million, with concerns raised about conflicting priorities regarding maintenance backlogs in national parks and public lands. The Senate and House Appropriations Committees reported on the FY2000 Interior Appropriations bill. The Senate and House Appropriations Committees reported on the FY2000 Interior Appropriations bill, with funding levels below the FY1999 enacted level. Significant increases in the Senate bill include Bureau of Indian Affairs, Forest Service, and Fossil Energy, while the House bill includes increases for U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The Senate bill includes increased funding for various departments within the Interior Department, such as U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Office of Surface Mining, Departmental Offices, Energy Conservation, and Indian Health Service. Concerns were raised by the Office of Management and Budget regarding aspects of the Interior Appropriations bill, including funding for the President's Lands Legacy Initiative, Everglades restoration, timber sales management, Millennium Initiative, National Endowment for the Arts, and National Endowment for the Humanities. The House passed H.R. 2466 on July 15, 1999, providing $13.93 billion in FY2000 funding with amendments impacting funding levels for various programs, including cuts to the Department of Energy's Weatherization program and increases in weatherization assistance. The Senate passed its version of the Interior Appropriations bill on September 23, 1999, providing $14.06 billion in FY2000 funding. President Clinton signed a continuing appropriations bill on September 30, 1999, for the fiscal year 2000. A House-Senate conference met on the Interior bill on October 13 and 14, 1999. The House-Senate conference met on the Interior bill on October 13 and 14, 1999. The conference report on H.R. 2466 was agreed to by both the House and Senate on October 21, 1999, providing $14.565 billion for FY2000, including $57.4 million in mandatory funding. The report included increases for various agencies and emergency funding for the United Mine Workers of America combined benefit fund. However, the legislation was not transmitted to the President due to expected veto over differences involving riders on oil royalty valuations, mining, grazing, and funding levels for the Lands Legacy Initiative. The Interior bill negotiations included controversial issues like oil royalty valuations, mining, grazing, and funding levels for the Lands Legacy Initiative. The final agreement was incorporated into the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2000 (H.R. 3194). The omnibus measure passed both the House and Senate in November 1999 and was signed into law by the President on November 29, 1999 (P.L. 106-113). The funding bill (H.R. 3423) included $14.959 billion for Interior appropriations, additional funding for the Lands Legacy Initiative, and government-wide cuts of 0.38% of the discretionary budget authority for FY2000. Programs may be reduced by up to 15%, with proportional cuts to the Department of Defense and Department of Energy Defense Activities. The Office of Management and Budget must specify these reductions in the President's FY2001 budget submission to Congress. The FY2000 discretionary budget authority was reduced by 0.38%, not reflected in the report. Department of the Interior appropriations increased by 16% from FY1991 to FY1995, then remained flat. The Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996 reduced FY1996 budget authority by 9%. Funding increased in subsequent years to $14.3 billion in FY1999. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) manages approximately 264 million acres of public land in the West, along with an additional 300 million acres of minerals on federal and private lands nationwide. The agency also handles wildfire management. For more information on the Department of the Interior's budget and performance, visit their websites. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) manages 388 million acres of federal and private lands for wildfire management and suppression. In FY2000, the Consolidated Appropriations Act allocated $1.236 billion to BLM, $33 million less than requested but $52 million more than the previous year. $646 million was designated for land and resource management activities, representing a $34 million increase from FY1999. The FY2000 appropriation for BLM was $1.236 billion, with $292 million for wildland fire management and $135 million for the Payment in Lieu of Taxes program. The increase was partly for \"Health of the Land\" programs and fuels management. The FY2000 appropriation for BLM included $135 million for the Payment in Lieu of Taxes program (PILT), which compensates local governments for federal land. PILT funds can be used for schools, firefighting, and road maintenance. Funding for Oregon and California grant lands was $99 million. The PILT program has been controversial since its establishment in 1976. The FY2000 appropriation for BLM included $99 million for Oregon and California grant lands, with $15.5 million allocated for land acquisition. The Administration had sought to increase the funding as part of its Lands Legacy Initiative. The FY2000 appropriation for BLM included $99 million for Oregon and California grant lands, with $15.5 million allocated for land acquisition, part of the Lands Legacy Initiative. $5 million was designated for BLM land acquisitions in the California Desert, including private inholdings owned by the Catellus mining company. An additional $10 million was provided for California Desert land acquisitions, split between the National Park Service and Title VI. Future funding decisions for California Desert land acquisitions would depend on progress in desert tortoise mitigation and expansion at the National Training Center for the Army at Fort Irwin. In Fort Irwin, California, the FY2000 appropriation law allocated funding for various BLM activities. Construction received $11 million, an increase from the President's FY2000 request. The central hazardous materials fund and range improvements each received $10 million. Service charges, deposits, and forfeitures were set at $9 million, while miscellaneous trust funds received $8 million. Mining was a controversial issue in the FY2000 Interior appropriations. The FY2000 Interior appropriations included a controversial issue regarding mining activities and the interpretation of the 1872 Mining Law. Critics argued that a legal opinion limiting mining claim acreage was a new interpretation and an indirect way of reforming the law. The Department of the Interior defended its legal opinion on mining claim acreage limits in the FY2000 Interior appropriations, providing a two-year exemption for certain mining operations. The House and Senate had opposing views on the exemption for FY2000 and FY2001. The House supported the Solicitor's opinion, while the Senate sought to overturn it. The Senate's language aimed to permanently reverse the opinion and prevent limitations on millsites based on mining claims. The Senate rejected an amendment to delete millsite language from the bill, preserving the Solicitor's opinion. A related amendment to protect mining operations was withdrawn. The Senate Appropriations Committee included language applying to all mining claims and millsites, going beyond the Interior Subcommittee's amendment. The debate on millsite acreage follows a stalemate over the 1872 Mining Law on federal lands. The Interior Department's decision on millsite acreage for the Crown Jewel Mine in Washington led to the Administration's denial of an operating plan in March 1999. Congress enacted a law to allow the mining operation to proceed without limitations on millsites and acreage. The Consolidated Appropriations Act retained the mining patent moratorium. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2000 essentially retained the mining patent moratorium, prohibiting new applications for mining or mill site claims on federal lands. However, applications filed before September 30, 1994, were grandfathered, and third-party contractors were authorized to process them. Additionally, the Act extended grazing permits and leases until the renewal process is completed under applicable laws and regulations. The FY2000 law addressed the heavy workload of processing grazing permits and leases up for renewal, preserving the Secretary's authority to cancel, suspend, or modify them. It directed the Interior Department to develop a schedule to alleviate the backlog and included $2.5 million for expedited renewal. Environmental groups opposed the permit extension language for potentially delaying required environmental analyses. The permit extension language allows BLM to delay environmental analyses, continuing permits with possibly detrimental conditions. The Senate and House had different provisions on extending grazing permits. The House bill specified permit modifications and reissuance for up to 10 years. The Senate considered an amendment to establish a schedule for processing expiring permits and leases. The amendment proposed a schedule for processing expiring grazing permits and leases by BLM, with a deadline of September 30, 2001. It aimed to ensure timely completion of renewals and had support from environmental groups. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2000 did not address wildlife population surveys on federal land by BLM and Forest Service. The language in both chambers granted the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior authority to decide on wildlife population surveys on federal land. This modification was opposed by environmentalists and the Administration due to concerns about slowing down timber sales and increasing project costs. The Senate Appropriations Committee initially granted discretion to agencies, citing cost and time concerns for requiring wildlife surveys in all cases. The Senate rejected an amendment to delete language on wildlife surveys in federal land, with advocates arguing for comprehensive wildlife surveys before ground-breaking activities. Supporters of the Senate-passed language cited recent court rulings allowing timber sales to proceed based on habitat inventorying and existing population data analysis. Recent court decisions on species monitoring and data collection were deemed impossible to meet, with estimated costs between $5 billion and $9 billion. The Consolidated Appropriations Act provided BLM with $15.5 million from the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), totaling $35 million with additional funds. The funding was more than what the House and Senate provided but less than the Administration's request. The Senate provided $17 million for the Bureau of Land Management, which was less than the Administration's request of $49 million. The Administration recommended $950 million for the Fish and Wildlife Service, an increase of $110.2 million over FY1999, but the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2000 provided $878.1 million. The proposed increase in Resource Management was not fully met, with the House and Senate agreeing to $716 million for FWS. The Administration requested an increase in Endangered Species funding from $124.8 million to $194.9 million, with a strict limit on funding for the listing function. The proposed cap for listing function was set at $7.5 million in the bill itself, limiting agency discretion for additional listings. The cap on funding for listing certain species mandates agency action, with limitations on de-listing and down-listing. This restriction makes listing decisions a zero-sum game financially, with a set budget of $6.2 million in the FY2000 law. The Administration proposed further restrictions, allowing only $1 million for critical habitat designation out of $7.5 million requested. FWS has historically de-prioritized critical habitat designation, citing inefficiency in resource allocation. The FY2000 law imposed limitations on funding for listing species, affecting decisions on de-listing and down-listing. The Administration proposed restrictions on critical habitat designation funding, with only $1 million allocated out of $7.5 million requested. Funding for Endangered Species Programs in FY1999-FY2000 saw increases in the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund, with $66 million proposed from the Land and Water Conservation Fund. This included $43 million for grants to states and $20 million for land acquisition related to Habitat Conservation Plans. The National Wildlife Refuge Fund received $10.779 million in FY1999 and FY2000, with ongoing controversy over payment levels to local governments. The FY2000 law allocated $10.779 million for the National Wildlife Refuge System. There are calls for Congress to increase the appropriation due to controversial payment levels, as local governments mistakenly view the payments as entitlements. PILT payments benefit counties with land in the system, but lands acquired instead of reserved are not eligible. The President's proposal includes a 53.3% increase in land acquisition funding for the system. The President's proposal includes a 53.3% increase in land acquisition funding for the National Wildlife Refuge System, with much of the increase going towards state grants for habitat acquisition. The Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund and the Multinational Species Conservation Fund would also see increases in funding. The FY2000 law allocated $2.4 million, with a $700,000 decrease for invasive species and permits under CITES. A special fund was created for commercial salmon fishery capacity reduction in Washington State. For more information on the Fish and Wildlife Service, visit http://www.fws.gov/. The National Park Service manages 378 units, including 54 National Parks. The Park System covers over 83 million acres in the U.S. and territories, with annual visits exceeding 285 million. The NPS aims to balance visitor access with resource preservation despite tight budgets in recent years. The National Park Service has faced restricted funding and increased management responsibilities, leading to a multibillion dollar backlog of deferred maintenance. Public support for expanding NPS funding has grown since the temporary closure of NPS units during a government shutdown in 1995-1996. The White House warned of potential cuts to the NPS due to stringent spending caps set by the House Appropriations panel in May 1999. The National Park Service faced funding restrictions and increased management responsibilities, resulting in a backlog of deferred maintenance. Public support for increased funding grew after the temporary closure of NPS units during a government shutdown. The House panel's bill included additional funding for the NPS, with the Administration's FY2000 request totaling $2.059 billion. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved $1.72 billion in funding for the NPS, $41 million less than FY1999. The Senate passed bill provided a total NPS appropriation of $1.750 billion, including $1.36 billion for operations. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $1.72 billion in funding for the National Park Service, including $1.36 billion for operations. This exceeds current funding by $70 million but falls short of the Administration's request of $1.39 billion. An additional $27 million in operational funding is allocated for park units with critical health and safety deficiencies. The House bill also includes $114 million for Everglades restoration, with $94.4 million from the NPS and $20 million from other Interior Department bureaus. The total NPS funding would be boosted to $1.755 billion, with park operations remaining at approximately $1.39 billion. The conferees agreed to increase NPS total spending to $1.810 billion, with $1.365 billion allocated for operations. An amendment in the Senate version could delay new sound thresholds for air tour overflights of Grand Canyon National Park. The conferees also dropped a provision from the House bill that could have blocked construction. The conferees dropped an amendment in the House bill that could have blocked construction of a new visitors center at Gettysburg National Military Park. LWCF Funding provides land acquisition funds to states for state recreation plans, with the House approving $30 million for the program. The Senate agreed to $20 million, but Senator Chafee indicated support for the House's higher figure. The conference committee provided $21 million for NPS land acquisitions, with $2.5 million earmarked for Wisconsin. The FY2000 appropriations law increased state-side grants to $41 million, nearly double the committee figure. The law also allocated $134.7 million for land acquisitions, below the Administration's request of $172 million. The Park System faces significant maintenance challenges due to its extensive infrastructure. The NPS has assets valued at over $35 billion, including bridges, tunnels, employee housing units, water and waste systems. Concerns about unmet maintenance needs have led Congress to seek new funding sources. In response, the FY2000 budget proposed increasing maintenance spending by $29 million to address the backlog. The Park Service would prioritize maintenance over a five-year period, with a budget increase from $412 million in FY1999 to $441 million in FY2000. The FY2000 appropriations law allocated $441 million for park maintenance, with an additional $5 million for backlog maintenance of the NPS. The Recreation Fee Demonstration Program allowed higher entrance and recreation user fees, generating over $136 million in FY1999. The program was extended for two more years, allowing public land agencies to retain 100% of fees collected. The Urban Park and Recreation Fund, managed by the Park Service, received $2 million in new funding in FY2000 after a 5-year gap. The program helped economically distressed urban areas rehabilitate playgrounds, recreation centers, and other facilities with a 70% federal and 30% local match. The Administration had requested $4 million for the program in FY2000. The Administration requested $4 million for the Urban Park and Recreation Fund (UPARR) in FY2000. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees did not include separate funding for UPARR in their bills. However, a $4 million amendment for UPARR was approved during House floor action on H.R. 2466, with the Senate voting $1.5 million. The final conference package included $2 million for UPARR as part of the National Recreation and Preservation funding. Additionally, the House Resources Committee approved a conservation bill (H.R. 3245) guaranteeing $125 million annually for UPARR. The National Parks Omnibus Management Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-391) guarantees $125 million annually to the Urban Park and Recreation Recovery program. The Act includes park criteria and management reforms, concessions policy changes, and increased funding for National Park roads under the surface transportation law (TEA-21, P.L. 105-178). For more information on the National Park Service, visit http://www.nps.gov/. The Historic Preservation Fund, administered by the National Park Service, provides grants to states, local governments, and other entities for activities outlined in the National Historic Preservation Act. Grants are typically funded on a 60% federal-40% state matching share basis, with additional funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Indian Tribes. The Administration's FY2000 budget requested $80.5 million for the Fund, including $50.5 million for grants-in-aid and $30 million for the \"Save America's Treasures\" initiative. The \"Save America's Treasures\" initiative, funded at $30 million in FY1999, grants funds to preserve nationally significant artifacts and historic structures. This includes monuments, historic sites, artwork, documents, and more. Specific allocations in FY1999 included $3 million for the restoration of the Star Spangled Banner, $500,000 for the Sewall-Belmont House, and funds for the restoration of the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution. The remaining $26.5 million from the $30 million FY1999 \"Save America's Treasures\" fund is allocated for federal agencies' historic preservation Millennium projects. Additionally, $15 million from the FY2000 Historic Preservation Fund budget is designated for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) for the preservation of historic buildings on their campuses. The FY1999 Historic Preservation Fund allocated $7 million for Historically Black Colleges and Universities Historic Building Restoration and Preservation program. The FY2000 budget included $8.422 million for restoration on HBCU campuses, while \"Save America's Treasures\" funding was eliminated due to fiscal constraints. The Senate bill provided $42.412 million for the Historic Preservation Fund, and the House bill allocated $46.712 million. The FY2000 Interior Appropriations bill allocated $46.712 million for the Historic Preservation Fund, including $11.722 million for restoration of historically black colleges and universities. The House and Senate bills both eliminated funding for \"Save America's Treasures\" millennium projects. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2000 provided $75,212,000 for the Historic Preservation Fund, with allocations for HBCU restoration, tribal grants, state historic preservation offices, and grants. The National Trust for Historic Preservation, chartered by Congress in 1949, is responsible for protecting historic American sites. Federal funding through the Historic Preservation Fund has supported its work in local communities. The Administration's FY2000 budget did not allocate funds to the National Trust, aiming for self-support through private funding. The National Trust for Historic Preservation received federal funding in FY1998 but was not mentioned in the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2000. The U.S. Geological Survey is the primary science agency for earth and biological science information, environmental aspects, and water resources data. The USGS budget for FY2000 included a new Integrated Science budget activity for science support for land management bureaus. The budget for the U.S. Geological Survey in FY2000 included funding for science support for land management bureaus like the Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and National Park Service. Facilities and administrative costs were consolidated into separate categories to provide a clearer view of the money allocated directly for science. The Administration requested $838.485 million for the USGS in the Surveys appropriation category. The Administration requested $838.485 million for the U.S. Geological Survey in FY2000, with funds allocated to four major program areas and Integrated Science. Despite apparent decreases in some areas, overall funding showed an increase, including $16.581 million for the National Mapping Program. The budget request for the Geologic Hazards, Resource, and Processes Program in FY2000 was $198.617 million, a decrease of $40.533 million from FY1999. Water Resources Investigations saw a decrease in funding for budget restructuring, while Biological Research had a net reduction in funding due to budget restructuring. The Integrated Science program received a budget request of $47.686 million, with $17.4 million in new funding allocated for science resources. The National Mapping Program was recommended $140.596 million by the Senate Appropriations Committee, an increase of $5.162 million. Geologic hazards and water resources investigations also saw increases in funding. The USGS budget was recommended at $813.243 million, $25.242 million less than requested. Water resources investigations and biological research received increased funding, while integrated science funding was eliminated. The Committee did not approve the budget restructuring for the Geological Survey but supported restructuring for program efficiency. The Senate and House passed appropriations totaling $813.1 million and $820.444 million, respectively, for the USGS. The USGS budget was recommended at $813.243 million, with funding increases for water resources, biological research, and geologic hazards. The budget request for a new \"Integrated Science\" activity was not approved. The House directed the Survey to provide a statement of its vision for the future. The House directed the US Geological Survey to outline its future role and key areas of focus. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2000 allocated $823.833 million for surveys, investigations, and research, including funds for water resources investigations, economic inquiries, mineral data base development, and biological research. The Minerals Management Service (MMS) administers programs for Royalty and Offshore Minerals Management and Oil Spill Research. The Royalty Management Program ensures timely collection and disbursement of revenues from mineral leases on federal and Indian lands. MMS anticipates collecting about $4.0 billion in revenues in FY2000. Revenues from onshore leases are distributed to states where they were collected. Revenues from onshore leases are distributed to states where they were collected, the U.S. Treasury, and designated programs. Offshore lease revenues are allocated to coastal states, Land and Water Conservation Fund, Historic Preservation Fund, and the U.S. Treasury. The Administration's FY2000 request of $240.2 million included $234.1 million for Royalty and Offshore Management and $6.1 million for oil spill research. The request was $16.2 million higher than FY1999, with offsets increasing by $24 million from Outer Continental Shelf revenues. The net amount requested was $116.2 million for FY2000, despite lower OCS revenues in FY98. In the previous 2 years, activity in the Gulf of Mexico region remains high. The Senate Appropriations Committee supported funding for Royalty and Offshore programs at $234.7 million and oil spill research at $6.1 million. The House-passed version provided Royalty and Offshore Minerals Management with $234.1 million and Oil Spill research with $6.1 million. The net amount of funding for MMS approved by the Senate was $116.8 million. The House supported a net amount of $116.2 million for MMS. The conferees agreed with the Senate funding level of $116.8 million. The conferees agreed with the Senate funding level of $116.8 million for the Minerals Management Service in FY2000. Reported discrepancies in royalty valuation continue to be an issue, with the Administration claiming the U.S. Treasury is being underpaid by at least $60 million annually. MMS has proposed a rule change for crude oil valuation to rely less on posted prices and more on an index price. Oil industry officials have criticized this approach and offered alternative benchmark options. The comment period on the oil valuation rule was extended twice in the 105th Congress to allow for industry and congressional input. Industry representatives believe the extension was necessary for further improvements, while critics argue that enough has been said. Details on the rule were provided to House and Senate Committees on August 31, 1998. The Senate Appropriations report for FY1999 postponed the rule's release until October 1, 1999. The MMS was suggested to use the royalty in kind approach, but a compromise in the FY1999 Omnibus Budget Bill postponed the new rule by eight months. The new oil valuation rule was postponed multiple times in the 105th Congress, with delays costing taxpayers millions in underpaid royalties. The rule's release was further extended in FY1999 and FY2000 through various amendments and filibusters in the Senate. The Senate voted to extend the moratorium on the oil valuation rule for up to six months pending a review by the General Accounting Office. Despite the President's threat to veto the Interior bill, negotiators agreed to implement the new rule by March 15, 2000. An RIK Feasibility Study found that RIK could generate positive revenue for the U.S. Treasury. The MMS began a pilot study on a RIK process involving natural gas and oil production in Wyoming, Texas, and the Gulf of Mexico, with the pilot expected to be fully operational in 1999. The RIK pilot study on oil and gas production in Wyoming is expected to be fully operational in 1999. Legislation (P.L. 104-185) authorized states to collect royalties from federal leases. The OCS moratorium on leasing activity was extended through FY1999 and supported by Congress for FY2000. In 1990, President Bush issued a directive banning OCS leasing activity in areas other than Texas, Louisiana, and Alabama offshore. The moratoria apply to environmentally sensitive areas, with little hydrocarbon production. Lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico have been robust, with record-setting auctions in recent years. The Central Gulf auction in March 1997 set a record with $824 million in high bids. The last sale under the 1992-1997 leasing plan generated over $2.4 billion in bonuses. The OCS Leasing Plan for FY1997 to FY2002 included a record-breaking Western Gulf auction in August 1997. Plans for continued annual lease sales in Gulf Coast areas were outlined due to rising oil imports. Oil and gas exploration activities have increased in the past two years. Oil and gas exploration activities have increased over the past two years, but actual activity on current leases in the OCS has decreased in FY1998 due to lower oil and gas prices. Deep water well development is expanding rapidly with new discoveries. MMS is proposing to increase efforts in technological needs and environmental issues associated with deep water drilling. The Gulf of Mexico accounts for over half of the world's drilling rigs in deep water. The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement ensures land mined for coal is reclaimed to support its pre-mining land use. The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) administers the Abandoned Mine Lands (AML) fund, funded by coal production fees, to reclaim hazardous sites. States and tribes enforce minimum standards, overseen by OSM. The FY2000 budget request was $305.8 million, with $27.1 million for AML fund to accelerate reclamation. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2000 provided $292.4 million for OSM, including $94.7 million for Regulation and Technology programs. In FY2000, the Surface Mining budget included $96.2 million for Regulation and Technology programs, an increase from previous years. The AML request was $211.2 million, with additional funding for the Appalachian Clean Streams Initiative. Funding for AML activities is based on states' coal production levels. The minimum funding level for states with lower coal production was increased to $2 million in 1992, but Congress only appropriated $1.5 million in FY1996-FY1998. The Administration proposed restoring the funding to $2 million in FY2000, but the Senate Appropriations recommended $185.7 million, $25 million less than the Administration, and funding minimum program states at $1.5 million. The House Committee on Appropriations recommended $196.5 million for the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement, with $8 million allocated to the Appalachian Clean Streams Initiative (ACSI). The final budget package allocated $196.2 million, with $8 million for ACSI and $1.5 million for minimum program states. The Bureau of Indian Affairs provides services to federally recognized tribes and has historically been the lead agency in federal dealings with tribes. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) provides a wide range of programs and services to federally recognized tribes, including government operations, law enforcement, education, and economic development. Key issues for the BIA include equitable funding distribution, tribal influence on programs, and reorganization. Greater tribal control over federal Indian programs has been a goal since the 1970s. Tribal control over federal Indian programs has been a goal since the 1970s, with the BIA implementing three forms of this policy: tribal contracting, tribal compacting, and Tribal Priority Allocations (TPA). TPA accounts for a significant portion of the BIA's operation of Indian programs and direct appropriations. The BIA is under pressure to reorganize to accommodate tribal influence and funding distribution. The BIA has faced pressure to reorganize from tribes, the administration, and Congress, but there have been disagreements on proposals. The Clinton Administration's initiative aimed at restructuring through the \"tribal shares\" process, but the Interior solicitor advised against it. Appropriations Committee reports directed the BIA to develop a reorganization plan and consolidate offices, leading to the development of reorganization plans and consolidation options. The BIA commissioned NAPA to study its administration and management, leading to recommendations for reorganization and funding allocation. The BIA funding distribution issue involves equitable allocation and consideration of tribes' financial resources, including business revenues. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed developing alternate formulas for distributing funds based on need and requiring tribes to submit business revenue information to BIA. The Senate Committee's FY1999 bill proposed reallocating TPA funds based on tribal business revenues to address inequities in funding distribution. The House Appropriations Committee allocated $250,000 to develop TPA needs-measurement methods and criteria for equitable funding allocation, ensuring that returning funds to the BIA would not diminish the federal trust responsibility to tribes. Opponents argue that means-testing TPA funding would penalize tribes with severe needs, violate the federal trust responsibility, and be unfair compared to state or local governments receiving federal assistance. Congress had previously distributed FY1998 TPA funds to ensure each tribe received the minimum recommended funding. The 1994 report recommended minimum funding for tribes, with allocation based on task force recommendations. Senators requested a GAO report on TPA distribution issues. The tribal/federal task force made distribution recommendations in 1998, supported by the BIA. GAO findings showed TPA funds were distributed based on historical levels and formulas, varied per capita, and tribal revenue reporting was inconsistent. The GAO report on TPA distribution issues highlighted inconsistencies in tribal revenue reporting. Congress made changes to the FY1999 proposals, dropping the reallocation scheme but retaining the requirement for the BIA to develop alternative funding methods. The BIA/Tribal Workgroup concluded that current TPA funding does not meet tribes' identified needs due to variations in circumstances. The Senate proposed redistributing TPA funds to address tribal funding inequities in FY2000, with a 10% limit on reducing any tribe's share. The House did not have a similar proposal. The conference report on H.R. 2466 included the Senate's proposal, allowing exceptions to the 10% limit in certain situations. The BIA was directed to distribute funds for post-secondary institutions by formula. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2000 retained these funding provisions. During congressional debates over FY1997 and FY1998 Interior appropriations, controversial provisions were considered but not approved, including one prohibiting the Interior Secretary from taking land into trust for a tribe without agreement on tax collection. Another provision would have waived tribal immunity to civil suits in federal court if a tribe accepted TPA funding, but it was withdrawn. The Senate Indian Affairs Committee held hearings on a related bill in 1998. The Senate Indian Affairs Committee held hearings in 1998 on a bill (S. 1691) restricting tribal sovereign immunity. Consideration of the bill was postponed, and the Interior Secretary was required to study tribal liability insurance coverage by Congress. The Joint BIA/Tribal Workgroup prepared the insurance coverage report. In FY1999 and FY2000, Congress addressed issues related to BIA-funded law enforcement, support costs for self-determination contracts, and self-governance compacts. Changes were made to centralized line authority and reprogramming of funds. A moratorium was approved for one year to address contract support costs, and a study by the GAO was conducted. In FY1999 and FY2000, Congress addressed contract support costs for self-determination contracts and self-governance compacts. The GAO recommended alternative funding methods and a standard policy development. The Senate recommended a moratorium extension, while the House bill did not. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2000 dropped the moratorium provision. Congress also included language restricting the use of the \"Huron Cemetery\" for gaming purposes. The Senate recommended provisions for FY2000, including prohibiting taking lands into trust in Clark County, Washington for the Shoalwater Bay Indian Tribe. They also approved an amendment prohibiting the Interior Secretary from approving class III Indian gaming compacts without state approval. Regulations for approving gaming compacts were promulgated by the Secretary of the Interior on April 12, 1999. The Secretary of the Interior promulgated regulations for approving gaming compacts in April 1999, which were immediately challenged in federal court by Florida and Alabama. The Secretary stated he would not approve any compacts under the regulations until the courts decided on his authority. The FY2000 appropriations committee did not include gaming-compact provisions, with the House rejecting an amendment to prohibit funding for compacts not agreed to by both state and tribe. The Senate approved a provision prohibiting funds to implement the Secretary's regulations, but it was dropped in the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2000 based on assurances that the regulations would not be implemented until ruled on by federal courts. The FY2000 BIA budget proposed an increase to $1.9 billion, with various increases in different areas such as TPA, BIA school operations, aid under the Tribally Controlled College or University Assistance Act, and total BIA construction. A new proposal included a school construction bond initiative to address the backlog in school construction. The administration proposed issuing $400 million in bonds over 2 years for school construction backlog. Additionally, there was a proposed increase of $20 million for the Indian country law enforcement initiative in FY2000. The recommended BIA appropriations for FY2000 varied between the House, Senate, conference committee, and Consolidated Appropriations Act, with the final amount being $1.87 billion. The House and Senate recommended different amounts for TPA funding. The House and Senate recommended different amounts for TPA funding in FY2000, with the final amount being $693.4 million, 0.8% less than FY1999. For BIA school operations, the recommended amounts were $488.7 million by the House and $490.7 million by the Senate, both higher than FY1999. The conference report recommended $489.7 million, a 2.9% increase. For tribally controlled colleges and universities, the Senate recommended $31.3 million, the House recommended $32.3 million, and the final amount provided was $35.3 million, nearly a 13% increase. The Senate recommended $146.9 million for BIA construction, including $82.4 million for education construction, a 19% and 36% increase from FY1999, respectively. The House recommended $126 million, including $60.5 million for education. The conference committee accepted the Senate recommendation, but the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2000 provided $169.9 million, a 37.6% increase. The proposed school construction bond initiative was not accepted. For more information on the Bureau of Indian Affairs, visit http://www.doi.gov/bureau-indian-affairs.html. The National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC) was established in 1988 to oversee tribal regulation of bingo and gaming operations. Its budget is funded through fee assessments on tribes' operations, with no direct appropriations since FY1999. The FY1998 Interior Appropriations Act increased assessment fees to $8 million and expanded fees to include Class III operations. The NIGC's authorization for appropriations was raised to $2 million. The NIGC did not receive any FY2000 appropriations. The Office of Special Trustee for American Indians, authorized by the American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act of 1994, oversees Indian trust assets and funds due to inadequate management by the BIA. The Office of Special Trustee for American Indians oversees Indian trust funds, including tribal and Individual Indian Money (IIM) accounts, with a total asset value of $2.5 billion and $433.3 million respectively. Trust funds consist of monies from various sources and are managed by the OST since 1996. An outside audit was conducted for non-investment transactions in tribal trust fund accounts for the period 1973-1992. The Office of Special Trustee for American Indians oversees tribal and Individual Indian Money (IIM) accounts, with a total asset value of $2.5 billion and $433.3 million respectively. An outside audit was conducted for non-investment transactions in tribal trust fund accounts for the period 1973-1992. A class-action suit was filed against the federal government on behalf of IIM account owners seeking an accounting of funds and restitution for any losses. The secretaries of the Interior and Treasury were held in contempt of court for failing to produce trust records. In Feb. 1999, federal departments apologized for trust fund system failures. The IIM suit went to trial in June 1999. In April 1997, the OST submitted a Strategic Plan for improving trust fund management. Congress opposed the creation of a new agency and directed the OST to focus on trust fund system improvements and financial claim settlements. In August 1997, the Secretary of the Interior agreed to implement aspects of the Strategic Plan for trust management systems and issued a \"High-Level Implementation Plan\" for the Trust Management Improvement Project. In January 1999, the OST was reorganized, leading to the resignation of the Special Trustee, Paul Homan. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported an emergency supplemental appropriations bill related to trust fund management. The Senate Appropriations Committee's supplemental appropriations bill (S. 544, 106th Cong.) did not include a provision prohibiting the Secretary's reorganization of the OST, but expressed concerns about the trust fund reform act and the High-Level Implementation Plan. The FY2000 Interior appropriations bill would restrict the deployment of the new trust asset and accounting management system (TAAMS) until certification of meeting contract requirements. The original FY1999 funding for the Office of Special Trustee was set at $39.5 million. The Office of Special Trustee received $39.5 million in funding for FY1999, which was increased to $61.3 million with supplemental appropriations. The President proposed a budget of $100.025 million for FY2000, with $90.025 million allocated for federal trust programs, including trust systems improvements, settlement and litigation support, trust funds management, and the Indian land consolidation pilot project. The purpose of the land consolidation project is to purchase and consolidate fractionated ownerships of allotted Indian trust lands. The House and Senate recommended $5 million for the land consolidation project, which was accepted in the conference report on H.R. 2466. The FY2000 appropriations law maintained this funding level. For OST's federal trust programs, the House recommended $90.025 million while the Senate recommended $73.836 million. The conference report included the House recommendation. The Office of Insular Affairs received roughly $300 million in FY2000 funding, with the larger portion of $201 million coming from previously enacted permanent and indefinite sources. In FY2000, federal assistance to insular areas totaled $300 million, with $201 million coming from permanent and indefinite sources. The remaining $99 million consisted of discretionary and current mandatory funds subject to appropriations. Guam, U.S. Virgin Islands, and three freely associated states received automatic allocations, while two territories did not. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2000 provided $91 million, exceeding previous years' funding levels. The Administration requested $88.6 million for discretionary and current mandatory funding for the OIA in recent years. In FY2000, funding for brown tree snake control was increased by $250,000 to a total of $2.35 million. Additionally, $1.0 million was requested for new coral reef management programs, with half of the amount approved for FY2000. In FY2000, Congress agreed to provide half of the requested amount for OIA funding. Debate centered on reallocating funds from CNMI to Guam to address \"compact impact\" from FSM immigration. Advocates argued for financial assistance to meet social service demands on Guam. The request included reallocating $5.4 million to Guam and extending $10 million funding indefinitely, which Congress did not approve. In FY2000, Congress approved a $10 million indefinite funding proposal. The Consolidated Appropriations Act included $3 million for Guam and reallocated $5.4 million to the U.S. Virgin Islands for prison construction. Funding for CNMI would return to $11 million annually in FY2001 and FY2002, dropping to $5.4 million in FY2003. Other issues raised included increased funding for the Office of Insular Affairs and concern for the fiscal condition of the territories and freely associated states. The House approved a loan of $18.6 million for American Samoa, to be repaid from the territory's share of the tobacco settlement. Concerns were raised about debt payments by Chuuk state of the FSM and immigration impact on Hawaii. Additionally, a $19 million loan for economic development in American Samoa was included in the FY2000 appropriations law. Members of Congress also expressed concerns about labor conditions and immigration laws in the CNMI. Members of Congress expressed concerns about labor conditions and immigration laws in the CNMI, supporting the extension of federal minimum wage laws to the territory. The Administration requested $2.913 billion for the U.S. Forest Service in FY2000, with State and Private Forestry seeing the largest increase of $82 million (48%). In FY2000, the U.S. Forest Service budget would have seen changes with State and Private Forestry increasing by $82 million (48%), research by $37 million (19%), and infrastructure maintenance by $28 million (16%). The National Forest System would have been adjusted with a $59 million (4%) increase, focusing on wildlife, soil/water/air, planning, monitoring, and recreation. The House passed a $2.604 billion appropriation, $309 million less than the Administration's request. The U.S. Forest Service budget for FY2000 saw changes with increases in State and Private Forestry, research, and infrastructure maintenance. The House passed a $2.604 billion appropriation, $309 million less than the Administration's request. The Senate passed an appropriation of $2.671 billion, with adjustments in research, National Forest System, land acquisition, and State and Private Forestry. The conference agreed to an appropriation of $2.798 million, with major adjustments in various areas. The U.S. Forest Service budget for FY2000 saw changes with increases in various areas. The final conference report contained an appropriation of $2.831 million, with increases in land acquisition, construction, forest research, recreation management, and other programs. Key increases included funding for the forest legacy program, inventory and monitoring, watershed improvements, and fish habitat management. The FY2000 appropriations law allocated $155.6 million for Forest Service land acquisitions, with $101 million designated for acquiring the Baca Ranch. Timber sales and forest health were debated, with proposed declines in salvage and green sales. More information can be found on the U.S. Forest Service website. The proposed sale program for FY2000 was at its lowest level since FY1950, with timber sale funds slightly lower than FY1999 levels. The 10% Roads and Trails Fund was modified to focus on improving forest health conditions and wildfire risk areas. $10 million was allocated for trail maintenance in FY2000 to offset a decline in appropriations. The FY2000 appropriations law included a provision regarding wildlife populations on federal lands. The agencies were challenged in court for not fulfilling survey requirements, leading to injunctions on timber sales. The provision was ultimately deleted from the final report. Management of federal lands has been controversial, leading to the enactment of the National Forest Management Act of 1976 and the Federal Land Policy. Congress enacted the National Forest Management Act of 1976 (NFMA) and the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA) to guide land management planning for national forests and BLM lands. Despite efforts to improve planning processes, bills to enhance forest health have not been passed. The FY2000 Forest Service appropriations bills included provisions directing the Forest Service to continue management under existing plans until new planning regulations are revised. The FY2000 appropriations law includes a provision prohibiting the completion of the RPA Program. Road construction in national forests remains controversial, with some opposing new roads due to environmental concerns while others argue for the need for access roads for forest protection and timber harvesting. The House and Senate passed modest increases for road construction in FY2000. The FY2000 appropriations law includes provisions for road construction funding, with modest increases from FY1999 appropriations. There was debate on increasing Forest Service fiscal accountability in the 105th Congress, with changes in budget structure included in FY1999. The House requested a review of agency fiscal management in 1998. The FY2000 appropriations law addressed concerns about Forest Service leadership and accountability, with recommendations for trust fund usage and additional information requirements. The Department of Energy's website provides further information on Fossil Energy Research. The Clinton Administration's FY2000 budget request for fossil fuel research and development (R&D) focused on environmental issues related to electric power, particularly global climate change concerns. The Administration requested a deferral of $256 million in funding for the Clean Coal Technology Program due to scheduling delays. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2000 included a deferral amount of $156 million, resulting in a 5.2% decline in funding compared to the previous year. The FY2000 appropriations law provided fossil energy R&D with net funding of $419 million, with the Senate approving $391 million and the House reducing funding to $280.3 million. Funding for coal R&D projects slightly decreased while petroleum R&D increased by 3.2% and natural gas R&D decreased by 8.6%. The House recommended transferring funds from biomass energy development to the energy conservation account and consolidating $41 million of the advanced turbine program under the energy conservation accounts. The FY2000 appropriations law allocated $419 million for fossil energy R&D, with a focus on new technology utilizing natural gas as a clean fuel. Critics question the narrow view of coal's potential and its impact on jobs and the economy. The 105th Congress approved $160.1 million for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve program in FY1999, following the cancellation of another authorized sale due to declining oil prices. Roughly 28 million barrels of SPR oil were previously sold for maintenance and upgrades. Attention in the 106th Congress turned to replenishing the SPR, with various proposals discussed. In late 1998, a proposal was made to have royalties on oil production from federal leases paid in actual barrels of oil and deposited in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). Transfers of nearly 100,000 barrels/day of oil from leases in the Gulf of Mexico began in April 1999 to replace the 28 million barrels that were sold. The petroleum industry has welcomed this royalty-in-kind program, with the Administration requesting $164 million for FY2000 to support operations, maintenance, and security of the SPR. The Senate Appropriations Committee agreed on $159 million for operations, maintenance, and security, with a $5 million appropriation to the SPR Petroleum Account. The House reduced funding to $146 million, but the conferees restored the money in the final bill. The House passed the amended bill with a vote of 377-47, and a final funding level of $159 million was agreed upon by both chambers. This amount remained unchanged during budget negotiations and was enacted in the Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2000. Additionally, the National Defense Authorization Act for FY1996 authorized the sale of the federal interest in the Elk Hills oil field in California, with Occidental Petroleum Corporation acquiring the site for $3.65 billion. The Department of Energy (DOE) approved $107 million for FY2000, with no new appropriation from Congress. Most Naval Oil Shale Reserves were transferred to the Department of the Interior, leaving two small oil fields and one oil shale reserve in the program. California Teachers' Retirement Fund will receive 9% of sale proceeds from Elk Hills, with payments spread over several years. DOE has deposited $298 million for future payments. The DOE approved $107 million for FY2000 with no new appropriation from Congress. The next $36 million installment will be paid from a contingent fund. Senate Appropriations recommended no appropriations to the school lands fund, but House Appropriations provided for the payment. The conferees authorized the next payment to be made on October 1, 2000, effectively postponing it into FY2001. The Clinton Administration views energy efficiency as crucial for curbing air pollution and climate change. For more information on Naval Petroleum and Oil Shale Reserves, visit http://www.fe.doe.gov/nposr/index.html. The President's State of the Union address emphasized the need for clean energy technologies to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. The Administration's FY2000 budget requested $837.5 million for the DOE's Energy Efficiency Program, a $145.8 million increase from FY1999. This included $646.5 million for R&D programs and $191 million for grant programs, with significant increases in funding for buildings R&D programs. The Senate recommended $684.8 million for FY2000, including $527.9 million for R&D programs and $168.0 million for grant programs. The House approved $731.8 million, with $37.9 million more for R&D programs and $46.1 million more for crosscutting programs under industries for the future. The Consolidated Appropriation Act for FY2000 allocated $720.2 million, $92.3 million less than the request. It included $576.7 million for R&D programs and $168.5 million for grant programs. Compared to FY1999, it provided $51.0 million more for R&D and $2.5 million more for grants. Significant program changes included decreases in funding for crosscutting activities and increases for Energy Efficiency Science Initiative and Cooperative Programs with States. The FY2000 Consolidated Appropriation Act allocated $720.2 million, $92.3 million less than requested. It included funding increases for vehicle technologies, equipment activities, specific industries, and material technologies under various R&D programs. The Department of Health and Human Services' Indian Health Service provides health services to American Indians and Alaska Natives. The Indian Health Service provides healthcare to over 557 federally recognized tribes in 34 states through federal, tribal, and urban programs. Funding is divided into Indian Health Services and Indian Health Facilities, covering services like hospital programs, mental health, and substance abuse programs. The program is funded through federal appropriations and reimbursements from Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance. The Indian Health Service receives funding from federal appropriations and reimbursements from Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2000 provided $2.398 billion for the Indian Health Service, with a focus on addressing the higher incidence of illness and premature mortality among American Indians and Alaska Natives. Alaska Natives have limited access to healthcare compared to the general U.S. population. The Indian Health Service (IHS) faces challenges with a shortage of physicians and nurses per beneficiary. Per capita health spending for IHS is lower than the U.S. average, and funding has not kept up with the increasing eligible population and inflation. Many IHS facilities require repair or replacement, with additional funding allocated for site purchase, construction, and maintenance in the FY2000 Consolidated Appropriations Act. The FY2000 Consolidated Appropriations Act allocated funds for site purchase, facility construction, repair, and maintenance for health care facilities. It also included funds for ambulances, Department of Defense equipment, and debt reduction for the Hopi tribe. The Act aimed to address the decrease in funding for health care facilities by authorizing the transfer of $10 million to IHShealth care facilities and requested a report on the fund usage. Additionally, the Act emphasized the need for collaboration between IHS, tribes, and the Administration to revise the facilities construction priority system. The FY2000 Consolidated Appropriations Act allocated funds for health care facilities, including site purchase, construction, repair, and maintenance. It aimed to address funding decreases by transferring $10 million to IHShealth care facilities and requested a report on fund usage. The Act emphasized collaboration between IHS, tribes, and the Administration to revise the construction priority system for health facilities. The Act's conference report highlighted the need for a more flexible program to accommodate tribal needs and the distribution of contract support costs. The FY2000 Consolidated Appropriations Act allocated $229 million for contract support costs, with only $10 million designated for new and expanded contracts. Congress aimed to distribute funds fairly but expressed concerns about unresolved issues. The Act's conference report highlighted congressional concerns regarding the funding of contract support costs for tribes, noting a conflict in the authorizing statute. It urged the Service to work with tribes and legislative committees to resolve discrepancies and ensure fair funding. Additionally, it referenced a recent court decision stating that contract costs are subject to appropriations. The Act's conference report emphasized fair distribution of funding increases among IHS programs, suggesting selective project allocation for demonstrable results. GAO released a report on Indian Self-Determination Act shortfalls on June 30, 1999. The General Accounting Office (GAO) released a report on Indian Self-Determination Act shortfalls on June 30, 1999, addressing contract support costs distribution and alternative funding methods. The Office of Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation was reauthorized for FY1995-2000 by P.L. 104-301. The 1974 relocation legislation (P.L. 93-531) resolved a dispute between the Hopi and Navajo tribes over land originally designated for a reservation in 1882. Lands were divided between the tribes, with Navajo families being relocated. Most relocatees are Navajo, with some still in the process of acquiring replacement housing. About 455 families, mostly Navajo, still need to complete relocation, including 72 families on Hopi land who refuse to relocate. Negotiations between the Hopi and Navajo tribes, along with the federal government, led to a proposed settlement agreement in 1995. This agreement included 75-year leases for Navajo families on Hopi partitioned land. The Navajo-Hopi Land Dispute Settlement Act of 1996 approved the agreement, but some Navajo families opposed the leases. Despite the agreements, not all issues have been resolved, and Navajo families faced a deadline to sign leases by March 31, 1997. The Hopi Tribe has called for enforcement of relocation against Navajo families without leases on Hopi partitioned land. The FY2000 Interior appropriations bill proposed by the President contains a provision forbidding ONHIR from evicting Navajo families without providing a replacement home. The settlement agreement allows the Hopi Tribe to take action against the United States in 2000 if Navajo families have not signed leases. Congress has been concerned about the slow progress in resolving the land dispute. Congress has expressed concerns about the slow progress of the relocation program for Navajo families. Appropriations for ONHIR were $13 million in FY1999 and proposed to be $14 million in FY2000, with the Senate recommending a reduction to $8 million due to unobligated balances. The House did not include language to phase out ONHIR in FY2000. The Smithsonian Institution (SI) is a museum, education, and research complex with 16 museums and galleries, including the National Zoo. It had over 30 million visitors in 1998, with the National Air and Space Museum alone attracting 8.8 million visitors. The federal government's role in supporting arts and culture programs like the Smithsonian is a debated issue. The Smithsonian Institution is estimated to be 70+ percent federally funded, with private trust funds and donations supplementing its budget. The FY2000 Clinton Administration budget proposed $447.4 million for the Smithsonian, with $380.5 million allocated for salaries and expenses. $19 million was requested for the completion of the National Museum of the American Indian. The National Museum of the American Indian (NMAI) faced controversy due to the need for renovation and maintenance of existing Smithsonian museums. Private donations totaling $36.7 million, including $15 million from the Indian community, helped fund one-third of the total cost. Despite Congress's request to scale down plans, the museum's projected cost remained high. The American Indian museum's total projected cost remained at $110 million, with $16 million provided for construction in FY1999. The FY2000 budget included $47.9 million for repair and restoration of Smithsonian buildings, which have not received adequate funding for maintenance, leading to increased deterioration. The NMAI groundbreaking ceremony took place in September 1999. The Commission on the Future of the Smithsonian recommended $50 million annually for 10 years for facility restoration. The National Zoo needed $10 million per year for 5 years. The FY2000 budget allocated $17 million for the American Art and Portrait Gallery renovation and $6 million for the National Zoo. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed $423 million for the Smithsonian, with $35 million for building repairs. The House Appropriations Committee suggested $438.4 million for the Smithsonian. The FY2000 budget allocated $439.8 million for the Smithsonian, including $372.9 million for salaries and expenses, and $47.9 million for repair and restoration. The House and Senate bills concurred on $19 million for the National Museum of the American Indian. The Senate bill included additional funding for certain programs of the Smithsonian. The Smithsonian's FY2000 budget included $372.9 million for salaries and expenses, $47.9 million for repair and restoration, and $19 million for construction of the National Museum of the American Indian. A report in 1997 questioned the Smithsonian's mission regarding Latinos, leading to the establishment of a Latino studies fellowship program in 1998. The Smithsonian celebrated its 150th anniversary in 1996 with public programs like \"America's Smithsonian,\" a traveling exhibit. While considering admission charges for special exhibits, the Smithsonian used bond issues for construction projects due to reduced federal support. Private donors contributed $60 million to the NASM's Dulles Center in 1999. In October 1999, private donors pledged $60 million to NASM's Dulles Center for renovation. The National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities, which includes NEA, NEH, and IMS, receives federal support for arts, humanities, and museums. The authorizing act for the foundation has expired but operates on temporary authority through appropriations law. The National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities, including NEA, NEH, and IMLS, has been operating on temporary authority through appropriations law since its last reauthorization in 1990. Congress is debating the federal role in funding for arts, humanities, and museums, with some arguing for abolishment of NEA and NEH, while others believe culture can thrive through private support. Proponents cite a long tradition of federal support for arts and humanities dating back to 1817. The National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities, including NEA, NEH, and IMLS, has been operating on temporary authority through appropriations law since 1990. Congress is debating the federal role in funding for arts, humanities, and museums, with some arguing for abolishment of NEA and NEH, while others believe culture can thrive through private support. Spokesmen for the private sector say they are unable to make up the gap left by the loss of federal funds for the arts. The Administration's FY2000 budget would have provided $150 million each for NEA and NEH and $34 million for OMS within the Institute of Museum and Library Services, including a new program Challenge America. The NEH would have received $150 million for humanities seminars, state humanities councils, American Legacy Editions, and regional humanities centers. The IMLS would have received $15.6 million for General Operating Support to help museums improve services, including developing Museums Online to reach 22 million people. In the 105th Congress, the NEA faced potential elimination as a priority for some House members. A \"values action team\" was formed within the House Republican leadership to coordinate legislative action with conservative groups. The President's Committee on the Arts recommended restoring federal funding for NEA, NEH, and IMLS to adequate levels. The goal was to reach $2.00 per person in appropriations by the year 2000 for all three agencies. The controversy over obscenity charges in a few NEA grants persists despite efforts to address the issue. No NEA projects have been deemed obscene by courts. A federal appeals court initially ruled applying \"general standards of decency\" to NEA grants unconstitutional, but the Supreme Court later reversed this decision. NEA eliminated grants to individuals by arts discipline, except for Literature fellowships, Jazz masters, and National Heritage fellowships in Folk and Traditional Arts. In the 105th Congress, the FY1998 Interior Appropriations Act included NEA reform measures, such as increased funding allocation to states for arts grants and underserved populations. The legislation also emphasized arts education and placed a 15% cap on NEA funds allocated to each state. Additionally, three members were added to the National Council on the Arts, while the size of the council was reduced from 26 to 20. Both NEA and NEH were given authority to solicit and invest funds. In the 105th Congress, funding for the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) was a topic of debate. The House initially recommended terminating $98 million for the NEA, but eventually restored the funding after various amendments and votes. The FY1999 Omnibus Appropriations Act provided $98 million for the NEA, along with funding for the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) and the Office of Museum Services (OMS). The Senate Appropriations Committee also allocated $99 million for the NEA in the FY2000 Interior Appropriations bill. In FY2000, the House and Senate proposed funding for the NEA, NEH, and OMS. The House recommended $98 million for NEA, $110.7 million for NEH, and $24.4 million for OMS. The Senate allocated $99 million for NEA. An amendment to increase NEA and NEH funding by $10 million each was proposed but not passed. The House and Senate proposed funding for the NEA, NEH, and OMS in FY2000. An amendment to increase NEA and NEH funding by $10 million each was rejected. The Senate adopted amendments to increase NEA appropriation to $103 million and NEH to $115.7 million. The Consolidated Appropriations Act for FY2000 provided $98 million for NEA, $115.7 million for NEH, and $24.4 million for OMS. For more information on the National Endowment for the Arts, visit http://arts.endow.gov/. The Lands Legacy Initiative was announced by the Clinton Administration on January 12, 1999, addressing resource protection issues. Components of the initiative were included in legislation introduced by Senator Boxer and Representative Miller. Other related legislative proposals were introduced by Representative Young and Senator Landrieu. H.R. 701 was reported by the House Resources Committee in November 1999, focusing on increasing federal land acquisition funding. The Interior Appropriations proposal aims to increase federal land acquisition funding through the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF). This would involve providing grants to states and localities for land acquisition and open space planning, expanding funding for resource protection efforts, smart growth partnerships, and ocean and coastal protection. The estimated cost for these proposals is just over $1 billion, with most of the funding coming from fully funding the LWCF at its authorized maximum level of $900 million. Federal agencies would spend $413 million on land acquisition. The Land and Water Conservation Fund proposal aims to increase federal land acquisition funding, including areas like Mojave Desert, N.E. Forests, Everglades, Lewis and Clark Trail, and Civil War Battlefields. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees did not support the overall request for FY2000. The proposal for the Land and Water Conservation Fund faced criticism for not addressing a large maintenance backlog and allocating funds for purposes unrelated to federal agency activities. Representative Ralph Regula expressed concerns about conflicting priorities with the President's Lands Legacy Initiative.
