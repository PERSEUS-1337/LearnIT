    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Headwaters Forest Act\" and includes findings and purpose. The Congress finds that redwoods are a significant national symbol and a defining symbol of California. Old growth redwood trees are a unique and irreplaceable natural resource, with less than 5 percent of the original 2,000,000 acre Coast redwoods remaining. The remaining unprotected stands of old growth forests and redwoods are under immediate threat. The purpose of this Act is to manage and protect old growth Redwood forest areas in Humboldt County, California, to prevent their harvesting without following guidelines, and to preserve habitat for the long-term benefits of permanent protection and preservation. The Act aims to manage and protect old growth Redwood forest areas in Humboldt County, California, to preserve habitat for various species by adding lands to the Six Rivers National Forest and including a portion in the national wilderness preservation system. Definitions include terms like \"Six Rivers National Forest Addition\" and \"Headwaters Forest,\" with the Secretary of Agriculture overseeing the implementation. The Act aims to manage and protect old growth Redwood forest areas in Humboldt County, California by adding lands to the Six Rivers National Forest. The Act aims to modify the boundaries of the Six Rivers National Forest in California to include approximately 44,000 acres of acquired lands. The Secretary of Agriculture will conduct land acquisitions to achieve this goal. The Chief of the Forest Service, Department of Agriculture, can acquire lands in the Six Rivers National Forest Addition through donation, purchase, or exchange. Excess federal lands can be transferred for exchanges with approval from the Secretary. The Secretary can propose legislation for the transfer of lands to Committees in the House and Senate without compensation. The Secretary may acquire land outside the Six Rivers National Forest Addition to minimize severance costs and exchange it for non-Federal lands within the boundaries. The Secretary can acquire land outside the Six Rivers National Forest Addition without compensation and exchange it for non-Federal lands within the boundaries. Lands owned by the State of California or its political subdivisions within the Addition can only be acquired by donation or exchange. The Secretary may accept funds from California to cover the cost of acquiring lands within the Addition. The Secretary can acquire lands within the Six Rivers National Forest Addition without compensation and may retain and expend funds for this purpose. A land acquisition plan must be developed within 6 months, prioritizing lands proposed for inclusion in the National Wilderness Preservation System. Other means of acquisition besides funds will be considered. The Secretary is authorized to use funds for acquiring lands within the Six Rivers Forest Addition, with a limit of $200,000,000. A plan must be submitted to relevant committees, and the Secretary cannot acquire lands after this limit. The Secretary is limited to acquiring lands within the Six Rivers National Forest Addition under this section for a 10-year period from the enactment of the Act. Consent of the owner is required for acquisition, and condemnation is not allowed for acquiring lands or interests within the Addition. SEC. 4. WILDERNESS AREAS. Designation of lands in California under the Wilderness Act as the Headwaters Forest Wilderness, with a map and legal description to be filed by the Secretary. The Secretary can correct errors in legal descriptions and maps filed for the Headwaters Forest Wilderness in California. Congress does not intend to create buffer zones around designated wilderness areas. State jurisdiction over fish and wildlife is not affected by this Act. The Act does not affect California's jurisdiction over wildlife and fish in designated wilderness areas. SEC. 5. ADMINISTRATION. Within 1 year of acquiring identified lands, the Secretary must develop a management plan for preserving old growth redwood ecosystems. The plan includes prohibiting timber sales in old growth groves, restoring lands impacted by previous harvests, and allowing timber sales in other areas of the Six Rivers National Forest Addition. The management plan for the Six Rivers National Forest aims to preserve habitat for various species and must be reviewed and revised regularly. The Secretary must administer acquired lands in accordance with the Management Plan, this Act, and other applicable laws and regulations, including the Wilderness Act for designated wilderness areas. The management plan for the Six Rivers National Forest includes provisions for implementing Restoration Measures using unemployed workers dependent on fishery and timber resources. The Secretary can enter agreements with California for managing state-owned or state-assisted lands. SEC. 6. PAYMENTS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT. For payments made under chapter 69 of title 31, lands added to the Six Rivers National Forest will be considered acquired for specific purposes. The Secretary will make annual payments to Humboldt County, California for 10 years after the acquisition of these lands, equivalent to the Timber Yield Tax revenues that would have been paid if the lands were not acquired by the United States. The Secretary will determine payments based on factors like timber sales, size, quality, market conditions, and laws. California Timber Yield Tax payments will be made to Humboldt County. Timber Yield Tax payments made to Humboldt County for timber sold from lands acquired under this Act will be deducted from payments to the county. Payments under subsection (b) will be reduced by amounts paid under the Act of May 23, 1908 for sales from the same lands in that year. SEC. 7. FOREST STUDY. The Secretary will study approximately 13,620 acres of land known as the \"Study Area\" to assess its potential for inclusion in the Headwaters Forest. The study will evaluate natural resources such as old growth forests, endangered species habitat, timber volume, recreational opportunities, wildlife, and watershed management. A report with the findings must be submitted to specific committees within one year of the Act's enactment. SEC. 8. NO ADVERSE EFFECT ON LANDS UNTIL ACQUIRED. Until the lands in the Six River National Forest Addition are acquired, the owners and their designees have full and lawful use of the lands. This Act does not limit their use, defer timber harvest plans, or grant a cause of action against them. Owners may voluntarily defer land use for a period of time. SEC. 9. Search and rescue operations in Six Rivers National Forest allow mechanical transport for emergencies involving individual health or safety. SEC. 10. Purchase of American-made equipment and products.
