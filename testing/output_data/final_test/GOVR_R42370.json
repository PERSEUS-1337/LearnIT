    "content": "The ACA expanded federal regulation over health insurance, requiring coverage for preventive health services without cost sharing. Key provisions include dependent coverage up to age 26, elimination of preexisting condition exclusions, and prohibition of lifetime annual limits on benefits. The ACA expanded federal regulation over health insurance, requiring coverage for preventive health services without cost sharing, including a full range of FDA-approved contraceptive methods and sterilization procedures for women with reproductive capacity. The ACA expanded federal regulation over health insurance to include coverage for preventive health services without cost sharing, including contraceptive methods and sterilization procedures for women. Guidelines based on IOM recommendations were published, supported by HRSA. Interim final regulations addressing preventive health services coverage were first published in July 2010, with an amended rule published in August 2011 allowing HRSA to exempt \"religious employers\" from contraceptive services guidelines. The final rules on the coverage of contraceptive services were published on February 15, 2012, adopting a narrow definition of \"religious employer\" that received criticism for excluding many religious institutions providing health, educational, or charitable services. Over 200,000 comments were received on the regulations, with some urging for a broader definition. The Departments established a narrow definition of \"religious employer\" in the final rules on contraceptive coverage. There were concerns about excluding religiously affiliated employers not qualifying as \"religious employers.\" A broader exemption was not favored as it could lead to more out-of-pocket costs for employees, reducing contraceptive use. A temporary enforcement safe harbor was provided for non-exempted, nonprofit organizations with religious objections. Plans were made to propose changes accommodating these organizations in the final regulations. The Departments plan to require issuers to offer insurance without contraception coverage to certain employers and provide contraceptive coverage directly to the employer's plan participants who desire it. A temporary enforcement safe harbor will be in effect until August 1, 2013, for non-profit entities meeting specific criteria. The organization, based on religious beliefs, does not provide contraceptive coverage in its group health plan since February 10, 2012. It notifies participants that contraceptive coverage will not be available starting from August 1, 2012. The organization self-certifies its compliance with the criteria outlined in the guidance. The Department of Labor and Treasury will not enforce actions against compliant organizations under the temporary enforcement safe harbor. The final rules on religious exemptions for contraceptive coverage raise concerns about compliance with religious freedom principles under the First Amendment and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993. Courts have emphasized the need for exemptions to be narrowly tailored to avoid burdening religious exercise. Religious exemptions for health benefits coverage are generally regarded as permissible but not required. The U.S. Supreme Court reinterpreted its standard in the 1990 decision, Employment Division v. Smith, stating that the Free Exercise Clause does not relieve individuals from complying with neutral laws. This lowered the constitutional baseline of protection. The U.S. Supreme Court's reinterpretation in the 1990 decision, Employment Division v. Smith, lowered the constitutional baseline of protection for religious exercise. Laws that do not specifically target religion are not subject to heightened review, making it less likely for religious groups to argue for constitutional protection from laws that incidentally burden their religious exercise. The Court has indicated that laws can interfere with religious practices, even if they cannot interfere with mere beliefs and opinions. The U.S. Supreme Court's 1990 decision in Employment Division v. Smith allowed the government to regulate actions based on religious beliefs but not the beliefs themselves. The Court upheld laws prohibiting behaviors that may be compelled by religious beliefs, such as polygamy, child labor, and drug laws. The Court's 1990 decision in Employment Division v. Smith established that religious exemptions are not required for actions that violate laws, such as controlled substances laws. Members of the Native American Church were fired for using peyote for religious purposes and challenged their ineligibility for benefits, but the Court ruled that free exercise of religion does not allow individuals to avoid complying with generally applicable laws. The 1990 decision in Employment Division v. Smith established that religious exemptions are not guaranteed for individuals with objections to generally applicable laws. The Court ruled that the government's enforcement of laws cannot depend on measuring the effects on a religious objector's spiritual development. The Court ruled in Employment Division v. Smith that religious exemptions are not guaranteed for individuals objecting to general laws. State courts in California and New York upheld requirements for contraceptive coverage, with exemptions for religious employers. The California Supreme Court upheld the law requiring contraceptive coverage, stating it was neutral towards religion and did not discriminate against the Catholic Church. Religious employers that objected to contraceptives were provided an exemption, including the Catholic Church. The California Supreme Court upheld a law requiring contraceptive coverage, stating it was neutral towards religion and did not discriminate against the Catholic Church. The New York Court of Appeals also supported this, explaining that religious exemptions do not render a statute non-neutral. Congress responded to a Supreme Court decision by enacting RFRA in 1993 to protect free exercise of religion. RFRA, enacted in 1993, reinstated heightened scrutiny for religious freedom. It requires a compelling governmental interest and least restrictive means for burdening religious exercise. Pre-Smith cases like United States v. Lee may offer insight on evaluating exemptions for contraceptive coverage. The Court in United States v. Lee recognized a burden on Lee's religious belief regarding paying FICA taxes but found it not sufficient to violate his free exercise rights. The government's interest in the social security system was deemed \"very high\" and mandatory participation was seen as crucial for its fiscal vitality. The Court in United States v. Lee upheld the burden on religious objectors to pay FICA taxes, citing the government's interest in maintaining a sound tax system. Providing accommodations for religious objectors was deemed impractical due to the complexities of administering various exceptions. Congress's narrow exemption for self-employed individuals with religious objections was considered sufficient, allowing them to avoid paying taxes towards the social security program. The Court recognized Congress' ability to expand accommodations for religious objectors through legislation, but held that the existing exemption was sufficient to avoid interfering with the government's interest in maintaining a functional tax system. Under a RFRA analysis, a court must find a compelling governmental interest for a legal challenge to the federal contraceptive coverage requirement, allowing the government to regulate the activity while burdening religion as narrowly as possible. This reinstatement of the compelling interest test may lead to more success for religious groups seeking protection. The compelling interest test allows religious groups to argue for protection from legal requirements conflicting with their beliefs, with courts recognizing public health and cost distribution as compelling interests. Laws promoting public health have been upheld by the Supreme Court as valid for protecting the welfare of the people. The right to practice religion freely does not include exposing the community to communicable diseases. The Supreme Court has recognized public health as a compelling state interest, prioritizing it over individual religious practices. This was evident in cases where the Court upheld laws promoting public health and ruled that government interests in health care funding outweigh individuals' religious freedoms. The Court's decisions indicate a recognition of public health as a paramount concern, even in challenges to state legislation mandating coverage of contraceptives. The California and New York courts recognized the government's interest in gender equity when mandating coverage of contraceptives. They highlighted the need to eliminate economic inequity between men and women in healthcare costs. The government must use the least restrictive means to achieve this interest for the requirement to be upheld. The government must use the least restrictive means to achieve its interest in mandating coverage of contraceptives, such as providing exemptions for individuals with religious objections. Accommodations should be made to balance free exercise of religion and public health protection. In Lee, the employer is not substantially burdened to trigger free exercise protections by requiring coverage of certain health services. If a religious employer objects to facilitating access to contraceptives, a court would likely recognize a substantial burden and proceed with the compelling interest analysis. Courts have upheld mandates related to public health without exemptions for conflicting religious beliefs. Courts have upheld mandates related to public health without exemptions for conflicting religious beliefs, citing that public health concerns outweigh the right to exercise one's religion without interference. State supreme courts have held that mandatory vaccination programs do not violate religious freedom. Exemptions may be required under RFRA if the government cannot show that uniform application of a requirement is necessary. The Court recognized the viability of a narrow exemption applied only to the self-employed under RFRA, as a broad exemption would undermine the government's ability to maintain the social security system. State courts considered strict scrutiny analysis when deciding related issues under state law, even though RFRA's requirements do not apply to state laws. The California Supreme Court and New York Court of Appeals have different views on religious exemptions for contraceptive coverage requirements. California's court believes a narrowly drawn exception is sufficient to accommodate religious burdens, while New York's court suggests that religious organizations hiring nonbelievers may not expect broad accommodations. Under religious exercise protections, courts have stated that Congress can include or broaden religious exemptions at its discretion. However, a religious exemption may violate the Establishment Clause if it favors one religion over another or religion over nonreligion. Special treatment for religious adherents through exemptions may be seen as preferential treatment. Exemptions limited to specific religions may violate the Establishment Clause, which prohibits preferential treatment based on religion. Legislation providing protection or exemption for a specific religious group is considered a violation. Generally available religious exemptions may also be seen as preferential treatment. The Establishment Clause prohibits preferential treatment based on religion, but some generally available religious exemptions have been upheld by the Supreme Court. For example, exemptions to prevent government interference with religious exercise have been allowed. State courts have upheld exemptions for some religious entities under the Establishment Clause regarding contraceptive coverage requirements. Employers who object to these requirements and do not qualify for an exemption may choose not to offer the coverage. While the ACA does not explicitly include enforcement tools, the requirement for preventive health services is incorporated into other laws. The requirement to provide preventive health services, including contraceptive coverage, under the ACA applies to group health plans established by employers. Non-compliance may lead to potential liability under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act for sex discrimination. ACA's insurance market reforms also apply to health insurance issuers providing group or individual health insurance coverage. The ACA's insurance market reforms, including preventive health services requirements, do not apply to \"grandfathered health plans\" established before March 23, 2010. Religious employers may be exempt from providing contraceptive services, and certain organizations with religious objections are not subject to enforcement actions. Penalties may apply to group health plans or health insurance issuers subject to ACA's insurance market reforms. The penalties for not providing health coverage in line with federal requirements under the ACA's insurance market reforms may be enforced through existing mechanisms in federal statutes such as ERISA, PHSA, and IRC. The type of penalty and enforcement entity would depend on the plan's subjectivity to these statutes. The enforcement of penalties for non-compliance with federal health coverage requirements under the ACA can be done through existing mechanisms in federal statutes like ERISA, PHSA, and IRC. These laws apply different health insurance standards to various types of private-sector health coverage, with ERISA regulating employer-provided health coverage, PHSA covering self-insured governmental plans and group health coverage, and IRC addressing employment-based group health plans. Each statute has its own enforcement mechanisms. The Secretaries of HHS, Labor, and Treasury have shared interpretive and enforcement authority under ACA, ERISA, and IRC. The Secretary of Labor can enforce ERISA against employers offering group health plans, but not against health insurance issuers. Section 502(a) of ERISA allows civil actions to enforce ERISA requirements, with remedies limited for successful plaintiffs. Section 502(a) of ERISA authorizes plaintiffs to bring actions against plans to recover benefits or enforce rights. If benefits are denied, plaintiffs can sue for unpaid benefits. ACA did not amend this section, so it could allow claims for violations of ACA provisions. For example, a plan participant could potentially bring a claim for contraceptive services not provided by a group health plan or insurance issuer. Prior to ACA, state and local governments could exempt their plans from certain PHSA requirements, but ACA changed this for federal health insurance standards. Enforcement differs for health insurance issuers and governmental plans, with HHS enforcing for non-federal governmental plans and states for health insurance issuers. The PHSA requires compliance with health insurance standards, with potential penalties for non-compliance. Failure to provide contraceptive services may trigger enforcement mechanisms, with penalties of up to $100 per day per individual for non-compliant health insurance issuers and governmental plans. Enforcement is carried out by HHS for non-federal governmental plans and states for health insurance issuers. Under the IRC, penalties may apply for non-compliance with group health plan requirements, with amounts based on the severity of the violation and previous compliance history. Penalties can be avoided if the violation was not known or promptly corrected. Failure to meet requirements results in an excise tax, paid by employers for single-employer plans and imposed on multiemployer plans. Under the IRC, penalties may apply for non-compliance with group health plan requirements. The excise tax is imposed on multiemployer plans for failures to comply, with penalties ranging from $100 per day to a minimum of $15,000 for violations considered more than de minimis. Certain limitations on the tax may apply if the failure was due to reasonable cause and corrected within a specified timeframe. Church plans are exempt from minimum excise tax requirements. Certain religious employers are exempt from the prohibition on religious discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. They may consider religion in employment decisions but cannot discriminate on other bases forbidden by Title VII. The Secretary has discretion to waive part or all of the excise tax for church plans if the failure is due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect. Religious organizations exempt from religious discrimination under Title VII can still violate the law by treating employees differently based on race, color, national origin, or sex. Once an organization hires an individual, it cannot discriminate based on religion in terms of employment conditions like compensation and benefits. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) found in 2000 that employers cannot discriminate against employees with different religious beliefs in providing wages or benefits. The EEOC found that an employer's decision to exclude prescription contraceptives from coverage violated Title VII by constituting sex discrimination. This decision applies only to the specific case before the Commission, with courts reaching different conclusions on the issue. Two federal district courts ruled that failing to provide coverage for prescription contraceptives in prescription drug plans violated Title VII's prohibition on sex discrimination. The EEOC found that excluding prescription contraceptives from coverage violated Title VII by constituting sex discrimination. Courts have differed in their interpretations, with some ruling in favor of the EEOC's decision while others, like the 8th Circuit, have found it unpersuasive. The court distinguished its case from the EEOC decision by ruling that an employer's health plan excluding all contraceptive services did not violate Title VII. Even if a religious employer qualifies for exemptions, they must still comply with Title VII's ban on sex discrimination. Employers may avoid liability under Title VII by omitting coverage for contraceptives altogether. The proposed legislation would amend section 2713 of the Public Health Service Act to exempt individuals and entities from requirements related to contraceptive or sterilization services if they have a religious objection. Bills have been introduced in the House and Senate to exempt those with religious objections from contraceptive coverage. The proposed legislation aims to exempt individuals and entities from providing contraceptive or sterilization services based on religious beliefs. The exemption is broad and applies regardless of religious affiliation or organizational purpose. Existing religious exemptions typically require certain characteristics to qualify, but the proposed exemption is more expansive, subject to congressional discretion. The proposed legislation aims to exempt individuals and entities from providing contraceptive or sterilization services based on religious beliefs, subject to congressional discretion. However, a broad exemption may allow an unintended range of employers to avoid compliance with coverage requirements, potentially imposing the religious beliefs of an employer on employees who do not share those beliefs. This could undermine the goals of the original legislation. The proposed legislation aims to exempt individuals and entities from providing contraceptive or sterilization services based on religious beliefs. This exemption could extend to a wide range of employers, potentially imposing the religious beliefs of an employer on employees. The proposed legislation would exempt individuals and entities from providing contraceptive or sterilization services based on religious beliefs. This exemption may extend to employers, potentially imposing their beliefs on employees. In the individual market, a health plan would not be required to cover prescription contraceptives if it goes against the religious beliefs or moral convictions of a family member covered under the policy. However, group health plans would need to show objection from the issuer or plan sponsor to be exempt from covering specific items or services. The Respect for Rights of Conscience Act would allow health plans to avoid coverage requirements for essential health benefits if it conflicts with their religious beliefs or moral convictions. This exemption could apply to both individual and group health plans. The Respect for Rights of Conscience Act allows health plans to decline coverage for items or services that conflict with religious beliefs or moral convictions. It also provides conscience protections for health care providers, allowing them to refuse to provide or refer for specific services. The Act includes a private right of action for enforcement in federal courts. The Respect for Rights of Conscience Act allows health plans to decline coverage for items or services conflicting with religious or moral beliefs. Financial consequences may apply if a health plan refuses to cover a required service based on objections. The Secretary of HHS can issue regulations to ensure equivalent coverage for plans excluding certain items. The Respect for Rights of Conscience Act allows health plans to refuse coverage for items conflicting with religious or moral beliefs. Religious exemptions have been enacted in various legislative mandates, including for contraceptive coverage. Section 1402(g)(1) of the IRC provides exemptions for individuals with religious objections to insurance coverage. The Respect for Rights of Conscience Act allows exemptions for individuals with religious objections to insurance coverage, including in employment decisions under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Supreme Court has not defined terms like religious corporation, association, educational institution, or society for tax exemption purposes. Lower courts consider factors like organization's purpose, ownership, requirements for staff and members, and religious practices to determine eligibility for exemption. The Supreme Court has not defined terms like religious corporation, association, educational institution, or society for tax exemption purposes. Lower courts consider factors like organization's purpose, ownership, requirements for staff and members, and religious practices to determine eligibility for exemption. Twenty-eight states have enacted laws requiring insurers to cover contraceptives, with varying approaches to exemptions based on religious or moral objections. In 28 states, laws mandate contraceptive coverage by insurers, with exemptions for religious or moral objections. Some states offer no explicit exemption, while others use a multi-pronged test for exempt religious entities. In 28 states, laws mandate contraceptive coverage by insurers, with exemptions for religious or moral objections. Eight states have varying criteria for religious exemptions, with some requiring all four prongs to be met, while others only require two or three criteria. In some states, exemptions for religious employers or entities are provided without a specific definition or test."
