    "content": "The potential for conflicting regulatory scope between federal statutes like FIFRA and the CWA, which regulate pesticides and water pollution, has raised concerns. Pesticides used for weed and pest control can have health and environmental impacts, including cancer and acute toxicity. Recent studies suggest that some pesticides can disrupt endocrine systems and affect reproduction in aquatic environments. Many pesticides do not have standards or guidelines, and current ones do not consider exposure to mixtures and seasonal pulses of high concentrations. U.S. Geological Survey surveys found that over half of sampled streams had pesticide concentrations exceeding EPA guidelines for aquatic life protection. Most water contamination occurs from pesticide mixtures, despite toxicity assessments being based on single contaminants in controlled experiments. The EPA's operating principle for over 30 years was that pesticides used according to FIFRA requirements did not need regulatory consideration under the Clean Water Act. However, recent challenges have arisen regarding the relationship between the two laws, with federal courts and EPA regulatory proceedings being battlegrounds. Congressional action is also testing the issues surrounding FIFRA-approved pesticides. The issue at hand is the regulation of FIFRA-approved pesticides sprayed over or into waters, and whether they require approval under a CWA permit. This issue arose from challenges to routine practices in the West and efforts to combat mosquito-borne illnesses. EPA tried to clarify the relationship between the two laws in a regulation issued. In 2006, a regulation was issued to address conflicts from judicial rulings, but was later vacated in 2009 by a federal appellate court. The issue of pesticides unintentionally impacting waterbodies through drift or migration remains unresolved. EPA's efforts to clarify policy, the 2006 rule, the 2009 court ruling, and options for addressing FIFRA-CWA issues are discussed. In response to the court ruling, EPA issued a pesticide general permit in 2011. The Pesticide General Permit (PGP) was renewed in 2016 in response to a court ruling. Despite efforts to streamline the permit, it remains controversial. FIFRA is a regulatory statute aimed at protecting human health and the environment from the adverse effects of pesticides by establishing a nationally uniform pesticide labeling system. Congress has considered legislation to nullify the court's ruling, but no action has been taken yet. EPA registers chemicals under FIFRA, evaluating risks and benefits based on scientific data. Approved uses and conditions are specified on product labels. Pesticides can be classified for general or restricted use. EPA aims to prevent unreasonable adverse effects on the environment. FIFRA preempts stricter state regulations on pesticide labeling but allows for more restrictive local conditions. It prohibits off-label pesticide use with civil and criminal penalties. States can enforce FIFRA provisions related to pesticide use. The CWA aims to maintain water quality by regulating waste and pollutant discharge. EPA enforces FIFRA, while states have primary authority for enforcement with adequate procedures. The Clean Water Act (CWA) regulates the discharge of pollutants into US waters through a permit system. Key factors in determining CWA applicability include point source discharge, discharge into US waters, and the definition of pollutants. The issue of whether pesticides are considered pollutants under the CWA has been a central point of debate. The Clean Water Act (CWA) defines pollutants as various substances discharged into water, regulated through the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permitting requirement. NPDES permits set limits on allowable pollutant discharge amounts and require monitoring to protect receiving waters. The Clean Water Act (CWA) regulates pollutants through the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits, which set limits on discharges and include monitoring requirements. States issue most NPDES permits, with EPA handling permits in some states. Enforcement actions for permit violations can include compliance orders, civil suits, and criminal penalties. The Clean Water Act (CWA) regulates pollutants through NPDES permits issued by states. Enforcement actions are primarily undertaken by states due to resource limitations. Citizen suits can be brought against violators. Recent lawsuits have challenged EPA's interpretation that CWA permits are not required for pesticide applications consistent with FIFRA. Five federal court cases since the late 1990s have tested the relationship between FIFRA and the CWA. The cases mainly focus on pesticide applications and whether CWA permits are required. The Ninth Circuit ruled that permits are needed for some pesticide activities, while the Second Circuit ruled differently in cases involving mosquito control. The Second Circuit ruled that trucks and helicopters discharging pesticides are point sources, but deferred permit requirements until EPA issues a CWA general permit. The first major case involved herbicide application in irrigation ditches, where the issue was whether pesticide application constitutes pollutant discharge. The Ninth Circuit endorsed the lower court's ruling that the pesticide was a pollutant under the CWA, but rejected the lower court's decision on CWA permit requirements. The appeals court ruled that a CWA permit is required for pesticide application, even if the pesticide has an EPA-approved FIFRA label. FIFRA and CWA serve different purposes, with FIFRA regulating pesticide labeling nationwide and CWA considering local environmental conditions for permit issuance. The court reversed a district court's decision regarding the need for a CWA permit for pesticide application, leading to states like California and Washington amending their rules to require NPDES permits. Oregon suggested obtaining state-issued permits to protect against lawsuits. Outside the Ninth Circuit, states continue their practice of not issuing permits for pesticide applicators. Another case involved a U.S. Forest Service aerial spray program in Oregon and Washington, which was challenged by environmental groups in a lawsuit. Environmental groups challenged a U.S. Forest Service aerial spraying program in Oregon and Washington, arguing that the Forest Service needed a CWA permit for aerial spraying. The appeals court ruled in favor of the environmental groups, requiring the Forest Service to obtain an NPDES permit and complete a revised EIS before further spraying. The court determined that the insecticides used in the spraying met the CWA definition of \"pollutant\" and that the spraying constituted point source pollution under the CWA. In September 2003, the EPA General Counsel issued a legal memorandum in response to the Forsgren case, disagreeing with the court's ruling within the Ninth Circuit. The memo stated that outside the Ninth Circuit, EPA would maintain its interpretation of FIFRA and the CWA. Within the Ninth Circuit, EPA would not agree to the ruling for materials other than pesticides or in cases where pesticides are not directly applied to waters of the United States. The third Ninth Circuit case involved the intentional application of the pesticide antimycin by the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks to remove non-native trout species from a river. The court ruled that no NPDES permit was required for the intentional application of the pesticide antimycin by the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks to remove non-native trout species from a river. The court determined that properly performing pesticides are not considered pollutants under the Clean Water Act. The court ruled that no NPDES permit was required for the intentional application of the pesticide antimycin by the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks to remove non-native trout species from a river. The court stated that EPA's interpretation of the CWA's definition of \"chemical waste\" in the context of intentionally applied pesticides is reasonable and not in conflict with Congress' intent. The appeals court remanded a case regarding spray drift and pesticide use to the district court for further development of the record. The court invited the EPA to offer its views broadly on policy and legal questions related to the regulation of pesticides under the CWA and FIFRA. Until the EPA articulates a clear interpretation of current law, the question of whether properly used pesticides can trigger the requirement for NPDES permits remains open. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed with a district court's ruling that FIFRA-compliant spraying did not require a CWA permit. The court held that trucks and helicopters were considered \"point sources\" and would need permits for lawful discharge. EPA's interpretation of the law in this situation would be helpful for the courts. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that permits were not required for certain activities until EPA issued a general permit in 2011. A mosquito abatement district in Idaho sought a CWA permit for pesticide spraying, but EPA declined based on its policy. The district then sued EPA to avoid citizen suit litigation. In Idaho, a mosquito abatement district sought a CWA permit for pesticide spraying. The federal court dismissed the case in 2005 as both parties agreed that no permit was needed for pesticide applications consistent with FIFRA. Citizen groups in other locations have threatened lawsuits for operations without CWA permits, such as against Maine blueberry farmers. The farmers decided to stop aerial spraying and switch to ground spraying in response to the litigation pressure. The Ninth Circuit rulings in the Talent and Forsgren cases caused concern among various stakeholders in the regulated community, including forestry, agriculture, and pesticide applicators, as well as public health officials. They feared that CWA permit requirements could be extended to activities not traditionally regulated under the CWA, leading to significant costs, operational difficulties, and delays for applicators. The EPA issued guidance documents in response to concerns about extending CWA permit requirements to pesticide applicators. Industry and states urged clarification on conflicts between CWA and FIFRA laws. EPA's guidance stated that pesticides applied according to FIFRA do not constitute chemical wastes or biological materials. EPA's guidance clarified that pesticides applied in accordance with FIFRA are not considered chemical wastes or biological materials under the CWA. However, pesticide applications that violate FIFRA, such as not following labeling requirements, would be subject to all relevant statutes, including the Clean Water Act. Environmental activists disagreed with EPA's stance, arguing that chemical and biological pesticides should be considered pollutants under the CWA. Environmentalists disagreed with EPA's stance on pesticides, arguing that FIFRA and the Clean Water Act must work together to prevent harm to aquatic life. They criticized EPA for focusing on FIFRA compliance rather than considering the water quality impact of pesticide applications. Critics also raised concerns about the lack of local water quality standards in the FIFRA registration process. Environmentalists argue that FIFRA's labeling system does not ensure local water quality standards are maintained or account for the effects of multiple pollutants. They believe the Clean Water Act is necessary for assessing the safety of pesticide discharge into specific water bodies and that FIFRA does not consider the lasting impact of pesticide residues on ecosystems. The EPA guidance on pollutant discharges under the CWA is welcomed by industry and agricultural groups, who request broader inclusion of applications like aquaculture. Some argue that CWA permits should not be required for pesticides that inadvertently impact waterbodies through drift. Many urge EPA to address these issues definitively through rulemaking to avoid citizen lawsuits and NPDES permit requirements. Several states and local agencies supported EPA's clarification of laws regarding pesticide applications, while some, particularly in the Ninth Circuit, disagreed. Oregon and California authorities suggested amending laws rather than creating exemptions. EPA proposed a rule in 2005 and finalized it in 2006 to exclude certain pesticide applications from NPDES permit requirements. In November 2006, EPA finalized a rule excluding certain pesticide applications from NPDES permit requirements if they comply with FIFRA. The rule allows for pesticide applications to control pests in or near waters of the United States without needing a permit, as long as the pesticides are not considered pollutants under the CWA. EPA acknowledged that residual materials may remain in U.S. waters after pesticide application. The EPA finalized a rule in 2006 excluding certain pesticide applications from NPDES permit requirements if they comply with FIFRA. The agency acknowledged that residual materials may remain in U.S. waters after pesticide application, which could be considered pollutants under the CWA at a later time. Despite this, EPA stated that the initial application of the pesticide does not require an NPDES permit as it is not considered a pollutant at the time of discharge into water. The agency also addressed criticisms of FIFRA's registration process, stating that regulatory and nonregulatory tools provide means of addressing water quality problems from pesticide use. Multiple lawsuits were filed in response to the 2006 rule by industry and environmental groups. The Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals consolidated litigation from environmental groups challenging a rule that treated pesticides applied in violation of FIFRA as pollutants. Industry argued the rule was arbitrary and sought to expand its scope. Environmentalists claimed EPA ignored Clean Water Act duties by exempting FIFRA-compliant pesticide applications. The court ruled on January 7, 2009, with EPA arguing that pesticides are nonpollutants at the time of discharge. The Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals rejected EPA's attempt to exempt residual and excess pesticides from Clean Water Act permits, stating that such an interpretation is unsupported by the law. The court emphasized that discharges that may be harmless initially but harmful later should still be subject to permitting requirements. The vacatur of the rule was initially set for April 9, 2009, but was delayed for two years to allow EPA to develop a regulatory response. The Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals rejected EPA's attempt to exempt residual and excess pesticides from Clean Water Act permits. The vacatur of the rule was delayed for two years to allow EPA to develop a regulatory response. Congressional interest in these issues became apparent after the ruling, with hearings focusing on implications for pesticide use and local governments' efforts to control mosquito-borne illnesses. The subcommittee's concern stems from conflicting practices in managing stormwater runoff regulated under the Clean Water Act. Stormwater management practices involve collecting water in retention ponds, basins, etc., while public health efforts aim to eliminate standing water to control insect-breeding habitats. One solution is to spray pesticides on standing water areas. The subcommittee is uncertain about the implications of litigation over CWA-FIFRA issues for communities and industries maintaining stormwater control systems. The EPA official acknowledged the new territory of CWA jurisdiction over pesticide spraying but believed there is no conflict between protecting water quality and preventing mosquito-borne disease. Some urged EPA to provide guidance to resolve uncertainties raised by court rulings. Another hearing in October 2004 discussed challenges in controlling West Nile Virus, with concerns that EPA's guidance did not fully resolve legal uncertainties and could not prevent citizen lawsuits. In a hearing, supporters urged EPA to settle legal questions through formal rulemaking to revise CWA rules. Even if EPA promulgated a rule, states could still require non-NPDES permits. In the 108th Congress, Senate appropriators called on EPA to finalize guidance by December 2004 and clarify the distinction between agriculture and silviculture activities needing CWA permits. In 2003, House and Senate Members urged the Bush Administration to support Supreme Court review of the Forsgren case regarding CWA permits for pesticides. The Administration did not endorse industry's request for a review, and the Court did not grant certiorari. In January 2009, the Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals rejected EPA's rationale for its 2006 rule on pesticide applications in waters of the United States, potentially leading to permit requirements for each application. The industry groups petitioned for a rehearing of the case by the full Sixth Circuit court, but the request was rejected. The federal government requested a two-year stay of the order vacating the exemption to develop a general permit for pesticide applications. State water pollution agencies supported the government's request, and the court granted the two-year delay. NPDES permits can be individual or general, with general permits being more efficient for large numbers of permittees. Both types are enforceable by the permitting authority and private citizens. EPA frequently issues general permits, such as the vessel general permit covering 69,000 vessels. Dischargers under a general permit typically submit a notice of intent, but this requirement can be modified. The EPA issued the pesticide general permit on October 31, 2011, covering approximately 5.6 million applications annually by 365,000 applicators. The permit includes activities such as mosquito control, aquatic weed control, and forest pest control, encompassing about 500 pesticide active ingredients. The EPA issued a pesticide general permit on October 31, 2011, covering various entities involved in pesticide use, including agricultural interests, pesticide manufacturers, mosquito control districts, utilities, and government agencies. Operators are required to minimize pesticide discharges to waters and prepare pesticide discharge management plans. Permittees must monitor their pest management practices. The EPA pesticide general permit issued in 2011 requires entities to minimize pesticide discharges to U.S. waters and prepare discharge management plans. The permit does not cover certain agricultural discharges exempt from CWA permitting and terrestrial pesticide applications. It is used as a model for states to develop their own permits and includes Endangered Species Act provisions. The EPA renewed the 2011 pesticide general permit for another five years on October 25, 2016. The renewed permit includes electronic notification requirements and a provision to consider adverse effects on certain species. It is effective in the same areas as the 2011 permit. The EPA renewed the 2011 pesticide general permit for another five years on October 25, 2016. States will issue their own NPDES permits for pesticide discharges, either by adopting EPA's general permit or adapting it. One issue EPA could address separately is pesticide drift, which can affect health, the environment, and nearby crops. EPA was awaiting advice from a workgroup of its Pesticide Program Dialogue Committee established in 1995. The EPA established the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA) to oversee federal advisory committees for impartial expertise. In 2006, a Spray Drift Workgroup studied pesticide drift's impact on water quality and wildlife, leading to proposed pesticide label changes in 2009. EPA also issued guidance on pesticide spray drift evaluation and announced a Drift Reduction Technology program in 2014. In 2014, EPA introduced a voluntary Drift Reduction Technology program for spraying devices to reduce spray drift. Environmentalists have criticized EPA's risk review procedures for not considering synergistic and additive effects of pesticides. EPA convened a task force in 2003 to assess if pesticide review processes meet water quality standards. The EPA convened a task force in 2003 to assess pesticide review processes for water quality standards. Changes to FIFRA implementation may result from the review, aiming to harmonize methods for ecological assessment of pesticide chemicals' water quality risks. White papers are being developed to bridge the gap between CWA and FIFRA approaches to pesticide risk assessment. Legislation was debated regarding the need for permits for pesticide discharge under the Clean Water Act. Some argued that existing laws were clear enough, while others pushed for new legislation to clarify the issue. Despite concerns about environmental impact, bills were introduced in Congress to exempt certain pesticide spraying activities from permit requirements. The proposed bills in Congress (H.R. 1749 and S. 1269) aimed to exempt certain pesticide use from needing NPDES permits, including FIFRA-approved pesticides, fire retardants, biological organisms for pest control, and silviculture activities. This legislation was in response to concerns about the need for permits for pesticide discharge under the Clean Water Act. The proposed legislation in the 109th Congress aimed to address various circumstances related to pesticide use and Clean Water Act permits. Witnesses from different sectors supported the legislation to resolve legal uncertainties about permitting, while the EPA's proposed rulemaking aimed to clarify the relationship between FIFRA and the CWA. The EPA official appreciated congressional efforts to reduce confusion over permitting requirements under FIFRA and the CWA. Legislation introduced in the 111th Congress aimed to clarify these issues by amending FIFRA, unlike earlier bills that focused on amending the CWA. The new bills did not exempt certain chemicals or activities from permit requirements. The 111th Congress introduced legislation to clarify permitting requirements under FIFRA and the CWA. The bills aimed to exempt FIFRA-authorized activities from various permit requirements, including those under federal environmental laws, non-environmental permits, and state or local laws. Another bill, H.R. 6273, sought to nullify a 2009 federal court ruling but was narrower in scope. The 112th Congress revisited the controversy surrounding the Pesticide General Permit (PGP), which critics argue duplicates requirements of the Clean Water Act (CWA) and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). Despite EPA's assertion that many farms do not need CWA permits for pesticide applications, water quality officials in some states have seen little benefit from the permit. The Pesticide General Permit (PGP) has been controversial in the agriculture community. Draft legislation (H.R. 872) aimed to overturn a ruling that would amend FIFRA and the CWA to exempt pesticide discharge from needing a permit, with some exceptions. The bill was passed by the House in March 2011. The House passed H.R. 872 on March 31, 2011, by a vote of 292-130. The Senate Committee approved the bill in June 2011. Related bills in the 112th Congress included S. 3605 and S. 718. In July 2012, the House Agriculture Committee ordered reported the 2012 farm bill (H.R. 6083). The 2012 farm bill (H.R. 6083) included a provision similar to H.R. 872, which was passed by the House but not included in the Senate's version (S. 3240). Legislation to nullify a 2009 federal court ruling was introduced in the 113th Congress (H.R. 935, S. 175, S. 802). H.R. 935 was passed by the House in 2014 and included in the 2013 farm bill (H.R. 2642), but not in the Senate's version (S. 954). The 2014 farm bill, enacted in February 2014, did not include similar provisions. The 2014 farm bill (the Agricultural Act of 2014, P.L. 113-79) did not include a provision to overturn the Sixth Circuit ruling on PGP requirements. Critics argue that the permit's CWA requirements are duplicative of FIFRA and burdensome, while supporters claim the laws are different and necessary for evaluating pesticides' impacts. EPA officials have stated no issues with the permit or active litigation related to the PGP. In the 114th Congress, legislation was introduced to overturn requirements for the PGP, with the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee approving S. 1500 on August 5, 2015. This bill aimed to clarify congressional intent on regulating pesticide use near U.S. waters and required EPA to report to Congress on coordinating efforts between water quality and pesticides offices for analyzing water quality impacts. The Senate Environment Committee approved legislation to analyze water quality impacts of pesticides and pesticide registration actions. The House also passed a similar bill to reduce regulatory burdens for public health agencies spraying pesticides for disease-carrying vectors. The legislation passed by the House, known as the Zika Vector Control Act, would relax pesticide standards, potentially threatening waterbodies. It includes a sunset provision expiring on September 30, 2018. A separate Senate bill, the Zika Response and Regulatory Relief Act, proposes a 180-day waiver of pesticide reporting requirements for public health mosquito control. Additionally, a bill providing $1.1 billion for Zika virus control was passed by the House on June 23, 2016. The House passed a bill providing $1.1 billion in Zika funding and other appropriations (H.R. 2577) on June 23, 2016. The Senate failed to approve the legislation due to controversies over provisions, including a temporary waiver for mosquito control. A 10-week continuing resolution was passed on September 28, 2016, extending funding until December 9, 2016 (P.L. 114-223). The bill passed on December 9, 2016 (P.L. 114-223) included Zika funding but did not waive requirements of the PGP. A second resolution extended funding until April 28, 2017 (P.L. 114-254) with no impact on the PGP."
