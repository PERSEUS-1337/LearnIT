The Act \"Community Choice for Electricity Act of 1999\" defines key terms related to retail electricity aggregation, electric utility franchise, municipal electric utility, and opt-out aggregation plan. The Act \"Community Choice for Electricity Act of 1999\" defines key terms related to retail electricity aggregation, including retail electric consumers, rural electric cooperatives, and States. The Act \"Community Choice for Electricity Act of 1999\" defines key terms related to retail electricity aggregation, including islands, Indian tribes, State regulatory authority, and suppliers of electric energy. SEC. 3. FINDINGS. Congress finds that many States are deregulating retail sales of electricity to benefit all customers, but large industrial and commercial customers are currently getting the best deals. It is expected that most residential customers will stick with their current supplier, and finding a new supplier can be difficult and time-consuming for all customers, especially residential and small businesses. Community choice aggregation allows local governments to negotiate electricity contracts on behalf of all citizens within their boundaries, providing the option to opt out for those who prefer to choose their own suppliers. This benefits all consumers, including large customers who can still receive price differentiation based on their usage. Local governments can negotiate electricity contracts for all citizens within their boundaries, ensuring accountability through various laws. This allows all customers to benefit from diverse electric load options, unlike other retail suppliers who target profitable customers. In deregulated states, citizens should use public processes to decide if local governments can act as nonprofit aggregators for their communities. In states with franchise powers for electricity, local governments should be able to exercise community choice through their franchise. SEC. 4 allows a group of customers or entity to collectively purchase retail electric energy if served by local distribution companies under retail competition. SEC. 5 introduces COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATION under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978. Community Choice Aggregation allows local government units to act as agents for retail electric consumers in purchasing electric energy on an aggregate basis, subject to approval by vote. The government has approved the aggregation of electric energy purchases through a vote of its governing body or citizens. Local governments must also approve this aggregation through a vote. Participation in the aggregation is not mandatory for retail electric consumers within the political subdivision. Retail electric consumers can opt out of participating in the aggregation of electric energy purchases and buy from other suppliers or aggregators. State regulatory authorities must cooperate with local governments to ensure compliance with this rule and establish guidelines for community choice electricity aggregators. Local governments retain their powers to procure competitive energy services under existing laws and practices. Each State allowing retail electric consumers to choose suppliers must also permit local governments serving as community choice aggregators to collect and use funds for renewable energy or energy efficiency programs, subject to state regulator approval. The Federal Power Act exempts local governments aggregating electric load from being considered utilities engaging in wholesale electricity transactions. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission can enforce compliance with this provision against states. Other laws may still allow local governments to aggregate electric load differently. SEC. 6. FRANCHISES. Any State deregulating retail electricity sales must allow local governments to grant franchises through competitive bidding authorized by consumers. SEC. 7. EXCLUSIONS. SEC. 7. EXCLUSIONS. Municipal electric utilities and rural electric cooperatives not participating in retail electric competition are exempt from sections 4, 5, and 6 of this Act. States with existing retail competition laws are also excluded from these sections regarding opt-out aggregation plans. SEC. 8. SEPARABILITY. SEC. 8. SEPARABILITY. If any provision of this Act is held invalid, the rest of the Act shall not be affected."
