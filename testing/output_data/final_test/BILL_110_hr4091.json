    "content": "The \"Adoption Equality Act of 2007\" is the short title of this Act. Congress finds that the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 prioritizes a child's health and safety, leading to incentives for adoptions. Despite progress, there are still over 115,000 children in foster care waiting to be adopted. Some States limit services for special needs adopted children. Special needs adopted children may not receive adoption assistance under the Social Security Act, discriminating against them based on the financial status of adults who are no longer their legal parents. These children require federal financial assistance for healing from past abuse and neglect. SEC. 3. PROMOTION OF ADOPTION OF CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS. Section 473(a)(2) of the Social Security Act is amended to include criteria for a child to meet requirements for paragraph (1)(B)(ii), such as being in the care of a public or licensed private child placement agency, meeting medical or disability requirements for supplemental security income benefits, or residing in a foster family home. The amended Social Security Act includes criteria for a child to qualify as a child with special needs for adoption, such as being in foster care or meeting medical requirements for income benefits. A child who is lawfully present in the United States and meets specific requirements will be treated as meeting adoption assistance eligibility criteria. This includes children previously eligible for adoption assistance payments whose prior adoptions have been dissolved or whose adoptive parents have passed away. The paragraph discusses exceptions to adoption assistance payments for special needs children who are not citizens or residents of the United States and were adopted internationally. It also allows payments for children in foster care after a failed adoption. The paragraph discusses the determination of a child with special needs for adoption assistance payments, based on criteria set by the State. The Congress believes that states should reinvest savings from this Act into child welfare programs. Effective date is specified. The amendments made by this Act will take effect on October 1, 2008, applying to adoption assistance agreements and payments under part E of title IV of the Social Security Act starting from that date. If State legislation is needed for a State plan to meet the new requirements, a delay is permitted until the 1st day of the 1st calendar quarter after the first regular session of the Congress. The Act will take effect on October 1, 2008, and applies to adoption assistance agreements and payments under part E of title IV of the Social Security Act. State legislation may be delayed until the 1st calendar quarter after the first regular session of the State legislature."
