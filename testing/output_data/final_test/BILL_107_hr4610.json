    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Urban Watershed Model Restoration Act\". It includes a pilot program for the restoration and protection of the Anacostia River watershed. The Administrator of the EPA will develop a pilot program in the Anacostia River watershed to demonstrate methods for urban watershed restoration and community redevelopment, focusing on water quality objectives and reducing environmental health risks. The Administrator will integrate EPA programs with other government programs, support monitoring efforts, develop environmental indicators, and provide grants to community groups and nonprofit organizations. The Administrator will work with local community groups and nonprofit organizations to involve the community in decision-making, set measurable restoration goals, maintain annual program plans with public input, educate school children and community groups on environmental resources, develop consensus strategies for watershed restoration, and collaborate with other Federal, State, and local groups on critical issues. The pilot program aims to demonstrate new technologies and approaches for stormwater management, urban habitat improvement, and toxics reduction in the watershed. Federal agencies will implement on-the-ground projects for restoration that can be replicated nationally. The Administrator may set aside funds for challenge grants under the pilot program, with the EPA covering at least 75% of project costs. In-kind contributions can make up the remaining share of costs.
