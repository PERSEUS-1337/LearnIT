    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Meth Exposure to the Home Disclosure Act\" or the \"METH Disclosure Act\". Congress finds that there has been a significant increase in methamphetamine laboratory incidents in the United States since 2007. Additionally, only a small percentage of homes used to make methamphetamine are disclosed, leading to environmental contamination. Toxic waste residue from methamphetamine production can linger in buildings for years if not cleaned properly. Harmful by-products like propane, lithium, and solvents can have lasting negative effects on families and children. Contact with these substances can lead to various health issues, including respiratory problems, birth defects, and reproductive issues. Acetone can be fatal, while chronic inhalation of hexane can cause severe damage. Inhalation of hexane can cause damage to the central nervous system, while benzene by-product is linked to anemia and leukemia. Testing for methamphetamine and its harmful by-products is simple and inexpensive. Cleaning a building affected by methamphetamine can cost up to $10,000, posing a financial burden. A law requiring landlords to disclose methamphetamine usage could prevent lethal exposure to millions in the US. The Federal Government needs to take action to protect the health and financial stability of the people in the United States from potentially lethal circumstances. SEC. 3.
