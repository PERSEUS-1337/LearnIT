    "content": "The report discusses potential issues for Congress on port security, emphasizing the vulnerability of U.S. ports to terrorist attacks. Government leaders and security experts are concerned about the potential smuggling of dangerous materials into the country through the maritime transportation system. Port security legislation can have significant implications for public safety, the war on terrorism, and the economy. Experts are concerned about potential terrorist attacks on U.S. ports, which could disrupt global maritime commerce. In response, Congress passed the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 and the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2004 to enhance port security measures. The Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 and the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2004 were passed to improve port security. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 implemented recommendations for maritime transportation security. There are concerns about the adequacy of current port security efforts, with gaps still remaining despite initiatives by the Coast Guard and CBP. The U.S. maritime system consists of over 300 ports with thousands of terminals and harbor channels. The U.S. maritime system consists of over 300 ports with thousands of terminals and harbor channels. Transportation firms concentrate traffic through major cargo hubs due to high infrastructure costs. The top 50 ports handle 90% of cargo tonnage, with 25 ports managing 98% of container shipments. Energy products are concentrated at specific ports, like one area in California handling a quarter of imported crude oil. In 2003, 6,000 commercial ships made 60,000 port calls in the U.S., mostly foreign-owned and crewed. Container ships are a growing segment of maritime commerce, drawing attention to seaport security. Container ships are a significant focus of seaport security, carrying marine containers with various goods. These containers, similar to truck trailers, are typically 8 x 8 x 20 feet or 8 x 8 x 40 feet in size. Once offloaded, they are transported inland by rail cars, tractor-trailers, or barges. Container ships carry high-value cargo, accounting for 66% of the total value of U.S. maritime overseas trade. The estimated global inventory of containers is around 12 million, with containerized imports mainly consisting of consumer goods like clothing, electronics, and toys. Imports are dominated by consumer goods like clothing, shoes, electronics, and toys, while U.S. automakers import parts in containers. Containerized exports consist of wastepaper, forest products, chemicals, and agricultural products. Over 9 million cargo containers enter U.S. sea ports annually, with CBP analyzing manifest information to target containers for inspection. Ships carry 80% of world trade by volume, highlighting their economic importance. The United States is a leading maritime trading nation, accounting for nearly 20% of world ocean-borne overseas trade. Trade now makes up 25% of the U.S. GDP, with the total volume of trade expected to double in the next two decades. Disruptions to maritime trade can have significant economic impacts, with port closures on the West Coast costing the U.S. economy approximately $1 billion per day. The container shipping system is designed for speed and efficiency. The container shipping system is crucial for the global, low-inventory distribution model adopted by many manufacturers in the United States. Lean inventories have led to a drop in business logistics costs, contributing to increased productivity. Experts emphasize the importance of a highly efficient maritime transportation system for the U.S. and global economy. Increased security measures at seaports have both benefits and costs. Resources allocated to seaport security can reduce various risks such as cargo theft, smuggling, and trade law violations. Improved planning for terrorist attacks can also enhance responses to other emergencies. New technologies like electronic seals and tracking devices aim to make sea containers more secure. The marine transportation system is crucial for national security, with 17 U.S. seaports designated as strategic for military deployment. During Desert Storm, 90% of military equipment and supplies were shipped from U.S. seaports. The CBP is developing the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) to evaluate cargo manifest information for high-risk shipments and expedite customs filing for U.S. importers. During Desert Storm, 90% of military equipment and supplies were shipped from U.S. strategic ports, requiring over 312 vessels from 18 ports. Security experts are concerned about terrorist threats at U.S. ports, including smuggling weapons in cargo containers and using commercial ships as weapons. Terrorist threats at U.S. ports include attacking bridges, refineries, cargo ships, oil tankers, ferries, cruiseships, and U.S. Navy ships to cause disruption, environmental damage, and harm to military personnel. Terrorist threats at ports involve attacks on bridges, refineries, and port facilities. Examples include the 2002 attack on the French oil tanker Limberg, the 2001 arrest of a Canadian citizen with high-tech equipment in an Italian port, and the 2000 bombing of the U.S. Navy destroyer Cole in Yemen. In 1985, terrorists seized the cruise ship Achille Lauro in the Mediterranean, holding passengers hostage and killing one. Concern is high about the potential threat of smuggling a nuclear weapon in a sea container into the United States, which could result in catastrophic casualties and global trade disruption if detonated in a port. Port areas and ships are vulnerable to terrorist attacks due to large perimeters to secure and proximity to urban areas, with the movement of trucks providing potential points of entry for terrorists. Port areas and ships are vulnerable to terrorist attacks due to the ease of entry for terrorists using trucks or boats. Commercial cargo ships in ports are stationary and easy to intercept, making them vulnerable to seizure by armed individuals. Pirate attacks on cargo ships have increased, with most attacks occurring while the ship is in port. U.S. shippers may also be at risk, as some experts believe there is a link between pirate attacks and foreign-flag freighters. Some experts believe piracy may be linked to terrorism, as pirates may raise money to finance terrorist operations. The lack of transparency in ship registration allows for anonymity, enabling terrorists to remain hidden while being involved in the operation of their vessels. Unscrupulous ship owners can hide their identity by re-registering vessels under fake names and flags of convenience. U.S. intelligence suspects 15 cargo ships have ties to al Qaeda. Containerized shipments pose challenges in ensuring cargo integrity due to the complex loading process involving multiple companies. Ships carry cargo for multiple companies, generating numerous documents. Each shipment involves various parties like exporters, importers, freight forwarders, and transportation providers. Security at transfer points is crucial for shipment safety. Not all U.S.-bound containers reach U.S. ports. Many containers discharged at the Port of Montreal are transported by truck or rail to cities in the northeastern or mid-western United States. Security experts warn about the potential for terrorists to use containers to smuggle weapons of mass destruction into the U.S. Drug smugglers also exploit legitimate cargo to conceal contraband. The Coast Guard and CBP are experienced in combating drug smuggling but recognize the different threat posed by terrorism. The Coast Guard and CBP focus on finding smuggling methods for drug shipments, looking for patterns of operation among smugglers. Terrorists, however, are more likely to use a method of attack only once for a specific operation. The consequences of failing to intercept illegal drugs or weapons of mass destruction at seaports are significant. Improving port security is challenging due to the large volume of cargo and the potential risks involved. The challenges in improving port security are evident in the high annual estimate of cargo theft, with much of it believed to occur in or near seaports by the FBI. Understanding the governance and operation of seaports is crucial in enhancing security, as the governing structure varies between federal, state, and local levels. Examples include bi-state or regional ports like the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Ports can be structured as bi-state or regional agencies, like the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. They can operate as landlord ports, providing basic services while tenants handle most activities, or as operating ports, handling most activities themselves. Some ports have their own police forces and finance infrastructure improvements through various means such as taxes, operating revenues, bonds, trust funds, or loan guarantees. Federal agencies involved in port security include the Coast Guard, CBP, TSA, and MARAD, all housed in the Department of Homeland Security. The Coast Guard is the primary maritime law enforcement authority responsible for evaluating, boarding, and inspecting commercial ships, countering terrorist threats in ports, and protecting U.S. Navy ships. The Coast Guard is responsible for port security and protecting U.S. Navy ships in ports. The Captain of the Port oversees security and safety in their geographic zone. The Bureau of Customs and Border Protection inspects cargoes and ship crews in U.S. ports. The CBP was established to combine customs and immigration functions at U.S. borders. The TSA is responsible for transportation security across all modes. MARAD supports the U.S. commercial maritime industry and publishes reports on port security. The Coast Guard, in response to 9/11, plays a key role in port security. In response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the Coast Guard implemented a large port-security operation, diverting resources to patrol U.S. ports and coastal waters. They established security zones around key facilities and began inspecting high-interest vessels. The Coast Guard and CBP aimed to enhance the quality and timing of information from shippers and carriers to assess terrorist risks. This effort seeks to improve federal authorities' ability to identify potential threats in the marine environment. In response to the 9/11 attacks, the Coast Guard implemented port-security measures to enhance federal authorities' ability to identify potential threats in the marine environment. This includes new reporting requirements for ships entering and leaving U.S. harbors, extending the Notice of Arrival to 96 hours, and developing maritime domain awareness to prevent terrorist threats through actionable knowledge. The Coast Guard is expanding vessel tracking systems and modernizing its fleet as part of the MDA effort. The Bureau of Customs and Border Protection has implemented programs like CSI and C-TPAT to counter terrorist threats, including pre-screening U.S.-bound containers. The Bureau of Customs and Border Protection has implemented programs like CSI and C-TPAT to counter terrorist threats by requiring ocean shipment information to be transmitted 24 hours before loading onto a U.S.-bound vessel. This allows for more efficient evaluation of container shipments for terrorism risks. C-TPAT offers importers expedited processing if they comply with CBP guidelines for securing their supply chain. Businesses participating in the program must conduct a self-assessment of their supply chain and submit a questionnaire to CBP. If certified, they may have fewer cargo inspections, reducing shipment delays. The Transportation Security Administration and CBP are running the Operation Safe Commerce pilot project to verify container contents, ensure container integrity, and track movement from origin to destination. Smart container devices are being developed for real-time location tracking and tampering alerts. The challenge is developing a device for real-time location tracking and container tampering alerts in the harsh ocean environment. TSA is field-testing a TWIC for transportation workers to control access to secure areas. MARAD, along with the Coast Guard, CBP, and TSA, is part of the Container Working Group to ensure the security of marine container transportation. International Institutions, such as the Group of Eight Nations, have also identified the importance of maritime security. In June 2002, the IMO and the World Customs Organization were identified by the Group of Eight Nations to improve maritime security. The IMO adopted the ISPS Code in December 2002 to enhance maritime security, with member governments required to implement the regulations by July 1, 2004. The WCO aims to simplify customs procedures for cross-border trade, with 164 countries as members. The WCO created a task force in June 2002 to draft a \"Resolution on Security and Facilitation of the International Supply Chain,\" completed in June 2003. In May 2005, the WCO issued its Framework of Standards to Secure and Facilitate Global Trade, requiring advance electronic reporting of cargo and shipper data. The bill creating the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was passed in November 2002, incorporating the Coast Guard, former Customs Service, and TSA. The Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 was passed in November 2002, creating a U.S. maritime security system. The Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 establishes a U.S. maritime security system, requiring federal agencies, ports, and vessel owners to upgrade security measures. It mandates the development of national and regional maritime transportation security plans by the Coast Guard, as well as security and incident response plans for ports, terminals, and certain vessels. The act also authorizes CBP to collect cargo manifest information electronically and allocates funds for research and development in cargo inspection and nuclear material detection. The Trade Act of 2002 (P.L. 107-210) and the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-293) were enacted to enhance port security and maritime transportation. These acts include provisions for electronic transmission of cargo information to CBP and the development of a maritime intelligence system. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-458) passed by Congress in December 2004 imposes urgency on DHS efforts to strengthen maritime security. It includes requirements for a maritime security grant program, implementation of joint operational centers at U.S. ports, investigation of sensors for tracking marine containers, and reporting on vessel and container inspections. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-458) imposes deadlines on DHS for strengthening maritime security, including a national maritime security plan by April 1, 2005, facility and vessel vulnerability assessments by December 31, 2004, and deployment plans for TWIC. Congress is concerned about the adequacy of MTSA requirements and has introduced their own maritime security legislation. Congress is debating further port security legislation and funding for port authorities and border agencies. There are concerns about the urgency of addressing maritime security threats, with seaports still vulnerable to terrorist attacks. A recent GAO report identified seaports, air cargo, general aviation, and mass transit as major vulnerabilities in the transportation system. Despite progress, an effective port security environment may be years away. While CSI, C-TPAT, OSC, and MDA are seen as important strategies for maritime security, they are considered only a framework with significant gaps in security. Experts believe these initiatives have not sufficiently reduced the vulnerability of cargo containers to terrorism. Congress is evaluating the effectiveness and pace of these programs in addressing the terrorist threat and providing resources for security initiatives. Some observers and Members of Congress are concerned about the slow pace of initiatives to improve port security, including the credentialing of transportation workers and the development of a \"smart-box\" for container shipments. There are debates over the adequacy of security funding for seaports compared to airports. However, some argue that current efforts to enhance port security are progressing rapidly, citing new international port security measures agreed upon by the IMO and the timely implementation of MTSA by the Coast Guard. Operation Liberty Shield showcased the capabilities of the Coast Guard and CBP. During Operation Liberty Shield, the Coast Guard and CBP demonstrated their ability to rapidly intensify port security operations. The unresolved debate over how to pay for port security is stalling efforts to improve security, with estimated costs of $1.5 billion for the first year and $7.3 billion over the succeeding decade. Congress has provided over $650 million in federal grants to ports for security improvements. Advocates argue for increased federal funds for port security, citing inadequacy compared to airports. Senator Hollings proposed user fees on ship cargo to finance security upgrades, but faced opposition labeling it as a tax. Advocates propose user fees on ship cargo to fund port security, arguing it's a more reliable funding source than annual appropriations. They suggest creating a port security trust fund to ensure fees are solely used for security purposes. Advocates propose user fees on ship cargo to fund port security, arguing it's a more reliable funding source than annual appropriations. They suggest creating a port security trust fund to ensure fees are solely used for security purposes. Congress is interested in allocating resources appropriately to ports based on vulnerability criteria such as economic importance and proximity to sensitive areas. The 9/11 Commission criticized the TSA for lacking a strategic plan to allocate limited resources effectively. The Inspector General of the DHS criticized port security grant award decisions and recommended improvements. Resources for improving security at foreign ports, especially in developing countries, are a concern. The IMO has proposed a Maritime Security Trust Fund to support strengthening maritime security infrastructure in developing countries. Security experts argue that achieving perfect maritime security would require shutting down the transportation system. The issue for Congress is how to increase port security while minimizing economic impacts. Significant gaps in maritime security include credibility problems with container loading and screening overseas. Point of origin cargo security is crucial to prevent terrorist events. Inspecting cargo on the high seas is difficult, and waiting until it arrives at a U.S. port may be too late. Ensuring the integrity of U.S. bound cargo at its overseas point of origin is a critical challenge in supply chain security. Congress is examining the effectiveness of C-TPAT, CSI, and OSC programs in verifying cargo legitimacy and preventing fraudulent information. The GAO found shortcomings in the implementation of CSI and C-TPAT programs. Key issues include verifying cargo legitimacy, using \"smart box\" devices for container integrity, and improving cargo manifest information for CBP targeting. The GAO found shortcomings in the implementation of the CSI and C-TPAT programs, including reduced scrutiny of certified participants' cargo and lack of inspection of targeted containers at overseas loading ports. CBP has taken corrective action to address some of these flaws. Additionally, the Coast Guard is required to report on foreign-flag vessels calling at U.S. ports, especially those with unclear ownership histories, to improve transparency in international shipping regulation. In December 2002, the IMO adopted stricter international standards for vessel and port security. Congress may assess the effectiveness of Coast Guard and international efforts in enhancing ship operator security. Critics argue that the new regulations may only give the appearance of increased security, especially in \"flag of convenience\" countries. The United States enforces its standards when inspecting arriving ships, but there is concern about the lack of a pre-screening system for sub-standard shipping. In the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, experts emphasize the need for an international maritime security regime with multiple layers of defense to prevent dangerous items from entering the maritime transportation network. The first line of defense should be at the overseas point of origin to avoid potential threats like nuclear weapons or dirty bombs reaching U.S. seaports undetected. International port security standards are also under scrutiny for inclusion in this security framework. The United States is considering including international port security standards in trade agreements. Congress is debating whether to establish common standards for all seaports or use a tailored approach for each port's specific needs. Some argue for uniform security measures across seaports, while others emphasize the importance of site-specific security measures due to the diverse characteristics of each port. Port authorities aim to strike a balance between standardized and port-specific security regulations. Ports seek uniform security requirements to retain customers, but also want flexibility to avoid wasting resources on irrelevant benchmarks. Implementing security cards for port workers raises questions about disqualifications. MTSA requires a transportation security card for port workers to enhance security infrastructure and ensure trustworthiness. The USA PATRIOT Act requires background checks for truckers carrying hazardous materials. The TSA is developing a \"Transportation Worker Identification Credential\" Program to limit access to secure areas in the transportation network. Tampa's port faces challenges in implementing security measures due to its diverse workforce. The Tampa port's major employers hire workers for short-term projects, some with criminal records. New state requirements for background checks could restrict access to restricted areas. Policymakers are concerned about assigning roles for maritime security among federal, state, and local agencies, and private industry to prevent overlap and conflicting regulations. The maritime trade community must perceive federal agencies working together to prevent overlap and conflicting regulations. Intelligence sharing is crucial for detecting terrorist activity in the vast amount of global cargo, requiring precise intelligence for interception. Timely information-sharing in surface transportation is hindered by the lack of standard protocols among government agencies and private entities. One barrier to effective intelligence sharing with local port authorities may be the lack of security clearances for state and local government officials. The role of the private sector in enhancing maritime security is a key policy question for Congress, with concerns about businesses prioritizing profits over security. Tightening control over maritime commerce requires embedding security into everyday business processes, with programs like CBP's C-TPAT enlisting companies in international container shipments. Congress may evaluate the effectiveness of such programs in ensuring due diligence. Congress may evaluate the effectiveness of the C-TPAT program in ensuring due diligence of maritime traders long-term. Policymakers may consider a \"trust but verify\" approach with regular CBP security audits. Proposed legislation in the 109th Congress includes creating a pilot program for sealing empty containers, amending the criminal code for terrorist-related acts in the marine environment, and authorizing federal port security grants. In the 109th Congress, various bills were introduced to enhance port security, including creating a federal database for cargo crime data collection, authorizing port security grants from Customs import duties, and implementing measures to ensure maritime security such as radiation detection equipment deployment and intermodal shipping container security strategy development. Several bills introduced in the 109th Congress aimed to enhance port security, including requirements for \"smart box\" technology on imported containers, increased penalties for maritime crimes, a Caribbean Basin Port Security Assistance Program, establishment of joint harbor operational centers, and measures to improve container inspection and security. The 109th Congress introduced bills to enhance port security, including \"smart box\" technology on containers, increased penalties for maritime crimes, a Caribbean Basin Port Security Assistance Program, joint harbor operational centers, and measures for container inspection and security. Additionally, a plan for random container inspections and a study on creating a user fee for port security funding were proposed by DHS."
