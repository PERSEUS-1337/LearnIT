The stability and security of Taiwan and the balance of power in the Taiwan Strait are crucial for peace in the Asia-Pacific region. China's military modernization poses a threat with advanced missiles. Lack of transparency in China's military infrastructure is concerning. The People's Liberation Army's modernization efforts, including missile programs, could lead to regional instability and threaten US national security. In 1996, they conducted military exercises near Taiwan, launching nuclear-capable ballistic missiles. In March 1996, People's Liberation Army military activities near Taiwan's ports created a de facto blockade of the Taiwan Strait, interfering with US and international shipping and aviation. This prompted the immediate deployment of two US aircraft carrier battle groups to the South China Sea. The PLA's actions were seen as deliberate attempts to disrupt Taiwan's stability and intimidate its people before their first democratic presidential election. The early development and deployment of an effective United States theater missile defense system to the Asia-Pacific region, including Taiwan and its surrounding islands, would be a prudent response to the military threat posed by China's advanced missile development and their refusal to renounce the use of force against Taiwan. The Government of China intends to use military exercises and missile tests as coercive diplomacy against Taiwan. Deploying a US anti-ballistic missile system in the Asia-Pacific region would deter China from military intimidation tactics. Taiwan is acquiring a defense capability with the Modified Air Defense System (MADS). Taiwan seeks expanded US cooperation on missile defense, including a joint study for a defense system covering Taichung, Kaohsiung, Penghu Islands, Kinmen, and Matsu. This is in response to China's military exercises and missile tests aimed at Taiwan. The \"Extension of Hong Kong Territory\" agreement between Great Britain and China leased the New Territories for 99 years starting in 1898. The \"Sino-British Joint Declaration\" in 1984 established terms for Hong Kong's return to China in 1997. No treaties exist between China and Taiwan regarding Taiwan's future status, with China attempting to annex Taiwan using the \"one country, two systems\" formula. The People's Republic of China has refused to renounce the use of force against Taiwan and held military exercises in the Taiwan Strait in an attempt to intimidate the people of Taiwan in their first presidential elections. The Taiwan Relations Act states that any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means is considered a threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of grave concern to the United States. Study and report on establishing a theater ballistic missile defense system in the Asia-Pacific region. The Secretary of Defense will conduct a study on the architecture requirements for a theater ballistic missile defense system in the Asia-Pacific region to protect Taiwan. The study will also explore cooperation with Taiwan for an advanced local-area ballistic missile defense system. A report with the study results and factors used will be submitted to the House and Senate Committees by July 1, 1998. The Secretary of Defense will conduct a study on the architecture requirements for a theater ballistic missile defense system in the Asia-Pacific region to protect Taiwan. The report will be submitted in both classified and unclassified form. SEC. 4. TRANSFER OF BALLISTIC MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEMS TO TAIWAN. The President should transfer defense articles or services to Taiwan for a local-area ballistic missile defense system. SEC. 5. STATEMENT OF POLICY ON US THEATER MISSILE DEFENSES IN ASIA-PACIFIC. The Congress emphasizes the importance of Taiwan's inclusion in ballistic missile defense cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region. It urges the President to convey the American people's commitment to security and democracy in Taiwan to China. Additionally, there is a sense of Congress regarding the resolution of security issues in Taiwan by peaceful means. SEC. 7. ADDITIONAL SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING TAIWAN: The Congress affirms that the transfer of Hong Kong to China does not affect Taiwan's status. It advocates for Taiwan's future to be determined democratically and peacefully. The United States should support Taiwan's defense in case of threats or attacks from China."
