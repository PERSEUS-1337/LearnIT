    "content": "The \"Quality Water Supply Enhancement Act\" aims to develop economically viable advanced water supply projects, including desalination, to improve access to existing water sources and tap into new ones. It also seeks to commercialize newly developed water supply technologies, provide objective analyses of water supply policies, and promote collaboration among Federal agencies for these projects. The Act defines key terms such as Advisory Panel, Regional Center, Institute, Program, Program Coordinator, and Secretary. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior. \"Water resource agencies\" are federal agencies identified in the Interagency Consortium for Desalination and Membrane Separation. \"Water supply enhancement\" includes demonstration projects like desalination to improve water quality or use existing water sources more efficiently. The curr_chunk discusses various aspects related to water management, including disposal, water reuse, contaminant removal, efficiency in agriculture, industrial, and municipal sectors, and water monitoring and systems analysis. The curr_chunk introduces the Desalination and Water Supply Enhancement Demonstration Program. The Secretary, in coordination with Water Resource Agencies and the Program Coordinator, establishes a program to fund advanced water supply projects, including desalination. The Program Coordinator, with input from the Secretary and Water Resource Agencies, will oversee the program's activities and construct a facility for program administration. The Program Coordinator is responsible for administering the program, establishing budgetary and contracting procedures, performing administrative duties, administering funds, conducting peer reviews, creating a roadmap for water supply enhancement demonstrations, and coordinating budgets for projects. The Program Coordinator is responsible for coordinating budgets for demonstration projects at Regional Centers, research, annual evaluations, and establishing a water supply demonstration transfer program to facilitate commercialization of promising projects. The Program Coordinator is responsible for coordinating budgets for demonstration projects at Regional Centers and establishing procedures for assessing Regional Centers, providing information on demonstration project results to the public, and implementing cross-cutting research for sensor and monitoring systems. SEC. 5. WATER SUPPLY ADVISORY PANEL. The Program Coordinator, in consultation with the Secretary, establishes the \"Water Supply Advisory Panel\" to advise on program direction, project performance review, commercialization, and water policy evaluation. The panel includes members from industry, educational institutions, the Federal Government, NGOs, international water technology institutions, and Regional Centers. SEC. 6. REGIONAL CENTERS IN WATER SUPPLY ENHANCEMENT. Regional Centers partner with universities to conduct water supply enhancement projects. Centers are grouped by region and theme for specific projects like water quality impacts reduction, water reuse, energy reduction for desalination, and water efficiency in manufacturing. The Regional Centers partner with universities for water supply enhancement projects in different regions. Projects include water efficiency in manufacturing, energy reduction in wastewater treatment, cogeneration of nuclear power, conjunctive management of hydropower and water, and transboundary water management. The Regional Centers partner with universities for water supply enhancement projects. Each center selects a primary university partner and may nominate additional partners. Operational procedures must be submitted within a year, and additional centers may be designated after 5 years if new water supply technologies need research. The Regional Centers partner with universities for water supply enhancement projects. Designations under subsection (b), (c), or (d) are for 5 years and subject to periodic assessments for renewal. The Secretary may decide not to renew a Regional Center's designation based on assessments. The Regional Center's designation may not be renewed or terminated by the Secretary in coordination with Water Resources Agencies. A Regional Center is administered by an executive director and is required to publish research results in peer-reviewed journals periodically. SEC. 7. PROGRAM FUNDING. Funding to Regional Centers for demonstration projects without cost-share requirements, with 50% of funds going to regional university partners. Open-Call Funding coordinated by the Program Coordinator. Open-Call Funding coordinated by the Program Coordinator provides competitive funding mechanisms to eligible institutions and individuals for water supply demonstration projects. Eligible collaborative institutions include nongovernmental organizations, Department of Energy National Laboratories, private corporations, industry consortia, universities, and international research consortia. The program funding distribution includes providing 15-25% to nongovernmental organizations with a cost share requirement and 20-30% to Department of Energy National Laboratories for individual projects without matching fund requirements. The funding distribution for projects includes allocating 15-25% to Federal Agencies with matching fund requirements and 25% to other entities with a nonprogram cost share. Grants are typically for a 2-year term, with the possibility of renewal for up to 2 additional years. Recipients must report bi-annually on research results and status. The Program Coordinator, in coordination with the Secretary and Water Resource Agencies, will establish criteria for grant applications and funds provision. National Laboratories receiving funding under this section are exempt from cost-sharing requirements. SEC. 8. NATIONAL WATER SUPPLY POLICY INSTITUTE. The Utton Center at the University of New Mexico Law School is designated as the National Water Policy Institute. The Institute's duties include conducting research on water regulations, providing policy alternatives to increase water supplies, consulting with various stakeholders, and hosting an annual water policy seminar. The Institute may also form partnerships. The Institute may form partnerships with other institutions to assist in carrying out its duties. An executive director, approved by the Program Coordinator, will administer the Institute. SEC. 9. REPORTS.\n\nAny Regional Center or collaborative institution receiving funding under section 7 must submit an annual report to the Program Coordinator on activities conducted using funds from this Act. The Program Coordinator is required to submit a report to the Secretary, Water Resource Agencies, and Congress every 3 fiscal years after enactment and every 5 years thereafter, detailing activities under this Act.\n\nSEC. 10. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorized appropriations for fiscal years 2005-2009 include $20 million for facility construction, $5 million for program administration, $200 million for demonstration projects, and $7.5 million for Regional Centers. Allocation of funds for demonstration projects to Regional Centers is limited to $10 million or 5 percent per center. The funding allocation for Regional Centers under the designated sections includes block funding, with limitations on amounts for specific purposes: $10 million or 5 percent for the Institute, at least 15 percent for demonstration projects, and at least 30 percent for the open-call funding program."
