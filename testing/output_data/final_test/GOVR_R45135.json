    "content": "Securing the electric power grid is a top priority for critical infrastructure protection in the United States, with a focus on preventing terrorist attacks that could cause widespread blackouts. The emphasis has shifted from cybersecurity to physical security of power grid assets following a 2013 attack on an electric transmission substation in Metcalf, CA. Following the 2013 attack on an electric transmission substation in Metcalf, CA, Congress passed new legislation to strengthen power grid physical security. This led to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) ordering the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) to develop new physical security standards for critical infrastructure. NERC proposed these standards in May 2014, which were approved by FERC in November of the same year. Since the approval of NERC's physical security standards in November 2014, security risks to the power grid have increased, leading to ongoing legislative proposals in Congress focused on physical grid security. The report examines changes in grid security and discusses the current risk environment for the bulk power system. The report focuses on NERC's security standards for the power grid, specifically addressing physical security measures to prevent attacks on critical infrastructure. It also discusses proposed legislation and policy issues for Congress. The report highlights the risks to high voltage transformer stations and substations. The 2013 Metcalf attack and the 2016 rifle attack in Utah highlighted the vulnerability of high voltage transformer stations and substations in the electric transmission system. Foreign entities, like Russian hackers, have also shown interest in targeting power grids. The National Academy of Sciences warns of the potential for large-scale physical destruction of key infrastructure. The threat of large-scale physical attacks on the power system in the United States is a real danger, with potential disruptions lasting for weeks or months. Power grid owners and operators are increasingly concerned about physical and cyber security risks, as attacks become more sophisticated and dynamic. Exelon Corporation highlighted the ongoing threat sources seeking to exploit vulnerabilities in the electric utility industry. The risk of system-related events and security breaches in the electricity sector is intensifying. Xcel Energy and Exelon Corporation both acknowledge the potential for terrorist activities targeting their facilities. NERC conducts security exercises simulating attacks on critical assets. FERC has ordered NERC to propose reliability standards addressing physical security risks. FERC ordered NERC to propose physical security standards for the power grid to address vulnerabilities and protect critical facilities from potential attacks. NERC submitted its proposal on May 23, 2014, and FERC required verification of the security measures by a qualified third party. NERC proposed mandatory physical security standards to FERC, which were approved and implemented as the new Physical Security Reliability Standard (CIP-014-1). A revised version (CIP-014-2) was approved on July 14, 2015, with compliance required by November 24, 2016. The standard aims to protect critical transmission stations and substations from physical attacks to prevent instability in the power grid. The Physical Security Reliability Standard (CIP-014-2) applies to transmission owners with assets operating at 500 kV or higher and substations between 200-499 kV meeting specific criteria. It consists of six requirements: risk assessments, third-party verification, notification of critical facilities, threat and vulnerability assessments, physical security plans, and third-party review. The new Physical Security Reliability Standard (CIP-014-2) includes requirements for risk assessments, third-party verification, notification of critical facilities, threat and vulnerability assessments, physical security plans, and independent third-party review. Compliance monitoring involves audits, self-certifications, spot checking, violation investigations, self-reporting, and handling complaints, enforced by NERC or another Regional Entity under penalty review policy approved by FERC. Key roles in oversight and implementation support are played by NERC, FERC, and the Department of Energy. NERC, with oversight by FERC, develops and enforces the CIP-014 physical security standard for bulk power asset owners. NERC, along with Regional Entities, forms the Electric Reliability Organization (ERO) Enterprise. Compliance monitoring is risk-based, tailored to factors like risk and management practices. The NERC Framework assesses, mitigates, and reports noncompliance in the bulk power system. It tailors compliance monitoring based on individual and collective risk levels of registered entities. NERC offers flexibility in monitoring frequency and type based on reliability risk, conducting activities like audits, spot checks, and self-certifications. NERC focused on monitoring compliance with the CIP-014 standard in 2015 and 2016, emphasizing the identification of critical transmission stations and substations. Covered entities were required to self-certify their risk assessment, critical asset identification, and third-party verification. NERC conducted on-site visits with 19 entities to discuss security measures and implementation challenges. Discrepancies in critical asset lists led to further requirements from NERC. NERC required covered entities to provide additional information to address discrepancies in critical substations. Audits were conducted to identify entities with abnormal percentages of critical substations. Detailed compliance findings are confidential, but NERC noted progress in industry compliance with CIP-014-2 in 2016. A presentation highlighted significant improvements in physical security among asset owners by February 2016. In 2017, NERC increased focus on utility security plans and implementation progress for CIP-014. The ERO Enterprise is prioritizing auditing covered entities' risk management plans and implementing physical security measures. NERC has conducted compliance audits on 45% of covered entities with critical transmission stations and substations, aiming to audit 70% by the end of 2018. NERC aims to audit 70% of entities with CIP-014 critical assets by the end of 2018, with the remaining to be audited in 2019. Audits have not revealed major compliance failures, with 19 noncompliance issues identified, 8 being minimal or moderate risk. NERC supports the electric power sector through the E-ISAC for security. The E-ISAC, established in 1998, serves as the primary communication channel for security-related information in the electricity sector. It gathers and analyzes security data, shares it with stakeholders, and communicates security risk mitigation strategies. Bulk power entities report physical security events to the E-ISAC under NERC's Event Reporting Reliability Standard. The E-ISAC is independent from NERC's standards enforcement functions and has facilitated industry understanding of physical security best practices. The E-ISAC, established in 1998, serves as the primary communication channel for security-related information in the electricity sector. It gathers and analyzes security data, shares it with stakeholders, and communicates security risk mitigation strategies. In 2015, the E-ISAC established a Physical Security Advisory Group to analyze physical security threats and advise asset owners on threat mitigation. The agency developed a design basis threat for the electric sector and hosted threat workshops to support bulk power asset owners in complying with standards. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission oversees implementation of NERC's CIP-014 standard through annual compliance reporting and independent activities. FERC coordinates with NERC for compliance activities, including on-site visits to covered entities. FERC requires reports on critical facilities after implementing specific requirements. Based on NERC's reported results, FERC will audit entities for compliance with Reliability Standard CIP-014-1. FERC may direct NERC to modify the standard based on audit findings. FERC has completed two audits of critical assets and is conducting a third, identifying one concern related to standard interpretation. The interpretation of specific language in the standard regarding asset criticality is a concern. FERC receives periodic Notices of Penalty for violations of the CIP-014 standard. PDD-63 established national policy for critical infrastructure protection from physical and cyber threats. Presidential Directive 7 (HSPD-7) assigned DOE responsibility for the energy sector's protection. The Obama Administration replaced HSPD-7 with Presidential Policy Directive 21 (PPD-21) in 2013, keeping DOE as the Sector-Specific Agency for the energy sector. DOE has supported utilities in safeguarding critical power assets for the past two decades through its Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability. The Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability has been focused on grid cybersecurity, with activities related to power grid physical security. A new Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response (CESER) was established by the Secretary of Energy in 2018 to protect energy infrastructure from cyber threats, physical attacks, and natural disasters. The impact of this reorganization on DOE's bulk power physical security activities is yet to be seen. The reorganization of DOE's activities in bulk power physical security following the 2013 Metcalf substation attack is still uncertain. Changes in the electricity sector regarding physical security may be driven by utility perceptions of grid threats or NERC's security standards. There is a lack of comprehensive data on sector-wide physical security changes, but anecdotal evidence suggests significant and widespread improvements. The Metcalf substation attack highlighted the lack of centralized physical security management at utilities like PG&E. However, many utilities, including PG&E, American Electric Power, and Xcel Energy, have since elevated physical security functions by appointing Chief Security Officers with direct access to senior management and company boards. The electricity industry is prioritizing security with dedicated departments and centralized physical security capabilities. Xcel Energy increased staffing for Chief Security Officer services to address the need for adequate resources in cyber and physical security. The emerging need for a Chief Security Officer to focus on Cyber Operations, Enterprise Resilience, Physical Security, and Security Governance is evident in the response to security threats like the Metcalf attack. Dominion Energy and other major utilities have established cross-functional teams and implemented comprehensive security programs. For example, the Western Area Power Administration consolidated its security and emergency management offices in 2013 to analyze threats and vulnerabilities to substations. The Tennessee Valley Authority also prioritizes security measures in its operations. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) recently closed a job posting for entry-level Inspectors to be trained as physical security specialists. Some transmission owners are increasing their in-house intelligence capabilities in physical security. This trend among key grid owners aims to make physical security a better-organized and more influential corporate function. Some utilities are emphasizing bulk power physical security in long-term transmission system planning following NERC's CIP-014 standards. Examples include Public Service Enterprise Group using power system simulation tools for security and reliability studies, and Commonwealth Edison incorporating security criteria for system design. American Electric Power (AEP) incorporates asset criticality as a design criterion in its transmission planning, classifying facilities based on equipment criticality to determine security levels. This approach allows for proactive security controls in new infrastructure, balancing risks with mitigation solutions. In its plans for a 2018 reliability-related upgrade, Vermont Electric Power Company will improve physical security at a substation. Utilities are considering new transmission interconnections to reduce criticality of transformer substations. Industry vendors are offering more physical security products and services to meet sector demand. New offerings in the bulk power physical security market include customizable security programs, anti-intrusion products, and various systems for facility monitoring and response. New physical security products in the utility sector include radar, electromagnetic systems, hardened transformers with integrated ballistic shielding, perimeter fencing, and wall products for bulk power substations. Smaller manufacturers are also marketing hardened transformer components for substation applications. The utility sector is seeing new physical security products being marketed, such as radar, electromagnetic systems, and hardened transformers with ballistic shielding. However, the impact of these offerings on the sector is uncertain, with limited commercial orders reported. Changes in power grid expenses and capital investments are slow due to rigorous approval processes in both privately and publicly owned utilities, which can take years to complete. Many utilities face lengthy approval processes for physical security upgrades, leading to delays in implementing significant investments. For example, Southern California Edison planned improvements at 24 facilities from 2015-2017 and proposed upgrades at 8 substations annually from 2016-2020. Dominion Resources' power grid capital investment timeline for \"Physical Security\" extends to 2021. Despite the slow approval process, bulk power asset owners have been increasing spending on new security measures. The Edison Electric Institute and the California Public Utilities Commission report increased spending on physical security measures for transmission infrastructure. Examples include security fencing at substations to comply with NERC standards and protect critical assets. In 2017, PPL Electric Utilities and Vectren (Indiana) filed for regulatory approval to invest in physical security upgrades at substations to comply with NERC's standards. Western Area Power Administration's expenses for physical security nearly tripled between 2013 and 2017. Utility participation in voluntary security initiatives administered by NERC and DHS indicates overall efforts to protect critical assets. NERC conducted GridEx in 2011, the first of a series of biennial grid security exercises. The exercise focused on utilities' readiness to respond to cyberattacks and included physical incursions into power grid substations. After the Metcalf attack in 2013, NERC conducted GridEx II, which simulated a cyberattack on the grid along with coordinated physical attacks on transmission and generation assets, including critical transformer substations. NERC conducted GridEx III in 2015, with a baseline scenario of cyber and physical attacks on transmission and generation assets, including critical transformer substations. GridEx IV took place in November 2017, showing progress in bulk power grid security with increased participation from 49 utilities in 2011 to 166 in 2015. The Department of Homeland Security conducts voluntary field assessments to identify vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure. The DHS conducts voluntary security surveys of critical facilities to identify vulnerabilities and security gaps. Over 600 surveys have been conducted on electric power facilities, but details on timing and specific types of facilities are not reported. Bulk power physical security has not been a major legislative focus due to the recent promulgation of NERC's new standards. Bulk power physical security has not been a major legislative focus in the 115th Congress. Several bills aim to enhance bulk power physical security by establishing new DOE grid security programs. For example, the Enhancing Grid Security Through Public-Private Partnerships Act (H.R. 5240) would require DOE to facilitate public-private partnerships for electric utility security. The Energy Emergency Leadership Act (H.R. 5174) is also relevant in this context. The Energy Emergency Leadership Act (H.R. 5174) would amend the Department of Energy Organization Act to include \"energy emergency and energy security\" functions for Assistant Secretaries, including responsibilities for emerging threats, supply, and emergency planning. The Energy and Natural Resources Act of 2017 (S. 1460) would require DOE to develop an advanced energy security program to secure energy networks, focusing on electric transmission and delivery. Eligible activities would include identifying vulnerabilities and modeling national impacts from human-made events. The Leading Infrastructure for Tomorrow's America Act (H.R. 2479) and the Advancing Grid Storage Act of 2017 (S. 1851) aim to enhance energy security through measures for electricity delivery infrastructure hardening and improving the security of critical infrastructure. The Grid Cybersecurity Research and Development Act (H.R. 4120) requires collaboration between DOE, bulk power asset owners, and National Laboratories to enhance grid cybersecurity. The Flexible Grid Infrastructure Act of 2017 (S. 1875) requires DOE to develop model standards for the electric distribution grid to improve security against physical threats and evaluate the need for new performance standards. House Resolution 334 aims to bolster the reliability, affordability, diversity, efficiency, security, and resiliency of the electric grid. The government aims to enhance the reliability, affordability, diversity, efficiency, security, and resiliency of domestic energy supplies through advanced grid technologies. Congress is concerned about the current state of electric grid physical security, focusing on security implementation oversight, cost recovery, hardening vs. resilience, and threat information quality. Congressional oversight of physical security implementation may be challenging due to various reasons. Physical security implementation poses challenges due to sensitive information, statutory restrictions, and limited disclosure outside of regulatory processes. NERC does not maintain a centralized database of critical assets or security measures, limiting public access to security-related information. Despite existing information among utilities and third parties, details on CIP-014 implementation are restricted in public reports. NERC's CIP-014 standards provide flexibility for bulk power asset owners in implementing physical security measures, making it challenging to develop useful metrics for comparison. While the standards ensure consistency in identifying critical substations and securing them, the lack of specificity in information sharing may hinder visibility for external entities like Congress. NERC's CIP-014 standards allow flexibility for bulk power asset owners in implementing physical security measures, making it difficult to develop useful metrics for comparison. The lack of specificity in information sharing may hinder visibility for external entities like Congress. Officials at EEI have highlighted challenges in measuring the adequacy of grid security for a diverse set of asset owners under changing risk circumstances. NERC is facing challenges in developing security metrics for bulk power systems due to evolving threats and vulnerabilities. Congress may struggle to assess the effectiveness of physical security standards like CIP-014, as information provided by individual entities may be insufficient. This could lead to a need for revisiting how responsible agencies collect and measure data for better insights into bulk power physical security. Congress may need to consider additional avenues for reviewing information on physical security of the power grid, such as classified briefings or requested studies. FERC's policy on regulating physical security should be examined to ensure company-specific initiatives align with risk profiles, and that security measures across the grid reflect national terrorism risks. Barriers to physical security investment include competition for capital resources and justifying security spending to corporate boards and regulators. NERC's regulatory requirements make it easier for security managers to justify operating expenses. Physical security investments can be challenging to justify due to the lack of direct monetary return and the difficulty in evaluating them on a traditional benefit-cost basis. Regulators face challenges in gauging the prudence of specific security investments, making cost-justification difficult. Approval from utility management, FERC, and state public utility commissions is required for cost-justification and regulated rates for electric transmission. Utility commissions regulate rates for electric transmission and distribution services to ensure they are just and reasonable. Approval for new grid security costs must be justified to be passed on to ratepayers. However, investment and cost recovery for physical security vary among utilities and jurisdictions, making it a work in progress. Congress may assess if current security investments align with risks and if cost-recovery barriers hinder grid security investments. The two fundamental approaches to reducing the risk of a successful physical attack on the electric grid are outlined. The first approach focuses on preventing attacks by monitoring critical facilities and hardening them physically. The second approach aims to make the power system more resilient to attacks by enhancing the ability to manage loads and access alternative sources of generation. Initiatives like the spare transformer program by the Edison Electric Institute are part of these efforts. The Edison Electric Institute (EEI) administers a transformer program and proposes a federal Strategic Transformer Reserve to enhance the power grid's ability to withstand a terrorist attack. Hardening critical facilities and increasing system resilience are complementary measures to reduce security risks, involving different approaches and investments. Balancing these approaches efficiently is crucial for achieving desired outcomes. The CPUC highlighted the challenge of balancing physical security measures for utilities with limited budgets. Congress is overseeing bulk power physical security regulation to ensure a proper balance between different security approaches. The utility industry relies on threat information from the government for risk assessments, which determines the security measures needed. Incomplete or unclear threat information can lead to inconsistent security measures and inefficient spending. The E-ISAC plays a crucial role in identifying and analyzing physical security risks for bulk power asset owners. Independent third-party verification and NERC compliance audits help ensure consistency in threat information among utilities. However, the evolving threat landscape poses challenges for security planning and investment. Adaptation and information sharing are essential to address these issues effectively. Concerns about federal threat information quality and specificity have been a long-standing issue across critical infrastructure sectors, including power grid physical security. Industry analysts have differing opinions on the response to the Metcalf attack, with some calling it an \"overreaction\" while others predict even more sophisticated attacks in the future. There are concerns that physical security measures may be too focused on specific scenarios rather than a broader range of potential threats. Effective adaptation and information sharing are crucial in addressing these challenges. The vulnerability of bulk power critical assets to physical attacks is a growing concern, with uncertainties about the nature and capability of potential attackers. Limited information on potential targets and attacker capabilities leaves the true vulnerability of the grid an open question. Congress is examining how federal and electric sector threat information is used by critical asset owners and how limitations and uncertainties in this information may impact the physical security of the electric grid. The 2013 attack on the Metcalf transformer substation was a significant event in this context. The 2013 attack on the Metcalf transformer substation prompted utilities to enhance physical security programs, leading to the establishment of NERC's CIP-014 standards in 2015. Compliance reports suggest ongoing physical security improvements among bulk power critical asset owners, although uniform progress is not confirmed. NERC's State of Reliability 2017 report acknowledges positive compliance trends. NERC's State of Reliability 2017 report highlights the electric power sector's progress in enhancing physical security measures, with a focus on integrating security technologies and staff expertise. The industry is in the process of prioritizing utility physical security on par with safety and reliability, although some measures are yet to be fully implemented. The U.S. electric grid has improved its physical security measures in the past five years, but there is still work to be done to meet the sector's own risk assessments. Congress may need to focus on long-term structural changes to prioritize physical security in the power sector."
