    "content": "Central governance in Yemen, led by former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, began to unravel in 2011 due to political unrest in the Arab world. Infighting among Yemeni political powers led to a security vacuum, allowing militias linked to Al Qaeda to seize territory. The United States, Saudi Arabia, and other international actors brokered a transition plan in 2012, resulting in Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi becoming president with their support. President Hadi attempted to reform Yemen's political system with support from the United States, Saudi Arabia, and the United Nations Security Council. The National Dialogue Conference in 2013 aimed to reach a new political consensus but ended without agreement in January 2014. The Houthi movement, with support from former President Saleh, launched a military offensive against President Hadi's allies, eventually taking over the capital of Sanaa in 2014. In 2015, Houthi forces advanced southward from the capital to Aden on the Arabian Sea. Saudi Arabia and an international coalition launched a military offensive to restore President Hadi's rule and evict Houthi fighters. The United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 2216 demanding an end to violence by Houthi-Saleh forces. The US provided limited assistance to the coalition military operations. In December 2017, the Houthi-Saleh alliance unraveled. Since the Houthi-Saleh alliance unraveled in December 2017, the coalition has made military gains in Yemen, advancing northward along the Red Sea coast. Houthi forces still control the capital and northern Yemen, exacerbating a humanitarian crisis that began in 2011. Estimates suggest that 60,000 Yemenis have been killed since January 2016, with 3.9 million internally displaced as of January 2019. The United Nations Panel of Experts on Yemen reported in January 2019 that Yemen is facing a humanitarian and economic catastrophe. The conflict has led to internal displacement of 3.9 million Yemenis. Formal negotiations in Sweden in December 2018 resulted in the Stockholm Agreement, including a cease-fire around the port city. The Stockholm Agreement, brokered by the Special Envoy of the United Nations Secretary-General for Yemen, includes a cease-fire around the port city of Hudaydah, a prisoner swap, and the formation of a committee to discuss the city of Taiz. The agreement also involves the redeployment of forces outside Hudaydah city and port, monitored by the Redeployment Coordination Committee (RCC) chaired by the United Nations. The United Nations Security Council passed UNSCR 2452 to authorize the creation of the United Nations Mission to support the Hudaydah Agreement (UNMHA) for a 6-month period. The implementation of the Stockholm Agreement in Hudaydah stalled for nearly two months due to complexities on the ground. The parties reached an agreement on Phase 1 of mutual redeployment of forces, with the Houthis withdrawing from Hudaydah port and the Saudi-led coalition moving out of the eastern outskirts of the city. However, the identities of local police forces to take over security in Hudaydah remain unresolved. As of March 2019, significant progress had been made towards implementing phase one of the redeployments. The implementation of the Stockholm Agreement in Hudaydah has faced challenges, with the Houthis still present in the city. The coalition is concerned about the neutrality of local coast guard units, and the fear of vulnerability to attacks if the Houthis withdraw. Meetings between the Houthis and the Hadi government in Jordan for a prisoner exchange have not yet resulted in a comprehensive agreement. Since the signing of the Stockholm Agreement, the Saudi-led coalition has conducted airstrikes in Sanaa and retaliated against a Houthi drone attack. Implementation of the agreement has been hindered by a lack of trust and reluctance to make concessions without a comprehensive political agreement. The Trump Administration continues to support United Nations-led efforts in addressing the humanitarian situation in Yemen. The United States supports UN efforts in Yemen for humanitarian aid and peace, while also cooperating with Saudi Arabia and the UAE to counter terrorism and limit Iran's influence. The Trump Administration defends Saudi Arabia against Houthi attacks and urges judicious use of air power to reduce civilian casualties. Despite ending refueling support, the Administration opposes congressional attempts to block arms sales, arguing that continued assistance is key to achieving objectives. The United States halted in-flight refueling support for coalition aircraft in Yemen to address concerns over civilian casualties. The coalition has made changes to minimize civilian casualties and the U.S. will continue to press for humanitarian efforts in the country. General Votel testified about U.S. support for Saudi Arabia in countering ballistic missiles and unmanned aerial systems to protect civilians and infrastructure. The U.S. advisors play a crucial role in this mission, with Saudi Arabia providing significant support. Additionally, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have supplied armored vehicles to Yemen. Saudi Arabia and the UAE provided U.S. military equipment to Yemeni units fighting the Houthis, possibly violating agreements. The quad (US, UK, Saudi Arabia, UAE) met to coordinate policy on Yemen, emphasizing the Stockholm Agreement, Iran's role, and humanitarian aid. They expressed support for Saudi Arabia's security concerns. The House passed a joint resolution calling for the removal of US Armed Forces from unauthorized hostilities in Yemen, despite the White House's argument that US support to the Saudi-led coalition is limited. The Senate passed a joint resolution (S.J.Res. 7) on March 13, 2019, stating that it should not disrupt any intelligence or investigative activities related to threats in Yemen. Senator Robert Menendez introduced S. 398, the Saudi Arabia Accountability and Yemen Act of 2019, on February 7, 2019. The Saudi Arabia Accountability and Yemen Act of 2019 aims to end in-flight refueling for Saudi-led coalition operations in Yemen, suspend certain arms sales to Saudi Arabia, sanction individuals blocking humanitarian access in Yemen, and sanction those supporting the Houthis. Iran and Hezbollah have provided support to the Houthis with advice, training, and arms shipments. Iran's support for the Houthis in Yemen has been a point of contention for Saudi Arabia, with accusations of illicit support leading to increased tensions. Questions remain about the extent of Iran's influence over the Houthis, as their aid does not seem to match their commitments in other Middle Eastern countries. Prior to the conflict in 2015, Yemen had acquired missiles from the Soviet Union and North Korea. The government in Yemen acquired Scud-B missiles from the Soviet Union and North Korea, which the Houthis seized. The Houthis have been firing short-range ballistic missiles into Saudi Arabia since 2016, with the latest version being the Burkan-2H. In November 2017, the Saudi-led coalition and U.S. officials claimed that the Burkan-2H is an Iran-manufactured Qaim missile. The United Nations Panel of Experts on Yemen concluded in January 2018 that Iran was in noncompliance with UNSCR 2216 for failing to prevent the transfer of Iranian-made missiles to the Houthis. Russia vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution in February 2018 expressing concern over Iran's noncompliance with the arms embargo. In summer 2018, the United Nations Panel of Experts on Yemen reported to the United Nations Security Council that Iran may be violating the international arms embargo by supplying advanced weaponry to the Houthis. The report noted that missiles fired by the Houthis showed characteristics similar to weapons produced in Iran, suggesting they were manufactured outside of Yemen and reassembled by the Houthis. In May 2018, the U.S. Department of the Treasury designated five Iranian individuals for providing ballistic missile-related technical expertise to the Houthis. Iran's support to the Huthis in Yemen includes supplying ballistic missiles, posing a serious threat to US partners and interests in the region. The U.N. Panel of Experts traced the supply of UAVs and rocket fuel mixing machines to the Houthis, with funding from Iranian entities. Iranian entities funded the purchase of rocket fuel for Houthi militants in Yemen. Saudi Arabia supported the central government in military campaigns against the Houthis before the conflict began in 2015. Saudi leaders became increasingly alarmed as Houthi militants took over the capital in 2014, leading to a military offensive by an international coalition to restore President Hadi's rule. The Saudi-led coalition launched a military offensive to restore President Hadi's rule and remove Houthi fighters from Yemen. They sought support from the United States, which provided logistical and intelligence support, established a Joint Planning Cell, and conducted mid-air refueling of coalition aircraft from 2015 to 2018. The Saudi-led coalition, with support from the United States, has provided military advice and support to pro-Hadi forces in Yemen, conducting air campaigns against the Houthis. Saudi ground and naval forces have also been involved in limited operations. The UNVIM assists in validating traffic to enforce an arms embargo. US forces continue to provide non-combat support to regional forces combating the Houthi insurgency, with aerial refueling ending in November 2018. United States forces are present in Saudi Arabia. In November 2018, aerial refueling support for regional forces in Yemen ended. US forces are in Saudi Arabia but not engaged in hostilities with the Houthis under the War Powers Resolution. The US continues counterterrorism operations against AQAP and ISIS affiliates in Yemen, with 36 airstrikes conducted in 2018. President Trump confirmed a small US military presence in Yemen for anti-AQAP and ISIS operations. General McKenzie warned of AQAP's aspiration to attack the US in his testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee. AQAP's power in Yemen has diminished due to US counterterrorism operations and internal conflicts. US officials claimed the killing of high-value target Ibrahim al Asiri in a 2018 airstrike. Asiri was a key figure in AQAP and responsible for creating explosive devices used in past attacks. In January 2019, U.S. officials confirmed the killing of Jamal al-Badawi, an al Qaeda operative involved in the USS Cole bombing. Two American soldiers have died in the U.S. counterterrorism campaign against AQAP in Yemen. In January 2017, Navy SEAL Ryan Owens died in a raid that also resulted in civilian casualties. The Trump Administration's first acknowledged counterterror operation in Yemen resulted in the death of a U.S. citizen. Yemen is facing a severe humanitarian crisis, with 80% of the population needing assistance. The United Nations warns that millions of Yemenis rely on humanitarian aid as their only lifeline. The parties to the conflict began implementing the Stockholm Agreement on February 17. The Stockholm Agreement, implemented on February 17, aims to reopen main roads from Hudaydah to Sanaa and Taiz, and provide humanitarian access to the Red Sea Mills grain storage facility. The United Nations, Sweden, and Switzerland hosted a pledging conference in Geneva on February 26, where Saudi Arabia and the UAE each pledged $750 million for Yemen. The UN is seeking $4 billion from donors for 2019, with the US, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Kuwait being major contributors in 2018. Since FY2018, the United States has provided $720.8 million in emergency humanitarian aid for Yemen, with $498 million through USAID's Office of Food for Peace. The US has been the largest contributor of humanitarian aid to Yemen since March 2015, providing over $1.71 billion in funding. In FY2018, $566.2 million was provided to international aid organizations by USAID's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, Food for Peace, and the Department of State's Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration. Humanitarian conditions in Yemen are affected by economic disruptions and access constraints imposed by conflict parties. The conflict in Yemen has led to economic disruptions and access constraints, particularly in remote regions controlled by the Houthis. Food prices have skyrocketed, with the cost of the minimum survival food basket more than 110% higher since the conflict escalated in March 2015. Inflation is fueled by the depreciation of the national currency, exacerbated by the existence of two competing central banks in Sanaa and Aden. The Houthis have depleted foreign currency reserves, leading to unpaid public sector salaries. The conflict in Yemen has caused economic disruptions, with food prices soaring due to the depreciation of the national currency. The central bank in Aden has printed money, leading to a decline in the value of the rial. Saudi Arabia agreed to lend $2 billion for food imports, but only a fraction has been authorized for payment. The UNSCR 2216 allows member states to block arms sales to the Houthis. The UNSCR 2216 authorizes member states to prevent arms sales to the Houthis and allows Yemen's neighbors to inspect cargo for illicit weapons. The Saudi-led coalition imposed a blockade on Yemen in 2015, causing delays in goods off-loading and increased shipping costs. To expedite imports while adhering to the arms embargo, the UNVIM was formed by the EU, Netherlands, New Zealand, UK, and US in 2016 to inspect incoming sea cargo for weapons. The UNVIM was established in 2016 to inspect sea cargo to Yemen for illicit weapons, amidst concerns of Iranian weapons smuggling to Houthi forces. Saudi officials argue that strict inspections are still necessary to prevent weapons reaching Houthi forces. Recent reports show a 20% decrease in cargo volume at Yemeni ports, impacting humanitarian aid delivery. Yemen is also facing a severe cholera outbreak. Since late 2016, Yemen has been experiencing the world's largest cholera outbreak with over 1.3 million suspected cases and nearly 2,800 deaths. The war has devastated the country's water and sanitation infrastructure, leading to contaminated water supplies. Humanitarian efforts have improved cholera prevention, but the crisis persists due to ongoing challenges. International organizations have accused the Saudi-led coalition of targeting civilian infrastructure, exacerbating the situation. According to U.N.OCHA's 2019 Yemen Humanitarian Needs Overview, public water and sanitation systems in Yemen require increased support to prevent collapse. A large percentage of the population lacks access to safe water, sanitation, and healthcare. The Stockholm Agreement aims to bring a nation-wide cease-fire, but delays in implementation increase the risk of renewed conflict in Hudaydah. Fighting has continued despite the agreement, with concerns about its collapse. The Stockholm Agreement has allowed the Saudi-led coalition to gradually withdraw from Yemen, but the cease-fire is at risk of collapsing. The coalition faces a dilemma of military action against the Houthis in Hudaydah, considering the humanitarian costs and international reputation. Yemen remains plagued by political conflicts and violence, including secessionist tensions in the south and militia warfare in Taiz. The future of Yemen remains uncertain amidst the Houthi-Saudi-led coalition conflict. Questions linger about the willingness of the Houthis to give up their advanced weaponry, while Iran's involvement complicates the situation. Political and military compromises could end the fighting but may empower an anti-U.S. and anti-Saudi Houthi movement. The complexity of Yemen's internal politics overshadows discussions on future governance. The United Nations Panel of Experts on Yemen doubts the ability of the legitimate Government of Yemen to reunite the country. The failure of the 2013 National Dialogue Conference continues to have violent repercussions in Yemen. The aftermath of the failed 2013 National Dialogue Conference in Yemen has led to ongoing violent reverberations as local players struggle to establish a new political order. Key issues such as the power of the central government, devolution of power to regional authorities, and the composition of national security forces must be addressed to prevent the country from further dissolution into competing autonomous regions."
