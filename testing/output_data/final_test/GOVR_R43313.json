    "content": "The United States has a strong economic interest in ensuring energy security, bolstering exports, and reducing barriers to U.S. trade and investment, especially with Mexico. Energy cooperation between the two countries is a priority under the U.S.-Mexico High Level Economic Dialogue. Policymakers are closely monitoring the implementation of constitutional reforms in Mexico to allow partnerships with international companies. The energy reforms in Mexico, allowing partnerships with international companies, are seen as a significant economic reform. These reforms are expected to boost investment, growth, and oil and gas production in the country. The reforms also aim to make Mexico's manufacturing sector more competitive by reducing electricity costs. However, there is a concern that the benefits of the reforms may have been oversold. Investors have shown interest in Mexico's energy sector despite oil price declines. Despite declines in oil prices, Mexico's first round of public bidding in July 2015 was disappointing due to limited block size, high minimum bids, and investor concerns about corruption and insecurity. Mexico aims to address these issues before the upcoming September 30 bidding round, which will include nine large shallow-water production blocks. This report provides an overview of Pemex, Mexico's energy reforms, and specific challenges in the oil and gas industry. It also examines the U.S.-Mexico energy relationship in terms of trade and cooperation, highlighting oversight issues for Congress related to energy reform. Foreign investment in Mexico's oil industry has a tumultuous history, with political unrest and the country's 1917 constitution leading to a decline in foreign investment and production levels by the 1930s. This has strained relations between U.S. oil companies and post-revolutionary presidents. Tensions between U.S. oil companies and Mexican presidents escalated, leading to President L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas' 1938 decision to expropriate foreign oil assets. The creation of Pemex symbolized Mexican nationalism, uniting society against foreign intervention. Pemex later monopolized Mexico's oil industry after outlawing service contracts with U.S. companies in 1958. Pemex, Mexico's state-owned oil company, held a monopoly over the country's oil and gas sector since 1938. By 2013, Pemex faced challenges due to lack of investment, high losses, low productivity, and infrastructure in need of repair. An explosion in 2013 highlighted the company's issues. Pemex, Mexico's state-owned oil company, faced financial challenges due to heavy tax demands, debt burden, pension liabilities, and losses from criminal activities. The government's restrictions on reinvestment and partnerships hindered the company's ability to improve operations. President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto took office in 2012, aiming to address these issues after years of conservative rule. President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto took office in 2012, succeeding the conservative National Action Party (PAN) rule. He prioritized economic reforms, including allowing Pemex to partner with private companies. Pe\u00f1a Nieto's reformist agenda, supported by a \"Pact for Mexico\" agreement with PAN and PRD, aimed at boosting Mexico's competitiveness through constitutional changes, including energy sector reform. Pe\u00f1a Nieto's energy reforms in August required approval from Mexican Congress and state legislatures. A PRI-PAN alliance led to the 2013 approval of constitutional reforms allowing Pemex to partner with international companies. The reforms aimed to give Pemex more autonomy, transparency, and fiscal changes. The PAN proposed deeper energy reforms than the PRI, allowing private involvement in Pemex operations. Former PAN President Felipe Calder\u00f3n's 2008 energy reform proposal was diluted by the PRI-led Congress. The PAN also aimed to establish a regulatory body and a sovereign wealth fund. The PRD opposed private participation in Pemex, focusing on company reform, budget autonomy, and tax relief. The Mexican Congress approved energy reforms in 2013, combining elements from PRD, PRI, and PAN proposals. Key points include state ownership of resources, various contract types for exploration, and opening up sectors like refining and transport. The Mexican Congress approved energy reforms in 2013, including state ownership of resources, different contract types for exploration, and opening up sectors like refining, transport, storage, natural gas processing, and petrochemicals to private investment. Pemex will become a productive state enterprise with an autonomous budget and a board of directors excluding union representatives. Regulatory roles in the hydrocarbons industry will be strengthened, and a National Agency for Industrial Safety and Environmental Protection will be created. Additionally, a sovereign wealth fund, the Mexican Petroleum Fund for Stabilization and Development, will be managed by the Central Bank. The Mexican Congress approved energy reforms in 2013, including state ownership of resources and opening up sectors to private investment. Pemex will have more independence, pay a lower tax rate, and end its monopoly on retail sales in 2016. The Congress debated and approved the reforms with support from various parties. The Mexican Congress approved energy reforms in 2013, including ending Pemex's monopoly on retail sales in 2016. Companies will pay royalties and taxes based on oil prices, must meet national content requirements, and cannot expropriate land. The National Hydrocarbons Commission (CNH) is strengthened to manage the energy sector and oversee bidding rounds and contracts. The Mexican government announced the results of Round Zero in August 2014, ahead of schedule. Various agencies such as the Ministry of Finance, National Hydrocarbons Commission, Energy Regulatory Commission, and others play key roles in managing contracts, overseeing the industry, and regulating environmental and safety concerns in the energy sector. The Mexican government announced the results of Round Zero in August 2014, awarding Pemex 83% of Mexico's probable reserves and 21% of its prospective reserves. Pemex is seeking new partners to develop other fields and changing existing service contracts into profit-sharing contracts. This opens up opportunities for private involvement in Mexico's exploration and production sector. Mexico may first seek to partner with Pemex before submitting independent bids. Regulatory agencies empowered by energy reforms are hiring and training staff, releasing regulations, and defining priorities for the Mexican Petroleum Fund. U.S. companies are monitoring Mexico's establishment of environmental and safety standards, transparency, and fair bidding processes. Budget cuts due to declining oil prices have impacted energy-related entities. In 2014, the Mexican government announced terms for companies to bid on production-sharing contracts to explore shallow-water fields in the Gulf of Mexico. Despite low oil prices, only 2 out of 14 blocks were awarded in the bidding results announced in July 2015. Analysts suggest that more competitive terms are needed to attract foreign investment for exploration, especially as Pemex's budget is being cut by 20% in 2016. Mexico's proposed budget for 2016 is being cut by 20%, affecting exploration efforts. The government has made modifications to terms for bidding on production blocks, aiming to attract foreign investment. Mexico holds significant oil reserves, with the potential to reverse its declining oil production trend. Aging infrastructure has contributed to a 20% decline in oil production from 2005 to 2009. Mexico lags behind Russia, the United States, China, and Canada as a non-OPEC oil producer. Most production is offshore in the Bay of Campeche, concentrated in the KMZ and Cantarell fields. Cantarell's production declined from 2.1 million b/d in 2004 to 440,000 b/d in 2013. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates that Mexico's oil production could reach 3.7 million b/d by 2040, up from 2.9 million b/d in 2013. Mexico has untapped deep water resources in the Gulf of Mexico, but lacks technical capacity for exploration. International companies are interested in Mexico's energy reforms, and the U.S.-Mexico Transboundary Agreement may be significant. Mexico's natural gas production capacity has increased since 2000 but has not kept up with demand, which has risen by 123% between 2000 and 2014. Most of Mexico's natural gas consumption supports its oil operations and electricity generation. However, underinvestment in exploration has led to a decline in proven gas reserves. Production has also decreased in recent years as it has been more profitable for Pemex to produce oil than gas. Mexico's energy reforms aim to attract private investment in both conventional and unconventional natural gas resources. Mexico's natural gas production capacity has not kept up with demand, leading to increased imports. Mexico started importing LNG in 2006 to meet growing demand. U.S. natural gas exports to Mexico have increased, supported by free trade agreements. The surge in U.S. natural gas exports to Mexico has significantly impacted the country's imports and consumption. U.S. pipelines to Mexico have doubled their capacity between 2008 and 2013, with current export capacity at 4.9 bcf/d, expected to reach 8.4 bcf/d by the end of 2016. Mexico's reliance on U.S. natural gas is likely to continue due to growing demand. Mexico's shale gas resources are attracting interest, with some formations in northern Mexico being close to U.S. developments like the Eagle Ford basin in Texas. Mexico's Ford basin, a rapidly growing shale producing area, may extend into Mexico where Pemex is exploring unconventional formations. Limited test wells have been drilled, but ambitious plans for development over the next decade require reforms to attract outside investment, strengthen regulations, expand infrastructure, address water management, and improve security. Violence in northeastern Mexico where shale formations are located poses challenges for business opportunities, with government efforts to reduce criminality showing limited impact. Disputes over land access for exploration may also arise. Mexico's limited refining capacity and need for upgrades pose challenges for meeting domestic demand for refined petroleum products. The country has six refineries operating below capacity due to operating mishaps, requiring major repairs and investments. This could deter potential investors, along with disputes over land access for exploration and opposition to fracking in some areas. Mexico has been collaborating with the United States on technical aspects like resource assessment and environmental protection. Mexico's refineries need repairs and upgrades, operating below capacity and facing a $7.7 billion loss in 2013. The U.S. Gulf Coast has advanced refining capacity for heavy crudes, which Mexico exports. Pemex owns 50% of a Texas refinery, and the refining relationship could expand with Mexico's downstream market reforms. The United States has a strong economic relationship with Mexico, being its leading partner in merchandise trade. Since NAFTA in 1994, trade between the two countries has significantly increased, with U.S. exports to Mexico growing by 478% and imports from Mexico by 637%. NAFTA has removed trade barriers and strengthened supply chain linkages between the two countries. Since NAFTA in 1994, trade between the United States and Mexico has significantly increased, with U.S. exports to Mexico growing by 478% and imports from Mexico by 637%. NAFTA removed trade barriers and strengthened supply chain linkages between the two countries. Mexico reserved strategic activities related to the exploration and exploitation of crude oil and natural gas under Chapter 6 of NAFTA. Despite these exclusions, energy remains a central component of U.S.-Mexico trade, with Mexico being a top exporter of oil to the United States. Since NAFTA in 1994, trade between the United States and Mexico has significantly increased. U.S. crude oil imports from Mexico peaked in 2004 at 1.6 million b/d but have since declined due to Mexico's drop in production and rising internal demand. In 2014, the United States imported 842,000 b/d of crude oil from Mexico, making up 11% of total imports. Approximately 71% of Mexico's oil exports go to the United States via tanker, with exports leaving the country from three Gulf Coast terminals. Mexico's crude oil exports mainly consist of the heavy Maya blend. Mexico's crude oil exports, mainly the heavy Maya blend, make up approximately 82% of total exports. The U.S. Gulf Coast's advanced refineries are key for processing Maya crude, leading to the majority of Mexico's exports going to the United States. In 2014, crude oil imports from Mexico were valued at $27.7 billion, surpassing automobile imports. Despite a decline in oil prices, Mexican oil imports reached their lowest level since 2006. In 2014, Mexico's crude oil imports reached their lowest level since 2006, declining from $39.6 billion in 2011 to $27.7 billion in 2014. Mexico is a net importer of refined petroleum products, with imports totaling $29.6 billion in 2012. The United States is Mexico's largest supplier of natural gas, with the value of natural gas imports increasing from $995.7 million in 2007 to $2.5 billion in 2013. Mexico imported a total of 779 billion cubic feet of natural gas. The United States is Mexico's largest supplier of natural gas, with imports increasing to $2.5 billion in 2013. Mexico imported 779 billion cubic feet of natural gas in 2012, with 620 Bcf coming from the United States. The surplus in natural gas trade is expected to widen due to supply and demand trends. Energy cooperation between the two countries has been growing, with a focus on geothermal and renewable energy projects. President Obama and then-Mexican President Calder\u00f3n announced the Bilateral Framework on Clean Energy and Climate Change in 2009 to develop clean energy sources and encourage investment in climate-friendly technologies. The goals include enhancing renewable energy, combating climate change, and strengthening cross-border electricity grids. Four bilateral meetings have been held to advance the Framework. The U.S. and Mexico aim to develop untapped resources in deep waters in the Gulf of Mexico and shale formations near the U.S. border in an environmentally responsible way. Both countries share an interest in developing renewable energy sources for growing population centers along the U.S.-Mexico border. Since 2011, the North American Development Bank has provided over $677 million in loans for wind and solar energy projects in rapidly growing population centers along the U.S.-Mexico border. Mexico is working to diversify its energy sources, but will likely continue relying on oil and natural gas. The U.S. and Mexico have expanded cooperation on environmental issues, including a $70 million program to help Mexico reduce emissions and monitor greenhouse gas emissions. The United States and Mexico are working together to ensure environmentally responsible development of hydrocarbon resources, with a focus on shale oil. Pemex could benefit from partnering with U.S. companies in the Gulf, including participation in the Marine Well Containment Company. The U.S.-Mexico Transboundary Hydrocarbons Agreement signed in 2012 marks the start of an energy partnership in the Gulf of Mexico. The U.S. and Mexico signed an Agreement in 2012 to develop hydrocarbon resources in the Gulf of Mexico, including shale oil. The partnership aims to lift a moratorium on development in a region with significant oil and gas reserves. The Agreement allows for joint development of transboundary resources and was approved by both Mexican and U.S. Congresses in 2013. The moratorium is now considered moot, and the first leases under the Agreement have been awarded by the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. Mexico's economic growth has been slow, with a forecasted drop to 2.1% in 2015. The decline in oil production and prices has led to lower export earnings and peso depreciation. Energy reform is a key focus for President Pe\u00f1a Nieto's administration to attract foreign investment and create more jobs. Observers have high expectations for Mexico's energy reforms to improve economic conditions. The energy reforms in Mexico are expected to bring significant wealth generation opportunities over the next five years, particularly in unconventional oil and gas production. However, there are concerns about the potential benefits primarily favoring multinational companies and large Mexican conglomerates over the general population. Skeptics doubt the government's claims of job creation through the reforms, suggesting that the bloated state-owned company, Pemex, may actually shed workers as a result. The opening of Mexico's oil and natural gas sector to foreign investors may have advantages and disadvantages for both the U.S. and Mexico. Reversing Mexico's production decline could enhance U.S. energy security and contribute to North American energy independence. Predictions suggest the region could produce surpluses of oil, gas, and renewable energy in the coming decades. The opening of Mexico's oil and natural gas sector to foreign investors could benefit U.S. companies in renewable energy and infrastructure development. However, U.S. natural gas producers exporting to Mexico may face market challenges in the long term due to restrictions on crude oil exports under U.S. law. Under current laws and regulations, unlimited oil exports from the United States to Canada are allowed, with an approved application required for each transaction. Canada is the primary destination for U.S. crude oil exports, and efforts have been made to allow unlimited exports to Mexico as well. The President could make a national interest determination for crude oil exports to Mexico, similar to Canada. Congressional debate on changing export restrictions continues, with multiple bills proposed during the 114th Congress. Bills in the House and Senate energy committees aim to allow unrestricted crude oil exports. S. 2012 and H.R. 702 were advanced in July and September 2015, respectively. The Bureau of Industry and Security reviews crude oil export applications on a case-by-case basis to determine national interest and EPCA consistency. Regulations permit exchanges with foreign states. Oil export regulations allow exchanges with adjacent and non-adjacent foreign states, each with different criteria. Licenses for non-adjacent foreign state exchanges are harder to obtain. Adjacent foreign state exchanges can be approved for transportation convenience. Mexican government proposed an exchange of heavy, sour crude oil for light, sweet crude oil to enhance refinery efficiency in the US and Mexico. The CEO of Pemex announced plans to increase Mexico's gasoline production by importing light crude from the US. The US is in discussions with Mexico about exporting light crude oil. The Department of Commerce approved license applications for the exchange of US crude oil for Mexican crude oil. Analysts suggest this represents a shift in US policy, but existing regulations allow for such exchanges. The existing regulations allow for exchange transactions with adjacent countries, including cross-border natural gas pipelines authorized by FERC in the United States. More than 20 natural gas pipelines link the US and Mexico, with U.S. pipelines doubling their capacity between 2008 and 2013. Current U.S. export capacity to Mexico is 4.9 bcf/d, expected to reach 8.4 bcf/d by the end of 2016. Private companies have not complained about the pipeline approval process speed, but delays for specific projects have been a concern. Unlike natural gas pipelines, cross-border oil pipelines require specific approvals. The U.S. Department of State issues Presidential Permits for cross-border oil pipelines, which has been a contentious process, as seen with the Keystone XL pipeline. Legislative proposals have aimed to modify the State Department's permitting authority, but none have been enacted. Energy cooperation between the U.S., Mexico, and Canada could increase as energy becomes a focal point in their relations. Efforts for greater energy cooperation between the U.S., Mexico, and Canada include advocating for regulatory harmonization, regional planning, and strategic investments in infrastructure. Suggestions also include offering technical assistance to Mexico, collaborating on environmentally responsible hydrocarbons development, and expanding educational exchanges in the petroleum sector. The Obama Administration's \"100,000 Strong in the Americas\" initiative could support these capacity-building efforts. The recent opening of Mexico's energy sector to foreign investors may impact ongoing trade negotiations for a Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement (TPP), involving the United States, Mexico, and Canada. This move could change the rules governing North American investment and trade. Mexico's energy sector was opened to private investors in 2014, with reforms allowing for private participation in the oil and gas industry. These reforms have the potential to boost energy production and improve economic competitiveness in Mexico. President Pe\u00f1a Nieto has successfully pushed through significant constitutional reforms, including the energy reforms that could impact North American investment and trade negotiations like the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement. Mexico's energy reforms aim to boost energy production and improve economic competitiveness, but face challenges in implementation. The next six months are crucial for success. Pemex must restructure to compete with other companies, CNH needs to conduct public bidding efficiently, and regulators must be established amidst budget constraints. The report will update Congress on oil and gas reforms in Mexico and their impact on economic performance, the U.S. energy sector, and bilateral relations."
