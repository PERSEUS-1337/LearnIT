    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Local Energy Supply and Resiliency Act of 2015\". Definitions are provided in the Act. The \"Local Energy Supply and Resiliency Act of 2015\" defines terms such as \"combined heat and power system\" and \"demand response\" in relation to energy efficiency and electricity usage. The \"Local Energy Supply and Resiliency Act of 2015\" defines terms related to energy efficiency and electricity usage, including \"combined heat and power system\" and \"demand response.\" Distributed energy refers to energy sources close to the point of use, while a district energy system provides thermal energy to buildings from one or more plants. The \"Local Energy Supply and Resiliency Act of 2015\" defines terms related to energy efficiency and electricity usage, including \"combined heat and power system\" and \"demand response.\" Distributed energy refers to energy sources close to the point of use, while a district energy system provides thermal energy to buildings from one or more plants. Islanding refers to a distributed generator or energy storage device continuing to power a location in the absence of electric power from the primary source. A microgrid is an integrated energy system consisting of interconnected loads and distributed energy resources within clearly defined electrical boundaries. The \"Local Energy Supply and Resiliency Act of 2015\" defines terms related to energy efficiency and electricity usage. It includes definitions for \"combined heat and power system,\" \"demand response,\" and \"distributed energy.\" Islanding and microgrids are also discussed in the context of distributed energy resources. The Act defines \"renewable energy source\" to include biomass, geothermal energy, hydropower, landfill gas, municipal solid waste, ocean energy, organic waste, photosynthetic processes, photovoltaic energy, solar energy, and wind. The term \"renewable thermal energy\" refers to heating or cooling energy from a renewable resource. The term \"thermal energy\" includes heating and cooling energy for various purposes. Waste thermal energy is energy contained in exhaust gases, steam, water, or oil. The term \"renewable thermal energy\" refers to waste energy sources such as water, jacket cooling heat, exhaust heat, hot liquids, flared gas, waste gas, industrial tail gas, pressure drop in gas, and condenser water. This energy is not being used in existing facilities. The term \"renewable thermal energy\" refers to waste energy sources not being used in existing facilities or in new facilities that are not conventionally used in comparable systems. SEC. 3. DISTRIBUTED ENERGY LOAN PROGRAM. The Secretary will establish a loan program for eligible entities to deploy distributed energy systems in specific projects or finance multiple systems through various financial assistance programs. Eligible entities include states, state energy offices, and tribal organizations. The Secretary will establish a loan program for eligible entities, including tribal organizations, institutions of higher education, and electric utilities, to deploy distributed energy systems. Selection requirements will ensure regional diversity among recipients of the loans. The Secretary will establish a loan program for eligible entities to deploy distributed energy systems, ensuring regional diversity among recipients. Selected projects aim to expand on existing technology deployment programs and achieve objectives such as improved energy supply security and resilience. The loan program aims to increase the use of local renewable energy resources and waste thermal energy sources through distributed energy implementation. It focuses on enhancing microgrids, demand response, and peak load management for consumers and the grid, especially in rural areas with high energy costs. Eligible entities receiving loans must use them for programs related to distributed energy systems. Loan terms and conditions will be provided by the Secretary. The Secretary will provide loans with terms and conditions determined in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury. Loans require a specific appropriation, repayment prospect, fixed interest rate, and a defined term. The loan term for repayment shall not exceed 20 years or 90% of the projected useful life of the asset. Payments support energy research, are available until expended, and early repayment incurs no penalty. Unused portions must be returned to receive a loan. To receive a loan, an eligible entity must agree to return any unused portion to the Treasury. Laborers and mechanics on construction projects funded by the loan must be paid prevailing wage rates. The Secretary must establish rules and procedures for the loan program within 180 days of the Act's enactment. Loans must be disbursed within 1 year of the rules being set. Recipients of loans must submit annual reports on program performance. Authorization of Appropriations: Sums necessary for carrying out the loan program are authorized to be appropriated. SEC. 4. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND GRANT PROGRAM. The Secretary will establish a program to provide technical assistance and grants to eligible entities for the planning and design of distributed energy systems. Technical assistance may include support for various activities related to these systems. The program will provide technical assistance and grants for planning and design of distributed energy systems, including activities like identification of opportunities, assessment of characteristics, utility interconnection, permitting, business planning, financial analysis, and engineering design. Information dissemination will include topics, case studies, computer software, and databases for system assessment and design. The program offers technical assistance and grants for planning and designing distributed energy systems. Eligibility is open to nonprofit or for-profit entities. Applications must be submitted to the Secretary following specified guidelines. Applications are accepted on a competitive basis at least once every 12 months. The Secretary gives priority to eligible entities with projects that promote renewable energy use, enhance energy infrastructure resilience to extreme weather events, improve microgrid feasibility in rural areas, and reduce environmental impact when selecting recipients for technical assistance and grants under the program. The Secretary may award grants to eligible entities for assessing opportunities, feasibility studies, guidance on implementation barriers, and detailed engineering costs. Rules and procedures for the program must be adopted within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The Secretary will issue grants under the Act within 120 days of the rules being issued. Reports on program performance must be submitted to Congress every 2 years, with an assessment of success upon program termination. $250,000,000 is authorized for this section. The Act authorizes $250,000,000 for fiscal years 2016 through 2020, to be used for grants and program performance reports."
