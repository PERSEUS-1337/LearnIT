    "content": "In 1995, the Chicago Fire Department administered an employment examination to over 26,000 applicants, categorizing them as \"well-qualified,\" \"qualified,\" or \"not qualified\" based on their scores. The city hired new firefighters from the well-qualified group on nine occasions over six years, but also hired from the qualified group once the well-qualified pool was exhausted. In 1997, black applicants in the qualified range filed a discrimination charge with the EEOC, alleging that the city's hiring practice had a disparate impact on race. In 1995, the Chicago Fire Department administered an employment examination to over 26,000 applicants, categorizing them as \"well-qualified,\" \"qualified,\" or \"not qualified\" based on their scores. Black applicants in the qualified range filed a discrimination charge with the EEOC, alleging disparate impact on race. The district court certified a class of over 6,000 black applicants who scored in the qualified range but were not hired. The city stipulated to the disparate impact but sought summary judgment based on a filing deadline. The district court ruled in favor of the applicants, ordering the city to hire 132 members of the class and awarding back pay to the rest. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed the decision, stating the applicants failed to meet the statutory filing deadline. The Supreme Court reviewed a case involving disparate impact discrimination in employment practices. Title VII prohibits two types of discrimination: disparate treatment and disparate impact. Disparate impact occurs when a neutral practice disproportionately affects protected individuals. The case questioned whether a plaintiff can assert a disparate-impact claim if they did not challenge the adoption of the practice in a timely manner. The Supreme Court reviewed a case involving disparate impact discrimination in employment practices. An employer can defend against a disparate impact claim by showing the practice is job-related and necessary. Individuals must file a charge with the EEOC within a specified period to challenge an employment practice. The question in the case was whether the city's subsequent use of a discriminatorily tiered hiring system was unlawful. The Supreme Court ruled unanimously in favor of applicants in a case involving disparate impact discrimination in employment practices. The Court held that such claims can be brought when challenging an employer's application of a discriminatory practice. The city's refusal to hire applicants below a certain score range was deemed an \"employment practice,\" allowing the applicants to proceed with their suit. The Court rejected the city's argument that discrimination only occurred when cutoff scores were first established. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of applicants in a case involving disparate impact discrimination in employment practices. The Court distinguished its rulings in earlier cases, including Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., emphasizing the need for a \"present violation\" within the limitations period for a Title VII claim. In a disparate impact case like Lewis, discriminatory intent is not required, unlike in disparate treatment cases. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of applicants in a case involving disparate impact discrimination in employment practices. The Court concluded that the applicants' claim was cognizable without requiring a showing of discriminatory intent. The Court also addressed the practical implications of its decision, noting that it may lead to an increase in disparate impact lawsuits challenging longstanding employment practices. The Court highlighted the potential for ongoing disparate impact if employers can continue using unlawful practices indefinitely without timely charges being brought. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of applicants in a case involving disparate impact discrimination in employment practices. The Court noted that its task is to give effect to the statute, allowing claims against an employer for disparate impact regardless of intent. If unintended, it is a problem for Congress, not the federal courts to fix."
