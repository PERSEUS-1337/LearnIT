Congress finds that foster youths face challenges in financial, emotional, educational, employment, housing, and permanency options. They lack guidance when transitioning to adulthood and despite previous legislation, still need more support. Studies show that foster youths have poorer outcomes compared to the general population. Over 20,000 youth age out of foster care annually, facing challenges in employment, education, homelessness, mental health, medical insurance coverage, criminal activity, and early pregnancy. Individual Development Accounts for foster youth are addressed in Section 3. Section 105 of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act is amended to allow for grants to States to establish Individual Development Accounts for foster youths. Governors must submit applications to the Secretary for these grants. The Secretary may require applications for grants to establish Individual Development Accounts for foster youth. The plan must address the needs of foster youth, promote self-support after leaving care, and create funding partnerships. Priority is given to states in grant allocation. Priority for states in grants and contracts under this paragraph is given to those allowing foster youths under 13 to have Individual Development Accounts. Each state receiving a grant or contract must establish Individual Development Accounts for foster youths, including those in kinship or guardianship placements. Individual Development Accounts for foster youths include deposits made by the youth, matching funds from public or private partnerships, and additional funds. Individual Development Accounts for foster youths involve funds deposited into the account from grants or contracts.

Individuals eligible to withdraw funds from an Individual Development Account include those transitioning from the foster care system, those not younger than age 18, and those with a waiver from the State for extenuating circumstances. Withdrawals can be made to secure and maintain stable housing.

The State program provides seed money for foster youth to attend money management training to become self-sufficient. The State program provides seed money for foster youth to attend money management training before accessing their individual development account. The account remains in the individual's name even after moving to a permanent living arrangement. Additionally, evaluations of individual development account programs are conducted. The Secretary conducts independent evaluations of State programs for individual development accounts, preparing reports on how account funds are spent. The State programs impact quality of life indicators for individuals eligible to withdraw funds from accounts. Money management training effectiveness and collaboration between States and partners are also described. The Secretary shall submit interim and final reports to relevant committees on recommendations for strengthening or modifying programs under subsection (a)(6) within 2 years of the FIRST Act enactment. The Secretary must submit a final report to committees within 3 years of enactment. No reduction in benefits for individuals with funds in an Individual Development Account. Interest accruing in an Individual Development Account shall be disregarded for any period when contributions are made into the account. Authorization of appropriations for individual development account programs is amended under the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act to allow for necessary funds for fiscal year 2008 and the following 4 years."
