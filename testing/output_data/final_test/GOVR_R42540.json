    "content": "Congress is considering legislation to add two new FDA user fee programs: GDUFA and BSUFA. In 2012, Secretary Kathleen Sebelius submitted the proposals to the Senate and House committees. PDUFA in 1992 authorized FDA to collect user fees from manufacturers for brand-name drugs and biological products. This was possible when FDA, industry, and Congress agreed on performance goals and the use of fees. The FDA implemented user fees for drug applications to support review processes and increase staff, reducing review times significantly. User fees now make up 35% of the FDA budget, with a larger contribution to the human drug program at 51%. Congress is considering adding two new user fee programs, GDUFA and BSUFA, following the success of the PDUFA program for brand-name drugs and biological products. The FDA is considering new user fee programs for drug applications, with legislation and performance goals agreements developed with industry representatives, patients, advocates, experts, and congressional committees. The report will provide context for agreement among FDA, Congress, industry, and patient groups, summarize legislative language submitted to authorizing committees, and outline FDA-industry agreements on performance goals. Authorization for FDA to collect fees under PDUFA and MDUFA expires on October 1, 2012. The bipartisan leadership of the Senate and House Committees on Health and Energy have emphasized the need to reauthorize FDA drug and device programs to prevent disruptions. Legislation has been introduced in both chambers, with minimal technical differences in the GDUFA and BSUFA provisions. The GDUFA and BSUFA proposals are nearly identical, adding new sections to the FFDCA. Generic drugs are described as bioequivalent to brand-name drugs. The Hatch-Waxman Act allows generic drug manufacturers to submit abbreviated NDAs referencing existing data. The generic drug applicant must scientifically demonstrate bioequivalence to the innovator drug, leading to lower development costs compared to innovators. Generic drugs make up over 70% of prescriptions in the US but account for a smaller percentage of spending due to lower prices. FDA lacks authority to collect user fees from generic drug manufacturers. In March 2012, the median review time for generic drug applications was 31 months with a backlog of over 2,500 applications. FDA has proposed a generic drug user fee in its annual budget requests to Congress since FY2008. The HHS proposed a generic drug user fee to Congress in January 2012 after negotiations with industry and consumer groups. The proposal, similar to PDUFA, includes provisions reflecting the generic drug industry and FDA's regulatory approach. It consists of draft legislative language and goals/procedures. The proposal to Congress includes draft legislative language and a goals/procedure agreement between FDA and the generic drug industry. It authorizes FDA to collect $299 million annually from FY2013 to FY2017 in fees from the industry, with inflation adjustments in subsequent years. The GDUFA proposal to Congress includes collecting $299 million annually in fees from the generic drug industry from FY2013 to FY2017. The fees include a one-time backlog fee and various types of fees for different activities, with limitations to ensure fees supplement congressional appropriations. The GDUFA proposal defines human generic drug activities, including review of submissions, approval letters, inspections, postmarket safety activities, and regulatory science. It also includes risk-based biennial inspections, parity of domestic and foreign inspection schedules, higher inspection fees for foreign facilities, streamlined hiring authority, and required annual reports. The generic drug user fee authority would end on October 1, 2017. The FDA's program goals for the five-year authorization period include reviewing and acting on 90% of complete electronic ANDAs within 10 months of submission, reviewing and acting on 90% of all pending applications by the end of FY2017, and committing to risk-adjusted inspections, efficiency enhancements, and regulatory science initiatives. A biosimilar is a biological product similar to a brand-name product, made from living organisms. The biotechnology industry began developing biologics for human therapeutic use in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The first FDA approval for a biotechnology drug, human insulin, was in 1982, followed by other biologics like human growth hormone, alpha interferon, tissue plasminogen activator, and erythropoietin. Biotechnology products are expected to increase in the pharmaceutical market, but the high cost of therapeutic biologics makes them unaffordable for many patients. The costs of commonly used biologic drugs in 2009 are reported, with Enbrel for rheumatoid arthritis at $26,000, Herceptin for breast cancer at $37,000, Rebif for multiple sclerosis at $40,000, Humira for Crohn's disease at $51,000, and Cerezyme for Gaucher's disease at $200,000. Biological products are regulated under the Public Health Service Act, while chemical drugs are regulated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984 allowed for the approval of generic drugs under the FFDCA. President Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act into law on March 23, 2010. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA) established a new regulatory authority within the FDA for biosimilars, similar to generic chemical drugs approval under the Hatch-Waxman Act. Biosimilars can be approved by demonstrating similarity to an existing biological product. FDA was authorized to collect user fees for biosimilars. Public input was requested in 2011, leading to negotiation sessions with industry representatives and meetings with patient advocacy groups and health professional societies. Recommendations for a new biosimilars user fee program were made. The FDA released recommendations for a new biosimilars user fee program in 2012, modeled after the PDUFA program. The program includes legislative language and performance goals, contingent on a minimum allocation of $20 million in non-user fee funds annually. The proposal to Congress would require industry to pay six types of fees based on inflation-adjusted amounts. The biosimilars user fee proposal includes fees for products in the development phase to generate revenue for the program and enable early meetings with FDA. Companies may pay a reactivation fee to resume product development after discontinuation. The proposed fees are based on inflation-adjusted PDUFA fee amounts. The biosimilars user fee proposal includes fees for product development, reactivation fees, and waivers for small businesses. The proposed fees are based on PDUFA fee amounts adjusted for inflation. The FDA Agreement effective October 1, 2017, sets performance goals for reviewing biosimilar applications. Targets include reviewing a percentage of applications within specific timeframes, starting at 70% in FY2013 and increasing to 90% in FY2017. The Agreement also covers topics like clinical holds, dispute resolution, and medication error reduction. Appendices include Generic Drug User Fee Proposal, Biosimilars User Fee Proposal, and Acronyms."
