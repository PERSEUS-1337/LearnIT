    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Stop AIDS in Prison Act of 2017\" and includes a comprehensive HIV/AIDS policy. The Bureau of Prisons will develop a policy for HIV testing, treatment, and prevention for inmates to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS, protect prison staff, provide medical care, raise awareness, and reduce transmission risk post-release. The Bureau of Prisons will consult with relevant agencies to develop HIV policy and draft regulations within a year of the Act's enactment. SEC. 3. REQUIREMENTS FOR POLICY. The policy created under section 2 mandates routine HIV testing for all inmates upon intake to a facility, with exceptions for those with previous records. Testing must also be provided to inmates admitted before the policy's effective date within 6 months. Health care personnel must provide HIV testing for inmates within 6 months of intake, along with other health services. Testing must comply with the opt-out provision. Pre-test and post-test counseling is required, which may be included with general health counseling. HIV/AIDS prevention education programs must be conducted frequently for all inmates. HIV/AIDS educational materials must be provided to inmates by various organizations and at different times during their incarceration. The materials should cover modes of transmission, prevention methods, treatment, and disease progression. Health care personnel in correctional facilities must provide culturally sensitive HIV/AIDS educational materials to inmates, available in multiple languages and designed for low literacy levels. Inmates have the right to request HIV testing once per year or if they suspect exposure, with health care personnel required to inform them of this right during orientation and periodically throughout their incarceration. Health care personnel in correctional facilities must encourage inmates to request HIV tests if sexually active, raped, use drugs, receive tattoos, or suspect exposure. Pregnant inmates must receive routine HIV testing with opt-out provision. Comprehensive treatment is provided to all inmates by health care personnel. Health care personnel must provide timely, comprehensive medical treatment, confidential counseling, and partner notification services to inmates who test positive for HIV. Treatment should follow current guidelines and medical practices, including discussing treatment options, adherence to therapy, and medication side effects with inmates. Inmates with HIV/AIDS should receive comprehensive treatment with FDA-approved medications. Health care and pharmacy personnel must ensure the facility has an adequate supply of medications and develop automatic renewal systems to prevent interruptions in care. Distribution procedures should be in place for timely and confidential access to medications. Confidentiality of inmate tests, diagnoses, and treatment must be ensured by health care personnel and correctional staff through procedures and regular training. Penalties for violations of confidentiality should be strictly enforced. HIV testing, counseling, and treatment should be provided in a confidential setting allowing inmates to request these services as routine medical care. Health care personnel must provide routine HIV testing to inmates before their release into the community, with testing waived if release occurs suddenly. Testing must comply with the opt-out provision. Inmates who test positive for HIV or already have HIV/AIDS should receive appropriate care. Health care personnel must provide confidential counseling on managing medical conditions, referrals to appropriate providers and social services, and a 30-day supply of medication before an inmate's release into the community. Inmates have the right to refuse routine HIV testing and must be informed orally and in writing. Refusal will not result in disciplinary action. Health care personnel must document HIV testing done under section 4014(b) of title 18, US Code, separately from routine testing. Inmates must be promptly notified of their HIV test results. SEC. 4. CHANGES IN EXISTING LAW. Section 4014(a) of title 18, United States Code, is amended to remove certain phrases and require testing for infection unless declined. Section 4014(d) is amended to include the Stop AIDS in Prison Act of 2017. Section 4014(e) addresses screening as part of routine procedures. The amendment to Section 4014(e) of title 18, United States Code, now includes that the initial test under this section must be part of routine health screening at intake. SEC. 5. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. The Bureau must provide a report to Congress on policies for testing, treatment, and prevention education programs for diseases transmitted through sexual activity and drug use. Additionally, the Bureau must report annually on the incidence of these diseases among inmates.
