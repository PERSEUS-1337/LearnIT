The \"Affordable Housing Preservation Act of 2006\" excludes gain from qualified sales or exchanges of eligible multifamily housing property, limited to depreciation adjustments. Qualified sales or exchanges involve preservation entities agreeing to maintain affordability and use restrictions for a specified period. The \"Affordable Housing Preservation Act of 2006\" requires preservation entities to maintain affordability and use restrictions on eligible multifamily housing properties, which must be recorded as restrictive covenants. These restrictions apply to all successors of the preservation entity and are consistent with the requirements outlined in the Act. The \"Affordable Housing Preservation Act of 2006\" mandates that eligible multifamily housing properties must be maintained as affordable housing, meeting specific criteria to qualify. Residents can continue to reside in the property without affecting its affordable housing status. The \"Qualified Sale or Exchange\" under the Affordable Housing Preservation Act of 2006 requires certification by the housing agency that the transferee is a qualified preservation entity, affordability restrictions will be maintained, new capital will be invested in property restoration, and the transferor's gain exclusion from gross income is determined.

The housing agency is responsible for ensuring the preservation entity's plan restores the property's condition, monitoring affordability and use restrictions for at least 30 years. The preservation entity must notify the IRS of any noncompliance with the multifamily housing property requirements. If the property is found to be out of compliance, the entity's tax will be increased by 12.5% of the noncompliant portion. The tax consequences for a qualified sale or exchange of eligible multifamily housing property include a reduction in the determined amount by 3.33 percent for each year the property was in compliance. A portion of the gain from the sale that is treated as ordinary income under section 1250 can be excluded from gross income.
