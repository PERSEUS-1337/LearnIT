    "content": "This paper enhances named entity recognition by using black-box LSTM encoders for sequence-labeling. It decouples NER into entity chunking and typing, analyzing how the model learns text patterns. A deep cross-Bi-LSTM encoder is explored for better global interaction capture. Named Entity Recognition (NER) involves locating entity chunks in text and classifying their types. NER has evolved from a structured prediction task to sequential token labeling, similar to text chunking and part-of-speech tagging. Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) has been effective for sequence labeling in NER tasks. This study aims to understand how LSTM learns patterns for NER by decoupling it into entity chunking and typing subtasks. A parallel self-attention mechanism is proposed to enhance Bi-LSTM performance. The study introduces a self-attentive Bi-LSTM model for Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks, which outperforms traditional Bi-LSTMs by utilizing parallel context vectors for each token. The proposed model also incorporates a cross construction of deep Bi-LSTMs to overcome limitations and achieve state-of-the-art results in sequence labeling NER. The paper details the formulation of the Bi-LSTM-CNN model, the computation of the self-attention mechanism, and presents empirical results in Section 5. In Section 6, the cross-Bi-LSTM-CNN model is introduced and evaluated theoretically for sequence-labeling NER. The model builds on previous work by incorporating multiple layers of LSTM cells per direction and using a CNN to compute character-level word vectors. The study provides insights into how sequence-labeling models address NER challenges and proposes improvements with cross-Bi-LSTM-CNN. The Bi-LSTM-CNN model focuses on constructing a new representation of external lexicon features. Previous models used intensive feature engineering and CRF for global context in sequential-labeling NER. BID17 developed the Illinois NER tagger with feature-based perceptrons, finding minimal usefulness of Viterbi decoding. Recent research shows empirical improvements with LSTM or CNN-based encoders. Recent research on LSTM or CNN-based encoders has shown improvements with CRF, which discourages illegal predictions by modeling class transition probabilities. In contrast, self-attention and crossBi-LSTM structures capture global patterns and extract better features for improved class observation likelihoods. Attention mechanisms have been successful in natural language tasks, reducing the burden on LSTM to compress all information into a single hidden state. A token-level parallel self-attention mechanism is proposed for sequential token-labeling in this work. The curr_chunk discusses the use of a parallel self-attention mechanism for sequential token-labeling, utilizing raw features like word and character embeddings. Character-trigram CNN with max-over-time pooling is applied to generate a character-based word vector. Word token length is unified to 20 through truncation and padding. The curr_chunk describes the use of pre-trained word vectors and one-hot word capitalization features in a model utilizing LSTM cells and Bi-LSTMs for sequence processing. The model aims to capture higher-level features by stacking four distinct LSTM cells. The curr_chunk discusses the use of 4 stacked LSTM cells to capture higher-level representations, with 100d LSTM cells used in all experiments. It also explains the probability calculation for token classes using affine and softmax transformations. Additionally, it introduces the use of 5 chunk labels to denote different types of named entities. The curr_chunk introduces a token-level self-attention mechanism computed after the autoregressive Bi-LSTM, allowing tokens to capture cross interactions between past and future sequences simultaneously. This mechanism projects hidden states to different subspaces for query vectors, enhancing sequence labeling for NER. The curr_chunk discusses the use of multi-head attention in NLP tasks, where different attention heads are used to compute attention weights and context vectors for each token. This mechanism allows tokens to capture cross interactions between past and future sequences simultaneously. The curr_chunk discusses the application of Bi-LSTM-CNN with attention mechanism on the OntoNotes 5.0 English NER corpus, which is a diverse dataset collected from various sources for joint research on NLP tasks. The models need to be robust to capture different linguistic patterns due to the dataset's diversity and noise. The curr_chunk discusses the challenges of achieving state-of-the-art NER results on the OntoNotes 5.0 English NER corpus due to the diverse linguistic patterns and 18 types of entities to classify. The models were trained with specific hyperparameters and evaluated for NER performance. The models were trained with specific hyperparameters and evaluated for NER performance, achieving a new state-of-the-art result with a clear margin using a parallel self-attention mechanism. By utilizing a parallel self-attention mechanism (ATT), a new state-of-the-art result (88.29 F1) was achieved, showing significant improvement over previous systems. The attention mechanism also provided insights into how Bi-LSTM learns and handles different NER subtasks like entity chunking and typing. The entity chunking task was decoupled from sequence-labeling NER, with performance comparisons shown in tables. The table displays the performance of different setups compared to the full model, with columns showing the impact of removing specific information on model predictions. The Bi-LSTM-CNN+ATT model assigns the task of predicting {I} to the attention mechanism, with a significant decrease in performance when global context is absent. The model strongly favors predicting 'I' given its global context. Different attention heads send signals on entity chunking, with NativeH-Bi-LSTM-CNN underperforming compared to models with attention. Entity chunking is crucial in sequence-labeling NER. In sequence-labeling NER, Bi-LSTM struggles to compress all necessary information in each hidden state to correctly label multi-token entities. Visualizing attention weights reveals patterns in classifying Begin, Inside, and End of entities. Models with attention outperform NativeH-Bi-LSTM-CNN in entity chunking. The Bi-LSTM-CNN model without attention struggles with entity chunking, while attention-based models show patterns in classifying entity boundaries. Attention weights indicate a focus on previous or following tokens to signal Begin, Inside, and End of entities. This behavior is observed in the attention maps of \u03b1 2, \u03b1 3, and \u03b1 4 for the White House entity. The attention maps of \u03b1 2, \u03b1 3, and \u03b1 4 show patterns in classifying entity boundaries, with a focus on previous or following tokens to signal Begin, Inside, and End of entities. The heat maps reveal how related labels {B, I, E} are collectively handled, highlighting the importance of modeling interactions between future and past contexts for sequence-labeling NER. This motivates the use of a deep cross-Bi-LSTM encoder. When entity chunking is separated from NER, the entity typing task requires a model to label entities accurately. HC all yields notably different performance from NativeH in entity classification. C5 shows a strong signal for language, while NativeH struggles in this class without attention. Qualitatively, HC correctly classifies tokens involving Dutch and Chinese languages, while NativeH wrongly predicts nationality. With attention, the model correctly attends to different languages simultaneously. The model attends to Dutch, English, Chinese, and Taiwanese simultaneously, learning cross-interactions between entities. Attention weights capture past and future context interactions, revealing deep cross-context patterns. The deep Bi-LSTM-CNN model captures cross-context patterns by considering past and future context for each token. It struggles to classify certain phrases correctly, even with training data, due to the complexity of interactions between entities. The Cross-Bi-LSTM-CNN model addresses limitations of the conventional Bi-LSTM-CNN by interleaving hidden features between LSTM layers to capture interactions between past and future contexts for each token. The study experimented with cross construction to enhance the performance of Bi-LSTM-CNN in named entity recognition. They decoupled the task into entity chunking and typing, utilizing a fast parallel self-attention mechanism to determine multi-token entity boundaries. The importance of capturing global patterns across tokens was highlighted, along with the limitations of traditional deep Bi-LSTM-CNN models. The proposed parallel self-attention method was shown to offer interpretability and improved performance. The study introduced parallel self-attention to correlate past and future contexts, along with deep cross-Bi-LSTM-CNN for extracting global context features. Both models achieved state-of-the-art results in sequence-labeling NER."
