    "content": "The Constitution requires that after a bill passes both houses of Congress, it must be presented to the President for approval or veto within 10 days. If the President takes no action, the bill becomes law without his signature. Congress is not bound by a time limit to present a bill to the President after completing its own action. Delays in presenting bills to the President have occurred for various reasons. Delays in presenting bills to the President have occurred for various reasons, including constitutional requirements and institutional reasons. The report discusses possible reasons for delays in presentment, recent instances of delay, and restrictions against such delays in the Constitution and congressional rules. It also explores how the House might address delays by considering them as a question of the privileges of the House. The Constitution requires bills to be presented to the President for approval. However, Congress may have reasons to temporarily withhold a bill from the President, such as during his extended absence. This could allow Congress to avoid a potential veto and make the bill law without the President's approval after 10 days. The Constitution requires bills to be presented to the President for approval. However, Congress may withhold presenting a measure likely to be vetoed until the President is absent for more than 10 days. To avoid complications, Congress and the Executive sometimes arrange for acts of Congress delivered during the President's absence to be considered presented only upon his return. The possibility of a \"pocket veto\" arises when Congress adjourns before the President can return a measure, allowing the President to reject it without the chance of a veto override. The pocket veto allows the President to reject a measure without returning it to Congress for a possible override. In the past, it was assumed that the President could only sign or veto a measure while Congress was in session. This led to the practice of the President signing or vetoing last-minute legislation before Congress adjourned sine die to avoid pocket vetoes. Congress had an incentive to present enrolled measures before adjournment to prevent delays in presentment. In the past, it was common for the President to sign or veto measures before Congress adjourned to avoid pocket vetoes. However, in recent decades, it has become accepted that the President can sign acts of Congress after adjournment, making the pocket veto a presidential option. If an act is presented within 10 days of an expected adjournment, the President can choose to withhold action until after adjournment and exercise a pocket veto. Disagreement remains on what types of adjournment allow for a pocket veto. Several recent Administrations claim any adjournment over three days permits a pocket veto. The pocket veto power allows the President to veto a bill by taking no action if Congress adjourns for more than three days. There is disagreement on when the pocket veto can be used, with some administrations limiting it to final adjournments of Congress. The Supreme Court has provided some clarification on the scope of the pocket veto power, but there is tension between different interpretations. The pocket veto power allows the President to veto a bill by taking no action if Congress adjourns for more than three days. Recent lower court rulings suggest that a pocket veto during any adjournment of either or both houses within a session may be unconstitutional if Congress appoints an agent to receive veto messages. Conflicting guidance exists for adjournments between sessions of the same Congress. Congress has at times responded to the possibility of a pocket veto during a recess by withholding bills until fewer than 10 days remained in the recess. The practice of withholding bills temporarily from presentment to protect Congress's ability to vote on overriding Presidential vetoes has been observed. Delays in presenting measures in recent years seem to be more politically motivated rather than institutional. If Congress can delay presentment to preserve its prerogatives, it may be difficult to argue against delays for other reasons. These delays have occurred when Congress and the Presidency were under different political control. In 1991, there was a delay in presenting a bill extending unemployment benefits to the President, causing political tensions between the majority and minority parties in Congress. The bill was held for eight days in the Senate to potentially delay an override vote. In 1995, the President vetoed the first legislative branch appropriation bill for FY1996, leading Congress to pass identical provisions in a new bill on November 2. The bill was eventually presented on November 18 and signed the following day. In 1996, bills to ban partial-birth abortions and regulate product liability suits were cleared by Congress but were not presented to the President immediately. The delay in presenting product liability suits to the President, despite being cleared by Congress, raises questions about possible constraints on Congress's actions in presenting measures. The longest delay in presentment in the past two decades was 176 days for a bill from the 105th Congress. Another bill from the 106th Congress was enrolled but ultimately never presented, instead being tabled by concurrent resolution. It is unclear if any specific disputes between the branches led to these delays. If the Constitution does not provide constraints, rules of Congress itself would be the likely source of such constraints. The administrative actions between final congressional action on a measure and its presentation to the President are governed by internal congressional proceedings. These processes are regulated by rules derived from joint rules in effect from 1789 to 1876 and the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946. The final text of the measure is prepared through enrollment by the Clerk of the House or Secretary of the Senate, and then examined for correctness before presentation. The final text of a measure is prepared through enrollment by the Clerk of the House or Secretary of the Senate, signed by the Speaker and Vice President, and then presented to the President. These processes are governed by rules originating in 1789 and continued through usage, with bills examined by a joint committee before presentation. After bills are enrolled, they are examined by a joint committee before being signed by the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate. The committee then presents the bill to the President for approval. These procedures also apply to joint resolutions. The rules governing this process have remained largely unchanged since 1789, with the Committee on House Administration taking over the functions of the Joint Committee on Enrolled Bills in 1946. The Committee on House Administration took over the functions of the Joint Committee on Enrolled Bills in 1946. In the 107th Congress, the responsibility to examine enrolled bills was transferred to the Clerk of the House. The duties related to acts from the Senate are overseen by the Secretary of the Senate. The signing of enrolled measures by the Speaker and President of the Senate is not explicitly regulated. In cases where measures were not signed in time, resolutions were adopted in the next session to authorize their signing or presentation. In recent times, delays in enrolling measures before adjournment have become more common. Both houses have authorized their presiding officers to sign enrolled measures during adjournments, including recesses within a session and adjournments of fewer than three days. The Speaker now authorizes specific Members to sign bills in her absence, while the Senate allows its President and President pro tempore to sign enrolled measures. In recent times, delays in enrolling measures before adjournment have become more common. Both houses have authorized their presiding officers to sign enrolled measures during adjournments, including recesses within a session and adjournments of fewer than three days. The Speaker now authorizes specific Members to sign bills in her absence, while the Senate allows its President and President pro tempore to sign enrolled measures. The beginning of a new Congress permitted the President, President pro tempore, and Acting President pro tempore to sign enrolled bills, increasing flexibility in timing but with no specific instances of using this flexibility for a particular purpose. This led to a change in House Rule I, clause 4 in 1981, allowing the Speaker to sign enrolled bills whether or not the House is in session, further strengthening the justification for flexibility in timing the signature of enrolled measures. The process of enrolling measures may require a certain amount of time due to the physical production of the final text. The time needed for verifying the enrolled text varies based on the measure's length and complexity. Signature by presiding officers may only require minimal time, but could be delayed by other business or the transmission of the measure between houses. The process of enrolling measures may require time due to the physical production of the final text and verification based on length and complexity. Delays in signing by presiding officers could occur due to other business or transmission between houses. The old joint rules only specified that the Joint Committee on Enrolled Bills report \"forthwith\" when a measure is correctly enrolled, without setting time limits for other steps. The time constraints for enrolling and presenting measures differ between the Reorganization Act and joint rules. The former Committee on Enrolled Bills had to transmit measures promptly for signature, while the Reorganization Act does not specify a timeline. Present rules require immediate presentment to the President after signature by the Speaker and President of the Senate. The term \"forthwith\" lacks substantive meaning in this context. No explicit time limits exist for the enrollment process or for officers examining the enrollment. The requirement to report measures for signature \"forthwith\" may still be followed. There are no time limits for the presiding officers to sign enrolled measures, but presentment is typically immediate unless delayed due to the President's absence or to avoid a pocket veto. Delays in presentment may occur by withholding signed measures or pausing earlier in the process. Despite the lack of specific mandates, there is precedent for enforcing timely actions in presenting an act of Congress to the President. House Rule IX defines questions of privileges as those affecting the House collectively, its safety, dignity, and integrity of proceedings. Such questions must be presented as a resolution and ruled on by the Speaker for consideration under the one-hour rule within two days of session. The House of Representatives can take action to enforce presenting a measure to the President in a timely manner, based on past resolutions. The Senate lacks a similar mechanism but could potentially address the issue through a resolution. The earliest known instance of such action dates back to 1888. The House of Representatives can enforce timely presentation of a bill to the President. In a specific incident, a resolution was proposed to address a delay in presenting a bill, which was signed by the Speaker and President of the Senate. This led to a question of privilege being raised, indicating the potential for such situations to be considered privileged. The Speaker pro tempore ruled that the Constitution does not specify a time limit for presenting bills to the President, with an average of three days for bills to reach the President. The delay in this case was only one day, leading to the decision that it was not a question of privilege. The ruling stated that delay in presenting a measure may raise a question of privilege under certain circumstances, emphasizing the importance of timely transmission of bills to the President. The Chair affirmed that if the resolution were properly before the House, it could be adopted, but did not specify the outcome if there was an unreasonable delay. The House could adopt a resolution regarding the timely transmission of bills to the President, emphasizing the importance of completing the enrollment process promptly. The House resolution addressed delays in transmitting enrolled bills to the President, establishing a precedent that such delays could be a question of the House's privileges. The resolution was quickly disposed of by laying it on the table. In 1888, the bill was ready for presentment, while in 1991, the enrollment process was not completed. The House resolution in 1888 established that delays in transmitting bills to the President could be a question of the House's privileges. The integrity of House proceedings could be affected by delays in preparing a measure for presentment, depending on the reasonableness of the delay. Institutional reasons may be acceptable grounds for delay. The 1888 case established that delays in presenting bills to the President could be a question of the House's privileges. Delays in preparing a measure for presentment could affect the integrity of House proceedings, even without specific time limits in place. Delays at points where action is required \"forthwith\" could strengthen the case for House integrity being compromised. The 1888 case highlighted delays in presenting bills to the President as a matter of House privileges. Delays in preparing measures for presentment could impact House proceedings' integrity, especially at critical action points. The resolution proposed to address delays by directing immediate transmission of bills to the President. Delays in bill processing can involve preparation or signatures, leading to resolutions directing prompt action by House officials. In a 1991 case, a resolution addressed a Senate bill's incomplete enrollment, suggesting inquiries to the Senate for updates. No concrete information exists on House resolutions addressing such situations. Delays in bill processing can lead to resolutions directing prompt action by House officials, but no concrete information is available on how directives in such resolutions are implemented or enforced. The time from second chamber passage of conference reports to presentment to the President has been calculated, with the shortest period being zero days. During the period examined, the time from second chamber passage of conference reports to presentment to the President ranged from zero to 176 days, with over 40 instances of same-day presentment. The average number of days for each Congress is detailed in a table."
