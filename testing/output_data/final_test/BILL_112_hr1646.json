    "content": "The \"American Angler Preservation Act\" is the short title of the Act. It aims to improve scientific review. Section 302 of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act is amended to require a peer review process by non-governmental entities for recommendations to increase or decrease annual catch limits by 20 percent or more. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act is amended to require peer review for recommendations on annual catch limits. Additionally, recommendations must be submitted to Congress. SEC. 3. Extension of time period for rebuilding certain overfished fisheries. Section 304(e) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act is amended to allow for an extension of the time period for rebuilding certain overfished fisheries, not to exceed 10 years, with exceptions based on biology of the stock, environmental conditions, or international agreements. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act allows for a 10-year extension for rebuilding overfished fisheries under certain conditions, such as when the cause of decline is beyond the Council's jurisdiction or when sustaining fishing communities is necessary. The extension must be supported by evidence of a positive rebuilding trend in fish stocks. The Magnuson-Stevens Act allows for a 10-year extension for rebuilding overfished fisheries if there is evidence of a positive rebuilding trend or a substantial change to the biomass rebuilding target. The Magnuson-Stevens Act allows for a 10-year extension for rebuilding overfished fisheries if there is evidence of a positive rebuilding trend or if the biomass rebuilding target exceeds the highest abundance of the fish stock in the 25-year period preceding. The Magnuson-Stevens Act allows for a 10-year extension for rebuilding overfished fisheries if there is evidence of a positive rebuilding trend or if the biomass rebuilding target exceeds the highest abundance of the fish stock in the 25-year period preceding. Factors contributing to overfished status include commercial, residential, and industrial development in coastal areas, agricultural activities, predator/prey relationships, and environmental/ecological changes in marine conditions. If the Secretary determines extended rebuilding time is necessary, the maximum allowed time for rebuilding may not exceed the initial 10-year period plus additional time as specified. The term 'on a positive rebuilding trend' refers to a substantial increase in fish stock abundance since the implementation of the rebuilding plan. It includes the expected time to rebuild the stock without fishing mortality and the mean generation time of the stock. SEC. 4 amends the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act to set a 60-day deadline for disaster declarations. SEC. 5 addresses the approval of limited access privilege programs. Amendment to the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act requires a petition for a limited access privilege program in certain fishery councils to take effect. The development of a limited access privilege program for a fishery requires a petition from a group of fishermen representing over 50% of eligible fishermen. The proposed plan must be approved by a two-thirds vote of eligible fishermen in the fishery. The Secretary reviews and certifies a petition for a limited access privilege program in a fishery if signed by over 50% of eligible fishermen. Eligible fishermen are defined as permit holders. A limited access privilege program in a fishery will terminate after five years unless at least two-thirds of eligible fishermen approve its continuation. Eligible fishermen are defined as holders of permits issued under a fishery management plan. SEC. 6. CERTIFICATION REQUIRED FOR FISHERY CLOSURE. Certification Required for Fishery Closure under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act prohibits fishery closures affecting small businesses without certification from the Secretary. The closure must be the only option for sustainability, with recent stock assessments reviewed. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act requires certification from the Secretary for fishery closures impacting small businesses. The closure must be the last resort for sustainability, with recent stock assessments peer-reviewed by non-governmental entities using at least 2 models. The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act requires certification from the Secretary for fishery closures impacting small businesses. The closure must be a last resort for sustainability, with a review of options other than closure within 90 days. The effects of closures on coastal communities, including job losses and impacts on small businesses, must be assessed. The Secretary must report to Congress on fishery closures within the 5-year period, including reasons, duration, and impact on coastal communities. The report should also include job losses expected within a year of closure initiation. The Secretary must report to Congress on fishery closures within a 5-year period, detailing reasons, duration, impact on coastal communities, and expected job losses. Definitions include \"fishery,\" \"Secretary,\" and \"small business.\""
