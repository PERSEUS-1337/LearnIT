    "content": "The Pipeline Safety and Community Empowerment Act of 2010 includes provisions such as notice to property owners, facility operation standards, pipeline inspection requirements, shut off valves, leak detection, and public education programs. It also references Title 49 of the United States Code. SEC. 2 of the Pipeline Safety and Community Empowerment Act of 2010 states that any reference to an amendment or repeal in the Act shall be considered to be made to a section of Title 49, United States Code. SEC. 3 requires notice to property owners and residents. Section 60102(c)(4) is amended to require pipeline facility owners to notify property owners and residents within 2,000 feet of a transmission line about the proximity of the line and its specific location on private residential property. Pipeline facility owners must provide notice to property owners and residents within 2,000 feet of a transmission line, including electronic access to information, a map of the pipeline system, and other relevant details as determined by the Secretary. The notice must be given within 2 years of the enactment of the requirement and every 3 years thereafter. SEC. 4. FACILITY OPERATION INFORMATION STANDARDS. \"Section 60102(d) amended to require pipeline operators to maintain and provide information to relevant authorities within one year of the Pipeline Safety and Community Empowerment Act of 2010. The Secretary will keep a record of the information submitted.\" The Secretary will file the information submitted by pipeline operators as required by the Pipeline Safety and Community Empowerment Act of 2010. Required periodic inspection of pipelines using internal inspection devices is mandated by SEC. 5. Section 60102(f)(2) is amended to require periodic inspections of pipelines using internal inspection devices at least once every 5 years. The Secretary shall require use of an inspection method certified to be as effective as using a device for detecting corrosion, pipe stress, and ensuring pipeline safety in segments where devices cannot be used. The Secretary shall prohibit a pipeline segment from operating under high pressure if it cannot be inspected with a device or using an inspection method as prescribed by standards. SEC. 6. AUTOMATIC OR REMOTE SHUT OFF VALVES. Section 60102(j) is amended to require owners or operators of covered pipeline facilities to install automatic or remote shut off valves within one year to reduce risks in case of a rupture. Minimum standards apply to new or replaced facilities, as well as existing facilities near earthquake faults. Minimum standards apply to covered pipeline facilities near earthquake faults. For facilities within 10 miles of a fault, standards must be implemented within 2 years, while for other facilities, implementation must occur within 5 years. The term 'covered pipeline facility' refers to pipelines in Class 3 or 4 locations. A 'significant earthquake fault' is one with a 1 in 10 chance of a magnitude 6.7 earthquake in the next 50 years. The term 'covered pipeline facility' refers to pipelines in Class 3 or 4 locations, with a significant earthquake fault defined as having a 1 in 10 chance of a magnitude 6.7 earthquake in the next 50 years, as determined by the Secretary based on information compiled by the United States Geological Survey. SEC. 7. AVAILABILITY OF INDUSTRY STANDARDS AND PROCEDURES ADOPTED IN REGULATIONS BY REFERENCE. The Secretary must ensure that industry standards and procedures referenced in Federal pipeline safety regulations are easily accessible to the public at no cost. This applies to regulations issued before or after the enactment of this subsection. SEC. 8. LEAK DETECTION. Section 60102 is amended to require pipeline facilities to have leak detection systems capable of promptly detecting leaks. The Secretary will establish performance standards for these systems within 18 months. The amendment requires natural gas transmission pipeline facilities to implement flow verification methods, increase aerial surveillance for remote pipelines, and meet additional requirements determined by the Secretary to enhance leak detection capabilities. SEC. 9 amends Section 60109 to include considerations for identifying high consequence areas based on seismicity, pipe age, and inspection methods. SEC. 10 focuses on public education programs. Section 60116 is amended to include an approval process for public education programs submitted by pipeline facility owners. The Secretary may review these programs as part of inspections and can take action if programs are inadequate. Additionally, the effectiveness of these programs will be assessed by the Comptroller General. The Comptroller General will assess the effectiveness of public education programs under Section 60116 and submit a report to Congress within one year of enactment."
