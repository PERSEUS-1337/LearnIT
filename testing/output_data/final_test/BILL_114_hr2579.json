Additionally, there will be an evaluation on the impact of chronic kidney disease codes. The Secretary will evaluate the impact of removing chronic kidney disease diagnosis codes in the 2014 risk adjustment model and analyze best practices of MA plans to slow disease progression. Additionally, there will be an evaluation of including 10 percent of encounter data in computing payment for 2016. The Secretary will evaluate the impact of incorporating encounter data in risk scores, analyzing data accuracy and completeness, issuing recommendations for improvement, and not increasing the percentage of encounter data used without public release and weighting information. The Secretary will evaluate the impact of incorporating encounter data in risk scores, analyzing data accuracy and completeness, issuing recommendations for improvement, and ensuring that the data reflects the degree and cost of care coordination under MA plans. Evaluations and analyses will include an actuarial opinion from the Chief Actuary of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services about the reasonableness of the methods, assumptions, and conclusions. The Secretary shall consult with the Medicare Payment. The Secretary will consult with the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission and stakeholders, such as managed care organizations and beneficiary groups, for evaluations and analyses.

The Secretary will periodically report to Congress on revisions made to the risk adjustment system, including evaluations conducted every third year starting in 2017. Adjustments must not hinder activities aligned with national health policy goals. The Secretary must ensure that changes to health status do not impede Medicare Advantage organizations from activities aligned with national health policy goals, such as early detection, care coordination, health risk assessments, and chronic disease management. Additionally, there must be an opportunity for public review and comment on adjustment factors for 2017 and beyond. The Secretary must provide an opportunity for public review and comment on proposed changes for at least 60 days before implementing them. SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. Congress acknowledges that the star rating system for Medicare Advantage plans lacks proper accounting for the socioeconomic status of enrollees and their eligibility for medical assistance under title XIX. Congress will collaborate with stakeholders to ensure the system accurately reflects these factors."
