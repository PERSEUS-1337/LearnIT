    "content": "The \"Small Business Tax Flexibility Act of 2005\" allows qualified small businesses to elect a taxable year ending in a month from April to November. A qualified small business can choose a taxable year ending in April through November or an equivalent annual period. The election must be made by the due date for the first taxable year and remains effective until terminated. Termination occurs under specific circumstances. An entity's election to choose a taxable year can be terminated if it fails to meet the gross receipts test, no longer qualifies as an S corporation, or terminates. Upon termination, the entity must determine its taxable year using another permitted method. If an election under paragraph (1)(A) is terminated, resulting in a short taxable year, net profits are included in income over 4 taxable years, while net losses are deductible in the first taxable year after the termination. Definitions for the term 'qualified small business' under this section include an entity with an active trade or business, eligible for start-up expenditure amortization, and classified as a start-up business. An entity qualifies as a start-up business if no more than 75 percent is owned by someone who conducted a similar trade within the past year. The term 'required taxable year' is defined in section 444(e). The term 'required taxable year' is defined in section 444(e) and rules similar to section 444(d)(3) are prescribed to prevent abuse through tiered structures. Section 444(a)(1) is amended to include section 444A in the Code. Section 444A allows qualified small businesses to choose a taxable year ending between April and November. The amendments apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2005."
