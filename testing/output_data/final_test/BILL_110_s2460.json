    "content": "Extension of moratorium on implementation of rule regarding federal-state financial partnership under Medicaid and SCHIP, and on finalization of rule regarding treatment of graduate medical education under Medicaid. Moratorium also on finalization of outpatient Medicaid rule making similar change. Congress found that a proposed rule published in 2007 aimed to make significant changes to the Federal-State financial partnership under Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Programs by imposing cost limits on payments to governmentally operated providers and restricting the sources of non-Federal shares. The proposed rule published in 2007 would significantly change Medicaid payments by removing payments for graduate medical education, impacting the Federal-State financial partnership and State programs. The proposed rule in 2007 would have a significant impact on States, providers, and beneficiaries by forcing billions of dollars in payment reductions. This would hinder providers' ability to offer essential services, including emergency care and education for medical professionals. After Congress approved a one-year moratorium in the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act of 2007, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services submitted a final rule on May 25, 2007, which was similar to the proposed regulation. The final rule published in May significantly differs from the January proposed regulation, accelerating negative impacts on States, providers, and beneficiaries, undermining Congress's moratorium intent. Additionally, a proposed rule in May on graduate medical education was not expected by Congress and also undermines the moratorium. Another proposed rule in September 2007 would bring significant changes to Medicaid payments by redefining outpatient services. The text discusses the need for an extension of the moratorium on changes to Medicaid payments, specifically focusing on outpatient hospital services. Congress did not anticipate ongoing changes that would limit State flexibility in making adequate Medicaid payments. The extension of the prohibition is necessary to align with Congressional intent. The text discusses the need to extend the moratorium on changes to Medicaid payments for outpatient hospital services. This includes finalizing provisions from a proposed rule published in 2007."
