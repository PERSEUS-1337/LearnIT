The government, through NIST and the NSA, plays a crucial role in developing tools for global electronic communication security. It is essential to actively promote privacy and computer security to maintain trust in the government and US products. Allegations of undermining encryption standards weaken privacy and trust. The United States may suffer economic losses due to surveillance concerns, potentially losing 10% of the cloud computing market to foreign competitors, amounting to $35 billion in lost sales by 2016. NIST's cryptographic expertise is globally recognized, but trust in their encryption standards is crucial for widespread adoption. To restore trust in US encryption standards and products, the government should be prohibited from undermining security. The government should be prohibited from undermining the security of US technologies essential for global commerce. The government should ensure federal information security management. The government is required to ensure federal information security management by implementing measures to prevent intentional weakening or bypassing of privacy, security, or encryption protections in any standard or guideline. The National Institute of Standards and Technology Act is amended to prevent intentional weakening or bypassing of privacy, security, or encryption protections in federal standards and guidelines. The National Institute of Standards and Technology Act is amended to update the System Security and Privacy Advisory Board to the Information Security and Privacy Advisory Board under section 21. SEC. 4. SECURITY OF COMPUTER HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, AND ELECTRONIC DEVICES. In this section, definitions are provided for terms such as \"agent of a foreign power,\" \"foreign power,\" \"covered person,\" \"covered product,\" and \"element of the intelligence community.\" These definitions are crucial for understanding the security of computer hardware, software, and electronic devices. In 1947, the Federal Government is prohibited from intercepting shipments of covered products to introduce mechanisms that bypass privacy or security protections. Intelligence agencies cannot mandate or contract manufacturers for device installations. The Federal Government cannot require manufacturers to insert mechanisms into products that would allow bypassing privacy or security protections, except for lawful surveillance activities authorized by court orders. The Federal Government cannot mandate manufacturers to include mechanisms in products for bypassing privacy or security protections, except for authorized surveillance activities. A covered person can bring a civil action against the United States for damages caused by a violation of the Act, with the exclusive remedy being a civil action under this subsection. The court may award the greater of actual damages or $10,000, along with reasonable costs and attorney's fees. States under this subsection are the exclusive remedy against the United States for a violation of subsection (b). An agency or department of the United States must reimburse any awarded amount for a violation of subsection (b) by depositing it into the general fund of the Treasury. The United States is not liable in a civil action based on any action taken in good faith reliance. The United States is not liable in a civil action brought under this subsection if an individual acted in good faith reliance on a court order, subpoena, or legislative authorization."
