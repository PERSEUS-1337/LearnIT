    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Prescription Drug Fairness for Seniors Act of 2001\". The Congress finds that manufacturers of prescription drugs engage in price discrimination practices, causing older Americans to pay significantly more for medication than consumers in foreign nations and favored U.S. customers. Older Americans often pay double or even ten times more for prescription drugs, sustaining major drug manufacturers' high profits. The policy set forth in this Act aims to reduce prices for brand name prescription drugs for many Medicare beneficiaries by an average of 40 percent, alleviating financial hardship and improving the health of older Americans. Medicare beneficiaries are currently denied the purchasing power benefits that foreign nations and federally funded health care programs enjoy, resulting in higher medication costs for them. The Act aims to lower prescription drug prices for older Americans, especially those receiving hospice care, to improve their health and reduce costs to the Medicare program. It aims to protect beneficiaries from discriminatory pricing and provide access to cheaper medications. The Act requires participating manufacturers to provide covered outpatient drugs to pharmacies at a price no greater than the manufacturer's average foreign price. Failure to comply will result in the manufacturer being debarred by the United States. SEC. 4.
