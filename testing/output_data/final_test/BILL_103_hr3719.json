    "content": "The Well America Act establishes the Wellness Trust Fund, funded by health care premiums and federal expenditures. It also implements a Wellness Program. The Wellness Voucher is issued to eligible enrollees for identification and payment processing at participating wellness providers. Eligibility includes enrollees over thirty years old or those under thirty with special wellness needs certified by their primary care provider. Benefits provided under this section aim to promote greater health and reduce injury and illness through programs that improve general health status and encourage healthier lifestyles by changing health-related behaviors. These benefits are not meant to duplicate or replace existing programs. States periodically determine eligible services for reimbursement from wellness voucher funds. Enrollees present the wellness voucher card to receive covered benefits from participating providers. Enrollees are responsible for costs exceeding the card's value. Participating providers must be licensed and meet state standards for solvency and insurance. They agree to provide covered benefits in exchange for payment from the Secretary or from the wellness voucher. Providers in the program must inform the enrollee's primary care physician of services rendered and consult if requested. States maintain a list of wellness providers meeting requirements, notify the Secretary of any changes. The Secretary will pay participating providers from the Wellness Trust Fund for covered benefits provided. The Secretary projects the total income to the Wellness Trust Fund for the upcoming year and divides it by the number of eligible enrollees to determine the value of the wellness voucher for each enrollee. Adjustments may be made based on differences in service costs among states or alliance service areas, but the total aggregate value of all vouchers will not increase. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.
