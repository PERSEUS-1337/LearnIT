    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Sustainable Chemistry Research and Development Act of 2014\" and includes definitions for key terms. The Act defines key terms such as Advisory Council, Interagency Working Group, Program, and sustainable chemistry, which focuses on developing safe chemicals and materials to benefit human health and the environment. The Act promotes sustainable chemistry by increasing the use of sustainable, renewable, or recycled materials, substitutes for rare substances, safe manufacturing practices, minimizing lifecycle impacts, optimizing product design for waste reduction and recycling, and using safe chemicals and materials. The Sustainable Chemistry Program is promoted by the Act to increase the use of sustainable, renewable, or recycled materials, substitutes for rare substances, safe manufacturing practices, minimizing lifecycle impacts, optimizing product design for waste reduction and recycling, and using safe chemicals and materials. The President will establish an interagency Sustainable Chemistry Program to promote Federal sustainable chemistry activities, including research, development, technology transfer, and education. Program activities will provide sustained support through competitive grants to individual and collaborative research partnerships. The Sustainable Chemistry Program will provide support through grants, loans, loan guarantees, prize competitions, and coordination of research at Federal laboratories to promote sustainable chemicals, materials, and processes. It also aims to encourage the consideration of sustainable chemistry in federal and state research and development efforts. The Sustainable Chemistry Program aims to promote sustainable chemistry processes and products through various methods such as soliciting proposals, creating incentives, facilitating adoption of innovations, expanding education and training, and collecting information on research and technology transfer. The Sustainable Chemistry Program supports the development, manufacturing, and commercialization of sustainable chemistry advances by providing incentives, sharing accomplishments, promoting best practices, and assessing costs and benefits. It also facilitates outreach through symposia, forums, conferences, and written materials in collaboration with industry, academia, and other relevant groups. Additionally, the program offers support for economic, legal, and social science research to identify barriers to commercialization and methods to overcome them. The Sustainable Chemistry Program aims to identify barriers to commercialization and advance sustainable chemistry. It includes public input through discussions and events, and the development of metrics to track program outcomes. An Interagency Working Group will be established to include representatives from various agencies. The Interagency Working Group, including representatives from various agencies, will oversee the planning, management, and coordination of the Sustainable Chemistry Program. The Director of the National Science Foundation and the Assistant Administrator for Research and Development of the Environmental Protection Agency will serve as co-chairs. They will establish goals and priorities for the Program in consultation with the Advisory Council. The Advisory Council for Sustainable Chemistry, established by the co-chairs of the Interagency Working Group, will provide recommendations and ongoing advice to the group. Members of the Advisory Council will not be federal government employees and will offer diverse perspectives. The Council will meet regularly and consult with the Interagency Working Group on budget coordination and activities under the Program. The Interagency Working Group will appoint a diverse Advisory Council for Sustainable Chemistry, including individuals from various sectors. Efforts will be made to avoid conflicts of interest among council members. The Advisory Council for Sustainable Chemistry will have balanced membership determined by the Interagency Working Group, with meetings open to the public. Members must disclose conflicts of interest. The Advisory Council for Sustainable Chemistry, appointed by the Interagency Working Group, must disclose conflicts of interest. All proceedings are subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The co-chairs can appoint new members as needed and appoint the original Chair for a 1-year term. The Advisory Council appoints a new Chair after the original Chair's term expires. Agency budget requests are also discussed. Each Federal agency and department participating in the Program must submit a report to the Office of Management and Budget as part of their annual budget request, identifying activities contributing to the Program and stating the portion of their budget allocated to those activities. The President must also include a statement in the annual budget request to Congress regarding the allocation of funds for activities under the Program. The Interagency Working Group will report to Congress within 2 years of the Act's enactment, summarizing federally funded sustainable chemistry activities, financial resources allocated, and progress made. The Interagency Working Group will report to Congress within 2 years of the Act's enactment on progress towards goals, recommendations for future activities, benefits of expanding hubs to include sustainable chemistry, and strategies to avoid duplication and streamline coordination. The Interagency Working Group will submit the report to the Government Accountability Office for future congressional inquiries. SEC. 4. PARTNERSHIPS IN SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY. The Interagency Working Group will lead a joint program to award grants to higher education institutions for partnerships with companies in the chemical industry. This includes creating collaborative research programs, training students and professionals in sustainable chemistry concepts, and developing curricular materials. The Interagency Working Group will establish guidelines for partnerships between chemical industry companies and eligible higher education institutions to apply for grants. This includes a competitive grant application process with cost-sharing from non-Federal sources. SEC. 5. STUDY OF SUSTAINABLE CHEMISTRY. The National Science Foundation will collaborate with the National Research Council to conduct a study on sustainable chemistry in the United States. This study will assess the current status of sustainable chemistry research, examine its presence in education, and provide recommendations for improvement. Successful and unsuccessful case studies will also be analyzed. The National Science Foundation and the National Research Council will conduct a study on sustainable chemistry in the United States. The study will assess the current status of sustainable chemistry research, examine its presence in education, analyze case studies of successful and unsuccessful commercialization, and discuss the potential economic impact of sustainable chemistry. The Interagency Working Group, in consultation with the Advisory Council, will produce a national strategy and implementation plan for sustainable chemistry within 2 years of the study release. The prioritization will focus on activities that achieve the goals of sustainable chemistry to the highest extent possible."
