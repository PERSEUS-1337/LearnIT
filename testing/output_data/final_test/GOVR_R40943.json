    "content": "President Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act into law on March 23, 2010, as part of the administration's efforts to address the growing number of uninsured individuals and rising healthcare costs. The Act includes provisions for a mandate for most U.S. residents to obtain health insurance and the establishment of insurance exchanges to provide federal subsidies for coverage. This legislation aims to improve access to care and control healthcare costs by making changes to both financing and delivery systems. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, signed into law by President Obama in 2010, includes provisions for insurance exchanges and subsidies to reduce coverage costs. It expands Medicaid eligibility, reduces Medicare spending growth, and imposes an excise tax on high-premium insurance plans. The Act also makes changes to the federal tax code, Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs. The House and Senate passed comprehensive health reform bills before its approval. The Senate passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (H.R. 3590) in 2009, followed by the House's approval in 2010. An accompanying reconciliation bill, H.R. 4872, was also approved. The National Priorities Partnership identified challenges in delivering high-quality care. The National Priorities Partnership identified challenges in delivering high-quality care, including improving patient safety, eradicating disparities in care, reducing the burden of chronic disease, and eliminating unnecessary and ineffective care. According to the Institute of Medicine, a significant portion of health care spending is wasted on unnecessary and unsafe care. The health reform debate includes proposals to improve the delivery of health care services by focusing on initiatives like encouraging healthier lifestyles and changing how providers manage disease. Key aspects of delivery reform proposals include expanding the primary care workforce, promoting clinical preventive services, and enhancing chronic care management to address challenges in the current system. Care coordination is crucial to prevent poor outcomes resulting from incomplete information transfer among providers. Care coordination is essential in health care to prevent poor outcomes from inaccurate information transfer among providers. Transforming the nation's health care delivery system requires significant changes in health professions education and training. The debate on health workforce policy highlights the need to shift towards primary care, disease prevention, and better management of chronic illness. Concerns about a future physician shortage exist, but simply adding more physicians may not improve accessibility or quality of care. Many health policy analysts recommend training more primary care physicians and developing integrated systems of care to improve healthcare delivery. Expanding the use of clinical preventive services, such as immunizations and screening tests, is key to reducing healthcare costs. Increasing physician supply may not necessarily improve patient outcomes or satisfaction. Clinical preventive services, including immunizations and screening tests, can improve health and may be cost-effective. The concept of a medical home, where primary care physicians partner with patients to manage care and coordinate services, is gaining popularity. Disease management programs, focused on specific diseases like diabetes, aim to address rising treatment costs and improve care coordination. Disease management programs focus on specific diseases like diabetes to help patients manage their care through education, symptom monitoring, and treatment adherence. These programs, run by health plans or specialized vendors, aim to improve care coordination and reduce treatment costs. Health care delivery reform relies on mechanisms like performance measurement, comparative effectiveness research, and alignment of payment incentives with high-quality care. The quality of health care depends on providers having financial incentives to change delivery methods. Fee-for-service payment models incentivize volume over quality of care. Pay-for-performance initiatives tie provider payments to quality measures. Public reporting of quality information helps patients make informed choices. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA; P.L. 111-5) enacted in February 2009 included the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, aimed at promoting the adoption of health information technology (HIT) for sharing clinical data among healthcare stakeholders. It allocated $2 billion for HIT grant programs, emphasizing the importance of interoperable electronic health records (EHRs) and computerized systems for clinical decision making in healthcare reform. The HITECH Act under the ARRA aimed to promote the adoption of HIT for sharing clinical data among healthcare stakeholders. HIT has the potential to overhaul care delivery by enabling more efficient care, improving quality, and providing data for research and performance measurement. The PPACA is composed of 10 titles covering various healthcare topics. The PPACA consists of 10 titles covering topics such as health insurance, Medicaid, Medicare, prevention, health workforce, transparency, drugs, long-term care insurance, and revenues. Title X was added as a manager's amendment, amending existing provisions and adding new ones related to workforce, prevention, quality, and other healthcare provisions. The PPACA consists of 16 sections covering various healthcare topics such as prevention, maternal and child health, behavioral health, quality, health disparities, emergency care, and more. The report provides background on existing laws and practices before describing the PPACA provisions, some of which would impact federal spending and revenue. Additionally, certain provisions would be amended by the reconciliation bill (H.R. 4872). Table 1 in this report provides a roadmap of public health, workforce, quality, and related provisions in PPACA. References to \"the Secretary\" pertain to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Acronyms used in the report are listed in the Appendix. Additional CRS reports discuss private health insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid provisions in PPACA. The CRS reports discuss changes to PPACA, including Medicare, Medicaid, and private health insurance provisions. PPACA amends various PHSA programs. PPACA amends PHSA programs with new authorizations of appropriations, including a multi-billion dollar Community Health Center Fund. A total of $11 billion is appropriated over the five-year period FY2011 through FY2015 for the health center program. The federal health center program, authorized by PHSA Sec. 330, provides grants to community health centers, migrant health centers, health centers for the homeless, and health centers for residents of public housing. These centers offer primary care and preventive services to uninsured and underinsured individuals, with a focus on medically underserved areas and populations. Health centers receiving Sec. 330 funding also have liability protection from medical malpractice claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA). The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) provides malpractice coverage for health centers, employees, board members, and certain contractors, but not for volunteer healthcare providers. The lack of coverage is a barrier to volunteerism, along with other factors such as time constraints, licensure costs, and limited capacity of health centers to recruit and retain volunteers. The health center program has bipartisan support and has expanded significantly in recent years. The Safety Net Act of 2008 included a requirement for a GAO study on the economic costs and benefits of school-based health clinics. These clinics increase access to primary health care services, reducing disparities and costs by averting expensive emergency room visits. The Act also authorizes specific amounts to be appropriated for the health center program from FY2010 to FY2015, with subsequent years based on a specified formula. The Safety Net Act of 2008 authorized specific appropriations for the health center program based on a formula that considers previous funding, per patient costs, and increases in patient numbers. Community health centers can contract with specified entities for primary health care services, with funding transferred from the Community Health Center Fund. The clinics must not discriminate based on ability to pay and must establish a sliding fee scale for low-income patients. The Community Health Center Fund allocated varying amounts for the health center program from $700 million for FY2011 to $2.9 billion for FY2015. Additionally, $1.5 billion was designated for construction and renovation of community health centers for FY2011 through FY2015. The reconciliation provision transferred funds for the health center program, extending FTCA liability protection to officers, governing board members, employees, and contractors of free clinics. Subsection 4101(a) would establish a grant program for School-Based Health Centers (SBHCs) to use funds for facility construction and equipment. SBHCs cannot use funds for personnel or health services. Preference would be given to SBHCs serving children eligible for Medicaid and CHIP. $50 million would be appropriated annually from FY2010 to FY2013. Subsection 4101(b) would award grants for operating costs of SBHCs. Grants for operating costs of SBHCs would require meeting specified criteria, matching 20% of the grant amount from non-federal sources, using funds for designated purposes, providing age-appropriate services, and not offering abortion services without parental consent. Entities violating state laws or overlapping with existing grants would be ineligible for funding. Applicants demonstrating preference may receive priority. The Secretary may give preference to applicants serving communities with barriers to access and consider previous grants for SBHCs. Funding would be authorized for FY2010 through FY2014 for Nurse-Managed Health Clinics providing primary care to underserved populations. Eligible NMHCs must have nurses as major providers, offer care regardless of income, and submit assurances to the Secretary. The Nurse-Managed Health Clinics (NMHC) will provide care to all patients regardless of income or insurance status. A community advisory committee will be established with majority members being individuals served by the NMHC. The Secretary will consider financial need and other funding sources when determining grant amounts. Funding of $50 million for FY2010 and subsequent years is authorized. Existing health professions education programs provide funding for medical schools to promote community-based practice, primary care, and opportunities for disadvantaged students. The National Health Service Corps (NHSC) program provides scholarships and loan repayments for medical students, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants who agree to work in underserved areas. Demand for NHSC clinicians exceeds availability. The NHSC program faces high demand for clinicians, with more interested in scholarships or loan repayment than can be accommodated. Currently, only 8% of the total need for primary care practitioners in HPSAs is being met. Medicare covers graduate medical education costs through direct and indirect payments to teaching hospitals. Medicare provides payments to teaching hospitals for graduate medical education costs, including Direct Graduate Medical Education (DGME) and Indirect Medical Education (IME) payments. IME payments compensate hospitals for higher patient care costs in teaching hospitals due to factors like sicker patients and inexperienced residents ordering more tests. In 2008, Medicare paid an estimated $9 billion in DGME and IME payments to over 1,100 teaching hospitals to educate and train around 90,000 residents. Medicare GME payments are seen as crucial for shaping health workforce policy by linking subsidies to delivery system reform and encouraging training in non-hospital settings. Proposed amendments authorize increasing amounts for NHSC scholarships and loan repayments from FY2010 to FY2015, with subsequent years based on previous appropriations and changes in health professions education costs. The section proposes transferring funds from the Community Health Center Fund to the NHSC for FY2011 to FY2015, with amounts increasing each year. It also amends PHSA Sec. 338C(a) to allow teaching time to count towards service obligation, and PHSA Sec. 331 to waive full-time clinical practice requirement for NHSC service. The section proposes changes to the NHSC program, including allowing part-time clinical practice to fulfill service obligations with an extended commitment, increasing the maximum annual loan repayment amount to $50,000, and permitting teaching to count as clinical practice for up to 20% of the obligated service period. The NHSC program allows part-time clinical practice to fulfill service obligations with an extended commitment. NHSC clinicians in teaching health centers GME program can count up to 50% of time spent teaching towards their service obligation. The Secretary must establish criteria for designating medically underserved populations and HPSAs through a rulemaking process. The IRS would exclude amounts received under NHSC loan repayment or state loan forgiveness programs from an individual's gross income for tax purposes. This tax exclusion applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2009. PHSA Title VII authorizes student loan programs for health professions students and grants for health professions schools to develop training programs. PPACA includes sections to establish or amend programs to increase primary care providers. Medical students receiving loan funds must practice in primary care for 10 years or until the loan is repaid. The Secretary cannot require parental financial information for loan applicants. The PPACA includes sections to establish or amend programs to increase primary care providers. Medical students receiving loan funds must practice in primary care for 10 years or until the loan is repaid. The determination of whether to seek financial information from loan applicants would be at the discretion of the school loan officer. Funds repaid under the loan program should not be transferred to the Treasury or used for any other purpose. A new section would establish a pediatric specialty loan repayment program for eligible individuals to work full-time in pediatric medical specialties, pediatric surgery, or child and adolescent mental and behavioral health care. The pediatric specialty loan repayment program under the PPACA offers up to $35,000 per year for eligible individuals working in specified pediatric specialties in underserved areas. Applicants must be U.S. citizens or permanent residents, enrolled in an accredited graduate program, and have good academic standing. Funding of $30 million per year is authorized for FY2010 through FY2014. The proposed legislation authorizes $30 million annually for loan repayments for pediatric medical specialists and pediatric surgical specialists, and $20 million annually for child and adolescent mental and behavioral health professionals. It replaces a section authorizing grants for training programs in primary care, with eligibility criteria for entities such as hospitals, schools of medicine, and physician assistant training programs. Only schools of medicine or osteopathic medicine would be eligible for capacity building grants. The Secretary would give preference to qualified applicants proposing specified activities for capacity building grants in the amount of $125 million for FY2010 and SSAN for FY2011 through FY2014. 15% of the funds would be allocated to physician assistant training programs for primary care. An additional $750,000 would be authorized for programs integrating academic units and new training opportunities for direct care workers in long-term care. Entities eligible for grants must partner with long-term care settings and use funds for tuition assistance for individuals enrolled in relevant courses. Recipients must work in geriatrics, disability services, or chronic care for two years. $10 million is authorized for FY2011-FY2013. The new PHSA Sec. 748 authorizes grants for dental training and faculty loan repayment programs in specified fields. Eligible entities include dental schools, residency programs, and schools of public health. The PHSA Sec. 748 authorizes grants for dental training and faculty loan repayment programs in specified fields, giving priority to qualified applicants with a record of providing care in underserved areas or to populations experiencing health disparities. $30 million is authorized to be appropriated for FY2010. The section authorizes $30 million for FY2010 and SSAN for FY2011 through FY2015. Funds can be carried over for up to three years without permission. A new program would train alternative dental health care providers to increase access in underserved communities. Eligible entities include institutions of higher education, public-private partnerships, FQHCs, and health facilities. The Secretary is authorized to award 15 grants of at least $4 million over five years to various eligible entities for a new program training alternative dental health care providers. The program aims to increase access in underserved communities and requires demonstration projects to start within two years and conclude within seven years of enactment. Additionally, the Secretary must contract with the IOM to conduct a study on access to dental health care. The curr_chunk discusses the authorization of grants for teaching health centers to establish primary care residency programs. These centers include FQHCs, community mental health centers, Rural Health Clinics, Indian health centers, and entities under the family planning program.

Preference would be given to applications with an existing affiliation agreement with an AHEC. Funding of $25 million for FY2010, $50 million for FY2011 and FY2012, and SSAN for subsequent years is authorized, with a limit of $5 million annually for technical assistance grants. Subsection 5508(c) would amend PHSA Title III, Part D to support Graduate Medical Education in Qualified Teaching Health Centers. The new section requires the Secretary to make payments to qualified Teaching Health Centers (THCs) for expanding or establishing approved graduate medical residency training programs. It specifies how these payments would be calculated, limits funding for full-time equivalent residents, and ensures that THC graduate medical education payments are in addition to other payments made to teaching hospitals. The Secretary is also required to determine any changes to resident reporting requirements. The Secretary is required to determine changes to resident reporting requirements for Teaching Health Centers (THCs) and may audit them. Failure to report certain information could result in a 25% payment reduction, with opportunities for remediation. Regulations must be promulgated, and up to $230 million is appropriated for FY2011-FY2015. PHSA Title VIII supports nursing workforce development through various programs. The PPACA would modify existing programs in nursing, increasing loan amounts for recipients and requiring financial need as a criterion. It also allows for partial loan cancellation for nurses working in public or nonprofit settings.

It would also establish Nurse Retention Grants for nurse retention and promotion programs, with funding authorized for FY2010 through FY2014. Preference would be given to entities that have not previously received grants and those addressing high-priority areas. The section would authorize SSAN to appropriate funds for grant programs in high-priority areas, expanding eligibility for nursing student loan repayment and scholarship programs to individuals serving as nurse faculty. It includes technical amendments for PHSA Title VIII and renames the nurse faculty loan program to School of Nursing Student Loan Fund with increased annual loan limits. Priority is given to doctoral nursing students. The section would increase the annual loan limit for nursing students from $30,000 to $35,500 for FY2010 and FY2011, with adjustments for cost-of-attendance thereafter. It would also create a new program for repayment of education loans to increase qualified nursing faculty, requiring recipients to serve as faculty for at least four years. Priority is given to doctoral nursing students, with an annual loan limit of $10,000 for individuals with a master's degree. The annual loan limit for nursing students with a master's or equivalent degree in nursing would be set at $10,000 ($20,000 for those with a doctorate) with an aggregate limit of $40,000 ($80,000 for doctorate) for FY2010 and FY2011. The loan limits would be adjusted for cost-of-attendance increases. Funding would be authorized for FY2010 through FY2014. Additionally, a graduate nurse education demonstration program in Medicare would be established. Under a Medicare demonstration program, eligible hospitals can receive reimbursement for training costs for advanced practice nurses. These nurses, including clinical nurse specialists, nurse practitioners, nurse anesthetists, and nurse midwives, would be trained in various clinical skills for Medicare-eligible populations. Training would focus on primary care, preventive care, chronic care management, and other nursing services. Half of the training would take place in non-hospital settings, with waivers possible for rural or underserved hospitals. Medicare payments would cover training costs.

The Secretary must consider recommendations from the National Advisory Council on Nurse Education and Practice and consult with nursing associations, including the National Coalition of Ethnic Minority Nurse Associations. A new Primary Care Extension Program would be established to fund local agencies supporting and educating primary care providers on various healthcare services. Health Extension Agents would work with primary care providers to implement quality improvement and patient-centered medical home principles. The Primary Care Extension Program, guided by patient-centered medical home principles, aims to assist primary care providers in culturally appropriate ways. State Hubs would be established to support local agencies in organizing networks to share best practices and ensure financial sustainability. The section aims to establish a program for primary care providers, with grants for hub plans and financial sustainability. It includes funding authorization and amendments to include physician assistant education programs. Additionally, it introduces Rural Physician Training Grants for medical schools to recruit and train physicians. The Secretary, through HRSA, will award grants to medical schools to recruit and train students likely to practice in underserved rural communities. Priority given to schools with a track record of training for rural practice, established partnerships, or a plan to track graduates.

Responsibilities of HRSA's existing NCHWA would be transferred to the new National Center within 180 days of enactment. Amendments to PHSA Sec. 791 would require the Secretary to implement these changes. The enactment includes amending PHSA Sec. 791 to give preference to applicants using longitudinal evaluations for grants or contracts. It also adds duties for various advisory committees and establishes the Interagency Access to Health Care in Alaska Task Force. The Task Force, appointed by federal officials, must submit a report to Congress within 180 days with recommendations. Medicare caps GME payments for teaching hospitals based on 1996 levels. The MMA of 2003 allowed redistribution of unused resident positions to hospitals prioritized by specific criteria. Rural teaching hospitals with fewer than 250 beds were exempt from redistribution. The redistributed resident positions have different payment formulas. Medicare does not set targets for resident positions. Medicare allows teaching hospitals to receive DGME and IME payments for residents rotating in non-hospital settings, as long as the hospital covers most of the training costs. Time spent in non-patient care activities at non-hospital sites is not counted for payment calculations. PPACA includes sections to address issues related to Medicare payments for residents in non-hospital settings. Hospitals have a financial incentive to retain residents for lower-cost clinical labor. Experts see value in residents gaining experience in non-hospital settings, but most residency programs are based in acute-care teaching hospitals. The legislation would establish criteria to reduce resident limits for hospitals with unused positions and redistribute them to other facilities. The legislation aims to redistribute 65% of unused residency positions from hospitals to other qualifying facilities, with exemptions for certain rural hospitals and the replacement facility for the former Martin Luther King Jr. Hospital. Qualifying hospitals can receive up to 75 additional full-time equivalent residents, with a focus on primary care and general surgery. The Secretary will consider factors like the hospital's ability to fill positions quickly when determining residency limit increases. The legislation aims to redistribute 65% of unused residency positions from hospitals to other qualifying facilities based on specific criteria. Residency positions would be allocated among hospitals in states with low resident-to-population ratios, high percentage of population in HPSA, and rural hospitals. DGME and IME payments for redistributed positions would follow the same basis as existing positions. All time spent by residents in patient care activities would count towards DGME payment, regardless of the setting, if the hospital covers stipends and fringe benefits. The legislation aims to redistribute residency positions from hospitals to other qualifying facilities based on specific criteria. All time spent by residents in patient care activities would count towards DGME payment, regardless of the setting, if the hospital covers stipends and fringe benefits. Resident time spent in non-patient care activities in a non-hospital setting primarily engaged in patient care would also be counted towards payments. When calculating IME payments, Medicare would adopt rules for counting residents' leave time and time spent in hospital settings on non-patient care activities. The legislation also directs the Secretary to establish a process to redistribute medical residency slots from closing hospitals to increase residency limits for other hospitals. The section would prioritize hospitals in the same or nearby areas for loan forgiveness for allied health professionals working in public health agencies, acute care facilities, and underserved areas. This section proposes demonstration projects to address health professions workforce needs by providing education and training opportunities for low-income individuals in the healthcare field. Grants would be awarded to states for developing core training competencies and certification. Demonstration projects aim to develop training competencies and certification programs for personal or home care aides. $85 million would be appropriated to the Secretary for projects from FY2010 to FY2014. $5 million would be used for the second project from FY2010 to FY2012. Additionally, $5 million would be allocated for special projects supporting family-to-family health information centers. The Secretary would receive $5 million annually from FY2009 to FY2012 for the development and support of centers. An annual report on activities under Title V of the legislation would be required. Recipients of funds may need to submit reports on activity effectiveness. A Personal Care Attendants Workforce Advisory Panel would be established within 90 days. Additionally, a new section would require the Secretary to establish a national program through the CDC. The Secretary would establish a national diabetes prevention program for high-risk adults with specified components. Eligible entities for grants include state or local health departments, tribal organizations, and academic institutions. Funding would be authorized for FY2010 through 2014, with states able to award grants to healthcare providers serving underserved populations. No funds from Medicare, Medicaid, or Tricare could be used for grants. $100 million would be appropriated for the program. The section authorizes $100 million for FY2010 for debt service, construction, or renovation of a hospital affiliated with a state medical school. The Secretary would establish a three-year demonstration project in up to 10 states to provide comprehensive health care services to the uninsured at reduced fees. Each state would receive up to $2 million for prevention interventions in clinical settings and communities. The federal government supports evidence-based recommendations for clinical and community preventive services, with a focus on improving patient and population health. Clinical preventive services like cancer screenings may not result in cost savings, but rather incur a net cost. There is ongoing debate on whether these services could lead to broader savings, such as preventing lost workdays, and what potential savings could benefit the federal government or society from expanding community-based prevention activities. The U.S. government supports evidence-based recommendations for clinical and community preventive services through advisory committees like the USPSTF, TFCPS, and ACIP. These committees assess scientific evidence for clinical preventive services, community interventions, and vaccine use. Current law addresses prevention through coverage of clinical preventive services under Medicare and Medicaid, community-based programs funded by federal grants, evidence review processes, and regulation of employer wellness programs. Medicare Part B covers various preventive services, including screenings and vaccines. Medicare Part B covers vaccines for influenza, pneumococcus, and hepatitis B for at-risk individuals. Medicare Part D covers FDA-licensed vaccines with a prescription. Medicare Advantage plans must cover Part B benefits and may waive cost-sharing for preventive services. State Medicaid plans must cover preventive services for beneficiaries under 21 through EPSDT. Medicaid state plans are not explicitly required to cover preventive services for adults. Medicaid state plans are not explicitly required to cover preventive services for adults, but coverage may be mandated if a service meets certain criteria. States can exclude coverage of certain drug classes under the optional Medicaid prescription drug benefit. Medicaid programs can choose to cover tobacco cessation counseling services for enrollees, including pregnant women. An adopted amendment could impact provisions in PPACA related to breast cancer screening recommendations. The USPSTF updated its recommendation on mammography for breast cancer screening in November 2009, now recommending routine screening to begin at age 50 instead of 40. The Vitter amendment may affect coverage for screening mammography for women aged 40-49. The Task Force recommends reducing beneficiary cost-sharing to increase utilization of screening mammography. The Task Force found insufficient evidence to recommend cervical or colorectal cancer screening. Employers and insurers are interested in reducing healthcare costs through wellness programs, subject to federal laws like HIPAA. HIPAA prohibits group health plans and insurance issuers from using health-related factors for coverage eligibility or charging higher premiums based on these factors. However, they can offer premium discounts or modify copayments for participation in wellness programs. The HIPAA nondiscrimination requirements categorize wellness programs based on rewards for participation. Programs offering rewards based on meeting health standards must comply with additional requirements, including a reward limit of 20% of employee coverage cost. Additionally, a new PHSA Sec. 2713 mandates coverage of certain preventive services by group health plans and health insurance issuers. The group or individual health insurance market must cover specific preventive services without cost-sharing requirements, including items recommended by USPSTF and immunizations recommended by ACIP. Additional preventive care and screenings for infants, children, adolescents, and women are also covered. Plans can choose to cover or deny services not recommended by USPSTF. The Secretary may develop guidelines for group health plans and insurance issuers. The guidelines aim to allow health plans to use value-based insurance designs, covering essential health benefits including preventive and wellness services without deductibles. The Secretary will determine specific coverage elements, effective from January 1, 2014. Medicare Part B will cover personalized prevention plan services starting in 2011, including health risk assessments and various elements like medical history review, screening schedules, and medication lists. Beneficiaries can receive these services annually without cost sharing, with cognitive impairment assessments included. Starting in 2011, Medicare Part B will cover personalized prevention plan services without cost sharing. Beneficiaries can receive the initial preventive physical examination (IPPE) in the first year of enrollment, and personalized prevention plan services annually thereafter. The Secretary will provide guidance and conduct outreach for these services, which include colorectal cancer screening and cognitive impairment assessments. The Medicare Part B coverage starting in 2011 includes the IPPE and personalized prevention plan services without cost sharing. Medicare will cover 100% of the costs for most preventive services, waiving beneficiary coinsurance requirements. This waiver applies to services recommended with a grade of A or B by the USPSTF, excluding electrocardiograms. The deductible would generally be waived for these preventive services as well. The Medicare Part B coverage starting in 2011 includes the IPPE and personalized prevention plan services without cost sharing. Medicare will cover 100% of the costs for most preventive services recommended with a grade of A or B by the USPSTF, waiving beneficiary coinsurance requirements and deductibles. Effective January 1, 2010, the Secretary can modify coverage of preventive services consistent with USPSTF recommendations and withhold payment for services graded D. This enhanced authority does not apply to services for diagnosis or treatment. Effective in 2013, SSA Sec. 1905(a)(13) will expand the Medicaid state option to provide other services. In 2013, Sec. 1905(a)(13) will expand the Medicaid state option to cover clinical preventive services recommended by USPSTF and immunizations recommended by ACIP for adults, with increased federal assistance for states that elect to provide these services without cost-sharing. Effective in October 2010, states are required to provide Medicaid coverage to pregnant women for counseling and drug therapy for tobacco cessation, including diagnostic, therapeutic, and counseling services, as well as FDA-approved tobacco cessation products. Cost-sharing for these services is prohibited, and coverage for smoking cessation products is allowed only for pregnant women. The DRA option provides counseling and drug therapy for pregnant women for tobacco cessation. Grants are awarded to states to incentivize Medicaid beneficiaries to adopt healthy lifestyles. Programs must be evidence-based and target specific needs, such as managing cholesterol, blood pressure, weight loss, smoking cessation, and diabetes prevention. Co-morbidities like depression can also be addressed. The program would appropriate $100 million over five years starting in 2011 to address diabetes and co-morbidities like depression. The Secretary could waive Medicaid requirements and ensure wide availability. Reporting requirements for group health plans and insurers would be developed. The new section requires health plans and insurance issuers to implement wellness and health promotion activities, with annual reporting to the Secretary and enrollees. Regulations will be established for reimbursement structures meeting these criteria, including personalized wellness services provided by healthcare providers or organizations conducting health risk assessments. The program offers face-to-face, telephonic, or web-based intervention efforts for participants, including wellness activities like smoking cessation, weight management, and nutrition support. The new PHSA Sec. 2717 contains provisions regarding gun rights, stating that wellness activities cannot require disclosure of firearm information. This section also amends HIPAA's nondiscrimination requirements through the creation of a new PHSA Sec. 2705. The new section codifies amended HIPAA wellness program regulations. Programs without health factor standards for rewards are allowed if open to all. Programs with health factor standards for rewards must meet additional requirements, with rewards capped at 30% of employee-only coverage cost. Secretaries have discretion to increase rewards up to 50%. HHS Secretary will establish a 10-state pilot program. The new section codifies amended HIPAA wellness program regulations, including a 10-state pilot program for health insurers in the individual market. It also extends provisions to group health plans and health insurance issuers under ERISA and the IRC. The CDC Director would provide technical assistance to evaluate workplace wellness programs. The Director would evaluate programs on health outcomes, absenteeism, productivity, workplace injury rates, and medical costs. They would also build evaluation capacity among workplace staff, conduct a national survey of employer-based health policies, and evaluate all CDC-funded programs before privately funded ones. Recommendations, data, or assessments cannot be used to mandate requirements. The Secretary would evaluate federal health and wellness initiatives to assess their effectiveness in improving the health status of the American public, including the federal workforce. Grants would be awarded to eligible employers for comprehensive workplace wellness programs over a five-year period. Eligible employers are those with fewer than 100 employees. Eligible employers with fewer than 100 employees can receive grants for workplace wellness programs over a five-year period. The programs must include education, participation encouragement, behavior change initiatives, and supportive work environments. $200 million is authorized for FY2011 through FY2015. The section requires the establishment of a National Prevention, Health Promotion, and Public Health Council to coordinate federal efforts in prevention and wellness. It aims to create a Prevention and Public Health Fund for national investment in health programs to improve health and control healthcare costs. The proposal authorizes appropriations to the Prevention and Public Health Fund for increasing funding for prevention, wellness, and public health activities. It also includes transferring funds to HHS accounts and establishing a Preventive Services Task Force. The proposal includes establishing a Preventive Services Task Force, composed of experts, to review scientific evidence on clinical preventive services and develop recommendations for the health care community. AHRQ would provide support for Task Force operations, which would include reviewing and updating recommendations every five years. The proposal includes establishing a Community Preventive Services Task Force, independent of political pressure, to review scientific evidence on community preventive interventions and develop recommendations. Funding would be authorized for Task Force activities each fiscal year. The proposal includes establishing a Community Preventive Services Task Force to review scientific evidence on community preventive interventions and develop recommendations. CDC would provide support for Task Force operations and funding would be authorized each fiscal year. The Task Force would coordinate activities with the ACIP and focus on health promotion and disease prevention activities. The Secretary, in consultation with the Institute of Medicine (IOM), must plan and implement a national public-private partnership for a prevention and health promotion outreach and education campaign. This includes developing a science-based media campaign, a website with information on chronic diseases, a program to disseminate health promotion information to healthcare providers, and a Web-based tool for personalized prevention plans. Additionally, an Internet portal for accessing risk-assessment tools will be established. The Secretary must establish an Internet portal for accessing risk-assessment tools developed by private and academic entities. Guidance on preventive and obesity-related services for Medicaid enrollees, including screening and counseling, must be provided to states and healthcare providers. States must create public awareness campaigns to educate Medicaid enrollees on available services. Funding for these activities would take priority over CDC grants, with a limit of $500 million in spending. Authorized funding would be provided annually for these activities under a new PHSA Title III, Part T, Oral Healthcare Prevention. The new PHSA Title III, Part T would establish a national public education campaign on oral health, targeting prevention of dental diseases. The Secretary would ensure culturally appropriate activities and use science-based strategies, including community water fluoridation and dental sealants. Grants would be awarded to demonstrate research-based dental caries disease management activities. Eligible entities would be community-based dental service providers. The section would create a new PHSA Sec. 399LL-2 authorizing the appropriation of funds to carry out a national public education campaign on oral health. It would also mandate a school-based dental sealant program and require the Secretary to award program grants to states, territories, and Indian tribes. Eligible entities for grants would include community-based providers of dental services. The section proposes cooperative agreements with states, territories, tribal entities, and urban Indian organizations to improve oral health through data collection, delivery systems, and program implementation. Funding would be authorized for FY2010 through FY2014, with a focus on updating and enhancing oral health components in national health surveys and surveillance systems. The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS), National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), Medical Expenditures Panel Survey (MEPS), and National Oral Health Surveillance System (NOHSS) are key systems administered by CDC and AHRQ. Funding would be authorized for NOHSS to expand participation to all 50 states, territories, and the District of Columbia, with a focus on measuring early childhood caries. Additionally, grants would be awarded for evidence-based community preventive health activities to reduce chronic disease rates and address health disparities. To reduce chronic disease rates and address health disparities, eligible entities such as government agencies, community-based organizations, non-profit organizations, or Indian tribes can receive grants. At least 20% of grants must go to rural areas. Grantees must develop community transformation plans for healthy living, conduct health promotion activities, and evaluations. Grant funds cannot be used for activities that may lead to obesity or inactivity. The CDC Director must provide training and technical assistance. Authorized funding for FY2010 is specified. Authorized funding for FY2010 through FY2014 would support grants for community prevention interventions targeting individuals aged 55-64. Grantees must collaborate with relevant agencies to improve nutrition, increase physical activity, reduce tobacco use, and conduct health screenings for cardiovascular disease, stroke, and diabetes risk factors. The program aims to reduce the risk of chronic diseases like cardiovascular disease, stroke, and diabetes by providing clinical referral and treatment for individuals with these risk factors. Grantees must ensure individuals have health insurance coverage and refer them to participating providers. Uninsured individuals will be assisted in determining eligibility for public coverage options. Grantees will use funds to measure changes in chronic disease risk factors prevalence among participants, with the Secretary conducting an annual evaluation of program effectiveness. The program aims to reduce chronic disease risk factors among new Medicare enrollees through community-based prevention and wellness programs. The Secretary will evaluate program effectiveness and develop a plan for promoting healthy lifestyles and chronic disease self-management for Medicare beneficiaries. Funding will be transferred to CMS for the evaluation. The Secretary will transfer $50 million from the Part A and Part B Trust Funds to CMS for evaluation purposes. This includes negotiating contracts with manufacturers for adult vaccines, reauthorizing immunization grants to states, and conducting a demonstration program to improve immunization coverage for children, adolescents, and adults. The proposed program aims to improve immunization coverage for children, adolescents, and adults by providing funds to states for evidence-based interventions. Grantees must report progress within three years, with a final report to Congress within four years. Funding would be authorized for FY2010 through FY2014. Additionally, a study on vaccine coverage under Medicare Part D for beneficiaries aged 65 and older would be conducted with a $1 million appropriation for FY2010. The section proposes a pilot program in community health centers to test individualized wellness plans for at-risk individuals. Plans may include nutritional counseling, physical activity, smoking cessation, stress management, dietary supplements, and compliance assistance. Risk factors like weight, tobacco, and alcohol use must be addressed. The proposed pilot program in community health centers aims to test individualized wellness plans for at-risk individuals, addressing risk factors such as weight, tobacco, and alcohol use. Funding would be allocated for research on public health services and systems, including examining evidence-based prevention practices and identifying effective strategies for organizing public health services in community settings. The curr_chunk discusses the amendment of PHSA Title XXVIII to establish a grant program for strengthening national epidemiology, laboratory, and information management capacity for public health emergencies. Eligible entities include state, local, or tribal health departments, with an authorized appropriation of $190 million for each of FY2011 through FY2013. The Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 (CHIPRA; P.L. 111-3) allocated funds for grants to improve epidemiology, disease control, information management, and laboratory capacity. It also included provisions for a demonstration project to reduce child obesity, with an appropriation of $25 million for FY2009 through FY2013.

It includes initiatives to promote education and training of physicians on birth and death certificate data, encourage standard revisions of certificates, and improve vital statistics systems. Additionally, it allows for the promotion of improvements to the collection of diabetes mortality data and requires a study on the impact of diabetes on medical practice. Authorization is given to enhance infrastructure for tracking congenital heart disease epidemiology and creating a surveillance system. The system must be made public and comply with HIPAA Privacy Rule. Sec. 399V-2(c) allows for a surveillance system to include information on congenital heart disease. Subsection 10411(b)(2) proposes amending PHSA to authorize research coordination and expansion for congenital heart disease. This includes efforts to consider research application for minority and medically underserved populations. Subsection 10411(c) authorizes appropriations for FY2011 through FY2015. Subsection 10411(c) authorizes appropriations for FY2011 through FY2015 to conduct a national education campaign on breast cancer awareness among young women. This includes providing evidence-based messages and materials developed by the CDC and establishing an advisory committee. Grants will be awarded to entities for national multimedia campaigns targeting young women, with the Secretary required to establish an advisory committee within 60 days of enactment. The Secretary, through the CDC, would conduct an education campaign among health care professionals to increase awareness of breast health, provide counseling to young women, discuss healthy behaviors, refer patients to genetics professionals, address survivorship of young women with breast cancer, and provide referrals to credible organizations. Prevention research on breast cancer in younger women would be conducted, new screening tests and methods would be developed, and grants would be awarded to provide health information to young women diagnosed with breast cancer. The Secretary, through the CDC, would conduct an education campaign among health care professionals to increase awareness of breast health, provide counseling to young women, discuss healthy behaviors, refer patients to genetics professionals, address survivorship of young women with breast cancer, and provide referrals to credible organizations. Sec. 399NN(e) would ensure no duplication of federal breast cancer education efforts. Sec. 399NN(f) would require measuring young women's awareness of breast health and lifestyle interventions, clinical breast exams, and breast self-exams every three years. Sec. 399(h) defines young women as ages 15-44. Sec. 399NN(h) authorizes $9 million for FY2010-FY2014 for a national diabetes prevention program for high-risk adults.

Funding would be authorized for FY2010 through 2014. Section 4401 from PPACA is struck, which addresses the challenges of estimating costs for prevention programs and the need for better methodologies for scoring progress in prevention efforts. The CDC aims to establish a national diabetes prevention program for high-risk adults with specified components. Eligible entities for program grants include state or local health departments, tribal organizations, non-profits focused on health, academic institutions, or other entities as determined by the Secretary. Funding would be authorized for FY2010 through 2014. Work with CBO to develop better methodologies for scoring progress in prevention and wellness programs. Home visitation is used to deliver support and services to families or individuals in their homes, focusing on maternal and child health, early childhood development, and family functioning. Early childhood home visitation programs operate in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, with visits typically starting during pregnancy and continuing until the child reaches kindergarten. In the District of Columbia, federal programs like Medicaid, TANF, Social Services Block Grant, and others support home visitation programs for families with young children. However, there is no dedicated federal program providing grant funds specifically for this purpose. The Administration sought legislative authorization and mandatory funding for such a program in the FY2010 President's Budget. SSA Title V authorizes the Maternal and Child Health block grant program, which allocates funding to states based on their share of children in the nation. The Title V Maternal and Child Health block grant program allocates funding to states based on children in families below the poverty level. States use the funds for various maternal and child health programs and must report on progress towards standardized indicators. A new provision would require states to conduct a needs assessment for Early Childhood Home Visitation Programs to receive block grant funds. The provision requires states to conduct a needs assessment for Early Childhood Home Visitation Programs to receive MCH block grant funds for FY2011. The assessment aims to identify communities with various risk factors and assess the quality and capacity of existing home visitation activities. The provision directs the HHS Secretary to award grants for early childhood home visitation programs targeting pregnant women, fathers-to-be, and caregivers of young children. Grantees must establish measurable benchmarks for improving maternal and newborn health, childhood injury prevention, school readiness, and reducing crime. The provision requires grantees to establish benchmarks for improving maternal and newborn health, childhood injury prevention, school readiness, and reducing crime. Grantees failing to meet benchmarks in specified areas must develop improvement plans or risk grant termination. Grantees must submit progress reports by December 31, 2015, and ensure voluntary family participation and individualized services. The grantee must provide individualized services based on family assessments and adhere to evidence-based service delivery models for early childhood home visitation programs. They can allocate up to 25% of the funds for new approaches. Priority should be given to at-risk families, including those with low-income, young maternal age, and involvement with child welfare. Technical assistance will be provided by the HHS Secretary to support grantees. The HHS Secretary would appoint an expert panel to design an evaluation of the home visitation grant program, including an analysis of state needs assessments and the impact of early childhood home visitation programs on child and parent outcomes. A report on grantee improvement, technical assistance, and program activities must be submitted to Congress by specific deadlines. The section appropriates $1.5 billion for the home visitation grant program from FY2010 to FY2014. Funds are allocated for research, evaluation, and grants to tribal entities. The program is jointly administered by ACF and MCH Bureau, with a focus on expanding research and public education efforts. The section focuses on improving screening, diagnosis, clinical research, and public education for postpartum depression and related conditions. It mentions a potential longitudinal study by the NIMH on the mental health consequences for women of different pregnancy outcomes, with reports to be submitted to Congress periodically. The NIMH Director could submit reports to Congress on the findings of a study on postpartum conditions. A new section would authorize grants for essential services and support for individuals with postpartum conditions and their families, including education, outpatient services, inpatient care, and earlier diagnosis and treatment. The Secretary would establish a grant program for essential services and support for individuals with postpartum conditions, integrating it with other grant programs. Eligible entities include public or nonprofit private entities, state or local government public-private partnerships, and various healthcare facilities. $3 million would be authorized for FY2010, and SSAN for FY2011 and FY2012. The Secretary would also study the benefits of screening for postpartum conditions and submit a report to Congress within two years of enactment. SSA Sec. 510 authorizes a state formula grant program for abstinence education programs, with funds awarded based on low-income children proportion. States must match federal funds with state funds to receive funding. The program received $50 million annually from FY1998-FY2003, with funding extended through June 30, 2009. Funds are administered by ACF within HHS. PHSA Title XX authorizes teen pregnancy prevention programs. The HHS Secretary may award demonstration grants for teen pregnancy prevention programs, counseling, and related services. Grantees must evaluate program results and report to the Secretary. Title X Family Planning funds support comprehensive family planning services, education, and research. Grants for technical assistance and voluntary services are authorized under PHSA Sections 318 and 318A. The curr_chunk discusses the establishment of a new Personal Responsibility Education program under SSA Sec. 513, administered by the ACF, with a state formula grant program of $75 million annually for FY2010 through FY2014 to address sexually transmitted diseases in women. This program aims to provide pregnancy prevention information and services to teens based on their state's youth population size. The Personal Responsibility Education program under SSA Sec. 513 provides a state formula grant program of $75 million annually for FY2010 through FY2014 to educate adolescents on abstinence, contraception, and adulthood preparation subjects. Each state receives a minimum allotment of $250,000. The Personal Responsibility Education program under SSA Sec. 513 focuses on skills for employment preparation, job seeking, independent living, financial self-sufficiency, workplace productivity, and healthy life skills including goal-setting, decision making, negotiation, communication, interpersonal skills, and stress management. It requires evidence-based effective programs to delay sexual activity, increase condom or contraceptive use, and reduce pregnancy among youth. The program emphasizes responsible sexual behavior, abstinence, contraception, and prevention of pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections among youth. The Personal Responsibility Education program focuses on skills for employment preparation, job seeking, independent living, financial self-sufficiency, workplace productivity, and healthy life skills including goal-setting, decision making, negotiation, communication, interpersonal skills, and stress management. It requires evidence-based effective programs to delay sexual activity, increase condom or contraceptive use, and reduce pregnancy among youth. States must submit an application to the HHS Secretary with youth pregnancy rates, goals for reducing pregnancy rates, and a plan to achieve these goals, especially among high-risk youth populations. The section outlines eligibility criteria for states to access funds for the Personal Responsibility Education program. States must use allotted funds within two fiscal years, with unspent funds allocated to local organizations for program implementation. States that did not apply for funds in specific years are ineligible to apply in subsequent years. The Personal Responsibility Education program requires grant recipients to participate in a federal evaluation. $10 million annually is reserved for innovative pregnancy prevention strategies targeting high-risk youth. 5% of funds go to Indian tribes, and 10% for research and training. The Pregnancy Assistance Fund would create a new competitive grant program to help pregnant and parenting teens and women, with $50 million appropriated annually for abstinence education grants. States must submit applications to qualify for grants. The Pregnancy Assistance Fund under the PPACA allows states to allocate grant funds to institutions of higher education, high schools, community service centers, and state attorney generals for services related to violence against pregnant women. The funds can also be used to increase public awareness and education on pregnancy assistance. Eligible institutions of higher education can use the funds to establish services for pregnant and parenting students, including conducting needs assessments and improving access to resources. The Pregnancy Assistance Fund allows institutions of higher education to receive grant funds for services related to pregnant and parenting students. These services include maternity coverage, family housing, child care, flexible scheduling, parenting education, material items, and counseling. Institutions must work with public and private service providers to meet the needs of pregnant or parenting students. The Pregnancy Assistance Fund provides grant funds to higher education institutions for services supporting pregnant and parenting students. Institutions must offer maternity coverage, family housing, child care, flexible scheduling, parenting education, material items, and counseling. Institutions receiving funds must submit annual reports, and the state must report findings to the Secretary. Matching funds of 25% from non-federal sources are required. States can also allocate funds to high schools and community service centers for similar services without the need for matching funds. PPACA allows states to provide grant funds to attorney generals for intervention services for pregnant women who are victims of violence. The attorney general can offer training to various organizations and increase public awareness about available services. Matching funds are not required for these grants. Sec. 10214 authorizes and appropriates $25 million annually for ten years for the pregnancy assistance fund. States must have a case review system for children in foster care, including developing transition plans for youth aging out of foster care. The Chafee Foster Care Independence Program provides funds for independent living services for youth aging out of foster care. States must certify how these programs will be carried out. The Stephanie Tubbs Jones Child Welfare Services Program requires states to develop a plan for overseeing health care services for children in foster care, with coordination between the state child welfare agency and the state Medicaid agency. The plan must ensure that children in foster care have their health care needs met and updated medical information shared. It would require a transition plan for youth aging out of foster care to include information on designating someone to make health care decisions if needed. The proposed amendment would require states to educate foster care adolescents about designating a healthcare decision-maker and executing relevant legal documents. Additionally, it would mandate that the health care oversight plan for youth aging out of foster care includes steps to ensure their healthcare needs are met. The transition plan for youth aging out of foster care must include health-care related components such as health insurance options and legal documents like a health care power of attorney. Funding for mental health and substance abuse programs is provided through SAMHSA. Funding for Title V programs has expired, but some still receive funding. Schools and social work training programs are generally not eligible for funding under PHSA Title VII. In contrast to other programs, graduate programs in mental and behavioral health are eligible for health professions training grants under Title VII. Insurers offering behavioral health coverage must provide it equally to physical health coverage. In 2007, 11% of Americans experienced serious psychological distress, while 8% were current illicit drug users. The behavioral health care system faces challenges in access, quality, insurance coverage, and care coordination. PPACA aims to address these issues. PPACA aims to address behavioral health issues through coordinated care for individuals with mental disorders and co-occurring physical illness, education and training of providers, mental health parity, and establishing centers of excellence for depression treatment. It includes creating grants for co-locating primary and specialty care in community-based mental health settings to provide coordinated care for individuals with mental illness and co-occurring primary care conditions and chronic diseases. The grant funds would support co-locating primary and specialty care services in community-based mental health settings for individuals with mental illness and co-occurring physical conditions. Grantees must provide specific services like primary care, diagnostic services, and screenings for special populations. A maximum of 15% of funds can be used for IT or facility improvements. Grantees must evaluate the effectiveness of activities within 90 days of grant expiration. $50 million would be authorized for FY2010 and SSAN for FY2011 through FY2014. The new PHSA Sec. 756 authorizes grants for mental and behavioral health education and training. Grants will support recruitment and education in social work and psychology programs, as well as training for paraprofessional mental health workers. Priority will be given to accredited institutions with high graduation rates. At least four grant recipients must be historically black colleges or universities or other minority-serving institutions. Grants prioritize institutions with high graduation rates for social work and psychology programs. Emphasis is placed on training professionals to serve vulnerable populations in high-need areas. Priority for grants to train paraprofessional child and adolescent mental health workers is given to applicants with demonstrated data collection abilities, familiarity with evidence-based methods, programs to increase workers in high-priority populations, collaborative curriculum with families, and services through a community mental health program. Funding authorization for training includes $8 million for social work, $12 million for graduate psychology, $10 million for professional child and adolescent mental health, and $5 million for paraprofessional child and adolescent training for FY2010 through FY2013. The section proposes the establishment of national centers of excellence for depression through competitive grants. The Secretary would be required to establish up to 20 Centers within a year of enactment and up to 30 Centers by September 30, 2016. Grant recipients must provide non-federal contributions equal to $1 for every $5 of federal grant funds. Each Center would focus on activities related to the treatment of depressive disorders. The proposal suggests creating national centers of excellence for depression through competitive grants. Each Center must carry out specified activities, including developing treatment standards, clinical guidelines, and expanding research. The coordinating Center would establish a national database and performance standards. The Secretary would issue Center report cards and make recommendations for improvements and expansion based on evaluations by an independent third party. The proposal recommends establishing national centers of excellence for depression through competitive grants, with allocated funding for each fiscal year. Efforts to improve healthcare quality have focused on refining metrics, publicly reporting quality performance, and implementing value-based purchasing policies. The PPACA addresses quality measurement, patient safety, care coordination, and comparative effectiveness research. It lacks provisions for national priorities for performance improvement but mandates the Secretary to contract with a consensus-based entity to develop a national strategy for health. AHRQ has statutory authority to develop quality measures and promote healthcare quality improvement. They are responsible for research, development, testing, and dissemination of quality measures. Current law does not require multi-stakeholder input in selecting quality measures for CMS's programs. The PPACA includes provisions for the Secretary to select quality measures for CMS's quality programs, establishing a national strategy for quality improvement, and formalizing processes for quality measure selection and public reporting of quality information. The PPACA includes a new Sec. 399HH mandating the Secretary to establish a national strategy for healthcare quality improvement. This strategy aims to enhance health care delivery, outcomes, and population health by addressing priorities such as high-cost chronic diseases, federal payment policy, health disparities, and quality measures. The strategy must include a comprehensive plan to achieve these priorities and promote coordination among stakeholders. The PPACA mandates the Secretary to establish a national strategy for healthcare quality improvement, addressing coordination among agencies, aligning public and private payers, and creating a health care quality website. It also requires the President to convene an Interagency Working Group on Health Care Quality to promote collaboration, avoid duplication, streamline reporting, and assess alignment of quality efforts. The Working Group, composed of senior representatives from federal agencies, would submit progress reports to Congress and make recommendations publicly. A new section in Title IX of the PHSA would require the Director of AHRQ to identify gaps in quality measures and consider input from contracted entities. The Director of AHRQ is required to identify gaps in quality measures and report on the process used to identify them. Funding or agreements with eligible entities would be made to develop quality measures in areas identified as gaps, prioritizing measures for health outcomes, care coordination, disparities, and efficiency. Entities receiving funds must use them to develop quality measures that can be collected using HIT. The Director of AHRQ is required to identify gaps in quality measures and report on the process. Funding would be provided to develop quality measures in identified areas, prioritizing health outcomes, care coordination, disparities, and efficiency. Measures must be collectible using HIT and publicly available. The Secretary would develop outcome measures for hospitals and physicians, including acute and chronic disease, and primary and preventive care. $75 million would be authorized for FY2010. This section authorizes $75 million for FY2010 through FY2014 to establish a consensus-based entity with new duties. The entity will convene multi-stakeholder groups to select quality measures and national priorities, excluding data sets used for payment rates. Input from these groups must be submitted to the Secretary by February 1 each year starting in 2012. The new section would require the entity to report gaps in endorsed measures and areas with insufficient evidence to Congress and the Secretary. It also mandates the establishment of a pre-rulemaking process with six steps to select quality measures, including stakeholder input and publication of rationales in the Federal Register. Additionally, the Secretary must establish a process for disseminating quality measures. The Secretary is required to establish a process for disseminating quality measures and periodically review them. $20 million would be transferred from Medicare Trust Funds to the CMS Program Management Account annually. A new section would be added to collect and analyze data for quality and resource use measures. The Secretary must implement a strategic framework for public reporting of performance information. The Secretary is required to collect and aggregate consistent data on quality and resource use measures, award grants or contracts for this purpose, and ensure data systems involve a broad range of patient populations. Grants or contracts can be awarded to support new or improve existing efforts in data collection. The Secretary can only award grants or contracts to entities that enable summary data integration and comparison across multiple sources. Authorization of appropriation for FY2010 through FY2014 is included in this section. Additionally, a new section on Public Reporting of Performance Information would require the Secretary to make performance information available to the public. The Secretary is required to make performance information available to the public through standardized websites, including data on quality measures specific to clinical conditions. Stakeholder input is gathered through multi-stakeholder groups convened by the entity with a contract under SSA Sec. 1890(a). The Secretary must consult with relevant entities to determine useful information for stakeholders. Authorization for appropriation is included in this section. The PHSA, Title IX, authorizes the appropriation of SSAN for FY2010 through FY2014, granting AHRQ authority to conduct research on health care quality and provide financial assistance for various projects. The Secretary is also given general authority to coordinate research on physical and mental diseases. The section discusses the creation of a new Subpart II for Health Care Quality Improvement Programs under the PHSA, allowing the Director of AHRQ to develop innovative strategies for quality improvement in healthcare delivery. It also establishes The Center for Quality Improvement and Patient Safety of AHRQ to identify high-quality healthcare providers. The Center for Quality Improvement and Patient Safety of AHRQ aims to identify high-quality healthcare providers by assessing research, evidence, and knowledge to improve healthcare delivery. It focuses on translating information effectively, creating strategies for quality improvement, and building capacity at the state and community level through education and training programs. The Director of the Center for Quality Improvement and Patient Safety would be required to share research findings with the public and the Office of the National Coordinator of Health Information Technology. They would also need to coordinate activities with the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation. $20 million would be authorized for funding from FY2010 through FY2014, with additional funding for technical assistance to eligible entities. The curr_chunk discusses the authorization of funds to provide technical assistance to healthcare institutions for implementing research-based models and practices. Sec. 3511 of PPACA would allow grants to eligible entities for demonstration projects integrating quality improvement into clinical education. Non-federal contributions are required for funding. The curr_chunk discusses the requirement for non-federal contributions towards program costs, evaluation of funded projects, publication of evaluation results, and submission of a report to congressional committees. It also mentions the authorization of funds for activities under this section. Medicare pays hospitals using the IPPS system based on MS-DRG classification. Starting October 1, 2008, hospitals did not receive additional Medicare payment for complications that were acquired during a patient's hospital stay for certain select conditions known as hospital-acquired conditions (HACs). These HACs are high cost, high volume, or both, identified through a secondary diagnosis that will result in the assignment to a different, higher paid MS-DRG, and reasonably preventable through evidence-based guidelines. Sec. 10303(b) would amend SSA Sec. 1890A to require the Secretary to publicly report on measures for HACs utilized by CMS for payment adjustment to hospitals. The Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 required the Institute of Medicine to study best methods for developing clinical practice guidelines. Stakeholders with expertise in clinical recommendations must participate in the study. The results and recommendations are to be submitted to the Secretary and Congress for potential legislative and administrative action. The Secretary is required to contract with the IOM every three years to identify clinical practice guidelines developed using best methods. Care coordination is crucial in healthcare to prevent waste and improve patient outcomes. The current system prioritizes specialty care over primary care. The current healthcare system prioritizes specialty care over primary care, leading to patients with multiple chronic conditions receiving care from various providers in different settings. This can compromise patients' understanding and management of their conditions, resulting in deficiencies in care quality. H.R. 3490 and the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 address these issues by supporting care coordination through medical homes, medication management services, patient navigator services, and patient empowerment through education on managing chronic conditions. The Medical Home model, supported by MIPPA Sec. 133, allows for regular monitoring and treatment of illnesses. Medicare Part D sponsors must establish MTM programs with pharmacists to ensure appropriate drug use. PHSA Sec. 340A authorizes grants for demonstration programs to provide care coordination. The curr_chunk discusses grants for patient navigator services to assist individuals with chronic diseases in accessing healthcare services. It also mentions the implementation of a grant program to establish health teams supporting primary care providers. Eligible grantees include states, Indian tribes, or tribal organizations. The curr_chunk discusses the establishment of a grant program for medical homes to provide services to Medicaid beneficiaries with chronic conditions. A medical home is defined as a mode of care that includes personal physicians, coordinated care, and payment that recognizes added value from patient-centered components. Eligible grantees include states, Indian tribes, or tribal organizations. The curr_chunk discusses specific activities required for health teams under a grant program for medical homes to provide services to Medicaid beneficiaries with chronic conditions. These activities include establishing agreements with primary care providers, integrating preventive services, providing 24-hour care management, and more. The program would be authorized to appropriate funds to carry out these activities. Management Services in Treatment of Chronic Diseases would involve the Secretary providing grants to support Medication Therapy Management (MTM) services by licensed pharmacists. Grantees must offer various MTM services to targeted individuals, including assessing health status, formulating treatment plans, administering medication therapy, monitoring patient response, documenting care, providing education on medication use, and integrating MTM services into broader healthcare management. These services target individuals taking four or more prescribed medications. The program targets individuals taking multiple prescribed medications, high-risk medications, with chronic diseases, or undergoing transitions of care. The Secretary must assess and report on the program, with funding authorized under Sec. 3511 of PPACA. A new PHSA Sec. 936 would facilitate shared decision-making between patients, caregivers, and clinicians. The Secretary must contract with a consensus-based organization under SSA Sec. 1890. The Secretary must award grants or contracts to develop patient decision aids, review them, and establish certification processes. Grants will also be given for Shared Decision Making Resource Centers and providers implementing shared decision-making techniques. The section authorizes grants for providers to report quality measures, receive feedback, and ensure patient navigators meet core proficiencies. Funding is allocated for FY2010 and subsequent years, with specific appropriations outlined. Additionally, a new section is added to award grants to support eligible entities. A new PHSA Sec. 340H authorizes grants for community-based collaborative care networks (CCNs) to provide comprehensive health care services for low-income populations. Grant funds can be used for case management, outreach, transportation, capacity expansion, and direct patient care services. The Secretary may impose limits on grant funding for direct care services by HRSA grantees. Funding is authorized for FY2011 through FY2015. The sections authorize appropriations for FY2011 through FY2015 to enhance accountability requirements for Medicare certified skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) and Medicaid certified nursing facilities (NFs). Changes include additional information on facility ownership, organizational structure, staff compliance, and ethics training programs. The Secretary must establish requirements for compliance and ethics programs, improve information on the Medicare Nursing Home Compare website, and ensure it is easily accessible to consumers. SNFs are required to report. The sections authorize appropriations for FY2011 through FY2015 to enhance accountability requirements for Medicare certified skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) and Medicaid certified nursing facilities (NFs). Changes include additional information on facility ownership, organizational structure, staff compliance, and ethics training programs. SNFs would be required to report wage and benefit expenditures for direct care staff. The Secretary, in consultation with private sector experts, would redesign Medicare and Medicaid cost reports to capture wage and benefit reporting by SNFs and NFs. Develop a new standardized complaint form for facilities and states to make available to stakeholders and consumers. SNFs and NFs must electronically report direct staffing information to the Secretary following specified guidelines. The GAO would conduct a study of the CMS Five-Star rating system. Additional civil money penalties would be established for quality of care issues and deficiencies. The Secretary would develop a national independent monitoring demonstration for SNF and NF chains to address quality of care issues. New requirements would be established for informing residents and stakeholders of planned facility closures, with penalties for non-compliance. Demonstration projects on culture change and information technology in SNFs and NFs would be conducted. Nurse aide training and evaluation would be revised. The Secretary would revise nurse aide training to include dementia and abuse prevention, establish a nationwide program for background checks on LTC facility employees, and provide federal matching funds to states for this purpose. This program would be similar to the Background Check Pilot program under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003. From January 2005 to September 2007, CMS ran the Background Check Pilot program in seven states. The program required LTC providers to conduct criminal history background checks on prospective employees. The Secretary would enter agreements with participating states and transfer funds to HHS for the program. The Secretary could reserve up to $3 million for program implementation. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) established a new private, non-profit corporation called the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research. This institute would replace the Federal Coordinating Council for Comparative Effectiveness Research and would be funded with $1.1 billion from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). The Secretary would be authorized to reserve up to $3 million for program evaluation. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act established the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to advance clinical evidence through research and evidence synthesis. The Institute would identify national research priorities, conduct systematic reviews, and collaborate with federal agencies and research entities for funding and research management. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute would have a 19-member board including representatives from various healthcare groups appointed by the U.S. Comptroller General. Expert advisory panels would assist in identifying research priorities and establishing the research agenda, with specific panels for clinical trials and rare diseases. A methodology committee would also be established with members appointed by the Comptroller General and directors of AHRQ and NIH. The methodology committee, consisting of 15 members appointed by the Comptroller General, AHRQ, and NIH, is responsible for developing and improving comparative clinical effectiveness research methods. They establish research design standards, consult with outside entities, and ensure procedures for conflict-of-interest, data privacy, peer-review, and public information availability. A new PHSA Sec. 937 mandates AHRQ to disseminate research findings and create a publicly available database of government-funded CCER research. The CCER research aims to develop a publicly available database of government-funded evidence. Dissemination materials would describe research methodology and limitations, without being seen as mandates or guidelines. Training of researchers and building data capacity are required, along with authorizing federal agencies to contract with the Institute for research support. Additionally, a new SSA Sec. 1182 would limit the Secretary's use of research findings for coverage determinations, requiring an iterative and transparent process with public input. The new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund (PCORTF) would prohibit the use of research findings that devalue the lives of elderly, disabled, or terminally ill individuals in Medicare coverage decisions. It also prohibits the use of values that discount life based on disability. The Fund would receive specified annual appropriations for the Institute's activities. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund (PCORTF) would receive annual appropriations totaling $1.26 billion over FY2010-FY2019, additional funds from a new fee on health insurance policies, and transfers from the Medicare Trust Funds through FY2019. The new fee and transfers would be adjusted annually for medical inflation. This section would terminate the FCCCER upon enactment. The AHRQ and CDC NCHS conduct activities on U.S. population health, focusing on quality of care and disparities. NCHS collects data on illness, disability, health hazards, determinants of health, health resources, healthcare utilization, costs, and family demographics. The Commission on Key National Indicators would oversee a new national indicator system, coordinate with government users and data providers, and work with the National Academy of Sciences to establish the system. The National Academy of Sciences would establish a key national indicator system by partnering with an independent organization, selecting criteria and methodologies, designing a public website for access to indicators, and submitting annual reports to the Commission on Key National Indicators. The National Academy of Sciences would establish a key national indicator system in partnership with an independent organization. The Comptroller General of the United States would conduct a study on best practices for the indicator system and submit findings to Congress. $10 million would be authorized for FY2010, and $7.5 million for each FY2011 through FY2018. Federal initiatives like the National Healthcare Disparities Report and HealthyPeople 2010 focus on health status, access to care, quality of care, and disparities using existing federally sponsored data. The OMB provides guidance on data collection for federally sponsored surveys. The OMB provides policy guidance for data collection from federally sponsored surveys and records. Categories must be aggregated into a minimum set for reporting purposes. OMB standards do not apply to state and municipal public health departments or Medicaid, but apply to CHIP. CMS mandates reporting of primary language for Medicaid beneficiaries, but not for CHIP. Data on access to care for disabled individuals is not required to be collected for federal health care programs or other federally sponsored entities. Surveys like the National Health Interview Survey and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey collect data on access to care for the disabled, but analysis is limited by survey items, variation, and sample size. Federal data collection efforts often include items for measuring race, ethnicity, primary language, and disabilities. Sample surveys may not have sufficient sample size for reliable estimates for small subpopulations, such as those with disabilities or non-English primary language. Oversampling and combining data from multiple years can improve precision. The cost of data collection influences sample size, and current law requires evaluation of data collection approaches for disparities data. The Secretary must develop reports for Congress on best approaches for collecting disparities data and improving care. The new PHSA Title XXXI, Data Collection and Analysis, requires the collection of disparities data on race, ethnicity, sex, and primary language in federally conducted or supported health care programs. It aims to ensure statistically reliable estimates for studies on health disparities among populations and includes data collection requirements for individuals receiving health care services under federal programs. Sec. 3101 of the new PHSA Title XXXI mandates the collection of data on individuals receiving health care services by race, ethnicity, sex, primary language, and disability status. It also requires the development of OMB-compliant standards for data collection and surveys of health care providers to assess accessibility and training for patients with disabilities. Additionally, Sec. 4302 calls for the development of national interoperability and security standards for managing this data. Sec. 4302 mandates the establishment of procedures for sharing data collected under federal health care programs on race, ethnicity, gender, language, and disability, with privacy and security safeguards. It also includes underserved rural populations and requires evaluation of approaches for collecting data on health care disparities. The Secretary is required to evaluate data collection methodologies for health care disparities, including race, ethnicity, sex, language, and disability under Medicaid and CHIP. Reports with recommendations for improving identification of disparities must be submitted, and promising data collection approaches implemented within 24 months of the Act's enactment. The new SSA Sec. 1946 requires the Secretary to report data on race, ethnicity, sex, language, and disability collected using federal funding. It authorizes appropriations for carrying out Sec. 4302 and elevates the Office of Minority Health within the HHS Office of Public Health and Science. The Office will be headed by a Deputy Assistant Director for Minority Health who will report directly to the Secretary. Grants, contracts, and agreements will be awarded by the Secretary through the DAD. The Secretary would be required to award grants, contracts, and enter into agreements with certain entities to improve health status of racial and ethnic minorities. Biennial reports on activities under PHSA Sec. 1707 must be submitted to congressional committees. HHS agency heads must create Offices of Minority Health and appropriate funds for FY2011 through FY2016. Heads of CDC, HRSA, SAMHSA, AHRQ, FDA, and CMS must establish an Office of Minority Health within their agencies. CMS will establish an Office of Minority Health within each agency, with directors appointed by the agency head. Funding will be designated for these activities, and the National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities will be redesignated as an Institute. The Institute Director's authority will be expanded to include research endowments for centers of excellence, with eligibility based on national median endowment funds. The Director will coordinate all research and activities supported by the Institute. The official responsible for coordinating research and activities on minority health and health disparities at NIH is tasked with planning, reviewing, and evaluating research conducted by NIH's Centers and Institutes. HIPAA's Administrative Simplification provisions mandated the adoption of electronic format and data standards for various healthcare transactions. This included patient eligibility inquiries, reimbursement claims, claims status inquiries, payment advice, and data transfer standards among health plans for claims processing coordination. In 2000, CMS issued standards for healthcare transactions and coordination of benefits. Updated standards were published in 2009, with a compliance deadline of January 1, 2012. The health care payment and remittance advice transaction involves communication between a health plan and provider regarding claim payment. Electronic funds transfer (EFT) can be used for payment, although it is not mandated by federal law for Medicare, Medicaid, or private insurance. In 2005, CMS proposed a standard for health care claims attachments, a transaction used to request and provide additional clinical data for claim adjudication. Providers can choose to submit HIPAA transactions electronically, with Medicare claims mandated to be in HIPAA standard format since 2001. The development process for HIPAA transactions includes optional data fields for plan-specific information. Unique identifiers for providers and employers have been adopted, while the health plan identifier is still under review. Congress has blocked the development of a unique individual identifier. This section aims to establish a timeline for the development of operating rules for each HIPAA transaction to create uniformity in implementation. The section aims to establish operating rules for HIPAA transactions to create uniformity in implementation, ensuring eligibility determination, comprehensive coverage, and timely acknowledgment. Operating rules are defined as necessary business guidelines for electronic information exchange, with recommendations considered from a qualified nonprofit entity using a consensus-based process. The section establishes operating rules for HIPAA transactions to ensure uniformity in implementation. It includes deadlines for adopting EFT standards and operating rules for various transactions, with a committee tasked to review and update standards biennially. By December 31, 2013, health plans must certify compliance with current standards for specific transactions. By December 31, 2015, they must certify compliance for all HIPAA transactions. The Secretary can appoint an outside entity to verify certifications and conduct audits for ongoing compliance. The section requires the Secretary to assess penalty fees against health plans for non-compliance with certification requirements, with the Treasury responsible for fee collection. Unpaid fees accrue interest and can be offset against tax refunds. The Secretary must establish a unique health plan identifier and adopt transaction standards for health claims attachments. An interim final rule may be issued by October 1, 2012. The section mandates the development of interoperable standards for enrollment in health and human services programs within 180 days of enactment. The standards must allow for electronic matching against federal and state data. The Secretary would develop interoperable standards for enrollment in health and human services programs, including electronic matching against federal and state data, simplification of documentation submission, reuse of eligibility information, online eligibility management, system integration for new programs, notification of eligibility status, and streamlining of the enrollment process. States would be notified upon approval of standards and required to incorporate them to receive federal HIT funds. Grants would be awarded for developing or upgrading enrollment systems. The Secretary would award grants to states and localities to develop or upgrade IT systems for implementing enrollment standards. Grantees must submit an adoption and implementation plan, collaborate with others, and share the IT at no cost. PHSA Title XII authorizes funding for trauma care research, training, evaluations, and demonstration projects in rural areas. The text chunk discusses a state formula grant program for trauma care in emergency medical services, focusing on the importance of the \"golden hour\" in saving lives after an injury. It highlights the need for timely access to trauma centers and the varying distribution of these centers across states and regions. The curr_chunk discusses the need to improve access to trauma care systems, especially in rural areas. It proposes amending the PHSA Sec. 1203 to provide competitive grants for trauma systems and transferring administration to the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response. Additionally, it suggests awarding contracts or grants for pilot projects to enhance regional coordination of emergency services. Funding would be given to eligible entities. The curr_chunk proposes pilot projects to improve regional coordination of emergency services through competitive grants. Funding would require a match of $1 for every $3 of federal funds, with priority given to medically underserved areas. Grantees must submit a detailed evaluation of the program within 90 days. Additionally, $24 million would be authorized for trauma care grant programs annually from FY2010 to FY2014. The curr_chunk proposes expanding research on emergency medical care systems and pediatric emergency medicine, as well as studying the economic impact of coordinated emergency care systems. It includes provisions for awarding grants to trauma centers and authorizing funding for FY2010 to FY2014. The curr_chunk proposes grants for trauma centers to help cover uncompensated care costs and support their core missions. Trauma centers must be part of the state's emergency care plan to be eligible for grants up to $2 million per year. Centers would be categorized based on the percentage of charity, self-pay, and Medicaid patients, with grants covering a specified percentage of their uncompensated care costs. Category A centers could receive grants covering 100% of their costs. The Secretary would award core mission grants to qualified trauma centers and emergency relief grants to those in areas with declining trauma care availability. Grantees must maintain trauma care services and provide data to a national registry. $100 million would be authorized for FY2009 and SSAN for FY2010 through FY2015 for the grant program. The Secretary would award grants to states for trauma-related physician specialties and trauma care services. Distribution of funds would be based on annual appropriation levels, with a focus on states with trauma centers providing uncompensated care. A biennial report to Congress on the grant programs' status would be required. The appropriation of funds for state grants to trauma centers providing uncompensated care would be based on annual levels, with a minimum of $10 million specified. The grant period for expanding emergency services for children would be extended to four years, with optional fifth-year funding. The Pain Consortium under NIH would receive funding of $25 million for FY2010, increasing annually to $30.4 million for FY2014 to enhance pain research and collaboration among researchers. The PHSA Sec. 403 requires the NIH Director to submit a biennial report to the President and Congress on research activities, including pain and palliative care. PPACA includes a section for pain research and education, aiming to recognize pain as a national public health issue and establish a health professionals training program in pain care. It also mandates the Secretary to convene a Conference on Pain within a year of fund appropriation to address pain as a significant public health problem in the U.S. The PPACA aims to address pain as a public health issue in the U.S. by authorizing funds for research through the Pain Consortium. It also requires the establishment of the Interagency Pain Research Coordinating Committee to coordinate initiatives. The PPACA authorizes funds for pain research through the Pain Consortium and establishes the Interagency Pain Research Coordinating Committee to coordinate efforts within HHS and other federal agencies. A new program under PHSA Sec. 759 would train health professionals in pain care, with funding for education and training programs on pain assessment, treatment, laws on controlled substances, interdisciplinary approaches, and barriers to care in underserved populations. The Secretary would be required to evaluate programs for pain care and elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation in domestic and institutional settings. Efforts to collect data on elder abuse are hindered by state variations in definitions. The prevalence of elder abuse and neglect is difficult to identify due to varying state definitions and lack of a uniform reporting system. Studies estimate that hundreds of thousands of older Americans experience abuse or neglect, with many incidents going unreported. Congress has taken steps to address elder justice through federal assistance and amendments to the Older Americans Act. The Elder Justice Act aims to address abuse, neglect, and exploitation of the elderly at a national level by providing separate funding for prevention activities and establishing the Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program. This legislation combines law enforcement, public health, and social services to combat elder abuse. The Elder Justice Act of 2009 (S. 795) provisions have been incorporated into PPACA (P.L. 109-365), including elder justice provisions amended to Title XX of the SSA, protections for residents of long-term care facilities, and the establishment of a national nurse aide registry. Subsection (a) of Sec. 6703 would insert new Elder Justice provisions into Title XX of the SSA under a new Block Grants to States for Social Services and Elder Justice subtitle, with two parts: National Coordination of Elder Justice Activities and Research, and Programs to Promote Elder Justice. The proposed Title XX, Subtitle B, Part I would establish an Elder Justice Coordinating Council and Advisory Board on Elder Abuse, Neglect, and Exploitation. It would include new sections awarding grants for forensic centers. The Elder Justice Coordinating Council would be chaired by the Secretary and include the U.S. Attorney General and heads of federal departments. The Elder Justice Coordinating Council, chaired by the Secretary, would include the U.S. Attorney General and heads of federal departments responsible for elder abuse. It would make recommendations for coordinating activities and submit reports to Congress every two years. Funding would be authorized for its functions, and an Advisory Board on Elder Abuse, Neglect, and Exploitation would also be established. Subpart A proposes the establishment of an Advisory Board on Elder Abuse, Neglect, and Exploitation to develop a multidisciplinary plan for elder justice, composed of 27 members with expertise in prevention. The Board will collaborate on improving long-term care quality, establish panels to address relevant issues, and submit reports to Congress and the Elder Justice Coordinating Council. The proposed Subpart A establishes an Advisory Board on Elder Abuse, Neglect, and Exploitation to develop a plan for elder justice. It includes 27 members with expertise in prevention, collaborates on improving long-term care quality, and submits reports to Congress and the Elder Justice Coordinating Council. Additionally, it requires the Secretary to promulgate guidelines for researchers working on elder abuse issues and defines \"legally authorized representative\" for research purposes. The proposed Subpart A establishes an Advisory Board on Elder Abuse, Neglect, and Exploitation to develop a plan for elder justice. It includes 27 members with expertise in prevention, collaborates on improving long-term care quality, and submits reports to Congress and the Elder Justice Coordinating Council. Additionally, it requires the Secretary to promulgate guidelines for researchers working on elder abuse issues and defines \"legally authorized representative\" for research purposes. Subpart B would add a new Sec. 2031, Establishment and Support of Elder Abuse, Neglect, and Exploitation Forensic Centers, requiring grants to establish and operate forensic centers to develop expertise in elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation. Funding would be authorized for the centers to develop forensic markers to determine abuse or neglect and methodologies for intervention. The proposed legislation aims to enhance forensic expertise in elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation, coordinate with the U.S. Attorney General to develop capacity in geriatric health care professionals and law enforcement, and establish grant programs to promote elder justice. Funding of $4 million in FY2011, $6 million in FY2012, and $8 million for each of FY2013 and FY2014 is authorized for these activities. The section aims to enhance long-term care by providing incentives for individuals to train and work in direct care. Grants will be awarded for training programs, certification, and bonuses for employees. Training and technical assistance will be provided to promote retention and accountability measures will ensure benefits for direct care workers. The Secretary can authorize grants to LTC facilities for purchasing EHR technology to improve patient safety and reduce medication errors. Facilities must participate in state health exchange activities and accountability measures will be developed to ensure effectiveness. The Secretary would be required to adopt electronic standards for the exchange of clinical data by LTC facilities to improve patient safety and reduce medication errors. Within 10 years, procedures must be in place for electronic submission of clinical data. Regulations would be promulgated for transactions involving clinical data by LTC facilities, with a requirement for data collection and reporting by states receiving funds. $20 million would be authorized for FY2011. The section authorizes funding for Adult Protective Service Functions and Grant Program, including investigating elder abuse, collecting data, providing training, conducting research, and offering technical assistance. Funding amounts are specified for FY2011 through FY2014. The section authorizes funding for Adult Protective Service Functions and Grant Program, including investigating elder abuse, collecting data, providing training, conducting research, and offering technical assistance. Funding amounts are specified as $3 million for FY2011, and $4 million for each of FY2012 through FY2014. The Secretary is required to establish two grant programs, one for enhancing APS programs provided by states and local governments, and the other for APS demonstration programs. Grant distribution is based on the number of individuals aged 60 or older in each state, with minimum allocations set for states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories. Grant awards for APS demonstration programs can be used for testing training programs. The APS demonstration programs allow state and local governments to test training modules for detecting elder abuse and financial exploitation. Funding of $100 million annually for APS programs and $25 million for demonstration grants is authorized for FY2011 through FY2014. The Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program Grants aim to improve the capacity of state LTC ombudsman programs to address abuse and neglect complaints. The provision authorizes funding for pilot programs with state or local LTC ombudsman offices to address abuse and neglect complaints. It also requires the Secretary to establish training programs for elder abuse, neglect, and exploitation. Funding of $5 million for FY2011, $7.5 million for FY2012, and $10 million for FY2013 and FY2014 is authorized. Additionally, $10 million for each of FY2011 through FY2014 is authorized for ombudsman training programs. The provision requires the Secretary to reserve a portion of funds for validated evaluations of funded activities. The Secretary must conduct evaluations and appropriate grant audits for the certified EHR technology grant program. A report compiling state reports must be submitted by October 1, 2014 to the Elder Justice Coordinating Council and Congress committees. The section discusses the compilation and analysis of state reports under APS grant programs, recommendations for legislative action, and a rule of construction stating that Subtitle B does not limit state law obligations. It also amends SSA Sec. 402(a)(1)(B) to require TANF state plans to include assistance for training in LTC facilities or elder care occupations, effective January 1, 2011. The amendment effective January 1, 2011, establishes a National Training Institute for Surveyors and grants to state survey agencies. It requires training for surveyors investigating abuse, neglect, and property misappropriation in Medicare or Medicaid facilities. $12 million is authorized for FY2011 through FY2014 for these activities. Grants will be awarded to state survey agencies for complaint investigation systems in Medicare or Medicaid facilities. The amendment authorizes funding for training surveyors investigating abuse, neglect, and property misappropriation in Medicare or Medicaid facilities. It also requires reporting of crimes in federally funded long-term care facilities and notification of individuals to report any suspicion of a crime. The amendment mandates reporting suspected crimes in long-term care facilities to the Secretary and law enforcement. Failure to report could lead to penalties and exclusion from federal health care programs. Retaliation against employees for reporting is prohibited, with penalties for facilities that engage in such behavior. The Secretary could penalize long-term care facilities for not reporting suspected crimes, leading to exclusion from federal health care programs. A study on establishing a national nurse aide registry is required, including considerations for privacy laws and data collection. The Secretary must submit a report within 18 months. The Secretary must submit a report to the Elder Justice Coordinating Council and congressional committees after enacting a study. Funding of up to $500,000 would be authorized for this study. The FDA is responsible for regulating the safety and effectiveness of medical products, impacting healthcare costs and quality. The FDA regulates the safety and effectiveness of medical products, impacting healthcare costs and quality. Adding regulatory requirements may increase product quality but also raise costs or delay consumer access. FDA's regulation of food, including nutrition labeling, can affect individuals' health. PPACA contains provisions affecting FDA regulation of prescription drugs and other products. The FDA regulates medical products to ensure safety and effectiveness, impacting healthcare costs and quality. PPACA contains provisions that would improve health care decision making by changing drug labeling requirements and requiring nutrition labeling at certain establishments. Additionally, provisions would create a licensure pathway for biosimilars and authorize the collection of associated fees. Misbranded drugs introduced into interstate commerce are subject to penalties under the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act. The FDA regulates medical products to ensure safety and effectiveness. PPACA includes provisions to improve health care decision making by changing drug labeling requirements and requiring nutrition labeling at certain establishments. FFDCA Sec. 502 lists information required in drug labeling, while FFDCA Sec. 505(j) requires an abbreviated application for new drugs to have the same labeling as approved drugs. The Secretary would determine if adding information about health benefits and risks to drug labeling and advertising improves decision-making. This would require reviewing scientific evidence, consulting stakeholders, and potentially implementing new regulations. Funding would be authorized for these activities under PPACA. Additionally, FFDCA Sec. 505(j) would be amended to allow ANDA approval for drugs with labeling reflecting the approved referent drug. The FDA is considering requiring nutrition labeling for some currently exempted foods to promote healthy eating. This provision would apply unless the Secretary determines it would adversely impact drug safety or if changes are made to the \"Warnings\" section of the label. Congress is concerned about rising obesity rates and its impact on health and healthcare costs. The FDA is considering new nutrition labeling requirements for chain restaurants and similar establishments with 20 or more locations to disclose calorie information for standard menu items. States and localities can petition for exemptions from these requirements. The FDA is considering new nutrition labeling requirements for chain restaurants and similar establishments with 20 or more locations to disclose calorie information for standard menu items. This would include providing detailed written nutritional information upon request and establishing standards for disclosing nutrient content. Vending machine operators with 20 or more machines would also need to display calorie information for each food item. The Secretary would be responsible for creating regulations for these requirements. The section amends FFDCA Sec. 403A to preempt states and localities from establishing different nutrition labeling requirements. The Secretary must create proposed regulations and provide quarterly reports to Congress on progress. The amendments do not preempt state or local laws unless they conflict with the new requirements. A biosimilar, also known as a \"follow-on\" biologic, is similar to a brand-name biologic, while a generic drug is identical to a brand-name chemical drug. Biosimilars are more challenging to compare structurally to brand-name biologics than generics are to chemical drugs. Biologics are preparations made from living organisms, often complex proteins that require special handling and are typically administered via injection or infusion. Biosimilars are similar to brand-name biologics and are administered via injection or infusion. Current technology may not fully characterize biological products, requiring additional clinical trials for FDA approval. Congress aims to create an expedited pathway for biosimilar approval to achieve cost savings, similar to the pathway for generic chemical drugs under the Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984. The FDA's approval of biosimilars aims to create cost savings by avoiding clinical trials and initial research costs incurred by brand-name manufacturers. Brand-name biologics like Enbrel can be expensive, costing $16,000 per year. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 establishes a pathway for biosimilar approval to promote market competition and reduce prices. The PHSA Sec. 351 establishes a pathway for biosimilar approval, defining biosimilars as highly similar to reference products with no clinically meaningful differences. It allows the Secretary to determine elements in the licensure application may be unnecessary and provides a 12-year data exclusivity period. The section provides a 12-year data exclusivity period for reference products, with additional exclusivity for orphan drugs. It allows for exclusive marketing for the first interchangeable biological product. The Secretary can publish guidance for public comment on biological product licensure. The section outlines a process for patent infringement claims and disputes for biological product licenses under PHSA Sec. 351. It also mandates user fees for biosimilar application reviews and sets a 10-year transition period for products approved under FFDCA Sec. 505. The Secretary must develop recommendations for biosimilar product application reviews and present them to Congress. Recommendations must be published with a public comment period and a meeting. Congress should authorize a user fee program effective October 1, 2012. Data on review costs must be collected until October 1, 2010. An audit of costs must be done every two years. User fees may be altered based on audit results. An alteration of user fees based on audit results is required for application review costs. Additional six months of exclusivity is granted for conducting pediatric studies before FDA approval for new biologic drugs. For biologic drugs already on the market, an extra six months of exclusivity is provided if pediatric studies are conducted and extension requested at least nine months before original exclusivity period expires. An IOM study is mandated to assess pediatric testing of biological products and offer recommendations for ensuring testing. The HHS Secretary and Treasury Secretary must determine the savings to the federal government from biosimilar approval pathway for deficit reduction. PPACA includes revenue-generating measures through taxes on branded drugs and medical devices, causing concern in the device industry. Manufacturers pay user fees to the FDA, but there is no special tax on drugs or devices. The section imposes an annual fee on certain manufacturers and importers of branded prescription drugs, totaling $2.3 billion to be transferred to the Medicare Part B trust fund. Covered entities would pay a proportion based on their branded prescription drug sales for specified government programs in the previous year. The annual fee on manufacturers and importers of branded prescription drugs ranges from $5 million to $125 million, with varying percentages to be taken into account based on sales. The Secretary of the Treasury will calculate the payment proportion for each covered entity using annual reports from HHS, Veterans Affairs, and Defense. Initial payments to the Treasury will be delayed until 2011, with the total amount to be paid annually increased from $2.3 billion. The annual fee on covered entities, including manufacturers and importers of medical devices, will increase annually from $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion in 2011, reaching $4.1 billion in 2018. Joint and several liability will apply if multiple parties are responsible for the fee. Certain medical devices are excluded from sales calculations. Covered entities will pay a proportion of the total fee to the Secretary of the Treasury, starting at $2 billion in 2011 and increasing to $3 billion after 2017. The covered entity would pay a proportion of the total fee, calculated by the Secretary, based on specified amounts of gross receipts from medical device sales. The Secretary of the Treasury would calculate the proportion to be paid by each covered entity, penalties could be imposed for failure to report. This provision would repeal Sec. 9009 and create a new IRC Sec. 4191 imposing a 2.3% fee. A new IRC Sec. 4191 in new Subchapter E \u2013 Medical Devices would impose a 2.3% sales tax on medical devices, excluding certain items like eyeglasses and hearing aids. Tax exemptions listed under IRC Sec. 4221(a)(3)-(6) and Sec. 6416(b)(2)(B)-(E) would not apply. The tax would apply to sales made after December 31, 2012. The 340B program allows covered entities to receive discounts on outpatient prescription drugs from participating manufacturers. Approximately 14,000 covered entities and 800 pharmaceutical manufacturers participate in the program. Covered entities include hospitals serving a higher percentage of Medicaid beneficiaries, FQHCs, family planning clinics, and others. Discounts are not available for inpatient drugs, and covered entities are prohibited from diverting drugs purchased under the program. The 340B program prevents covered entities from diverting drugs purchased under the program and obtaining multiple discounts. Manufacturers calculate the maximum price they can charge 340B entities based on the average manufacturer price (AMP) and Medicaid rebate percentage. Manufacturers can audit covered entity records to prevent product diversion or multiple discounts. Children's hospitals exempt from Medicare payment system were added to the 340B program, expanding discounts to certain hospitals and rural centers. Inpatient drugs for participating hospital entities would also be eligible for discounts. The 340B program allows participating hospitals to access discounts on inpatient drugs and join group purchasing arrangements. The Secretary would provide exceptions for outpatient drug group purchasing, including situations of supply shortages, lower prices for generic drugs, and reducing administrative burdens. Multiple purchasing options for covered inpatient drugs would be available for 340B hospitals, especially small and rural facilities. The 340B program requires hospitals to issue credits to Medicaid for inpatient drugs provided to beneficiaries. Changes aim to ensure manufacturers meet participation requirements and improve compliance. The Secretary will develop systems to enhance transparency, monitoring, and oversight of drug prices for covered entities. The administrative dispute resolution process would mediate overpayment claims and manufacturer claims for drug diversion in the 340B program. Manufacturers must report quarterly ceiling prices for covered drugs and offer them at or below these prices. GAO will submit a report to Congress on the optimal healthcare services provided through 340B-covered entities. The reconciliation provision would amend PHSA Sec. 340B to exclude inpatient drugs from the 340B program and restrict participating hospitals from obtaining outpatient prescription drug discounts through group purchasing organizations. Covered entities would also be prohibited from receiving discounts for orphan drugs through the 340B program. The Department of Veterans Affairs operates the nation's largest integrated direct health care delivery system. The VA health care system is a publicly funded program where the federal government owns medical facilities and employs health care providers. Eligibility is based on veteran status, service-connected disabilities, income, and other factors. In some cases, care is provided by private-sector providers. All enrolled veterans are offered a standard medical benefits package. Under current law, most veterans are required to pay copayments for nonservice-connected conditions, except for those rated 50% or more service-connected disabled. The VA is also required to collect reasonable charges for medical care from third-party insurers. PPACA includes provisions related to the VA, such as reporting to Congress. The VA is required to report to Congress on the impact of fees charged to drug and medical device manufacturers. It also includes provisions for VA participation in the Interagency Working Group on Health Care Quality, exemption from health insurer fees, and access to the National Practitioner Data Bank without charge. Additionally, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs must conduct a study on the effects of new fees on medical care for veterans and report the results to Congress. The report on the impact of fees charged to drug and medical device manufacturers must be submitted to Congress by the VA. A new Office on Women's Health would be established in the Office of the Secretary, with specified duties including the creation of a National Women's Health Information Center and an HHS Coordinating Committee on Women's Health. Funding would be provided for these activities, evaluations conducted, and reports submitted to Congress. Functions of the existing Office on Women's Health of the Public Health Service would be transferred to this new office. Authorized appropriations would be provided for FY2010 through FY2014. The section establishes new offices of women's health in various agencies, authorizing appropriations for FY2010 through FY2014. It also amends current authority for existing offices in the NIH and SAMHSA. The section does not alter existing regulatory authority or administrative activities at HHS regarding women's health. The new section would require regulatory standards for medical diagnostic equipment in medical settings to ensure accessibility for individuals with disabilities. It would also amend the Fair Labor Standards Act to provide break time and a private place for nursing mothers to express breast milk. The new section would require regulatory standards for medical diagnostic equipment in medical settings to ensure accessibility for individuals with disabilities. Employers must provide break time and a private place for nursing mothers to express breast milk, excluding small businesses if it causes significant difficulty or expense. State laws offering greater protections to employees are not preempted. The Sense of the Senate is that health care reform is an opportunity to address medical malpractice issues and Congress should consider establishing state litigation alternatives. Sec. 10607 proposes a state demonstration program to evaluate alternatives to the current civil litigation system for medical malpractice claims. It would authorize grants to states for developing and implementing alternative dispute resolution methods, focusing on resolving disputes caused by healthcare providers, promoting patient safety, and identifying compensation sources. The Secretary would provide technical assistance to states applying for grants to implement alternative dispute resolution methods for medical malpractice claims. A review panel of experts would be consulted when reviewing states' applications. States receiving grants must submit reports on the impact of funded activities on patient safety and medical liability insurance. The Secretary would report to Congress on any differences in quality of care and medical errors. The Secretary, in consultation with a review panel, would evaluate grants awarded for alternative dispute resolution methods in medical malpractice claims. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission and the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission would also assess the impact on their respective programs. $50 million would be appropriated for this purpose. The curr_chunk proposes a new tax on cosmetic surgeries and medical procedures to fund alternative dispute resolution methods in medical malpractice claims. The tax would be collected by the service provider and submitted quarterly to the Treasury Secretary. This provision would be nullified by Sec. 10907 of PPACA. The curr_chunk discusses amendments to the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) related to promoting education on birth and death certificate data, improving vital statistics systems, and implementing the Cures Acceleration Network (CAN) through NIH Director. It also enables the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health to accept charitable gifts for CAN support. The Cures Acceleration Network (CAN) under PHSA Sec. 402C is established within the Office of the Director to accelerate the development of high need cures. The NIH Director determines high need cures based on their ability to diagnose, prevent, or treat diseases without market incentives. Grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements are awarded to accelerate the development of these cures, with Cures Acceleration Partnership Awards providing up to $15 million in the first year. The Cures Acceleration Network (CAN) aims to support revolutionary advances in basic research and facilitate FDA review for CAN-funded cures. A CAN Review Board would advise the Director on barriers to translating basic science into clinical applications, with $500 million authorized to be appropriated. The Cures Acceleration Network (CAN) aims to support advances in research with $500 million authorized for funding. Grants are awarded to develop public access defibrillation programs, with funds allocated for establishing information clearinghouses. The section authorizes $25 million for pediatric education and medicine expertise. It imposes a 10% tax on indoor tanning services, excluding phototherapy by medical professionals. Providers collect and submit the tax quarterly to the Treasury Secretary, nullifying the Excise Tax on Elective Cosmetic Medical Procedures. It increases the qualified expense limitation for the adoption tax credit and income exclusion. The adoption tax credit and income exclusion for qualified employer-provided adoption expense programs would be increased to $13,170 for tax year 2010, with indexing to inflation for 2011. The adoption tax credit would become refundable for tax years 2010 and 2011, and the expiration of changes to these programs would be delayed to December 31, 2011."
