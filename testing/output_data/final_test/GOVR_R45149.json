    "content": "In 1976, President Ford signed the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) into law, requiring the EPA to regulate chemicals in U.S. commerce that pose health or environmental risks. The Council on Environmental Quality highlighted concerns with metals, metal compounds, and synthetic organic chemicals. Congress has since added five titles to TSCA to address specific chemicals. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) was signed into law in 1976 to regulate chemicals in U.S. commerce. EPA requires manufacturers to report information on chemicals, evaluate risks, and restrict some chemicals introduced before 1976. Additional titles added to TSCA do not amend the core chemical evaluation program under Title I. EPA focuses on regulating chemicals introduced after 1976. The Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act (P.L. 114-182) amended the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) in 2016 to address concerns about EPA's ability to evaluate and regulate chemicals introduced after 1976. The Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act (P.L. 114-182) expanded EPA authority under TSCA to collect fees from chemical manufacturers for risk evaluations. EPA continues to evaluate risks for various chemicals, with no additional pre-1976 chemicals regulated so far. Federal preemption of state requirements was a key issue during the debate leading up to the enactment of P.L. 114-182. The enactment of P.L. 114-182 in 2016 addressed state and local regulations on chemicals, establishing conditions for preemption of TSCA requirements. The chemical industry and retailers raised concerns about varying state regulations. The report summarizes TSCA authorities and covers topics such as scope and applicability. The report summarizes selected statutory provisions of TSCA, covering topics such as the overall scope and applicability of authorities, information gathering, confidentiality, prioritizing chemicals for evaluation, enforcement, federal and state roles, and resources for administering the act. It does not discuss agency regulations and guidance for conducting risk evaluation and selecting regulatory options. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) covers a broad scope of chemicals but excludes certain groups like pesticides, tobacco products, firearms, food, drugs, cosmetics, and mixtures. Despite excluding mixtures from the definition of a chemical substance, TSCA provisions still apply to them. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) covers a broad scope of chemicals but excludes certain groups like pesticides, tobacco products, firearms, food, drugs, cosmetics, and mixtures. Mixtures are subject to TSCA requirements if the constituent chemical substances' requirements are inadequate in evaluating or controlling risks. Articles containing chemical substances regulated by TSCA may be subject to the act if the chemical substance poses an unreasonable risk. Congress placed limitations on regulatory actions under TSCA for chemicals. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) imposes restrictions on regulatory actions for chemicals, with exclusions and limitations that may restrict the scope of authorities. The act requires an \"unreasonable risk\" finding for the EPA to regulate a chemical, but does not define this term explicitly, giving discretion to the EPA. The U.S. Court of Appeals has interpreted \"unreasonable risk\" to consider costs and impacts before taking action. The U.S. Court of Appeals vacated parts of an EPA rule on asbestos uses, citing the need to consider environmental, economic, and social impacts. P.L. 114-182 prohibits EPA from factoring in cost or non-risk factors when evaluating risks, but requires consideration of potentially exposed subpopulations. TSCA allows other federal laws to address unreasonable risks associated with chemicals. Section 9(b) of TSCA requires the EPA to use other federal authorities to protect against risks unless it's in the public interest to act under TSCA. If a chemical poses a risk that can be addressed by another federal agency, EPA must submit a report and request a response within 90 days. If the other agency disagrees or takes action, EPA cannot regulate the chemical under TSCA. Scientific and technical information is crucial in assessing chemical risks under TSCA. Under TSCA, scientific and technical information is essential for risk evaluation and regulatory decisions. P.L. 114-182 added provisions to specify EPA's use of scientific information. EPA must consider the \"best available science\" and \"reasonably available information\" when regulating chemicals. Policies and procedures must be developed by June 2018. EPA must develop policies, procedures, and guidance by June 2018 to carry out amendments to TSCA. The agency relies on scientific and technical information to evaluate risks and determine if regulation is necessary. TSCA directs EPA to establish a Science Advisory Committee on Chemicals for independent scientific advice, but the advice is not binding. EPA must periodically review and revise these policies and procedures to reflect new scientific developments. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) directs EPA to require chemical manufacturers, processors, and distributors to report information on existing chemicals, new chemical substances, and significant new uses of chemical substances. EPA can require the development of new information if existing information is insufficient to evaluate risks. TSCA also provides protection from disclosure of submitted information that may harm commercial interests. EPA is directed to promulgate rules for chemical manufacturers and processors to maintain records on chemicals. EPA requires chemical manufacturers and processors to maintain records on chemicals, including chemical identity, uses, volumes, byproducts, health and environmental effects, exposure, and disposal methods. Small manufacturers may have reporting requirements for certain chemicals. EPA maintains a list of chemical substances manufactured or processed for commercial purposes in the TSCA Inventory, excluding those made in small quantities for research and development. The Inventory contains around 60,000 chemical substances reported to the agency. Since the enactment of TSCA, over 24,000 new chemical substances have been added to the inventory. P.L. 114-182 amended TSCA Section 8 to divide the inventory into \"active\" and \"inactive\" substances based on manufacturing or processing between June 2006 and June 2016. Section 8 also allows EPA to require reporting of adverse reactions and evidence of substantial risk from chemical manufacturers or processors. Chemical manufacturers must report evidence of substantial risk to EPA under TSCA. They must submit a premanufacture notice (PMN) at least 90 days before manufacturing a new chemical. EPA has received over 40,000 PMNs since 1976. Manufacturers must also notify EPA before processing a chemical for a significant new use determined by the agency. EPA assesses new uses on a case-by-case basis, considering factors like volume and potential exposure. The EPA requires chemical manufacturers to submit a premanufacture notice (PMN) before manufacturing a new chemical to assess risks. Significant new uses are determined by the agency through a significant new use rule (SNUR), with notifications known as significant new use notices (SNUNs). Information required in a PMN or SNUN includes chemical identity, uses, volumes produced, health and environmental effects, exposure, and disposal methods. EPA reviews PMNs or SNUNs within 90 days to determine regulatory action, with a possible 90-day extension. Regulatory authorities for new chemical substances and significant new uses are discussed in \"Regulation of New Chemical Substances and Significant New Uses.\" EPA may exempt certain circumstances from PMN and SNUN requirements under Section 5(h) of TSCA. The EPA may grant exemptions for chemical substances under certain circumstances, with over 14,000 exemption applications received since 1976. Section 4(a) allows the EPA to request new information from manufacturers if existing data is insufficient to evaluate risks. EPA can require new information through rulemaking, administrative orders, or consent agreements. The EPA can request new information from manufacturers through rulemaking, administrative orders, or consent agreements. EPA must justify the need for new information to assess chemicals, prioritize them for risk evaluation, or conduct a risk evaluation. Section 4(e) establishes an interagency committee to recommend chemicals for new information development. No more than 50 chemicals can be designated at a time for new information development. The EPA can request new information from manufacturers for chemicals, with a limit of 50 at a time. Recommendations and designations by the committee are reviewed every six months, but not binding on EPA. Exemptions are provided if information is already being developed elsewhere, with a process for reimbursement of testing costs. EPA must publish new information in the Federal Register promptly. The EPA can request new information from manufacturers for chemicals, with a limit of 50 at a time. Recommendations and designations by the committee are reviewed every six months, but not binding on EPA. Exemptions are provided if information is already being developed elsewhere, with a process for reimbursement of testing costs. EPA must publish new information in the Federal Register promptly. New information under Section 14 must be made available for examination upon request. EPA can conduct research, development, and monitoring activities for carrying out the act, including toxciological screening and environmental monitoring. Animal testing is typically used for developing new information on chemicals unless an alternative approach is proven reliable. The EPA is required to develop a strategic plan to minimize the use of animals for testing chemicals under TSCA. TSCA balances protecting sensitive information and public access, building upon FOIA protections. EPA must withhold information meeting certain criteria under TSCA Section 14. TSCA Section 14 requires EPA to withhold trade secrets and confidential information under FOIA Exemption 4. Disclosure of such information is subject to criminal penalty. Certain categories of information, like health and safety studies, are not protected unless they reveal specific details. Chemical identities warranting confidential treatment must use generic identifiers. The TSCA Section 14 requires EPA to protect trade secrets and confidential information using generic identifiers. P.L. 114-182 amended the section to require further substantiation for confidentiality claims regarding specific chemical identities, limiting validity to 10 years with an opportunity for renewal. EPA must review confidentiality claims and renewals, even for specific chemical identities, to determine confidential treatment. TSCA Section 14 requires EPA to protect trade secrets and confidential information using generic identifiers. Information may be disclosed under certain conditions to protect health or the environment. EPA evaluates chemicals to inform regulatory decisions and prioritize which chemicals to assess for risks. EPA takes expedited actions for specific chemicals like polychlorinated biphenyls. The EPA is directed to expedite actions for specific chemicals, including polychlorinated biphenyls, hazardous chemicals, and new chemical substances. The TSCA Section 6 framework prioritizes chemical substances for risk evaluation, with EPA selecting 10 chemicals for evaluation in 2016. Additionally, a rule must be established for screening chemical substances as high or low priority for risk evaluations. The EPA must prioritize chemical substances based on risk factors and exposure potential. If a chemical is deemed to pose unreasonable risks, it is designated as high priority for evaluation. Otherwise, it is designated as low priority, with the option to revise based on new information. If information is lacking, the EPA must require the development of new data and prioritize the chemical within 90 days. The EPA must prioritize chemicals for risk evaluations based on exposure potential and risk factors. If a chemical poses unreasonable risks, it is designated as high priority for evaluation. The agency can request new data within 90 days to prioritize the chemical. EPA has discretion to grant or deny requests for risk evaluations. The EPA has discretion to grant or deny requests for risk evaluation of chemicals under TSCA. Risk assessment involves identifying adverse effects and exposure levels, with risk determinations based on scientific information. EPA has developed guidance for chemical risk assessment over time. The EPA is required to conduct risk evaluations for chemicals without considering cost or non-risk factors. Evaluations must be completed within three years, extendable by six months. Annual identification of chemicals for evaluation is mandated. If a chemical poses unreasonable risk, EPA must create a rule to eliminate it, with seven regulatory options available. The EPA may choose from seven regulatory options for chemicals, including restrictions on manufacturing, marking with warnings, record-keeping, and disposal regulations. Section 6 of the EPA directs manufacturers to notify distributors and the public of unreasonable risks, replace or repurchase chemicals upon request, and follow procedural requirements for rule promulgation. EPA must propose a rule within one year of final risk evaluation and finalize it within two years, with the option to extend for up to two years for certain chemicals. The EPA may extend time frames for chemicals not identified as persistent and bioaccumulative. Compliance dates for Section 6 rules must be within five years of promulgation, with exemptions for certain uses. Proposed rules can be declared effective upon publication until finalized or revoked. P.L. 114-182 amended TSCA Section 6 to exempt replacement parts for \"complex durable goods\" and \"complex consumer goods\" designed before a rule's publication. The EPA may grant exemptions from rules for chemicals to maintain critical uses, avoid economic disruption, or provide health and environmental benefits. PCBs are synthetic chemicals used in electrical equipment until the 1970s, with disposal rules mandated by TSCA in 1976. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) mandates rules for the disposal of PCBs and prohibits their manufacture, processing, and distribution without exemptions. TSCA Section 6(h) directs the EPA to propose rules by June 2019 to address risks of persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic (PBT) chemicals without requiring a risk evaluation. EPA must finalize a rule to reduce exposures to PBT chemicals within 18 months of proposing the rule. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) requires EPA to propose rules for PBT chemicals within 18 months. EPA can take civil action for imminently hazardous chemicals or those with significant risk of harm. EPA must act promptly to regulate chemicals posing serious risks to humans. The EPA must take action to prevent unreasonable risks posed by new chemical substances, either by proposing a rule or issuing an order to limit their manufacture or distribution. The agency must act promptly on proposed rules and orders to protect against such risks. The EPA issues administrative orders to restrict new chemical substances with insufficient risk information, becoming effective at the end of the review period. If necessary, a SNUR may be promulgated to apply restrictions to other manufacturers. EPA reported issuing 1,729 orders prior to June 2016. Prior to June 2016, EPA issued 1,729 Section 5(e) consent orders, with over 750 associated with SNURs. Substances subject to PMN and SNUN requirements deemed not risky can be manufactured after EPA's approval. TSCA requirements for chemical manufacture also apply to importation, with the same standards for chemicals made in or outside the US. Section 13 outlines the process for handling imported chemicals violating TSCA regulations. Section 12 of TSCA limits requirements on chemicals manufactured solely for export, with recordkeeping and reporting obligations. If EPA has set new information or risk prevention requirements for an export-only chemical, exporters must notify the agency and the receiving country. The Mercury Export Ban Act of 2008 aims to reduce mercury availability. The Mercury Export Ban Act (MEBA; P.L. 110-414) aims to reduce mercury availability in domestic and international markets due to health and environmental concerns. MEBA added Section 12(c) to TSCA, making it unlawful to export elemental mercury without an \"essential use\" exemption. Essential use exemptions are limited to three years and 10 metric tons, with no exemptions granted to date. P.L. 114-182 amended TSCA to prohibit specific mercury compound exports after January 1, 2020, and required EPA to report on mercury compound exports and disposal to Congress. The Mercury Export Ban Act (MEBA) added provisions to TSCA to regulate the export and disposal of mercury compounds. MEBA prohibits federal agencies from selling elemental mercury unless for storage or coal-related purposes. It also directed DOE to manage and store elemental mercury generated in the U.S. P.L. 114-182 directed EPA to gather information on elemental mercury supply, use, and trade in the U.S. and publish it in the Federal Register. TSCA allows citizen petitions and suits challenging EPA's implementation. Section 21 permits petitions for rule changes, with EPA required to respond within 90 days. Section 20 allows suits to compel EPA or others to comply with TSCA rules, with a 60-day notice requirement. Citizen suits are not available if EPA is already enforcing compliance. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) allows citizen petitions and suits challenging EPA's implementation. Section 21 permits petitions for rule changes, with EPA required to respond within 90 days. Section 20 allows suits to compel EPA or others to comply with TSCA rules, with a 60-day notice requirement. If a citizen suit is successful, the court may require the violator to take actions to correct a violation and may impose civil penalties. TSCA Section 19 governs judicial review of EPA actions, requiring petitions to be filed within 60 days after final action, with exclusive jurisdiction to federal courts of appeals. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) provides EPA with authority to enforce rules and orders through inspection, administrative subpoenas, and civil or criminal penalties for violations. Section 22 allows the President to waive TSCA requirements for national defense. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) allows for waivers of compliance with TSCA requirements for national defense purposes. It includes provisions to protect employees from retaliation and investigate alleged retaliations. TSCA also addresses potential conflicts between federal and state requirements on chemicals. TSCA does not preempt states from regulating chemicals if EPA has not taken action. Congress set provisions for chemical-specific preemption in TSCA, refined in P.L. 114-182. State law must yield to Congress's powers under the Supremacy Clause. EPA may grant states authority to address chemical risks. Under Section 18 of TSCA, states are preempted from regulating chemicals unless EPA takes specific actions. Exceptions and waivers may apply. States cannot enforce laws requiring new information on a chemical if EPA already has a rule in place. States also cannot restrict chemicals if EPA has determined they do not pose an unreasonable risk or has issued a rule to address the risk. Section 18 of TSCA preempts states from regulating chemicals unless EPA takes specific actions. Exceptions and waivers may apply, and states cannot enforce laws requiring new information on a chemical if EPA already has a rule in place. Additionally, states cannot restrict chemicals if EPA has determined they do not pose an unreasonable risk or has issued a rule to address the risk. The preemption applies to the extent of hazards, exposures, risks, and uses included in the scope of the risk evaluation, with exceptions provided to preserve state chemical requirements that would otherwise be preempted. States may continue to enforce laws on specific chemicals under certain conditions, including those in effect before April 22, 2016, or on August 31, 2003. TSCA does not preempt states from implementing protections for public health or the environment under certain circumstances, such as federal reporting obligations or state laws related to water, air quality, or waste treatment. Additionally, TSCA includes \"savings clauses\" to ensure that its requirements do not preempt state actions. TSCA includes \"savings clauses\" to prevent preemption of state actions, allowing states to enforce laws on specific chemicals under certain conditions. Section 18 grants the EPA Administrator the authority to exempt state requirements from preemption if compliance does not unduly burden interstate commerce, protects health or the environment, and is based on strong science. The EPA Administrator can exempt state requirements from preemption under TSCA if they do not unduly burden interstate commerce, protect health or the environment, and are based on strong science. Exemptions take effect automatically if the Administrator misses the 110-day deadline for action on the state's application, subject to public notice, comment requirements, and judicial review. States must not have penalties more stringent than TSCA for identical requirements. TSCA allows states to assess penalties for violations, but limits EPA's penalty assessment if the state has already acted. EPA can grant funds to states for programs addressing chemical risks not addressed by the agency. Congressional funding for state grants under TSCA continues despite the repeal of authorization for appropriations. Congress has continued to provide TSCA grant funding to states through annual discretionary appropriations, affecting EPA's ability to evaluate chemicals. TSCA Section 26(b) originally allowed EPA to collect fees from chemical manufacturers, but P.L. 114-182 amended it to authorize fees for certain information submissions. The EPA can collect fees from chemical manufacturers for information submissions related to TSCA activities, with a limit of 25% of annual costs or $25 million per year. Collected fees go into the TSCA Service Fee Fund and are used to partially cover the costs of conducting chemical risk evaluations. This fee collection authority expires in June 2026. EPA must report to Congress on its capacity to complete required chemical risk evaluations and regulate chemicals presenting unreasonable risks under TSCA. The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) authorizes EPA to regulate chemicals if unreasonable risks are found. EPA focuses on chemicals with greater risks due to limited resources. A systematic risk evaluation is needed before regulating a chemical, involving assessing health effects and exposure scenarios. EPA must have sufficient information to evaluate chemical risks. The EPA relies on available information or authority under TSCA to assess chemical risks, with differing perspectives from environmental groups and the industry. Scientific understanding of chemical risks evolves through new studies, requiring professional judgment in risk assessment. The EPA evaluates chemical risks considering costs and other factors, leading to potential disagreements. Stakeholders may differ on the adequacy of regulatory requirements to address risks, which could result in litigation. The pace of regulatory actions depends on resources and scientific information availability. EPA's authority to regulate chemicals is based on existing regulations. The EPA's authority to regulate chemicals is based on existing regulations, which depend on other statutes."
