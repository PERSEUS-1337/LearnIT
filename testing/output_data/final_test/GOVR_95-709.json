The Supreme Court overturned state convictions for flag-burning on narrow grounds, avoiding a definitive ruling on the constitutionality of such convictions. In 1984, during a protest at the Republican National Convention in Dallas, TX, Johnson burned an American flag in front of city hall. He was charged with desecration of a venerated object, convicted, and sentenced to prison. The Supreme Court later took up the Johnson case in the context of previous rulings on flag desecration. In 1984, during a protest at the Republican National Convention in Dallas, TX, Johnson burned an American flag in front of city hall. He was convicted and sentenced to prison. The U.S. Supreme Court later affirmed the reversal of his conviction, ruling that flag protection statutes could not be applied to flag burning in public demonstrations. Congress then enacted the Flag Protection Act of 1989 to focus on protecting the flag's physical integrity. The Flag Protection Act of 1989 aimed to suppress certain types of expression by making it a crime to intentionally mutilate, deface, or burn the flag. Proponents argued that a neutral statute, prohibiting all flag burning, could be judged under a less strict constitutional test, requiring the government to show that the restriction on First Amendment freedoms is essential to further an important governmental interest. The Flag Protection Act of 1989 criminalized intentional desecration of the United States flag, with an exemption for disposing of a worn flag. The act defined the flag broadly and allowed for expedited Supreme Court review of its constitutionality. Protesters arrested for flag burning had their cases dismissed as the act was deemed unconstitutional in a protest context. The Flag Protection Act of 1989 was deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court for public protest flag burning. Congress failed to pass a constitutional amendment to protect the flag's physical integrity in multiple attempts. In the 112th Congress, an amendment to the Constitution was introduced to prohibit flag desecration. Senator Hatch introduced a bill in the Senate for flag protection. If approved by Congress, the amendment would require ratification by three-fourths of the states. In Texas v. Johnson, the Court ruled that flag desecration is protected under the First Amendment. The Court outlined the criteria for determining if conduct is expressive and if state regulation suppresses expression. The Supreme Court ruled in Texas v. Johnson that flag desecration is protected under the First Amendment. The decision emphasized the importance of intent to convey a message and the likelihood of that message being understood. The majority found that Johnson's burning of the flag during a political demonstration was sufficiently expressive to implicate the First Amendment. The Supreme Court ruled in Texas v. Johnson that flag desecration is protected under the First Amendment. The finding that burning the flag in this circumstance was expressive conduct required the Court to examine the statute involved to determine if it aimed at suppressing expression or if the governmental interest was unrelated to free expression. Texas sought to protect state interests of preventing breaches of the peace and preserving the flag as a symbol of nationhood and national unity. The majority rejected the former interest. The Supreme Court ruled in Texas v. Johnson that flag desecration is protected under the First Amendment. The majority rejected the interest of preventing breaches of the peace, as no disturbance actually occurred. They found that preserving the flag as a symbol of national unity was directly related to expression. The Texas law aimed to protect the flag from offensive abuse, requiring an exacting scrutiny standard of review. The majority held that the Texas statute could not be applied in this case. The Supreme Court in Texas v. Johnson ruled that flag desecration is protected under the First Amendment. The Court held that the Texas statute could not withstand strict scrutiny, stating that the government cannot prohibit expression just because it is offensive, even when involving the flag. The Court also reaffirmed that flag-burning is protected speech under the First Amendment, as established in United States v. Eichman. The government argued that the act was aimed at protecting the physical integrity of the flag, without explicit content-based limitations. The majority rejected this, stating that the interest was related to the suppression of expression. The government's interest in protecting the physical integrity of a privately owned flag is to preserve its status as a symbol of our Nation and certain national ideals. The destruction or disfigurement of a flag does not affect its meaning unless it communicates a message inconsistent with those ideals. The Court rejected the argument that the act aimed at protecting the flag's physical integrity, stating it was related to the suppression of expression. The majority found that the language of the act connoted disrespectful treatment of the flag, making it suppressive of expression. The act was deemed to be subject to \"the most exacting scrutiny\" and could not withstand this level of examination, similar to the statute in the Johnson case."
