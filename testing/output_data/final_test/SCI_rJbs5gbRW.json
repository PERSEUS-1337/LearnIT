While traditional regularization techniques are still used, the regularization and generalization effects of newer structures like ResNet and DenseNet have not been extensively studied. In this work, the effect of skip connections on network generalization features is investigated. Experiments show that certain neural network architectures enhance generalization abilities, particularly when low-level features are introduced to deeper layers in DenseNet, ResNet, and networks with skip connections. These low-level representations improve generalization in various scenarios with reduced training data quality and quantity. Skip connections, as seen in Residual Network BID0, offer a new innovative insight into network structures for computer vision applications. DenseNet maximizes the benefit of shortcut connections by linking every two layers in a dense block, allowing each layer to use information from all previous layers. This mitigates gradient vanishing and degradation issues, making calculations more efficient. Concatenation in Dense Block involves the output of each layer being concatenated with its input before being passed on. DenseNet utilizes shortcut connections in dense blocks to concatenate the output of each layer with its input, diversifying input characteristics for improved computation. Neurons within the same Dense block are interconnected for feature reuse, reducing the need for a wide network. Shortcut connections facilitate unimpeded information flow from input to output, allowing direct feedback of gradient information. The addition of skip connections can enhance performance by sacrificing network width. Our experiments show that networks like DenseNet and ResNet, which utilize skip connections and dense connections, exhibit better generalization performance compared to simple feed-forward models. These connections allow for the reuse of low-level features, improving the network's learning ability while sacrificing some network width. The models achieve perfect training accuracy, but DenseNet and ResNet show better generalization performance with similar complexities. We investigate the effects of dense and skip connections in regression and classification tasks, highlighting the contribution of feature maps. In the study, the focus is on the effects of skip connections in DenseNet and ResNet models. The implementation includes 28 skip connections within each dense block, with experiments conducted on CIFAR100 datasets. The total number of parameters is kept constant at 92k by adjusting the depths of convolutional layers. Experiments are conducted to test the effect of skip connections in network structures like Cascade Network, ResNet, and DenseNet using MNIST and CIFAR100 datasets. The study focuses on the generalization performances of these models under harsh training conditions such as reduced training samples or noisy labels. The study compares the generalization performances of Cascade Network, ResNet, and DenseNet under harsh training conditions. The networks have depths ranging from 44 to 46 layers to avoid overfitting. Parameters are carefully selected to ensure fair comparisons, with similar parameter sizes of 560k to 580k. In FIG2 (c), networks are designed with different widths to achieve similar performance when trained on the entire dataset, around 50%. Cascade Net has more parameters but is less robust to decreasing training samples, while DenseNet, with more skip connections, is the most robust with fewer parameters. DenseNet's performance drops more moderately with fewer training samples, benefiting stability and generalization. Dense connections are effective for generalization, as seen in MNIST with fully connected layers. The Cascade Net and DenseNet models consist of only fully connected layers without convolution layers. Skip connections act as implicit regularizers in network training, improving generalization. Adding noise to the training dataset shows that DenseNet is more robust to noise compared to other networks. This demonstrates the generalization effects of network structures. In this section, we visualize the generalization effects of network structures using a 1-dimensional curve fitting problem. The network learns a function mapping scalar values x to f(x). Networks with better regularization capabilities produce smoother outputs in hidden layers, avoiding overfitting and enhancing generalization ability. Three types of networks are implemented: Cascade Net with a smooth linear model, ResNet with skip connections, and DenseNet with direct connections between layers. The final learned curve and output from each layer are analyzed in detail. The final learned curve and output from each layer of different network structures are compared. DenseNet with direct connections between layers shows better results compared to Plain Net with more parameters but unsatisfactory results. The 7-layer dense net successfully learns a standard sinc curve with only 30 training data points. The Plain Net struggles to fit small waves without sufficient training data points. Its training loss drops quickly initially but fails to decrease further. Adding ResNet shows competitiveness compared to DenseNet. Noise in training data complicates learning process. In experiments with noise, DenseNet outperforms Plain Net and ResNet in generalization. Statistical results show DenseNet has smaller mean loss and deviation, especially when deeper. Plain Net struggles with gradient vanishing when too deep. DenseNet can generalize even better than ResNet. The DenseNet outperforms Plain Net and ResNet in generalization, especially with noise. Plain Net struggles with gradient vanishing when too deep, while DenseNet can generalize better than ResNet. In a comparison of 15-layer nets, DenseNet has a smaller size and can generalize well even with shallow nets. The Plain Net shows severe gradient vanishing and learns only a little of the curve. The DenseNet outperforms Plain Net and ResNet in generalization, especially with noise. Plain Net struggles with gradient vanishing when too deep, while DenseNet can generalize better than ResNet. In a comparison of 15-layer nets, DenseNet has a smaller size and can generalize well even with shallow nets. The Plain Net shows severe gradient vanishing and learns only a little of the curve. Different network architectures with skip connections are explored to investigate their effects. The skip connections in different network architectures are added one by one to define network structures with varying densities. The representational power of skip connections is evident in the fitting effect and loss displayed in figures. Three styles of networks are analyzed in a two-dimensional classification problem, with parameters controlled by adjusting the growth rate in the Dense network. The Dense network's parameters are controlled by adjusting the growth rate of each layer. Intermediate decision boundaries across each layer show the progression of complexity with increasing depth. Networks that generalize better learn smooth decision boundaries in the presence of noise. Visualizing the intermediate results involves feeding a grid of data points and recording raw outputs after activation. The top row in Figure 9 illustrates the progression of a densely connected network. The DenseNet network achieves the lowest loss in the test set by utilizing dense connections, allowing every layer to receive inputs from all preceding layers. This enables the network to make use of low-level features even at the last layer stage. In contrast, the Residual and Plain networks do not benefit from dense connections. Visualizations in Figure 9 show the features learned in different layers, highlighting the advantages of dense connections in modern neural networks. This paper explores the impact of skip connections on neural networks in computer vision tasks. Experiments show that networks with skip connections outperform other architectures in regression tasks, demonstrating their significant learning power."
