It focuses on supporting local agents of change in crisis situations to promote peaceful and democratic outcomes that align with U.S. foreign policy goals. OTI operates with speed and flexibility, primarily aiming to improve public attitudes towards democratic reform. Its role within the broader spectrum of foreign assistance programs is sometimes unclear. The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) within USAID focuses on supporting local agents of change in crisis situations to promote peaceful and democratic outcomes aligned with U.S. foreign policy goals. OTI's origin, activities, and role within USAID are discussed in a report addressing its impact and structure. OTI was proposed in 1993 to bridge the gap between emergency relief and long-term development, aiming to address key foreign policy priorities quickly. The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was proposed in 1993 to bridge the gap between emergency relief and long-term development. It aimed to support demobilized combatants, restore infrastructure, prepare for elections, build public institutions, and provide demining and police training activities. Congress expanded the authorization of the existing Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) to include reconstruction activities in response to the proposal. OTI activities were initially supported through the OFDA account until a separate budget line item was created in 2001. The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) was established in 1993 to support transition to democracy and long-term development in crisis-affected countries. It operates under the authority of Section 491 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, allowing executive discretion in responding to foreign disasters. The appropriations language expanded the scope of OTI activities beyond its initial purpose. The language establishing the new budget account expanded the scope of OTI activities beyond traditional disaster assistance. Congressional notification of OTI activities only requires five days notice to appropriations committees. OTI can use resources transferred from other funds and is not bound by certain administrative requirements. Since 1994, OTI has worked in 36 countries and territories. OTI has worked in 36 countries and territories, selecting engagements based on U.S. national interests, opportunities for positive influence, and operating environment stability. For example, Angola and Haiti were chosen for their strategic importance and potential for impactful programs. OTI's work in Haiti focused on preventing long-term dependence on humanitarian assistance and chaotic immigration flows, with support for the reestablishment of community life. In contrast, OTI did not intervene in Liberia due to a lack of political will for positive transition. OTI's planning documents were found to lack specific consideration of engagement criteria, and the Director has authority to determine where OTI is active. OTI activities require advance notification to Congress and clearance from the Director of Foreign Assistance. Consultation with State and USAID leaders does not always lead to coordination. Funding for the Transition Initiative account has remained steady, with increases in obligations in FY2004 and FY2005 due to activities in Iraq. The Obama Administration has proposed a 150% increase in funding for the Transition Initiatives account in FY2010, raising it to $126 million. This increase may indicate a shift towards reducing reliance on transferred funds, which come with restrictions from their original accounts. Despite managing funds from various sources, OTI must adhere to the restrictions of transferred funds, limiting its flexibility. OTI's programs are tailored to specific country needs, often filling gaps in broader foreign assistance efforts. Over 15 years, OTI has supported projects like reintegrating former combatants and bringing high-speed internet to rural areas for development. They also back independent media to reach marginalized communities. OTI's flexibility is limited by restrictions on transferred funds, despite managing funds from various sources. OTI promotes democracy by supporting citizen-government interaction and confidence building through workshops, town hall meetings, and funding public opinion polls. Grants range from $5,000 to $100,000, with larger grants approved in the Washington office. Programs typically last two to three years but can extend beyond that timeframe in certain cases like Sudan and Venezuela. OTI is praised for embodying what USAID should be as an agency. OTI programs are flexible and address important issues, but differ from USAID's long-term development focus. Rapid response valued by some partners may compromise transparency and accountability. OTI serves as a laboratory for innovative development approaches, with lessons to be learned. Congress may consider oversight and reform activities related to OTI's funding sources and its impact on foreign assistance. OTI faces operational challenges due to funding sources outside of TI accounts, leading to uncertainty and inefficiency in planning. Limited budget visibility hinders OTI's ability to seize opportunities, suggesting a need for increased direct TI appropriations to enhance performance capabilities. The Administration's FY2010 budget request of $127 million for the Transition Initiative (TI) account may signal a move towards increasing direct TI appropriations. Unlike other foreign assistance programs, TI programs are often initiated on short notice and lack detailed budget justification. Operational challenges in OTI, such as limited budget visibility, hinder planning and require only five days' notice to Congress for new TI programs. This lack of transparency makes it difficult to determine how funds are spent, especially in sensitive cases like Pakistan and Colombia. OTI programs, including those in sensitive cases like Pakistan and Colombia, require discretion in releasing information about specific grantees to protect partners and local personnel. Congress may need to assess if the limited public transparency of OTI programs is justified, considering the need for speed, flexibility, and discretion. OTI aims to bridge the gap between emergency relief and long-term development with short-lived programs. OTI programs are meant to be short-lived with a two- to three-year limit, emphasizing the need for an exit strategy. However, programs in Venezuela since 2002 and Sudan since 2003 have continued beyond this timeframe. Evaluations suggest that some programs could have transitioned to long-term USAID programs earlier. In some cases like Serbia and Iraq, observers question the prolonged presence of OTI after the establishment of USAID missions. The U.S. military requested an extension of OTI's presence in Iraq to continue partnership, while concerns were raised about the long-term impact of OTI projects in Africa and Haiti due to poor coordination with other USAID components. Lack of understanding of OTI's mission led to a failure to foster synergies and sustain gains in these regions. An audit of the Iraq OTI program also highlighted issues with coordination and information sharing with USAID/Iraq. The Iraq OTI program faced challenges due to lack of coordination and information sharing with USAID/Iraq, leading to wasted resources and duplicate efforts. Transitioning OTI projects into sustainable development activities may not always be feasible, risking the loss of opportunities to build upon gains. Evaluations highlighted insufficient consideration for monitoring and evaluation in project planning and implementation phases, with issues like poor record-keeping in the early years of the Serbia-Montenegro program. Insufficient documentation in the Iraq program raised concerns about verifying achieved outputs. The documentation for verifying achieved outputs in OTI programs is insufficient, and controls for monitoring and documenting grants need improvement. The evolving nature of OTI programs makes establishing a monitoring and evaluation regime challenging, especially in unstable conditions. The emphasis on speed and grant disbursement has overshadowed strategic planning, raising concerns about the effectiveness of program evaluations. OTI's monitoring and evaluation process faces challenges and shortfalls, impacting strategic planning. Unlike many USAID programs, OTI can hire USPSCs for rapid program implementation. OTI staff are described as operational and interact with partners daily. OTI staff are actively involved in project planning and implementation, often working in volatile conditions with emerging local leaders. This hands-on approach contributes to high staff morale, as evidenced by a 2008 survey where 95.7% of OTI staff reported job satisfaction. This may be relevant for potential legislation to increase USAID staff. Despite high job satisfaction among OTI staff, challenges such as limited benefits, career progression, and high turnover due to the heavy use of USPSCs persist. The reliance on USPSCs also incurs high transaction costs, with up to 40% of operational manpower dedicated to procurement and human resources issues. This contract model contributes to frequent staff turnover, as qualified professionals in insecure environments may leave for better opportunities. OTI's \"bullpen\" system is also mentioned as a factor in staff turnover. OTI utilizes a \"bullpen\" of USPSCs for temporary staffing needs, including experienced professionals who can quickly ramp up personnel without guaranteed work days. The SWIFT contracting mechanism allows for fast establishment of offices and grant disbursement. This system helps OTI avoid overhead costs when not needed and provides flexibility for bullpen members to work globally. Successful contractors under the SWIFT mechanism must demonstrate the ability to implement an OTI-style program in a new country within 72 hours of receiving a task order. This expedited process has been praised by partners for its efficiency compared to other USAID programs. Firms with IQCs through SWIFT include AECOM, International Resources Group, Casals & Associates, Chemonics International, Development Alternatives, Inc., Development & Training Services, and Creative Associates. OTI collaborates with operational partners regularly. Critics of the SWIFT process point out that expedited contracting may not allow for effective program planning and can limit competition. The 72-hour rule for establishing a presence in a new country excludes potential partners, and OTI primarily uses contracts instead of cooperative agreements or grants, which some NGOs feel excludes them from partnerships. OTI's procurement process allows for speed and flexibility, with a waiver that permits local procurement of goods and services. This advantage over other U.S. foreign assistance programs may prompt Congress to reconsider the balance between competitiveness and speed in contracting. The waiver covers three types of procurements for SWIFT contractors but not for the contractors themselves. OTI's procurement waiver allows for local procurement of goods and services by grantees, not by SWIFT IQC holders or for restricted goods like pharmaceuticals. This use of the waiver may be relevant for congressional discussions on procurement restrictions in U.S. foreign assistance programs. OTI's role within USAID and the broader foreign assistance structure is sometimes unclear, as highlighted in a 2006 USAID Inspector General survey showing confusion among Mission Directors and Ambassadors on how to utilize OTI's resources. The Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization (S/CRS) is tasked with improving coordination of stabilization and reconstruction assistance, creating potential overlap with OTI's activities. The Civilian Response Corps (CRC) under S/CRS authority, with a sizable USAID component, may also have overlapping mandates. The Obama Administration recommended $323 million in FY2010 for the Civilian Stabilization Initiative to recruit, develop, and train the CRC. Observers suggest changes to OTI's status, such as merging with S/CRS or restructuring S/CRS to split off programmatic functions to USAID. OTI employees believe their location in USAID is crucial for effectiveness due to operational expertise and State's bureaucratic management style. Congress may review OTI's realignment in foreign aid activities. Congress may review the realignment of foreign aid activities, comparing OTI's mission with S/CRS and NED. The debate includes supporting private sector democracy promotion through NED versus direct engagement with OTI, which faces political entanglements with diplomatic implications. OTI activities supporting pro-democracy groups can have diplomatic implications, with critics accusing OTI of destabilizing civil society. Examples include accusations by Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and Bolivian President Evo Morales of OTI projects aiming to overthrow governments. Similar issues were raised in Serbia-Montenegro. OTI programs raise concerns about potential risks. OTI programs pose risks by potentially undermining popular support for opposition groups and raising concerns about U.S. involvement in foreign politics. The Serbia-Montenegro OTI program is highlighted as a success story, despite starting before a clear democratic transition. The OTI program in Serbia-Montenegro was considered a success story, with the main objective being to remove Milosevic from power. After his defeat in 2000, OTI shifted focus to community improvement projects promoting peaceful co-existence and democracy reform. During 1997-2000, OTI supported local organizations opposing the Milosevic regime in Serbia through technical and financial assistance, including aid to independent media and political parties. Despite operating from multiple locations and limited documentation, OTI is credited as a key player in Milosevic's fall, spending $8.68 million in the region. During 2000-2002, OTI spent $8.68 million in Serbia and Montenegro through 631 grants, supporting a democratic opposition campaign and election-monitoring activities. OTI expanded its activities post-Milosevic to consolidate democratic gains with community improvement projects, rehabilitating schools and health clinics, repairing infrastructure, and promoting civic participation. A 2001 survey showed increasing political apathy in Serbia. In response to a 2001 survey showing political apathy in Serbia, OTI shifted focus to the \"Pace of Reform\" initiative, emphasizing citizen participation in politics. From 2000-2002, OTI provided $14.05 million through 633 grants in Serbia and Montenegro, with 36.0% supporting CIPs and 32.8% focused on Pace of Reform. In Iraq, the Iraq Transition Initiative had the largest budget and coordinated with the U.S. military due to security circumstances. In April 2003, OTI staff arrived in Iraq as part of the USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team, focusing on humanitarian needs. They disbursed grants before the U.S. military entered Baghdad, setting up an Internet center and funding a meeting center in Umm Qasr. OTI was the first U.S. civilian entity to move substantial money through contractors in Iraq in 2003. Initially aiming to prevent inter-ethnic strife, OTI quickly initiated transition programs independent of DART. OTI focused on preventing inter-ethnic strife and anti-Baathist violence in Iraq but encountered less than expected. They filled gaps in democracy building, civil society organization, and human rights. OTI distributed grants for \"ministries in a box\" to set up the national government and later provided equipment support to advisory councils. OTI in northern Iraq addressed property disputes by establishing the Iraq Property Reconciliation Program. They also supported intelligence gathering for war crimes, funded employment programs, and infrastructure projects like patching fissures in the Mosul Dam. Additionally, OTI focused on improving information flow by opening Internet cafes. OTI focused on improving information flow to Iraqis by opening Internet cafes and expanding Radio Sawa's broadcast capabilities. The Coalition Provisional Authority provided OTI with $40 million for election preparation and democracy programs. OTI also participated in town hall meetings and helped establish an independent electoral commission. Additionally, OTI funded various small CPA priorities, including a delegation of Iraqi women visiting the United States. Some concerns were raised about spending too much time on CPA priorities, but coordination with U.S. government entities in Iraq was deemed necessary. In 2004, as the security situation in Iraq worsened, OTI focused on short-term employment programs for young men to deter insurgent recruitment, at the request of U.S. military commanders. The programs involved garbage collection, neighborhood clean-up, and park rehabilitation, paying $4-$5 per day. This initiative was strategically intensified before the 2005 national election, as OTI believed no other U.S. entity had the funding to address this need. The shift to employment programs strengthened OTI's relationship with the military. OTI's relationship with the military was strengthened through advisory roles in military-led projects. Some staff within OTI were concerned about the focus on short-term employment programs, suggesting a shift towards grants for civil society organizations. Despite calls for OTI to exit Iraq by 2005, continued instability and congressional support for employment programs led to the continuation of the Iraq Transition Initiative without the planned reorientation to civil society and local governance. OTI received $200 million from Congress in 2004 for short-term employment projects in Iraq, working closely with the military. Liaisons from multiple military commands were stationed at the OTI office until its departure in 2006. Lessons from this collaboration were integrated into the U.S. Army and Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Manual. Ambassador Khalilzad requested OTI to stay an extra six months to align USAID projects with military efforts. OTI funded projects to rebuild schools, parks, and soccer fields in strategic cities post-combat. The OTI program in Iraq received funding grants to rehabilitate schools, parks, and soccer fields after providing immediate humanitarian assistance post-military operations. Despite successful coordination with USAID and military commanders, there was limited evidence of the impact of the $337 million disbursed in grants. Monitoring and evaluation issues persisted, with little data available on the long-term effects of the projects, such as neighborhood clean-up employment initiatives and their supposed link to reducing violence. The OTI program in Iraq lacked a strong evaluation and monitoring plan, with no designated funds or personnel for monitoring. Military patrols in volatile areas provided remote oversight, which was inconsistent with OTI's criteria for engagement. The lack of focus on local capacity building in OTI's program has been criticized. The final evaluation report suggests that using local grantees for project design and monitoring could have led to better community buy-in and accountability. OTI's shift towards short-term employment in 2004-2005 was also criticized for aligning more with military objectives than with building local capacity for democratic governance. Some OTI staff only prioritized grantee capacity if they were viable in-kind grant recipients. Haiti II OTI's second program in Haiti focused on stability and progress in volatile communities through small grants for neighborhood improvement projects and youth-targeted activities. The program avoided direct involvement in election or democracy-promotion activities, instead aiming to diminish the power of spoilers perpetuating violence and chaos. The OTI program in Haiti aimed to support communities by focusing on small grants for neighborhood projects and youth activities. Initially partnering with the interim government, OTI faced delays and revised its strategy to work directly with selected communities. Collaboration with MINUSTAH proved more successful, allowing OTI to concentrate on key areas for stability and progress. The Stabilization of Haiti (MINUSTAH) focused on key areas with a strong peacekeeping presence, implementing programs to reduce gang violence through employment, school projects, soccer tournaments, and a media campaign. OTI improved MINUSTAH's image by involving local populations in public works projects and coordinating with international organizations. OTI also worked with Rene Preval's transition team on community projects after his election as President in 2006. OTI implemented 20 projects for community groups to showcase the new government's responsiveness and 17 projects targeting gang activity in Martissant. They also supported public viewing venues for the World Cup and planned for a turnover of activities to USAID/Haiti. The program disbursed $12 million for 546 infrastructure and community projects, with total expenditures of $16.9 million. Despite obstacles like theft, gang violence threats, and political interference, OTI functioned effectively in Haiti. The Haiti Transition Initiative implemented projects to improve community relations and communication with local governments. It also helped in reducing gang presence in neighborhoods, but ineffective local law enforcement may hinder lasting security improvements."
