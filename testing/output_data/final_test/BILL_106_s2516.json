Chapter 49 of title 18, United States Code, is amended to include administrative subpoenas to apprehend fugitives. A fugitive is defined as a person accused or convicted of a felony under Federal or State law who flees or evades jurisdiction. The term 'investigation' in the context of a State fugitive refers to a situation where there is reason to believe that the fugitive fled or attempted to flee from the court's jurisdiction. The term 'State' includes states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories. The Attorney General can issue subpoenas in investigations related to fugitive apprehension. The Attorney General can subpoena witnesses and records relevant to locating a fugitive. Witnesses and records can be required from any location within the United States. Witnesses summoned under this section can be required to appear within 500 miles of where they were served with a subpoena. The same fees and mileage as witnesses in federal courts will be paid. Subpoenas can be served by designated agents, personally delivered, or sent by certified mail. Domestic or foreign corporations, partnerships, or other associations subject to suit can also be served. The Attorney General can seek court assistance to enforce compliance with a subpoena in cases of refusal or contumacy. An affidavit of service is proof of subpoena delivery to authorized agents of unincorporated associations. The court can order a subpoenaed person to produce records before the Attorney General. Failure to obey may result in contempt charges. Process to enforce the order can be served in any judicial district. The recipient of the subpoena has the right to file a petition to modify or quash it within 20 days of service. The Attorney General can issue administrative subpoenas, which can be challenged if they are unreasonable, fail to meet requirements, or violate rights. The Attorney General must report annually to Congress on the number of subpoenas issued and the agencies involved. The Attorney General can issue administrative subpoenas with guidelines for approval by senior supervisory personnel. The reporting requirement will end in 3 years, and delayed notice is allowed for electronic communication service providers. The Attorney General can issue administrative subpoenas for communication or computing services, allowing delayed notification and court orders to prevent disclosure. Subpoenas for financial records from institutions can also be issued under this section. The Attorney General can apply for a court order to delay customer notice regarding financial records under the Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978. The court can also issue an order for nondisclosure of administrative subpoenas to prevent notification to other parties. The administrative subpoena can result in endangering individuals, flight from prosecution, evidence tampering, witness intimidation, or jeopardizing an investigation. Immunity from civil liability is granted to those who produce requested records in good faith. The curr_chunk discusses compliance with court orders for nondisclosure in production.
