    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 33607.5 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to apply to redevelopment projects adopted on or after January 1, 1994, or amended after that date to include new territory. Tax increments from added territory are subject to this section, calculated after deductions for the Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund. The payments made under this section are additional to amounts received by taxing entities. Payments are allocated based on property tax shares without considering certain allocations or reductions as per Revenue and Taxation Code. The agency shall reduce payments to taxing entities by any amount paid for public facilities, except for certain pre-1994 agreements or unrelated amounts. Reduction in payments to school districts, community colleges, or county offices of education shall only affect funds for educational facilities. The agency will reduce payments to taxing entities by any amount paid for public facilities, except for certain pre-1994 agreements or unrelated amounts. If the reduction exceeds the amount available for educational facilities in one year, the agency will spread the reduction over multiple years. If an agency reduces payments to educational entities, it must calculate the amount that would have been property taxes and available for educational facilities, then reduce the amount available for facilities and provide a statement to the entity. The total amount paid to school districts each year under this section is divided into 43.3% considered property taxes and 56.7% available for educational facilities. This excludes certain uses like land acquisition, construction, maintenance, and deferred maintenance. The total amount paid each year to community college districts is divided into 47.5% considered property taxes and 52.5% available for educational facilities, including land acquisition, construction, maintenance, and deferred maintenance. 19% of the total amount paid each year to county offices of education is considered property taxes, while 81% is available for educational facilities, including land acquisition, construction, maintenance, and deferred maintenance. (D) 19 percent of the total amount paid each year for special education is considered property taxes, while 81 percent is available for education facilities, including land acquisition, construction, maintenance, and deferred maintenance. (E) If an agency reduces payments to an educational entity, the calculation will determine the amount considered property taxes and the amount available for educational facilities in the year of the reduction. Local education agencies must use funds for school facilities within the project area, attended by students from the project area, or determined to benefit the project area by the governing board. In the fiscal years when a redevelopment agency receives tax increments, it must pay 25 percent of the increments to affected taxing entities, with the option for the community to receive a payment. Starting from the 11th fiscal year, the agency must pay the taxing entities, excluding the community. The redevelopment agency must pay 21 percent of tax increments received to affected taxing entities starting from the 31st fiscal year. The redevelopment agency must pay 14 percent of tax increments received to affected taxing entities after deducting amounts allocated to the Low and Moderate Income Housing Fund. Prior to incurring any loans, bonds, or other indebtedness, the agency may subordinate the required payment to affected taxing entities, with approval from the taxing entity. The agency must provide evidence of sufficient funds to affected taxing entities when requesting subordination of payments. Taxing entities have 45 days to approve or disapprove the request, or it will be deemed approved. The Legislature acknowledges these procedures. The Legislature states that payments under this section are necessary to help affected taxing entities with the financial burden from redevelopment plans and are the only payments required from a redevelopment agency during the plan's term. A redevelopment agency is not required to make additional payments to affected taxing entities or pay for public facilities owned or leased to an affected taxing entity as a measure to mitigate environmental effects or as part of any settlement agreement. A \"local education agency\" includes school districts, community college districts, or county offices of education."
