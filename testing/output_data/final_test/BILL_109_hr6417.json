Repeal of tax subsidies for oil and gas industry under the Climate Change Investment Act of 2006, including the expense election for certain refineries and amortization of geological and geophysical expenditures. Repeal of tax subsidies for oil and gas industry under the Climate Change Investment Act of 2006, including the repeal of enhanced oil recovery credit, credit for production of low sulfur diesel fuel, and credit for producing fuel from a nonconventional source after the enactment of this Act. The curr_chunk discusses the repeal of certain tax deductions related to environmental regulations, intangible drilling costs, and oil and gas provisions. The curr_chunk discusses the repeal of certain oil and gas provisions in tax deductions. The curr_chunk discusses the repeal of oil and gas provisions in tax deductions, specifically relating to expenditures on oil and gas wells. The effective date for these amendments is upon the enactment of the Act. Additionally, there is a repeal of the credit for producing fuel from a nonconventional source. The curr_chunk introduces a new section, SEC. 45N, which provides a Greenhouse Gas Intensity Reduction Investment Credit under business-related credits in the tax code. The new section, SEC. 45N, offers a Greenhouse Gas Intensity Reduction Investment Credit for taxpayers investing in approved projects certified by the Secretary of Energy. The credit is based on the percentage reduction in greenhouse gas intensity and the taxpayer's investment in the project. The Greenhouse Gas Intensity Reduction Investment Credit limits the total credit allowed to a taxpayer for a project to 50% of their investment. Additionally, the aggregate credit for a project cannot exceed the credit dollar amount allocated by the Secretary of Energy for that calendar year. The Greenhouse Gas Intensity Reduction Investment Credit allows for allocation of credits within the same calendar year as project approval by the Secretary of Energy, with a 10-year limit on credit allocation. There is a limitation on the amount of credits allocated each calendar year. The limitation amount for greenhouse gas intensity reduction investment credits is $600,000,000 for each calendar year from 2008 to 2012, and zero thereafter. Any excess credits can be carried over to the following year. Approved projects must meet criteria set by the Secretary of Energy. The approval criteria for greenhouse gas intensity reduction projects include the extent of reduction proposed, system efficiency improvements, technology transfer for projects outside the US, and agreements for sharing benefits and liability. Greenhouse gas intensity is calculated as emissions volume divided by economic activity. Recapture of credits may occur if project conditions are not met within a 20-year period. During a greenhouse gas intensity reduction project, a recapture event may trigger an increase in tax imposed for that taxable year. The credit recapture amount is determined by the recapture percentage of all previously allowable greenhouse gas intensity reduction investment credits. The recapture percentage is 100 percent if the event occurs within the first 5 years of the project. During a greenhouse gas intensity reduction project, a recapture event may trigger an increase in tax imposed for that taxable year. The recapture percentage varies depending on when the event occurs: 100% in the first 5 years, 75% in the second 5 years, 50% in the third 5 years, 25% in the fourth 5 years, and 0% after the 20th year. A recapture event can happen if the taxpayer violates project approval terms or adopts a new practice. During a greenhouse gas intensity reduction project, a recapture event may trigger an increase in tax imposed for that taxable year. The recapture percentage varies depending on when the event occurs. If an event outside the taxpayer's control is determined by the Secretary of Energy, it will not be treated as a recapture event. The tax for the taxable year may be increased due to a recapture event related to credits used to reduce tax liability. Any tax increase under this rule will not count towards determining tax credits or for section 55 purposes. The basis of an investment in a greenhouse gas intensity reduction project is reduced by any credit determined under this section. No charitable deduction is allowed for contributions certified as investments in such projects. The Secretary of Energy certifies to the Secretary of the Treasury the amount of greenhouse gas intensity reduction for each taxpayer annually. The Secretary of the Treasury will prescribe regulations for the greenhouse gas intensity reduction investment credit, including limits on subsidized investments, prevention of abuse through related parties, and reporting requirements. The credit is part of the general business credit. The greenhouse gas intensity reduction investment credit is added to the general business credit under section 38 and the deduction for unused credit under section 196. Additionally, a clerical amendment is made to the table of sections. The amendment adds a Greenhouse gas intensity reduction investment credit under section 38 and section 196 for investments made after December 31, 2007."
