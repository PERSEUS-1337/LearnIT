    "content": "The \"digital divide\" refers to the gap between those who have access to telecommunications and information technologies and those who do not. Factors such as computer availability, education, and affordable internet access determine if individuals fall into the \"information haves\" category. Broadband deployment in urban/suburban and high-income areas is faster than in rural and low-income areas. Prior to the late 1990s, internet access was limited to 56 kilobits per second. Broadband internet service began in the late 1990s, with cable modem and DSL options. The number of high-speed connections grew significantly, reaching 409 million by June 30, 2017. The majority of these connections, 353 million, are for residential users. The deployment of broadband technologies can be categorized into \"current generation\" and \"next generation\" broadband. \"Current generation\" includes cable, DSL, and wireless systems, while \"next generation\" offers faster speeds through fiber technologies. The FCC sets a benchmark of 25 Mbps download/3 Mbps upload speeds for advanced telecommunications capability. Urban Americans have varying access to fixed broadband services. Table 2 displays recent percentages of Americans in urban, rural, and tribal areas with access to fixed broadband at speeds of 25 Mbps/3Mbps, based on the FCC's Communications Marketplace Report. As of December 2017, 94% of all Americans had access to fixed terrestrial broadband at those speeds, with over 19.4 million still lacking access. Table 3 shows the percentage of Americans by state with access to fixed 25 Mbps/3Mbps terrestrial broadband. Urban areas typically have more broadband providers offering competition compared to rural or tribal areas (Table 4). Broadband adoption in American households is at 81.4%, with 68% using the internet at home. 52% use multiple devices to connect, including tablets and mobile phones. Groups lagging in internet adoption include those with low incomes, seniors, the less-educated, and rural households. The cost of monthly subscriptions is a main barrier to broadband adoption, especially for seniors, the less-educated, and rural households. GAO identified affordability, lack of perceived relevance, and lack of computer skills as key barriers. Efforts to address these barriers include discounts on equipment and subscriptions, outreach to promote benefits, and training in computer skills. Urban areas have seen faster broadband deployment than rural and tribal areas. Broadband deployment in rural and tribal areas lags behind urban areas, with over 24% of Americans in rural areas and 32% in Tribal lands lacking coverage compared to only 1.5% in urban areas. Rural areas also fall behind in mobile broadband deployment. Rural areas continue to lag behind urban areas in mobile broadband deployment, with a relatively flat rate of about 70% compared to 92.6% in urban areas. Data shows a gap in high-speed broadband connection at home, internet use, and population density as key factors contributing to the disparity. The lower population density in rural areas is a major reason for the limited deployment of broadband compared to urban areas. The cost to serve customers in rural areas is higher due to greater geographical distances, less demand, and challenging terrain. Additionally, the expense of backhaul in remote areas adds to the cost of deploying broadband technologies. Some policymakers are concerned about disparities in broadband access across American society, as high-speed internet connections are crucial for economic development and prosperity. A study by MIT found that communities with broadband experienced economic growth between 1998 and 2002. The study found that communities with mass-market broadband experienced rapid growth in employment, businesses, and IT-intensive sectors between 1998 and 2002. Subsequent studies projected increased employment with broadband penetration, with consumer benefits estimated to be $32 billion per year in 2009. In 2005, home broadband provided $20 billion in consumer benefits. A 2009 study by ITIF showed that investing $10 billion in broadband networks would create or retain 498,000 U.S. jobs. A 2013 study funded by the National Agricultural and Rural Development Policy Center found that counties with high broadband adoption had 23.4% income growth. A 2016 study by the Hudson Institute reported that rural broadband providers added $24.1 billion to the U.S. economy in 2015, supporting 69,595 jobs. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 requires the FCC to assess broadband availability and deployment to all Americans. There have been eleven Section 706 reports since 1999, each evaluating broadband deployment and setting minimum speed standards. The industry supported 69,595 jobs in 2015 through its own employment and purchases of goods and services. The FCC sets minimum broadband speed benchmarks to determine broadband service for Section 706 reports. In 2015, the minimum fixed broadband benchmark speed was raised to 25 Mbps/3 Mbps due to changing usage patterns. The 2018 Broadband Deployment Report concluded that advanced telecommunications capability is being deployed to all Americans in a reasonable and timely fashion. The FCC's determination on broadband deployment is based on progress evaluation, comparing current deployment to previous years. The use of present progressive tense indicates Congress intended the Commission to assess current deployment state to all Americans, not requiring every American to be served at the moment. This marks a departure from previous approaches. The FCC's latest determination states that broadband deployment in the US is now considered reasonable and timely, a change from previous assessments. The report was approved by three Republican commissioners, while two Democratic commissioners dissented. However, Commissioner Rosenworcel criticized the report, pointing out that millions of Americans still lack access to broadband, especially in rural areas and among school-aged children. The FCC's report on broadband deployment in the US was approved with dissent from Democratic commissioners. Despite considering lower benchmarks for mobile broadband, the report concluded that a single mobile benchmark is currently unworkable. The FCC adopted the report on August 8, 2018. The FCC's Fourteenth Broadband Deployment Report Notice of Inquiry, adopted on August 8, 2018, maintains the 25 Mbps/3 Mbps benchmark for broadband service. It seeks comments on the substitutability between mobile and fixed broadband services and the circumstances under which they should be considered substitutes. The challenges in obtaining an accurate snapshot of broadband deployment include rapidly evolving technologies, industry flux, consumer preferences, and the nation's diverse economy. Improving broadband deployment data quality is a congressional concern to target unserved areas effectively. Two federal agencies, NTIA and FCC, have initiatives for broadband availability mapping. The FCC's Form 477 National Broadband Map faces criticism. The FCC's Form 477 National Broadband Map has faced criticism for potentially overstating broadband availability due to data being collected at the census block level. The FCC is exploring ways to improve data accuracy and reduce industry burdens. The Administration requested $50 million for broadband mapping in FY2018. The Administration requested $50 million for broadband mapping in FY2018. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141) appropriated $7.5 million to NTIA for updating the national broadband availability map in coordination with the FCC. NTIA issued a Request for Comments on improving broadband availability data, receiving feedback on various issues. The NTIA issued a notice for public comment on collecting more detailed broadband availability data. The FCC released the National Broadband Plan in 2010, aiming to provide affordable broadband access to 100 million U.S. homes by 2020 with specific speed requirements. The National Broadband Plan aims to provide fast and affordable broadband access to all Americans, with specific speed requirements and goals for innovation, mobile networks, community access, public safety, and clean energy. The National Broadband Plan is divided into three parts: Part I focuses on innovation, investment, and consumer welfare through competition, efficient asset management, and addressing various issues. Part II aims to promote inclusion by ensuring all Americans have access to broadband opportunities through reforming the Universal Service Fund and other measures. The National Broadband Plan includes recommendations for compensation, federal assistance for broadband in tribal lands, expanding existing broadband grant and loan programs, improving broadband connectivity in anchor institutions, and enhancing broadband adoption among disadvantaged populations. It also focuses on maximizing the use of broadband for national priorities such as healthcare, education, energy, government performance, civic engagement, and public safety. Federal support for broadband in small businesses, telework within the federal government, cybersecurity, protection of critical broadband infrastructure, copyright of public digital media, interoperable public safety communications, next generation 911 networks, and emergency alert systems is facilitated through ongoing federal funding programs such as the Universal Service Fund (USF) programs under the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the broadband and telecommunications programs at the Rural Utilities Service (RUS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) released a comprehensive Guide to Federal Funding of Broadband Projects in June 2017, providing summary and contact information for various federal programs. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has been tasked with providing nationwide wire and radio communications services since 1934. This led to the development of the universal service concept, ensuring affordable telecommunications services for all Americans, including those in rural areas. Various FCC policies and programs have evolved to support this concept. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 codified the commitment to universal service, leading to the establishment of the Universal Service Fund (USF) in 1997. Administered by the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC) under the FCC, the USF supports the deployment of broadband services. The Universal Service Fund (USF) administers four programs: High Cost/Connect America Fund, Schools and Libraries Program, Rural Health Care Program, and Low Income Program, disbursing $8.8 billion in 2017. There was a policy debate on whether broadband should be included in universal service objectives, with the FCC adopting a limited definition in 1997. The FCC-adopted definition of universal service was criticized for being too limited and not considering the importance of advanced services like broadband. Provisions in the 1996 act call for equal access to advanced telecommunications services for all regions and consumers, including low-income and rural areas. This suggests the need for the FCC to expand its universal service definition. The 1996 act allows for the modification of the universal service definition to adapt to changes in the telecommunications sector. The FCC is tasked with periodically reevaluating this definition, considering advances in technology. The Joint Board recommended including broadband Internet services in the universal service support. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 called for the FCC to develop a national broadband plan to ensure universal access to broadband. The plan recommended restructuring the Universal Service Fund to support broadband deployment and adoption. In October 2011, the FCC adopted an Order to transform the USF over a multiyear period to support broadband services. The transformation of the Universal Service Fund from supporting voice telephone service to supporting broadband deployment and adoption includes phasing out the High Cost Program and creating the Connect America Fund. This shift aims to address the higher costs of providing services in rural areas and expand programs for schools, libraries, rural healthcare, and low-income individuals. The High Cost Program is being phased out and replaced by the Connect America Fund (CAF) to support affordable voice and broadband services in high cost areas. The CAF includes a Mobility Fund and a Remote Areas Fund. Approximately $4.67 billion in funding was disbursed in 2017. Congress expanded universal service to include telecommunications access for schools, libraries, and rural healthcare providers at discounted rates. The 1996 Telecommunications Act provides discounted rates for services for schools and libraries under the E-Rate Program, ensuring access to advanced telecommunications services for education purposes. The FCC established the Schools and Libraries Division within USAC to administer the program. The E-rate program administered by the Schools and Libraries Division within USAC provides discounts for eligible schools and libraries on telecommunications services based on poverty levels and location. Two categories of services are eligible for discounts: category one for telecommunications and internet access, and category two for internal connections and broadband services. The funding cap for 2018 is $4.1 billion, with $2.62 billion disbursed in 2017. The Rural Health Care Program, established under Section 254(h) of the 1996 act, provides funding of $2.62 billion in 2017 through three programs to ensure rural health care providers have access to telecommunications services necessary for quality health care. The program aims to provide advanced telecommunications and information services to improve health care in rural areas. The Rural Health Care Program aims to improve healthcare quality in rural areas by providing funding for broadband and telecommunications services to public or nonprofit healthcare providers. The Telecommunications Program, established in 1997, offers discounts to ensure rural providers pay similar rates as urban providers. The funding is used for reduced rates on necessary telecommunications and information services. The Rural Health Care Pilot Program, established in 2006, helps build broadband networks for healthcare services with funding up to 85% of eligible costs. No new funding is available under this program. The FCC created the Healthcare Connect Fund in December 2012 to expand broadband access for healthcare providers, especially in rural areas. The program offers a 65% discount on eligible expenses for broadband connectivity and supports the development of state and regional networks. Consortia can include nonrural providers, but at least 50% must be rural. The total annual funding cap for USF rural health care programs is $400 million. The Low Income Program, with a total annual funding cap of $400 million, provides discounts for voice telephony service for eligible low-income consumers. The program consists of two subprograms, Lifeline and Link Up, with Lifeline offering the majority of support. In 2016, the FCC expanded the Lifeline Program to include mobile and fixed broadband internet access services. Eligible households must meet needs-based criteria, and assistance is provided in the form of a monthly subsidy of $9.25 per eligible household. Support is given to the designated service provider, not directly to the subscriber. In 2017, approximately $261.5 million was disbursed. In 2017, approximately $1.27 billion was disbursed by RUS for broadband infrastructure deployment in rural areas through various programs. These programs include the Rural Broadband Access Loan and Loan Guarantee Program, Telecommunications Infrastructure Loans and Loan Guarantees, ReConnect Program, Community Connect Grant Program, and Distance Learning and Telemedicine Grant Program. The 2018 farm bill reauthorized and modified RUS broadband programs. The 2018 farm bill addressed RUS broadband programs, including the allocation of $2.5 billion for grants, loans, and combinations. The funds were designated for rural areas lacking high-speed broadband access to promote economic development. The 2018 farm bill allocated $4.7 billion to NTIA for broadband grants, with priorities for rural residents without access, borrowers of rural telephone loans, and specific grant categories. The Trump Administration's infrastructure plan released in 2018 does not allocate specific funding for broadband but includes rural broadband as eligible for funding under a $50 billion Rural Infrastructure Program. The Rural Infrastructure Program would provide block grants to states for infrastructure projects in transportation, water, power, broadband, and more for rural areas with populations under 50,000. Governors have discretion in choosing investments to meet rural needs. A portion of funds would be reserved for tribal and territorial infrastructure. Additionally, there is a $20 billion Transformative Projects Program for innovative infrastructure projects with commercial viability. The Rural Infrastructure Program, led by the Department of Commerce, would provide federal funding for up to 80% of eligible costs for capital construction. $14 billion is allocated for expanding federal credit programs, including USDA's Rural Utilities Service. $6 billion is designated for expanding Public Activity Bonds to include rural broadband service facilities. Congress will have the final decision on the proposal. The Administration's infrastructure proposal includes new categories like rural broadband service facilities. Congress will decide on the extent of implementation and legislation for the initiative. The $20 billion infrastructure budget includes funding for rural broadband, but the specific amount is unspecified. The Trump Administration's plan aims to streamline permitting regulations for faster infrastructure deployment. In the 115th Congress, legislation has been considered to streamline permitting for broadband deployment. The FCC has initiated the Broadband Deployment Advisory Committee to provide recommendations for reducing regulatory barriers. This committee includes stakeholders from industry and states appointed by the FCC chairman. The Broadband Deployment Advisory Committee (BDAC) consists of stakeholders appointed by the FCC chairman from various sectors. Five working groups have been established to address different aspects of broadband deployment. The FCC has taken steps to reduce regulatory barriers for wireless and wireline broadband deployment. BroadbandUSA, housed at the Department of Commerce's NTIA, provides technical assistance to communities for broadband initiatives. BroadbandUSA, under the Department of Commerce's NTIA, assists communities in identifying funding opportunities, forming partnerships, and navigating the broadband landscape. It organizes events, publishes resources, and co-chairs the Broadband Interagency Working Group to improve coordination and reduce regulatory barriers for broadband deployment. The Broadband Interagency Working Group (BIWG) was formed in 2017 to improve coordination, reduce regulatory barriers, promote federal support for broadband investment, and share information on available resources. It is part of BroadbandUSA, which also coordinates the State Broadband Leaders Network (SBLN) to share priorities, best practices, and address collaboration barriers across states and agencies. Section 1436 of the FAST Act authorized high-speed broadband deployment. The FAST Act authorized a high-speed broadband deployment initiative for the Appalachian region with $10 million in annual broadband grants. Broadband projects are eligible for funding under the Economic Development Administration programs, with a focus on unserved areas. EDA is directed to report on broadband projects supported. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 allocated $600 million to RUS for a broadband loan and grant pilot program, known as the ReConnect Program, targeting rural areas lacking sufficient broadband access. The program aims to serve at least 90% of households in rural areas with limited broadband availability. The ReConnect Program, funded by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, offers loans, grants, and loan/grant combinations for rural broadband access. Additionally, Title I of Division B appropriates $7.5 million to update the national broadband map in coordination with the FCC. Title V of Division P includes provisions for spectrum auction deposits and FCC reports on promoting broadband for veterans. The FCC is required to establish regulations for collecting mobile service coverage data for the Universal Service program. Title VI (MOBILE NOW) aims to increase spectrum for wireless broadband, streamline infrastructure deployment on federal lands, and promote consultation between telecom providers and state highway authorities. Section 615 mandates a study on broadband access using unlicensed spectrum. The 116th Congress may address the digital divide by considering approaches to support infrastructure deployment, including rural broadband. Various policy instruments are available to policymakers, such as universal service reform and financial support for broadband deployment. Various policy instruments are available to policymakers for broadband deployment, including tax incentives, broadband bonds, demand-side incentives, reducing regulatory barriers, and spectrum policy. Congress may consider the appropriate mix of incentives to create jobs and target next-generation technologies. Funding and federal assistance bills have been introduced in the 115th Congress.
