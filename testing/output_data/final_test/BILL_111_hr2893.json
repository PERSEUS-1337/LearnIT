    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Money Service Business Act of 2009\". The Congress acknowledges that money services businesses provide essential financial services to customers, including under-banked communities. These services include funds transfers, check cashing, money orders, traveler's checks, and bill payments. Regulatory guidance requires depository institutions to review money services businesses' anti-money laundering programs. Many insured depository institutions are refusing or closing money services businesses' accounts to avoid regulatory burdens and potential liabilities. This trend threatens the existence of legitimate, regulated money services businesses and may drive their transactions underground, posing risks to national security. Money services businesses must maintain transparency in transactions to comply with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing obligations. Federal and State regulators enforce control programs and reporting requirements on these businesses to ensure compliance. Regulators are committed to coordinating supervision and enforcement efforts for money services businesses. Insured depository institutions and Federal banking regulators rely on a regulatory process for overseeing money services businesses' compliance with anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing obligations. Self-certification by legitimate businesses attesting to compliance is also important to reduce regulatory burden and promote access to the banking system. Federal and State agencies have authority to supervise and enforce compliance with these obligations. To reduce regulatory burden and promote access to the banking system, self-certification by legitimate businesses is necessary under the Act and its implementing regulations. SEC. 3. SELF-CERTIFICATION PROCESS FOR MONEY SERVICES BUSINESSES ESTABLISHED. Section 5318(h) of title 31, United States Code, is amended to include provisions for federally insured depository institutions maintaining accounts for money transmitting businesses. These institutions are not obligated to review the compliance of the business or its agents if they have a certification on file that meets specific requirements. The text chunk discusses the requirements for a money transmitting business to provide certifications and penalties for misrepresentation. Civil penalties apply for making false certifications. The text chunk outlines criminal penalties for knowingly making misrepresentations in certifications for money transmitting businesses. It also clarifies that federally insured depository institutions are not required to manage accounts for such businesses. A federally insured depository institution is not liable for a money transmitting business or its agent failing to comply with regulations. The term 'federally insured depository institution' includes insured depository institutions and insured credit unions. Money transmitting businesses must provide a certification to meet requirements. A money transmitting business must certify compliance with anti-money laundering regulations and maintain a program covering all identified capacities. The business also needs to be licensed to meet requirements. The business must be licensed or registered as a money transmitting business in each State where it operates, registered with the Secretary in compliance with section 5330, and remain in full compliance with regulations. Certification by an agent of a money transmitting business must meet specific requirements, including being an agent of a business that meets certain criteria, appearing on the business's list of agents, and operating under a written contract. The certification by an agent of a money transmitting business requires compliance with laws, honesty in business dealings, and immediate notification of any material changes in the agent's relationship with the business to the depository institution. The agent of a money transmitting business must be licensed or registered in the state where they operate, comply with regulations, and notify any changes in their relationship with the business promptly. The Secretary of the Treasury will create regulations to implement the amendments within 120 days of the enactment of the Act."
