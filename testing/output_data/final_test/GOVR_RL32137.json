With six-party talks stalled, efforts are being made to pressure North Korea economically and politically. Chosen Soren has supported North Korea through trade, cash donations, personal contacts, and possible illicit activities. Japan is showing more willingness to crack down on the group's illegal actions, and the US may cooperate with Japan to influence North Korean behavior. Congress is actively overseeing the Administration's approach to North Korea. The Chosen Soren, a pro-Pyongyang group of ethnic Koreans in Japan, is being scrutinized by US and Japanese policymakers in efforts to halt North Korea's nuclear weapons program. Congress is actively overseeing the Administration's approach to North Korea, including a recent hearing where a North Korean defector testified about missile shipments. The report explores Chosen Soren's relations with North Korea and Japan, Japan's policy changes towards the group, and potential US actions to exploit the group's connections. The Chosen Soren is a political and social organization of ethnic Koreans in Japan affiliated with North Korea. Established in 1955, it represents a minority of the 640,000 ethnic Koreans in Japan. The group administers schools, a university, publishes a newspaper, and has ties with financial institutions. Up to 30% of the pachinko industry in Japan is controlled by ethnic Koreans. The pachinko industry in Japan, controlled by ethnic Koreans, is influenced by Chosen Soren, a group with ties to North Korea. Chosen Soren advocates for a strong national identity with North Korea and facilitated the repatriation of Korean residents to the North. In contrast, Mindan supports enfranchisement of ethnic Koreans in Japan. Membership in Mindan surpasses Chosen Soren, indicating a shift in support among ethnic Koreans in Japan. Chosen Soren, representing ethnic Koreans in Japan, faces discrimination and justifies its existence based on historical colonization by Japan. Relations with the Japanese government are strained, with leaders avoiding confrontation to prevent backlash from Pyongyang and accusations of racial discrimination. Government agencies ignored money flow from Japan to North Korea, allowed ferry links with little safety measures, and permitted Chosen Soren to maintain tax-free status. Accusations of ties with organized crime and politicians' involvement with gangster trade have surfaced. Critics suggest Japanese politicians allow cash remittances to continue due to their own connections with the yakuza. The interdiction of links with Pyongyang could expose LDP affiliation with the yakuza organized crime syndicate. The secretive nature of North Korea makes assessing political interaction with Chosen Soren and Kim Jong Il's regime difficult. North Korea reportedly sends $3.6 million a year to Chosen Soren for Korean schools in Japan. Chosen Soren has representatives in North Korea's legislature and runs an underground network for spying on South Korea and the Japanese military. Kim Jong Il issued a directive before a diplomatic summit with Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi in September 2002. Kim Jong Il issued a directive to disband the gakushu-gumi before a summit with Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. The issue of hard currency flowing into North Korea from Japan has been debated, with estimates of up to $1 billion a year before the economic downturn in Japan. Current estimates suggest remittances were generally below $100 million even at their peak. Eberstadt estimated that remittances to North Korea were below $100 million annually. Japanese firms linked to Chosen Soren were involved in illegal transfers of high-tech equipment to North Korea for its nuclear weapons program. Meishin, a Tokyo-based trading company, admitted to exporting transformers that could be used for uranium enrichment and missile development to North Korea via Thailand without authorization. The Korea Daesong General Trading Corporation, linked to Division 39 of the Korean Workers' Party, authorized the illegal transfer of high-tech equipment to North Korea. Meishin, a Tokyo-based company, exported transformers for uranium enrichment and missile development to North Korea through a Thai subsidiary of Loxley PCL, which has business interests in North Korea. Chosen Soren, a non-ethnic Korean company, was involved in selling military technology to North Korea. Seishin Enterprises shipped a jet mill and attempted to export electronic scales for weapons production. A senior member of Chosen Soren coordinated the order. Japanese radar was found after a clash with a North Korean spy ship in 2001. In December 2001, a North Korean spy ship was sunk, revealing Japanese-made radar and precision devices. President Bush reported North Korean involvement in drug trafficking, with Japan being a major recipient of methamphetamines. The Mangyongbong ferry between Japan and North Korea is suspected of smuggling drugs. The Yomiuri newspaper reported that an escapee smuggled narcotics for North Korea on the ferry, passing them to Chosen Soren who then sold them to Japanese gangsters. Ties between North Korea and the Japanese mafia are increasing, especially after the Taepodong missile test over Japan in 1998 and Kim Jong Il's admission of abducting Japanese nationals in 2002. This has led to the Japanese government cracking down on Chosen Soren's interactions with North Korea. The Japanese government has tightened regulations on the North Korean-operated Mangyongbong ferry following Kim Jong Il's admission of abducting Japanese nationals. Safety checks, cargo inspections, and passenger limits are now strictly enforced, leading to a seven-month suspension of the ferry's operation in 2003. Japanese officials suspended the North Korean-operated Mangyongbong ferry for seven months to bolster safety requirements before resuming service in August. They have since delayed departures citing violations of safety and disease control laws, ordering improvements on inspected vessels. The transport ministry seeks a budget increase for 2004 to enhance foreign vessel inspections. Chosen Soren, declared North Korea's representative in Japan in 1972, lost its tax-exempt status in 2003, leading to tax demands and facility seizures by Tokyo Governor Ishihara. In early September, Japanese officials seized three Chosen Soren facilities for unpaid taxes. Several local governments with Chosen Soren chapters are demanding similar tax payments. The collapse of credit associations catering to pro-Pyongyang residents has raised concerns about Chosen Soren's financial operations. Most of Japan's Chogin credit unions have collapsed due to illegal remittances to North Korea. Accusations include allowing Pyongyang sympathizers to create bogus accounts and offering preferential loans to North Korean supporters. The collapse of credit associations linked to Chosen Soren in Japan led to the infusion of public funds to protect depositors. Banks lent money beyond collateral, often tied to Chosen Soren, resulting in nonperforming loans. Replacement credit unions received over $3.3 billion in public funds in 2002, causing public outcry amid tensions with North Korea. Legislators pushed for banking regulators to sever ties with Chosen Soren. In Korea, legislators pressured banking regulators to appoint a Japanese national as the credit union president due to concerns about ties to Chosen Soren. Japan's newspapers urged financial authorities to monitor the union's connections with Chosen Soren for independence. Japan's actions suggest a willingness to confront Chosen Soren amid anti-North Korean sentiments, aligning with previous U.S. proposals to cut off funds to North Korea. Measures may include surveillance of banks serving Chosen Soren members and regulating pachinko profits. Japan has relaxed sanctions criteria to preserve peace, allowing for more robust enforcement of export controls on vessels to North Korea. Reform and transparency in financial institutions could help trace money to Pyongyang. The US may push Japan to cut off official trade with North Korea, facilitated by Chosen Soren. Multilateral efforts, like the Proliferation Security Initiative, may be pursued to pressure North Korea. Efforts to pressure North Korea involve the 11-country Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) to interdict vessels carrying illicit cargo. Crackdowns on drug and weapon trafficking may uncover more ties between Chosen Soren members and North Korea, leading to potential punitive actions. Third-party options include asking Thailand to stop technology transfers to North Korea and requesting Austria and Macau to limit bank transfers passing through their financial institutions."
