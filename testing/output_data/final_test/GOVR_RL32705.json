    "content": "Improving border and transportation security is crucial for homeland security, involving regulating traffic to detect and prevent entry of dangerous goods and people. A sophisticated border management system is needed to balance security with facilitating legitimate commerce and travel. Transportation security focuses on securing people and goods across highways, railways, airways, and waterways. Congressional actions post-9/11 have expanded federal roles beyond aviation security to other modes of transportation. Recent congressional actions have focused on terrorism and border security, including creating the Department of Homeland Security and enacting the USA Patriot Act. Specific measures have been taken to address immediate threats such as aviation security, visa policy, bioterrorism, and maritime security. The 109th Congress is expected to address these issues comprehensively and integrate border security and homeland security efforts. The report provides an overview of selected concepts and issues related to border and transportation security for the 109th Congress. It discusses the responsibilities of selected agencies, key concepts in recent debates, and provisions from the 9/11 Commission Report and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is highlighted as the primary agency responsible for border security. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was reorganized into four main directorates: Border and Transportation Security (BTS), Emergency Preparedness and Response (EPR), Science and Technology (S&T), and Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection (IAIP). Border security responsibilities are primarily within the BTS Directorate, with Customs and Border Protection (CBP) handling security at ports-of-entry and border crossings. The Coast Guard, a standalone agency within DHS, also has significant border security duties. The Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency, within the Border and Transportation Security (BTS) Directorate of the Department of Homeland Security, is responsible for maintaining border crossing stations and enforcing federal immigration laws. The United States Border Patrol (USBP) focuses on detecting and preventing the entry of terrorists, weapons of mass destruction, unauthorized aliens, drug smugglers, and other criminals. Additionally, the bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) enforces immigration and customs laws within the United States and investigates activities such as fraud and forced labor. ICE oversees investigations into activities such as fraud, forced labor, trade agreement noncompliance, smuggling, illegal transshipment, vehicle and cargo theft. It also manages building security, Air and Marine Operations, and Federal Air Marshals Service. ICE combines investigations and intelligence functions of U.S. Customs Service and former INS, air and marine interdiction functions, immigration detention and removal programs, and Federal Protective Service operations. It conducts investigations to reduce illegal entry into the United States and locates and removes illegal aliens by inspecting places of employment. ICE is responsible for locating and removing illegal aliens by inspecting places of employment for undocumented workers. The TSA focuses on aviation security post-9/11 attacks, deploying passenger and baggage screeners, detection systems, and other security technologies. TSA also has responsibilities for marine and land transportation modes. The TSA is responsible for aviation security and also oversees security for marine and land transportation modes. They assess the risk of terrorist attacks, issue regulations, and enforce them to protect the transportation system. The Coast Guard is the lead federal agency for maritime homeland security, responsible for border and transportation security in U.S. ports and waterways. The Coast Guard is a distinct entity within DHS and reports directly to the Secretary of DHS. It works closely with the BTS directorate, while DOS and DOJ also have roles in border security. Foreign nationals must obtain a visa to come to the US, with DOS issuing visas and USCIS administering laws on alien admission. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) oversees border security, with various agencies like USCIS and EOIR playing key roles. The report discusses concepts related to border management and the need to balance facilitating access with interdicting threats. Success lies in efficiently identifying high-risk individuals. The policymaker's task is to enhance the efficacy of filters for identifying high-risk passengers and cargo at the border. Border enforcement agents engage in an identification and verification process to determine the legitimacy of entry requests. Policymakers in the 109th Congress will face issues revolving around entry processing procedures for people and cargo. The issues facing policymakers in the 109th Congress revolve around themes of security and efficiency in border and transportation realms. There is a potential conflict between security measures and the flow of people and goods, but policy choices can balance both. The focus is on what and who should be inspected, the intensity of inspections, and how often inspections should occur. The key items of debate in border and transportation security include the intensity and coverage of inspections, as well as jurisdiction. Debates often revolve around the level of inspection for goods and people entering and moving throughout the country. Some argue for 100% inspection procedures, while others advocate for a targeted approach due to limited resources and potential impact on commerce. The appropriate level of inspection remains a point of contention. The appropriate level of inspection for goods and individuals entering the country is a key debate in border security. Confusion often arises over what proportion of goods have been inspected, leading to discussions on the frequency and responsibility of inspections. The term \"inspection\" can encompass various levels of scrutiny, from reviewing documentation to detailed examinations. The level of inspection for goods and individuals entering the country is a debated topic in border security. Confusion arises over the proportion of goods inspected, leading to discussions on inspection frequency and responsibility. Inspection methods range from document checks to physical examinations, including x-rays and radiation monitoring. The term \"inspection\" can involve various levels of scrutiny, such as biometric verification, interviews, and database searches for individuals. The level of inspection for goods and individuals entering the country is a debated topic in border security. There are differences in inspections depending on the port of entry, with airports having more comprehensive examinations than land ports. Primary inspection involves standard protocols for everyone, while secondary inspection is for cases that couldn't be processed during the primary inspection. When discussing border security, it is crucial to understand the context in which terms like \"inspection\" and \"screening\" are used. These terms are often used interchangeably, but they have different implications. Screening involves querying databases to verify identities and legitimacy, while inspection involves examining goods and individuals entering the country. The integration of the U.S. border security system was recommended by the 9/11 Commission. The 9/11 Commission recommended integrating the U.S. border security system by expanding screening points to include transportation systems and vital facilities. Homeland Security Presidential Directive 11 (HSPD-11) builds upon HSPD-6 to improve terrorist screening through information sharing and systems integration for interoperability. Integrated systems have standardized communication protocols for efficient information sharing. The report highlights issues related to BTS that may concern the 109th Congress, including US-VISIT/Entry-Exit Screening program oversight and exemptions for certain foreign nationals. The program aims to fully implement at various ports of entry, with exemptions for Mexican and Canadian nationals. The 108th Congress passed legislation requiring a biometrically secured document for entry at U.S. ports. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act includes provisions for the entry-exit system, with a recommendation to accelerate its implementation. Visa policy has been shifting away from U.S. border control since the mid-1990s. Since the mid-1990s, immigration control has shifted to overseas screening to prevent inadmissible aliens from entering the United States. Strengthening visa issuance procedures is crucial for border security, with the 109th Congress overseeing provisions for data sharing, an electronic data system for sharing information, and biometric identifiers on visas issued after October 2004. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 expanded overseas pre-inspection of travelers, deployed biometric technologies, established the Office of Visa and Passport Security, and required consular officers to have training in detecting terrorist travel patterns. The Visa Waiver Program allows visitors from 27 countries to enter the US without visas, provided they meet certain standards. The Visa Waiver Program (VWP) requires participating countries to issue passports with biometric identifiers, a deadline extended to October 26, 2005. The 109th Congress may re-examine this deadline due to potential issues with meeting it. Concerns include DHS's management of the VWP, such as lack of funding and trained personnel, data reliability on lost passports, and delays in country reviews. Biometric identifiers have been a requirement for immigration documents for over a decade. The Consular Consolidated Database (CCD) stores data on visa applicants, including photographs and fingerprints. The CCD is used for screening aliens for admissibility, particularly on terrorist security and criminal grounds. Laser visas issued to Mexican citizens include biometric identifiers like photographs and fingerprints for both index fingers. The Mexican laser visa, also known as a border crossing card (BCC), includes biometric identifiers like photographs and fingerprints for index fingers. The 109th Congress may consider limits to visa and passport requirements. The 109th Congress may consider limits to the President's ability to waive general statutory requirements for U.S. citizens traveling abroad or entering the United States without a valid U.S. passport. Some propose restrictions on waivers only for citizens traveling to or from contiguous territories with designated reliable proof of citizenship. Waiver authority for arriving nationals from foreign countries may only be granted through a joint determination by DHS and DOS based on reciprocity. ICE collaborates with other agencies on investigations into alien smuggling and trafficking, targeting major criminal activities in this area. Alien smuggling and human trafficking are related but distinct offenses, with human trafficking being an aggravated form of alien smuggling. ICE works with the Department of State and FBI on these investigations, which include overseas components. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 established the Human Smuggling and Trafficking Center to combat terrorist travel, migrant smuggling, and trafficking. There are concerns about terrorists using human smuggling networks to enter the United States. ICE is developing a strategy to address alien smuggling and human trafficking at the international level, but details on the strategy and integration with other law enforcement agencies are unclear. The Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000, containing programs to prevent trafficking and aid victims, expires in FY2005. Asylum seekers must show fear of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, social group, or political opinion. Regulations under the Torture Convention prevent the return of individuals to countries where they may face danger. An immigration officer can exclude an alien without proper documentation or present in the US for less than two years through expedited removal. Asylum seekers often first interact with Border and Transportation Security officials, raising concerns about their training in asylum policy and humanitarian immigration relief. Some advocate for changes in U.S. asylum law due to concerns about potential terrorists exploiting it for entry, while others argue that current laws do not adequately protect those fleeing human rights violations. Differentiating between the persecuted and persecutors is increasingly challenging in countries with religious, ethnic, and political violence. The crux of the issue lies in the extent of asylum policy. The asylum policy, shaped during the Cold War, is being reevaluated in the context of the war on terrorism. Proposed revisions include expanding expedited removal criteria and restricting asylum officer interviews. Legislative options aim to raise evidentiary standards for asylum cases. The integration of CBP's IDENT and FBI's IAFIS databases is a key project for tightening border security, allowing for better identification of criminal aliens and tracking repeat entrants. The integration of CBP's IDENT and FBI's IAFIS databases is crucial for border security, allowing frontline agents to check apprehended aliens for warrants or criminal histories. However, integration has faced challenges. The FY2005 DHS Appropriations Act requires DHS to fund full integration using US-VISIT funds and report on progress within 90 days. Cargo and container security are also ongoing concerns for CBP. CBP is advancing its cargo security strategy through C-TPAT and CSI initiatives. GAO report highlighted the need for CBP to develop systematic human capital plans, performance measures, and a long-term strategic plan for managing these programs. The House report requested a detailed report from CBP on these initiatives. The House report requested a detailed report from CBP on the implementation plan for CSI, including an integrated network for container security. The conference report directs the Under Secretary of BTS to submit a comprehensive report by February 8, 2005, detailing steps taken to enhance container security and the primary entity responsible for implementing cargo security measures. Questions for Congress include integrating CSI and C-TPAT programs into a wider screening network and maintaining shipment security within the country. The CSI program focuses on securing shipments entering the country and uses a risk assessment tool, the Automated Targeting System (ATS), to prioritize inspections based on risk scores. Congress may consider extending pre-inspection measures to other forms of marine cargo. The GAO recently noted that CBP's targeting strategy lacks comprehensive risk assessments and recognized modeling practices. Questions for Congress include the efficacy of the ATS, integration into a broader screening network, applicability to screening domestically shipped cargo, and pairing with random inspections. CBP uses non-intrusive inspection technologies like gamma-ray and x-ray systems for detecting suspicious cargo. CBP utilizes various technologies for cargo inspection, including VACIS, x-ray systems, radiation detection devices, and portal monitors. Congress may consider integrating these technologies into a broader screening network, improving screening for domestically shipped cargoes, and developing the next generation of cargo inspection technology. Additionally, the privatized Airport Screening Program may see an increase in the number of airports opting out of the federal screener program. The number of airports that may opt-out of the federal screener program after November 18, 2004 is specified in the conference report to the FY2005 DHS Appropriations Act. TSA is required to report on cost savings, airport applications for opt-out, decisions on applications, reasons for non-approval, and results of competitive acquisition for contract screening services. TSA had plans for a more advanced passenger pre-screening system called CAPPS-II, but due to privacy concerns and operational issues, the plans were scrapped. TSA announced the scrapping of plans for CAPPS-II in August 2004 due to privacy concerns and operational problems. Instead, a new program called \"Secure Flight\" was introduced, focusing on identifying terrorists. Congress may need to consider appropriating more funds for TSA to implement the new program. The FY2005 DHS Appropriations Act allocated $35 million for the \"Secure Flight\" program, with an additional $10 million for crew vetting. Concerns were raised about the timeline for implementation and the need to prioritize watchlists. The DHS proposed checking all passengers using Secure Flight as recommended by the 9/11 Commission. The 9/11 Commission Act of 2004 (P.L.108-458) implements recommendations to enhance passenger prescreening for flights, improve 'no-fly' and 'automatic selectee' lists, and address concerns about explosive detection. The FY2005 DHS Appropriations Act allocated funds for EDS/ETD machines for baggage screening and prioritized screening passengers for explosives. TSA was required to develop a plan for enhanced explosive detection equipment as per the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004. The 9/11 Commission recommended expedited installation of in-line baggage screening systems. Congressional debate may focus on funding levels and cost-sharing for in-line EDS integration. Air cargo security is a significant concern addressed in various legislation, requiring TSA to research, develop, and procure certified systems for cargo screening on passenger aircraft. TSA is mandated to triple the percentage of cargo inspected on passenger aircraft. The conferees direct TSA to strengthen air cargo security by enhancing the known shipper program, ensuring compliance of indirect carriers with security directives, and validating security measures of carriers that consolidate freight for passenger and cargo aircraft. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 mandates TSA to develop better technologies for air cargo security, authorize funding for equipment and research, finalize air cargo requirements within eight months, and implement a pilot program using blast-resistant containers for suspicious cargo. Issues for Congress may include debates on new approaches to air cargo security, levels of physical inspection, and improving cargo screening. Attention has shifted to non-aviation transportation security after the 9/11 attacks and the 2004 train bombings in Madrid. The FY2005 DHS Appropriations Act allocated specific funding for TSA and other DHS offices for rail security. TSA is responsible for national transportation security and developing the security plan. The IRTPA requires the development of better technologies for air cargo security and a pilot program for blast-resistant containers. The Secretary of DHS, in conjunction with the Secretary of Transportation, must create a national strategy for transportation security, including identifying and evaluating all transportation assets, setting risk-based priorities, and outlining roles of federal, state, and private entities. The strategy must be delivered to Congress by April 15, 2005. Congressional issues may involve division of security responsibilities and integration with existing security plans. The Coast Guard's Deepwater program is a long-term project to modernize aging ships and aircraft. However, a 2004 RAND Corporation report raised concerns that the program may not provide adequate assets to meet mission requirements. The Coast Guard is reassessing its mission requirements for the Deepwater program due to post-9/11 demands. Existing assets are deteriorating faster than expected, leading to a potential need for earlier procurement of new assets. Concerns have been raised about the condition of legacy assets, with reports noting increased usage and accelerated deterioration. The House Committee is concerned about the Coast Guard's focus on Deepwater procurement over maintaining legacy assets. They require the Coast Guard to report on maintenance plans for legacy vessels and aircraft, including responsible entities and costs. Quarterly reports on legacy maintenance are also mandated. Congress is also looking into the implementation of the Automatic Identification System by the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard is planning to implement a vessel-tracking system called AIS to enhance maritime domain awareness at major ports. Questions remain about the system's coverage and radio frequency availability. The FY2005 DHS Appropriation Act provides $24 million for AIS. Concerns also exist about the Coast Guard's ability to balance homeland security missions with non-homeland security tasks like fisheries enforcement and search and rescue. The Coast Guard increased homeland security operations post-9/11 while reducing other missions. GAO reports noted decreased operating hours for non-homeland security missions, raising concerns about resource allocation. Congress is concerned about staffing levels at border agencies, requiring CBP to submit a comprehensive staffing plan. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act authorizes funding for staffing, subject to appropriations. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act (IRTPA) authorizes funding for staffing of Border Patrol agents and Immigration and Customs Enforcement Inspectors. It stipulates an increase in agents, with 20% assigned to the northern border annually. HSPD-11 is the Administration's response to 9/11 Commission recommendations, reflected in IRTPA provisions. Oversight of IRTPA changes and legislative activity on remaining Commission recommendations are of interest. The 9/11 Commission made recommendations regarding border and transportation security, including combining intelligence, operations, and law enforcement to intercept terrorists. They also suggested integrating the U.S. border security system into a larger network of screening points, and designing a comprehensive screening system led by the Department of Homeland Security. These recommendations are likely to be of interest to the 109th Congress. The Department of Homeland Security, supported by Congress, should quickly implement a biometric entry-exit system integrated with benefits for foreigners staying in the US. The government should enhance terrorist information sharing with allies, raise border security standards, set criteria for birth certificates and IDs, prioritize protection of transportation assets, and develop a plan with budget and funding. The plan for improving airport security should assign roles to relevant authorities and private stakeholders, utilize watchlists maintained by the federal government, require air carriers to supply necessary information, prioritize detecting explosives on passengers, conduct human factor studies to improve screener performance, and set attainable objectives. The President issued Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-11 on August 27, 2004 in response to a 9/11 Commission recommendation. HSPD-11 aims to enhance terrorist-related screening procedures while safeguarding legal rights and privacy, facilitating efficient movement of people and cargo. Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD)-11, issued in response to a 9/11 Commission recommendation, aims to enhance terrorist-related screening procedures while facilitating the movement of people, cargo, and commerce. It requires a comprehensive and coordinated approach in immigration, law enforcement, intelligence, counterintelligence, and protection of critical infrastructure. The directive mandated reports outlining strategies for screening activities and investment plans, with status updates on implementation. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (IRTPA) includes BTS-related provisions that implement 9/11 Commission recommendations for transportation security. Subtitle A of Title IV requires the development of a national strategy, while Subtitle B improves passenger prescreening and watchlist usage without violating privacy or civil liberties. Subtitle B of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 focuses on enhancing passenger and baggage screening for explosives, improving screener performance, and implementing advanced security measures for air travel. Subtitle C addresses air cargo security by developing better technologies and requiring a pilot program for blast-resistant containers. Subtitle D pertains to maritime security and mandates TSA to begin screening cruise ships. Subtitle D of Title IV requires TSA to screen cruise ship passengers and crew against terrorist databases within 180 days and submit maritime-security plans promptly. Title V includes provisions on border protection, immigration, and visas. Subtitle A authorizes pilot programs on the northern and southern borders to test advanced border security technologies. Subtitle B mandates the use of remotely piloted aircraft to surveil the southwest border and increase staffing levels annually from 2006-2010. Subtitle C of Title V focuses on increasing the number of Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, as well as detention bedspaces. Subtitle D addresses smuggling and harboring aliens, while Subtitle E deals with the inadmissibility and deportation of aliens who commit atrocities abroad. Title VII, known as the 9/11 Commission Implementation Act of 2004, contains additional provisions. Subtitle B of Title VII, the 9/11 Commission Implementation Act of 2004, establishes the Human Smuggling and Trafficking Center and a program to counter terrorist travel. It also mandates training improvements for border, consular, and immigration officers to detect terrorist travel indicators. Additionally, it authorizes more consular officers, requires oversight of DHS's terrorist travel responsibilities, and implements a Visa and Passport Security Program. The provisions call for the accelerated deployment of the biometric entry-exit system and mandate individuals entering the U.S. to carry a passport or other citizenship documentation. Subtitle B of Title VII, the 9/11 Commission Implementation Act of 2004, requires individuals entering the U.S. to carry a passport or citizenship document. It also mandates minimum identification standards for domestic flight passengers and increases U.S. immigration presence at foreign airports."
