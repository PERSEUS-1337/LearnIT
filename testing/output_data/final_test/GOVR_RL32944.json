    "content": "Many retirees rely on their former employer for retirement health insurance, but the future of these benefits is uncertain due to employers not being required to offer them. Employers are facing a significant financial commitment with the retirement of the baby boom generation approaching, leading some to reduce or eliminate coverage for retirees. Recent trends show higher beneficiary cost-sharing and a decrease in guaranteed benefits for current workers upon retirement. Retiree health insurance became prevalent after the passage of Medicare in 1965, as a result of the relatively low cost. In the late 1980s, retiree health benefits became more expensive for employers due to rising costs of benefits not covered by Medicare and changing demographics of the retiree population. Employer-sponsored plans often include coverage for prescription drugs, which can be very expensive depending on cost-sharing arrangements. With the implementation of Medicare prescription drug coverage in January 2006, retiree coverage may see further changes as employers gain experience with the interaction between Medicare's benefits. Employer-sponsored retiree health insurance benefits are declining as employers tighten eligibility requirements and shift costs to retirees. Some retirees have turned to the courts to retain coverage, but federal protections for retirees are limited. The demographics of the retiree population explain their high health insurance costs, a growing concern for employers as the baby boom generation retires. Financial difficulties arise for employers offering retiree health insurance due to the group's size, increasing life expectancies, and rising health costs. Without employer-based retiree health insurance, retirees can expect higher costs for coverage in the individual market. The number of retirees has increased significantly since 1965, with 35.6 million people over age 65 in 2002, making up 12.3% of the population. Life expectancy has also risen, with individuals reaching age 65 expected to live beyond age 83. This trend is projected to continue, posing financial challenges for employers offering retiree health benefits. The number of individuals aged 65 and older is projected to double by 2030, comprising 20% of the U.S. population. As people age, they are more likely to have chronic health conditions. Lack of health insurance is linked to declining health in late middle age. Retirees are expected to use more medical services than younger individuals. Elderly individuals have higher out-of-pocket health care costs compared to the total population. Retirees with more health problems struggle to afford health insurance after losing employer-sponsored coverage. A study showed that adults aged 50 to 64 pay more for limited benefits with individual coverage than those covered by employers. Premium costs for individual coverage are higher for older individuals in 15 cities. Employers offer lower premium costs for health insurance compared to individual coverage. Workers have choices regarding retirement age, with some retiring as early as 55. Availability of health insurance benefits influences retirement decisions. Median retirement age is 60 for organizations offering retiree health insurance. The prevalence of retiree health insurance coverage increases with firm size, with larger firms more likely to offer benefits. Regardless of firm size, the percentage of employers offering retiree coverage has been declining since the late 1980s. The percentage of firms offering retiree coverage has been declining since the late 1980s. Kaiser/HRET's 2005 survey found that firms with more than 200 workers offering retiree coverage fell by half between 1988 and 2005. Mercer's 2004 survey showed a steady decline in coverage for over a decade, leveling off more recently. Coverage for pre-Medicare eligibles dropped from 46% in 1993 to 29% in 2001, remaining fairly constant at 28% in 2004. Similarly, coverage for Medicare eligibles decreased from 40% in 1993 to 23% in 2001, dropping slightly to 20% by 2004. Sources of health insurance differ for those under 65 compared to those over 65 covered by Medicare. According to CRS calculations, Medicare only covers about half of medical costs for those 65 and older. Most Medicare beneficiaries have additional health insurance coverage to help with costs not covered by Medicare, such as employee coverage, government coverage, and private supplementary coverage like Medigap. In 2002, less than 8% of Medicare beneficiaries had no additional coverage, while almost 12% enrolled in a Medicare managed care plan. For retirees who do not qualify for Medicare based on disability or End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), insurance options are limited. They may need to purchase insurance in the individual market if they do not have retiree health insurance, insurance through a spouse, or access to Medicaid or other federal programs. Moving from an employer's group plan to an individually purchased product provides guarantees for health insurance coverage under federal law, but there are no federal limits on premium amounts. Individual policies may be subject to underwriting, leading to higher premiums for older and sicker individuals, although some states have laws limiting premium amounts. Employers are managing retiree health insurance costs by increasing retiree premiums, coinsurance, and copayments, as well as the amount enrollees pay for prescription drugs. Some companies have eliminated subsidized retiree health benefits for new employees. Additionally, employers are providing different benefits for current and future retirees to control costs. The Mercer National Survey of Employer-Sponsored Health Plans 2004 study found that about 30% of respondents made similar adjustments. The Mercer National Survey of Employer-Sponsored Health Plans 2004 study revealed that 30% of respondents reduced retiree health benefits by increasing contributions, cost sharing, or limiting coverage. Some employers may not offer coverage to future retirees or require them to pay 100% of premiums. Premium contributions for retirees may be determined by factors like age and years of service. Retiree health benefits are based on age and years of service, with pre-Medicare retirees more likely to pay 100% of their health insurance compared to Medicare counterparts. Employers are not obligated to offer health insurance, and they have the freedom to modify or terminate benefits unless there is a specific promise or contractual agreement in place. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) governs the rules around employer-sponsored health insurance. According to ERISA requirements, employers must provide individuals with a summary plan description (SPD) within 90 days of becoming a plan participant. The SPD can change annually, and even if health benefits are promised to continue, changes like reduced benefits or increased copayments may occur. Vague language in the plan can lead to disputes settled by courts using various documents for clarification. Retirees have sought relief through courts due to limited protections in labor agreements. Courts have ruled in favor of employers when they have the right to modify or terminate a plan. Disputes arise over offering different health benefits to Medicare-eligible retirees, with court cases like Erie County Retirees Ass ' n v. County of Erie addressing this issue. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit found that a county had discriminated against Medicare-eligible retirees in their health insurance coverage based on age. A settlement was reached between the county and the retirees. The EEOC proposed an exception to the ADEA allowing employers to change retiree health benefits when retirees become eligible for Medicare. A federal judge blocked the rule, issuing a permanent injunction against its implementation. The EEOC appealed a ruling regarding a regulation on retiree health benefits. A federal judge granted AARP's petition to keep the injunction in place, pending a decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. The regulation would allow employers to provide different retiree coverage for those over 65 than for those under 65, potentially affecting Medicare-eligible retirees and their prescription drug coverage. The erosion of retiree health insurance coverage is influenced by various factors, including demographics, increasing costs (especially for prescription drugs), and the economy. Employers may face covering a larger number of individuals who are living longer and requiring more healthcare services, leading to potential higher costs or less generous coverage for Medicare-eligible retirees. According to a Kaiser/Hewitt January 2005 survey on retiree health benefits, total costs for employer-sponsored retiree coverage were $20.8 billion in 2004, estimated to increase to $22.9 billion for 2005. Per-person retiree medical costs increased by 8% for pre-Medicare eligibles and 7.8% for Medicare-eligible retirees between 2003 and 2004. Employer costs for providing these benefits have been rising due to an increasing number of retirees and higher per capita costs. According to the Kaiser/HRET 2005 annual survey, health insurance premiums are increasing faster than workers' earnings and overall inflation. Premiums rose by 9.2% from 2004 to 2005, compared to a 2.7% increase in earnings and a 3.5% increase in inflation. Premium increases have been on the rise since the early 1990s, with the largest increases seen in smaller firms. The trend is expected to continue due to rising medical claim costs. In 2004, firms offering retiree coverage with prescription drug coverage were more prevalent among larger firms. On average, 90% of large employers provided prescription drug coverage, with coverage rates decreasing for firms with 500-999 workers and increasing for firms with over 20,000 employees. Prescription drug spending has increased annually, leading employers to implement cost-saving measures such as increased cost-sharing and mail-order prescription refills. Multiple-tier payment arrangements are also being used to lower out-of-pocket costs for generic drugs. Medicare beneficiaries can choose between standard or alternative prescription drug coverage options with different tiers for generic and non-generic drugs. The Part D program, established in 2003, offers coverage with a deductible, coinsurance, and catastrophic limit. Coverage can be obtained through prescription drug plans or Medicare. Employers providing retiree prescription drug coverage may be eligible for a federal subsidy if the coverage is actuarially equivalent to or better than Medicare. Subsidy payments equal 28% of a retiree's prescription drug costs over the deductible up to $5,350. The majority of employers in a 2005 survey indicated they would continue offering prescription drug coverage in 2006, with 79% likely to choose the subsidy. Employers providing retiree prescription drug coverage may receive a federal subsidy. 79% of respondents in a survey indicated they were likely to choose the subsidy, while 10% planned to supplement Medicare coverage, 2% planned to offer their own Part D plan, and 9% planned to discontinue prescription drug coverage. Employers may make changes to their health plans for retirees in the future based on their understanding of the interaction between their coverage and Medicare's prescription drug program. Some employers may find it financially viable to continue coverage if the subsidy covers a significant portion of the cost, while others may no longer be willing to provide any retiree coverage. Employers may no longer feel obligated to provide retiree prescription drug coverage due to Medicare inclusion. They have the option to discontinue coverage and pay Medicare premiums instead. Younger retirees may still rely on employer coverage, while older retirees could be excluded if the EEOC allows. Some firms may have shielded workers from rising health insurance costs in the late 1990s. In the late 1990s, some firms shielded workers from increasing health insurance costs to remain competitive. However, as costs continued to rise and the economy weakened, employers were less able to absorb these costs. Small firms, operating on narrow margins, were particularly affected, leading to a decline in offering health insurance coverage. The FASB established new requirements for reporting non-pension retiree benefits in FAS 106, shifting from pay-as-you-go to accrual accounting. Companies now must account for retiree health insurance costs while employees are working, leading to closer examination of these expenses. Some companies made changes in benefit programs in response to FAS 106, such as eliminating retiree health coverage or setting caps on costs. The Government Accounting Standards Board (GASB) adopted statement No. 43, changing accounting rules for post-employment benefits. GASB 43, similar to FAS 106, requires accrual accounting but offers more flexibility in actuarial methods for calculating post-retirement health costs. The application of GASB 43, like FAS 106, impacts employers' commitment to retirees' health insurance coverage. State and local government workers may have more bargaining power or union protections. Employers set caps on contributions to limit liability under FAS 106 rules, but increasing health insurance costs may lead to exceeding these caps sooner than expected, posing a dilemma for retiree health benefits provision. The Kaiser/Hewitt study shows that many firms have caps on retiree health benefits, with 59% already reaching the cap and 19% expected to hit it in the next three years. Firms facing this dilemma can either raise the caps, leading to higher spending, or adhere to the caps by increasing retiree contributions or reducing benefits. There is also a concern about the convergence of the cap and employer subsidies for prescription drug benefits under Medicare Part D. Some firms may initially qualify for the subsidy but could face challenges as insurance costs rise and exceed the cap. Some firms may exceed their cap on retiree health benefits, leading to a decline in benefits. This could result in them no longer qualifying for the 28% employer subsidy. Companies can reduce post-retirement health costs by adjusting retiree health benefits, such as maintaining prescription drug coverage to receive the subsidy or reducing coverage to lower expenses. Employers can lower expenses by adjusting retiree health benefits, like maintaining prescription drug coverage or reducing coverage. It is important to consider the relationship between retirees' health insurance and insurance for current workers to avoid inequitable outcomes. One policy option discussed is requiring employers to continue providing promised health insurance to retirees, but without a similar requirement for current workers, it could lead to financial difficulties for employers. Under COBRA, employers with 20 or more employees must offer continued health insurance coverage to employees and their families in case of certain events. The former employee is responsible for paying the premium, limited to 100% of the rate charged to current employees plus an additional 2% for administrative costs. Continued coverage for the employee, spouse, and dependent children must be offered for 18 months in case of termination or reduction in hours, including retirement. If a firm offers retiree health insurance coverage, retirees would most likely be covered. If a firm offers retiree health insurance coverage, retirees may decline temporary COBRA coverage in favor of the retiree coverage, which could be less expensive and not limited to 18 months. However, if retiree coverage is discontinued, retirees may not elect COBRA unless due to bankruptcy. COBRA coverage can continue for spouses and dependent children for an additional 36 months after the retiree's death. COBRA is only available as long as the firm offers health insurance to current workers, so bankruptcy may affect its availability. When firms declare bankruptcy and cease operations, retirees and displaced workers may lose health insurance benefits as there are no current workers covered under COBRA. One proposed solution is to expand COBRA to allow younger retirees to continue purchasing coverage from their former employer until they reach age 65. This option has advantages and disadvantages for both retirees and employers, with retirees being able to purchase the same coverage they had as employees. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) does not limit premiums for individuals moving from group to individual market. Older individuals with more health care needs may find individual market coverage expensive, including COBRA premiums. Employers may substitute expanded COBRA coverage for other retiree benefits, reducing their health insurance offerings. Employers argue that the 2% administrative allowance for retiree health insurance does not cover their additional burden. COBRA enrollees may have higher health costs, making the 102% premium cap insufficient. Tax benefits make employer-sponsored health insurance attractive, with premiums not counted as taxable income. Retirees cannot pay premiums with pre-tax dollars like current workers. Expanding tax options for retirees to pay health insurance premiums with pre-tax dollars or receive tax deductions could make premiums more affordable. Tax credits could also be provided to reduce taxes and make premiums more affordable for retirees. Establishing tax credits for health insurance raises complex issues, such as determining if the credit should be the same for all taxpayers or more generous for those with lower incomes. Credits need to be large enough to encourage insurance purchases but could incentivize employers to reduce health insurance commitments. Individuals with tax credits may have limited options for buying insurance, potentially limiting the credit's buying power. Tax-advantaged accounts can be used for unreimbursed medical expenses. The Health Savings Account (HSA) is a personal savings account for qualified medical expenses not covered by insurance. It can only be established with a high deductible insurance plan and has annual contribution limits. Unused portions can be carried over to the next year. Unused portions of HSAs can be carried over from year to year, allowing Medicare-enrolled individuals to use accumulated funds indefinitely for various medical expenses and non-medical expenditures. Expanding opportunities to contribute to HSAs could make these funds even more useful, but concerns exist about their impact on insurance costs and healthcare needs. Expanding opportunities to contribute to HSAs could exacerbate insurance costs for individuals with high healthcare needs. However, HSAs have the potential to be expanded for individuals to help pay for retiree health insurance coverage by allowing larger contributions and catch-up payments for those over 55. The structure of the fund may need to be adjusted to limit withdrawals to medical expenses only. The Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI) calculated potential growth in contributions to HSAs over 10, 20, or 30 years. The Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI) calculated the potential growth in contributions to HSAs over 10, 20, or 30 years. Assuming a 55-year-old individual contributing $2,600 per year, plus catch-up payments, earning 5% interest, and with the maximum allowable contribution indexed for inflation, they could accumulate $44,000 by age 65, $101,000 after 20 years, and $190,000 after 30 years. These figures represent contributions and earned interest, with no withdrawals assumed. A Flexible Spending Account (FSA) is a tax-advantaged account funded by an employee's pre-taxed salary to pay for qualified medical expenses. Health Care FSAs cover expenses like coinsurance, deductibles, dental care, and certain medical supplies. However, funds in an FSA have limitations as they can only be carried over for a limited time after the plan year, and any remaining money is forfeited. Health care FSAs have limitations as funds can only be carried over for a limited time, and any remaining money is forfeited. Retirees are not eligible to contribute to an FSA on a pre-tax basis, but proposals have been discussed to allow retirees to contribute and use FSA funds for health insurance premiums. Medicare Part A is automatically available for individuals aged 65 and older who paid the HI payroll tax. Enrollment in Medicare Part B and Part D is voluntary, with individuals required to pay a monthly premium. Options for younger retirees to purchase Medicare before age 65 have been discussed, with proposals to lower premiums by spreading out costs over time. Once individuals reach age 65, they would pay the standard Medicare Part B premium. For Medicare aged eligibility, individuals would pay the standard Medicare Part B premium plus an additional monthly amount for life to cover earlier coverage costs. A similar arrangement could be developed for Medicare Part D. Federal employees, Members of Congress, annuitants, and qualified dependents can participate in the Federal Employee's Health Benefits program (FEHBP), the largest employer-sponsored health insurance program covering about 8 million individuals. FEHBP offers a choice of nationally available fee-for-service plans, limited geographic HMOs, and high deductible health plans with tax advantaged accounts. The Federal Employee's Health Benefits program (FEHBP) covers basic hospital, surgical, physician, and emergency care, with special benefits including prescription drugs, mental health care, child immunizations, and protection of enrollee out-of-pocket costs for catastrophic health care. Congress has considered proposals to allow small businesses and individuals to buy into FEHBP, similar to the Medicare buy-in. Some proposals suggest allowing small businesses and individuals, whether working or retired, to buy into FEHBP. Plans participating in FEHBP would need to offer the same plans to the new group. Premiums for the new group may be higher due to separate risk pools, but if risk is spread across all new enrollees, premiums could be lower than other options in the market. Expanding Medicare could potentially reduce costs for retirees over 65 with employer-sponsored health insurance. Medicare would act as the primary payer, with employer insurance covering additional costs. This could lead to overall reduced costs for employers covering retirees. Medicare covers about half of a beneficiary's medical expenses, which may increase with the new Part D prescription drug program. However, it does not cover all services, like routine check-ups, and lacks a catastrophic limit on out-of-pocket costs. Enhancements to Medicare could include expanded coverage or a catastrophic limit, but with the recent costly prescription drug benefit, further expansions are unlikely in the near future. Employer-sponsored health insurance can be changed at any time, including raising copayments, increasing deductibles, or even eliminating coverage. Employer mandates could prevent changes to retiree coverage, forcing cost reductions only for workers. Employers may reduce benefits, increase premium contributions, deductibles, or coinsurance for current workers while maintaining a more generous package for retired workers. They could potentially drop coverage for workers but still provide it for retirees. Employers might stop offering retiree health benefits to new hires to avoid future obligations. Unlike pension plans, there is no requirement for employers to pre-fund retiree health benefit plans. The ideal pre-funding vehicle would allow tax deductions for contributions, orderly accumulation of funds, and investment income. Under current law, employers can set up a Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association (VEBA) to pre-fund retiree health benefits for certain employee populations, similar to a defined benefit pension trust. However, investment income on a VEBA for non-union employees is taxed, and contributions may not account for health care inflation. Some employers use a 401(h) sub-account of a pension plan for retiree health benefits pre-funding. Employers can set up a VEBA to pre-fund retiree health benefits, with investment income being tax-free. Utilities and some colleges participate in programs like Emeriti Retirement Health Solutions. Contributions and investment income in a VEBA earn tax-free interest, which can be used at retirement for uncovered health care expenses. Employees who meet retirement eligibility requirements can withdraw tax-free funds from a VEBA for health care expenses, including Medicare premiums. Changing tax laws could expand opportunities for programs like Emeriti Retirement Health Solutions. The 110th Congress has not introduced bills on retiree health insurance, but it is likely to be an active issue. The 109th Congress proposed various legislative solutions to improve retirees' health insurance coverage, including expanding Medicare or FEHBP coverage, prohibiting benefit reductions for retirees, and providing tax relief. Some bills targeted specific groups of retirees, while others aimed to provide comprehensive health insurance for all Americans. The list may be updated in response to congressional activity in the 110th Congress. H.R. 2072 and S. 329 aim to provide access to Medicare benefits for individuals aged 55 to 65 and increase unsecured claims for salaries and wages in bankruptcy to compensate retirees for lost health insurance benefits. H.R. 1322 prohibits profitable employers from changing retiree health benefits and creates a loan guarantee program to help restore benefits. H.R. 218, H.R. 2176, H.R. 2089, H.R. 765, S. 4, S. 160, S. 1573, H.R. 1872, S. 978, H.R. 299, S. 162, H.R. 602, and S. 407 propose various tax deductions, credits, and incentives for health insurance costs and retiree benefits. H.R. 602 and S. 407 aim to restore health care coverage for retired members of the uniformed services. H.R. 322 proposes a refundable credit for military retirees' Medicare Part B premiums. H.R. 994 and S. 484 suggest allowing federal civilian and military retirees to pay health insurance premiums on a pretax basis and deduct TRICARE supplemental premiums. Additionally, H.R. 15, H.R. 676, H.R. 1200, and H.R. 2133 seek to establish national health insurance programs. H.R. 1955, S. 637, and S. 874 aim to establish a national health program administered by the Office of Personnel Management for individuals not federal employees."
