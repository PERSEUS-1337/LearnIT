By pre-training a neural network with a few examples, better results in compressed sensing and image recovery tasks can be achieved compared to untrained networks. Our approach in solving compressed sensing and semantic image recovery problems leads to improved reconstruction with increasing data availability. It requires less than 1% of the data needed for training a generative model. The problem involves recovering an image from linear measurements, which is common in image processing, machine learning, and computer vision domains. Various approaches enforce natural image models to address the ambiguity caused by the underdetermined nature of the system. Recent advancements in generative modeling have allowed deep neural networks to create realistic samples from complex natural image classes. Popular models like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) provide a low-dimensional parameterization of the natural image manifold, outperforming traditional methods in inverse imaging tasks such as compressed sensing and phase retrieval. These models offer theoretical guarantees and have shown superior performance compared to hand-crafted priors. Deep generative models like GANs and VAEs have drawbacks such as requiring large amounts of data to train and suffering from representation errors. On the other hand, untrained neural networks have been shown to act as natural image priors without any learning, exhibiting bias towards specific tasks like denoising and super-resolution. The neural network exhibited a bias towards natural images and required early stopping due to overparameterization. A simpler, underparameterized model was introduced to compress images and solve linear inverse problems without training data. These approaches serve as successful image priors in various inverse problems, aiming to improve upon untrained neural network priors and surpass generative models. The algorithm aims to perform as well as untrained neural networks with no data and improve with more data. It introduces a framework for solving inverse problems using a few examples from the same data distribution as the image of interest. Key contributions include pre-training a neural network with examples, optimizing over the latent space, and refining estimates through a two-step process. The approach involves refining estimates by optimizing over the latent space and network parameters. It shows improvement even with a small number of examples, outperforming untrained neural networks in compressed sensing. The model can learn semantics from a few examples, such as in colorization tasks, and achieves competitive performance with fully trained generative models with just 100 examples. The authors investigate using a small amount of data to solve the compressed sensing problem. They use an untrained neural network as a natural image prior and a learned regularization term for solving the inverse problem. The recovery problem involves noisy linear measurements and a low number of examples drawn from a specific data distribution. The authors propose using a deep neural network to model images, with pre-training using low shot examples to approximate the data distribution. They aim to find optimal parameters and latent codes that solve the inverse problem using a loss function. The authors use a deep neural network for image modeling, pre-training with low shot examples to approximate the data distribution. Optimal parameters and latent codes are found to solve the inverse problem using a loss function. Sampling from a multivariate Gaussian distribution initializes the latent code, refining the solution with fixed network parameters. The final estimate is obtained with refined parameters and latent code. The authors use a deep neural network for image modeling, pre-training with low shot examples to approximate the data distribution. Optimal parameters and latent codes are found to solve the inverse problem using a loss function based on kernel MMD estimation. Comparing two loss functions, they found the 2 loss to work well. They also compare their approach to three different baselines, including an untrained neural network and optimizing the latent space of a trained Wasserstein GAN. The authors used a deep neural network for image modeling, pre-training with low shot examples. They optimized the latent space of a trained Wasserstein GAN and used an image-adaptivity approach. The GAN was trained on a dataset of celebrity images, and low-shot models were trained on subsets of this dataset. They considered the compressed sensing problem and trained models with different loss functions for various numbers of shots. The authors trained deep neural networks on low shot examples using a Wasserstein GAN and image-adaptivity approach. Performance improved with more shots, with MMD trained nets showing steady improvement. Untrained neural networks performed better with higher numbers of measurements due to longer optimization and higher learning rates. The colorization task involves recovering an RGB image from its grayscale version using the ITU-R 601-2 luma transform. Untrained neural networks struggle with this problem, but a model trained with 10 shots using the MMD loss performs well, providing faithful reconstructions comparable to a trained GAN.
