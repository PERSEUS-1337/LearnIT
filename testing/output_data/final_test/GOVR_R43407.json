    "content": "Drought has historically impacted North America, leading to societal disintegration in the Southwest and Mississippi Valley in past centuries. Severe droughts in the 20th century, such as the Dust Bowl era in the 1930s, caused economic disruption and population displacement. The National Drought Mitigation Center monitors drought conditions, categorizing them into five levels. Since 2000, the United States has consistently experienced drought at varying levels, with up to 55% of the nation facing severe drought in September 2012. On average, about 26% of the country's land area experiences at least moderate drought intensity each year. Since 2000, extreme and exceptional drought conditions have affected approximately 6.5% and 1.4% of the nation on average, respectively. In June to October 2011, exceptional drought covered over 9% of the land area, mainly in Texas. By August 2012, extreme and exceptional drought extended over 20% of the country, concentrated in the central United States. Drought is defined as a prolonged period of insufficient precipitation leading to crop damage and yield loss. It is determined by a lack of balance between precipitation, evaporation, and plant transpiration. Drought has a beginning and end, unlike aridity which is permanent in low-rainfall regions. Drought is a prolonged period of insufficient precipitation leading to crop damage and yield loss. It becomes an issue when there is a water supply deficiency, impacting irrigation, municipal and industrial supply, energy production, and other needs. Impacts can include decreased precipitation affecting dryland farming and low reservoir levels reducing allocations for various purposes. Drought impacts various sectors such as farming, irrigation, navigation, energy production, recreation, and wildlife needs. Low reservoir levels and stream flows limit water withdrawals for multiple purposes. Drought can also lead to water quality issues like blue-green algae restrictions in lakes. It can trigger wildfires and heat waves. Drought intensity is assessed using indicators to guide responses at local, state, and federal levels. The U.S. Drought Monitor uses multiple indicators and expert opinions to assess drought conditions. The intensity scheme ranges from D0 to D4, depicting broad-scale conditions but not necessarily local drought circumstances. Drought can vary in severity across regions, as shown in Figure 3, with some areas experiencing extreme drought while others may have less severe conditions. On July 17, 2012, 72% of the United States faced abnormally dry or drought conditions, with 35% experiencing severe drought. In contrast, on May 2, 2017, only 17% of the country had abnormally dry or drought conditions, with 4% classified as severe drought or worse. Drought severity varies by region, as seen in Augusta, GA, and Colorado Springs, CO, during July 2012. Augusta received 60% of its average precipitation, while Colorado Springs received 7.63 inches over six months. In July 2012, Augusta received 13.28 inches of precipitation, only 60% of its average amount, while Colorado Springs typically receives 7.63 inches over the same period. Meteorological drought is region-specific due to varying atmospheric conditions creating precipitation deficiencies. US Drought Monitor maps include color-coded designations and additional information like \"S\" and \"L\" to describe the nature of drought. The \"S\" and \"L\" designations in Figure 2 indicate short-term and long-term effects of drought, respectively. These effects include impacts on agriculture, topsoil moisture, unregulated streamflows, wildfire danger, reservoir levels, groundwater, and lake levels. Some regions in the United States are experiencing both short- and long-term impacts of drought as of early October 2017. The immediate cause of drought is the sinking motion of air, resulting in compressional warming and high pressure that inhibits cloud formation. Regions under the influence of semipermanent high pressure are usually deserts like the Sahara, Kalahari, and Gobi. Prolonged droughts occur when these conditions persist abnormally. Predicting drought is challenging due to various key variables. Scientists aim to improve forecasting abilities for sustained and severe droughts beyond a season or two. Scientists have linked drought in the United States to cooler-than-average sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean, particularly during \"La Ni\u00f1a-like\" conditions. This correlation has been observed in past drought events, including the 1998-2004 western drought and precolonial megadroughts that were more extreme and longer-lasting than any U.S. droughts since 1850. Some modeling studies suggest that the western United States may face higher levels of dryness similar to the 900-1300 A.D. period. The Southwest has been experiencing a drought for the past 16 years, possibly indicating future conditions. The relationship between cooler-than-normal eastern tropical Pacific SSTs and drought in the U.S. is becoming more established. Scientists are studying global linkages among weather systems, such as the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation. Some scientists link La Ni\u00f1a conditions between 1998 and 2002 to severe drought in the southern United States, Southern Europe, and Southwest Asia. Drought reconstructions from tree rings show long-lasting drought in the western states and the East. Severe multi-decadal drought occurred in the American Southwest during the 13th century. Severe droughts in the American Southwest during the 13th century profoundly affected Pueblo society. Tree-ring reconstructions also show severe droughts in the central and lower Mississippi Valley during the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries, possibly leading to societal disintegration. In the 19th century, severe droughts occurred in 1856-1865, 1870-1877, and 1890-1896, with the 1856-1865 drought being the most severe in the Great Plains and Southwest. The 1890-1896 drought coincided with federal efforts to irrigate the arid western states. The Reclamation Act of 1902 aimed to irrigate the arid West. Severe droughts in the 1930s and 1950s were significant, with the 1987-1989 drought also causing widespread impacts. Studies show that droughts in the 19th and 20th centuries were less severe compared to the megadroughts of 900 to 1300 A.D. From 900 to 1300 A.D., \"megadroughts\" occurred with more severe and drier conditions than today. Paleoclimate reconstructions using tree rings have helped estimate the history of flows in western rivers like the Colorado River. The Colorado River basin has seen lower-than-normal flows for the past 16 years, affecting lake levels in Lake Mead and Lake Powell. Comparing previous low-flow periods may indicate future challenges for the Colorado River and its major storage. A 2007 study revealed that Colorado River flows were significantly below normal levels between 1130-1154, with flows less than 84% of the mean annual flow. This period had lower flows compared to the 1953-1977 period, where flows were 87% of normal. The mid-1100s experienced a 25-year period of exceptionally low flow within a generally dry 62-year period. The current dry spell in the Colorado basin may be creating similar low-flow levels to those seen in the mid-1100s. The Colorado River flows since 2000 are approaching historic low levels, with data showing that flows have been below average for most years. This suggests that the dry conditions since 2000 may rival extreme dry periods experienced in medieval times. The Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers, critical for California's water supply and agriculture, are also affected. Paleoclimate reconstructions have shown that low flows in the 1920s and 1930s were among the most extreme in the last millennium. However, the driest single year was in 1580, with flows on the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers significantly lower than in 1924. Despite severe droughts in the 1920s-1930s and more recent ones in the late 20th century, flows in the 1500s were lower due to drought. An outstanding question is whether the 2012-2016 California drought affected river flows similarly to past droughts. The relationship between climate change and future trends in droughts is complex, with very dry areas globally doubling since the 1970s. The 2007 IPCC report noted a decline in very wet areas by about 5% globally, and trends in severe droughts and heavy rains becoming more intense in some regions. The 2012 IPCC report highlighted uncertainties in observed global-scale trends in droughts. The 2012 IPCC report highlighted that global trends in drought duration, intensity, and severity are predominantly decreasing, with strong regional variation. It noted a slight tendency toward less dryness in North America, with an increase in soil moisture and runoff. Severe droughts in the 20th century occurred in the 1930s and 1950s, with the 1930s drought being the most intense. Compared to megadroughts in North America hundreds and thousands of years ago, current trends show a wetting trend. The 2012 IPCC report concluded that recent droughts were not unprecedented compared to past megadroughts in North America. While there is medium confidence in anthropogenic influence on drought patterns globally, regional attribution remains uncertain. Some regions have seen more intense and longer droughts, while others have experienced less frequent or shorter droughts. In 2014, the IPCC released a climate assessment stating that decreases in snowpack are affecting stream flows in North America. Recent droughts, floods, and changes in streamflow conditions cannot yet be attributed to climate change with medium-to-high confidence. It is uncertain if changes in drought frequency in North America are due to human-induced climate change, but they may indicate future conditions. Studies in 2014 and 2016 debated the influence of human activities on the California drought. One study in 2014 claimed that the California drought was the most severe in the state's history over the past 1,200 years. It highlighted the impact of diminished snowpack, streamflows, and reservoir levels, resulting in a unique convergence of reduced surface water supply and increased demand. The combination of lack of precipitation and record high temperatures in 2014 led to extreme dryness, making it stand out as the worst single drought year in at least the last 1,200 years in California. The study in 2014 highlighted the impact of lack of precipitation and record high temperatures in California, leading to extreme dryness. It mentioned the uncertainty of attributing a human influence on rainfall and Pacific storm tracks. The study projected a trend towards higher temperatures and linked future warming to human activities. Another study from 2014 found that the dry conditions were not unprecedented in California's history, with no clear trend towards wetter or drier conditions over the past 120 years. The second study focused on the influence of sea surface temperatures (SSTs) on atmospheric behavior and examined the role of natural atmospheric variability and SST forcing in the California drought. It noted that dry California winters usually result from internal atmospheric variability, but the 2012-2014 winters also had a component of SST forcing. Climate model projections suggest a future increase in California precipitation over midwinter, indicating that the recent severe rainfall deficit may not predict future precipitation changes. However, the study also mentioned that California may face challenges in the future. A 2016 study supported the prediction that California may experience a net surface moisture deficit in the future due to increased evapotranspiration driven by warmer temperatures, offsetting and exceeding the projected increase in precipitation. Another study noted that high temperatures during the California drought were linked to rising greenhouse gases, while low precipitation levels fell within past natural variability. Modeling studies suggested that future greenhouse gas warming could impact atmospheric rivers, crucial for California's precipitation, by the end of the century. By the end of the century, California may experience increased intensity and duration of precipitation, with atmospheric rivers potentially shifting southward. Modeling studies suggest a transition to a more arid climate in the American West, leading to higher evapotranspiration, reduced precipitation, and decreased spring runoff due to increased warming of the atmosphere. Due to increased warming of the atmosphere, more water is held in the atmosphere, leading to potential more frequent and severe droughts and floods. Understanding hydrologic extremes like drought is complicated by factors such as land cover changes, dam operations, and groundwater extraction. Forecasting drought conditions at a regional scale is challenging due to the limitations of current climate models. Despite the difficulty in regional drought forecasting, it is crucial for water managers at all levels to comprehend potential long-term trends for effective water resource management. Water project operations and state water allocations are based on past hydrological trends, which can pose challenges for water managers and users. Droughts can end abruptly with major precipitation events like atmospheric rivers in California. Droughts have significant economic, social, and ecological consequences and are part of natural climate cycles. Technology and scientific understanding help in managing drought impacts. The California drought that lasted from 2012 to 2016 has raised concerns and led to legislative actions. While surface water conditions have improved in 2017, groundwater levels continue to be a lingering issue. The prospect of extended droughts and arid conditions, possibly worsened by human-induced climate change, poses challenges for public policy responses. In response to the California drought, the 114th Congress passed legislation (P.L. 114-322) changing federal water infrastructure management and new water storage development. The 115th Congress is concerned about federal role and funding for new water infrastructure. Winter storms in 2016-2017, known as atmospheric rivers, brought significant precipitation, with studies showing they contribute 30%-50% of West Coast precipitation. Winter storms in January and February 2017 brought record-breaking precipitation levels to California, significantly above the average since 1895. Atmospheric rivers (ARs) were responsible for the increased rainfall, which can alleviate drought conditions but also lead to flooding. Reservoir managers faced challenges in balancing flood control and water supply needs, with Lake Oroville reaching full capacity in March 2017, prompting the release of water over a spillway. Winter storms in early 2017 brought record-breaking precipitation to California, filling reservoirs to 100% capacity. High snowpack levels led to dangerous conditions, forcing evacuations downstream. By April 1, 2017, snowpack was greater than the previous four years combined, providing water for irrigation during the summer. Reservoir levels remained high into the fall, indicating an end to the statewide Drought State of Emergency in April 2017. The multiyear drought in California led to significant impacts on groundwater supplies, with aquifer levels in the Central Valley, particularly in the San Joaquin Valley, dropping during the recent drought. Unlike surface water, groundwater stored in depleted aquifers may take much longer to recover and may never reach pre-drought levels. Groundwater levels in the San Joaquin Valley dropped significantly between 2011 and 2016, leading to land subsidence of up to 22 inches in some areas. Permanent subsidence of nearly 27 feet has occurred in the last century due to groundwater pumping, reducing the aquifer's capacity to store water and causing damage to surface structures. Damage to surface structures, such as canals, levees, roads, and foundations, occurred due to groundwater pumping during the recent drought in Texas from 2011 to late spring 2015. The Delta-Mendota Canal experienced land subsidence, with concrete sides buckling and a bridge dropping low. The drought in Texas was most severe in 2011, with conditions worsening through October of that year. The drought in Texas worsened through October 2011, with 88% of the state experiencing exceptional drought conditions. Drought conditions improved in 2011, but parts of the state were still affected until early 2015. Texas state climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon stated that 2011 may have been the worst one-year drought on record for Texas. The effects of abnormally low precipitation led to a significant increase in the June-August average temperature in Texas, reaching 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit higher than any summer since 1895. Drought conditions in the Midcontinent from 2012-2013 affected 70% of the United States, with regions of extreme and exceptional drought clustered across the Midwest, Great Plains, Southwest, and Southeast, particularly Georgia in 2012. Texas, Florida, and Georgia experienced exceptional drought conditions in early 2012. The drought in the United States from 2012-2013 intensified in the center of the country, affecting the agricultural heartland. Exceptional drought conditions persisted over nearly 6% of the contiguous United States during this period. The extent, timing, and features of areas affected by drought varied, impacting dryland and irrigated farm regions differently. The 2012-2013 drought in the United States intensified in the agricultural heartland, affecting dryland and irrigated farm regions differently. The severity of the drought raised questions about its origin, whether it was within the range of natural variability or linked to longer-term changes in the Earth's climate system. The 2012 intense drought in the midcontinent region was a discrete extreme event, developing suddenly with near-normal precipitation during winter and spring 2012 over the Great Plains. The drought resulted from an extreme lack of precipitation during the summer months, making 2012 the driest summer in the observed historical record for the region. The 2012 summer drought in the Great Plains was a \"climate surprise\" as rains abruptly stopped in May and did not return for the summer. The anomaly was not attributed to rising sea surface temperatures or changes in greenhouse gases. Seasonal forecasts did not predict the drought, but retrospective reports indicated a shift towards warmer and drier conditions in the region prior to 2012. The 2012 Great Plains drought was a climate surprise with no clear attribution to rising sea surface temperatures or greenhouse gases. A report suggested that natural decadal variability likely increased the probability of such a severe drought, concluding that the event resulted mostly from natural weather variations."
