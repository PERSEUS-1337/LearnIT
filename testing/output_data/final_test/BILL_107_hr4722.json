    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Lake Erie Western Basin International Wildlife Refuge Establishment Act\". The western basin of Lake Erie is crucial for the economic and environmental future of the United States. Efforts have been made over the past three decades to restore water quality and fisheries in the Great Lakes ecosystem, with a shift towards a holistic ecosystem approach that includes shoreline areas. The western basin of Lake Erie is a vital part of the Great Lakes ecosystem, receiving most of its flow from the Detroit River. It supports diverse populations of fish, wildlife, and plants, with coastal wetlands hosting the largest variety of species in the Great Lakes region. The moderate climate and southern latitude of Lake Erie allow for the presence of species not found in the northern Great Lakes. The western basin of Lake Erie is home to over 300 plant species, including 37 significant species, in its aquatic and wetland habitats. This area, from the Lower Detroit River to Sandusky Bay, contains the largest concentration of marshes in Lake Erie, providing important habitat for various bird species such as waterfowl, wading birds, shore birds, gulls, terns, raptors, and perching birds. The western basin wetlands of Lake Erie are crucial for migration, nesting, and feeding of various bird species. Diving ducks, sea ducks, and other birds make a stopover in the area during their migration. Lake Erie is internationally recognized for its Ottawa and Cedar Point National Wildlife Refuges. The lake is also famous for walleye, perch, and bass fishing, recreational boating, birding, photography, and duck hunting, contributing significantly to tourism and the economy. The western basin of Lake Erie in Ohio is home to a renowned walleye fishery, driving a $2 billion sport fishing industry. Coastal wetlands in the area have been under pressure for 150 years, with only approximately 5,000 hectares remaining today. This has led to a significant reduction in wetland acreage, impacting the ecosystem and wildlife in the region. Coastal wetlands along the Michigan shoreline have decreased by 62% between 1916 and the early 1970s, with significant impact from the development of Monroe city. Only about 100 hectares remain unaltered today, compared to 70 years ago when marshes were 10 times larger. Remaining wetlands have been degraded by various stressors like sediments, nutrients, contaminants, and exotic species. Protective beach systems have eroded, exacerbating shoreline erosion and affecting breeding grounds. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n(1) \"Refuge\" refers to the Lake Erie Western Basin International Wildlife Refuge established by section 5.\n(2) \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior.\n(3) \"Lake Erie Western Basin\" refers to lands and waters within the area described in section 5(a).\n\nSEC. 4. PURPOSES. The Lake Erie Western Basin International Wildlife Refuge is established to protect and enhance habitats, assist in conservation efforts, and facilitate partnerships for wildlife restoration in the western basin of Lake Erie. The Lake Erie Western Basin International Wildlife Refuge collaborates with various entities to promote public awareness and advance goals outlined in the Great Lakes Strategy 2002. The Lake Erie Western Basin International Wildlife Refuge collaborates with the Forest Service, Great Lakes Fishery Commission, State governments, and tribal governments to protect and restore the Great Lakes basin ecosystem. Establishment of Refuge. The Lake Erie Western Basin International Wildlife Refuge is established, including lands and waters in Michigan from Sterling State Park to Sandusky Bay. Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge and Cedar Point National Wildlife Refuge are now part of this new refuge. The Secretary has the authority to revise boundaries of the Erie Western Basin International Wildlife Refuge to facilitate property acquisition. They can acquire lands and waters within the Refuge through donation, purchase, or exchange, ensuring all acquisitions are voluntary. Federal properties under other agencies within the Refuge can be transferred with consent. The Secretary can transfer federal properties to the administrative jurisdiction for the purposes of the Act. The Secretary will conduct a study of the Maumee River habitat and submit a report to Congress within 18 months. SEC. 6. ADMINISTRATION. The Secretary administers federally owned lands within the Refuge in accordance with relevant laws. Priority uses include hunting, fishing, wildlife observation, and environmental education. The Secretary can enter cooperative agreements for managing non-federal lands within the Refuge and promote public awareness of resources. Encouragement is given for Ohio to use existing greenway authority for funding trails in the Refuge."
