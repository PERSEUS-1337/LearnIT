    "content": "The Act titled \"Jackson Multi-Agency Campus Act of 1999\" is established for the purpose of creating a multi-agency campus. The Act titled \"Jackson Multi-Agency Campus Act of 1999\" establishes a multi-agency campus in Jackson, Wyoming, involving various government agencies, commissions, and organizations. The Act aims to establish a multi-agency campus in Jackson, Wyoming to centralize administrative offices, promote communication, reduce costs, and better serve the public. Federal agencies are authorized to develop and maintain the Project in cooperation with other entities, providing necessary resources and agreements for planning, design, construction, operation, and maintenance. The Project involves construction, operation, maintenance, and modifications of elements. It includes conveying federally owned land to the town of Jackson and the Game and Fish Commission of Wyoming in exchange for construction and land use. Certain reversionary interests of the United States will be relinquished to facilitate these transactions. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines key terms such as \"Commission\" as the Game and Fish Commission of Wyoming, \"construction cost\" as costs for building improvements to Federal standards, \"Federal parcel\" as a 15.3-acre land on the Bridger-Teton National Forest map. The \"master plan\" refers to the Conceptual Master Plan dated July 14, 1998, for a proposed multi-agency campus construction project in Jackson, Wyoming. The project aims to provide administrative, interpretive, educational, and other facilities in accordance with the plan. The \"master plan\" outlines a proposed multi-agency campus construction project in Jackson, Wyoming, to provide interpretive, educational, and other facilities for visitors to the greater Yellowstone area. The terms \"Secretary,\" \"State parcel,\" and \"town\" are defined within the plan. A multi-agency campus project is proposed in Jackson, Wyoming to provide facilities for visitors to the greater Yellowstone area. The town may offer to construct an administrative facility for the Bridger-Teton National Forest as part of the Project. If the offer is made within 5 years, the Secretary will convey Federal land to the town in exchange for the completed facility. The Commission may also offer to convey a portion of the State parcel for the construction of an administrative facility for the forest. The Secretary will convey Federal land to the town in exchange for the completed administrative facility for the Bridger-Teton National Forest, as part of the Project. The Secretary will convey approximately 9.3 acres to the town and approximately 3.2 acres to the Commission in exchange for specified considerations. Additionally, the United States will relinquish all reversionary interests in the State parcel as part of the exchange. The fair market and improvement values of the land to be exchanged under this Act shall be determined by appraisals acceptable to the Secretary, in accordance with federal standards. Each appraisal report must adhere to Federal standards and not consider any reversionary interests held by the United States in the State parcel. The Secretary will adjust the acreage of Federal land conveyed to the town based on whether the value is greater or less than the construction costs for the administrative facility. If the value is greater, the acreage will be reduced to closely match the costs. If the value is less, additional Federal land may be conveyed to the town. The Secretary may adjust the acreage of Federal land conveyed to the town to match construction costs. The value of Federal land must equal the value of the State parcel, and boundaries can be adjusted for equalization. Cash payments can also be made to equalize values. The Secretary can adjust the acreage of Federal land conveyed to the town to match construction costs, in accordance with the Federal Land Policy and Management Act. If values cannot be equalized by adjusting parcel sizes or conveying additional land without compromising the Project design, other methods such as cash payments can be used for equalization. SEC. 7. ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS. Construction of facilities on Federal land within the Project boundaries will be supervised and managed by the town to approved standards. The town, including contractors, will have access to the land for construction purposes. Land acquired by the United States will be governed by national forest site laws. No construction is allowed in wetland areas after the conveyance of Federal land. Deeds and conveyance documents executed by the Secretary in carrying out the Act must include reservations to prevent wetland development on Federal parcels."
