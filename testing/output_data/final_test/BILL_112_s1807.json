    "content": "The Energy Research and Development Coordination Act of 2011 is cited as the short title. It amends the Federal Nonnuclear Energy Research and Development Act of 1974 to include comprehensive planning and programming. The Energy Research and Development Coordination Act of 2011 requires the Secretary, in consultation with the National Energy Research Coordination Council, to submit a comprehensive plan for energy research, development, and demonstration programs to Congress annually. The plan must be based on the most recent Quadrennial Energy Review and may consider recent energy developments. The Energy Research and Development Coordination Act of 2011 mandates an annual revision of a comprehensive plan for energy research, development, and demonstration programs. The plan aims to address energy supply, transmission, and environmental issues in the immediate, medium, and long term. The Energy Research and Development Coordination Act of 2011 requires the Secretary of Energy to develop and submit a detailed energy research, development, and demonstration program to Congress annually. This program will implement aspects of the comprehensive plan for addressing energy supply, transmission, and environmental issues. The Energy Research and Development Coordination Act of 2011 is amended to include changes in subsections (a) and (b), such as updating terminology and objectives. Subsection (c) is also revised regarding administration. The Energy Research and Development Coordination Act of 2011 is amended to include changes in terminology and objectives, as well as revisions in administration. Additionally, the Federal Nonnuclear Energy Research and Development Act of 1974 is amended to address coordination and reduction of duplication in energy research, development, and demonstration activities. The Energy Research and Development Coordination Act of 2011 is amended to include definitions for terms like annual budget submission, Chairpersons, comprehensive plan, Council, and energy program agency. These definitions clarify the roles and responsibilities within the energy research, development, and demonstration activities. The Energy Research and Development Coordination Act of 2011 defines an 'agency' as an executive department or agency with an annual expenditure budget for energy research exceeding $10,000,000. It establishes a National Energy Research Coordination Council within the Department to coordinate energy research activities. The Council is composed of the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Secretary, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and others. The Energy Research and Development Coordination Act of 2011 establishes a National Energy Research Coordination Council within the Department to coordinate energy research activities. The Council includes the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the head of any energy program agency, and other designated officers or employees. The Council, in coordination with the Council, establishes a consolidated budget proposal for each fiscal year to implement the comprehensive plan. The Energy Research and Development Coordination Act of 2011 establishes a National Energy Research Coordination Council to coordinate energy research activities. The Council provides budget guidance, coordination, and review for energy research, development, and demonstration budget requests submitted to the Office of Management and Budget. Each energy program agency must ensure timely budget development and submission to the Chairpersons of energy research, development, and demonstration budget requests. The Chairpersons, in consultation with the Council, establish objectives, priorities, and review the implementation of the comprehensive plan for energy research, development, and demonstration functions. They make recommendations to the President regarding changes in organization, management, and budgets of energy program agencies to implement policies and priorities. The Secretary may arrange for the National Academy of Sciences to prepare reports evaluating and providing recommendations on specific areas of energy research, development, and demonstration, including fundamental science and engineering research supporting those areas. The Secretary shall ensure that the Council, which is physically separate from the Department's headquarters, has necessary administrative support and personnel to carry out its functions. The budget of the Council is submitted separately from the Department's budget to Congress. The Chairpersons have the authority to select and appoint officers and employees for the Council, who will be responsible to them and the Executive Director. The Chairpersons have the authority to appoint officers and employees for the Council, who are not under the control of other Department or Office of Science and Technology Policy officials. Dual office holding is prohibited within the Council and other positions outside it. The effectiveness of the Council will be reviewed by the GAO every 3 years. Every 3 years, the Comptroller General of the United States will provide Congress with a management assessment of the Council. This assessment will evaluate the Council's staffing, coordination of policy and budget information, and alignment of the energy research budget to avoid duplication of programs."
