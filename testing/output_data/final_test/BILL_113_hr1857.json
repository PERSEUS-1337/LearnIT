    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Student-to-School Nurse Ratio Improvement Act of 2013\". It includes findings related to school nurse ratios. The American Academy of Pediatrics highlights the vital role of school nurses in providing comprehensive health services to children, promoting wellness, and supporting academic achievement. School nurses also conduct early intervention services to address barriers to learning. Recent national data shows that 45% of public schools have a full-time school nurse, while 30% have a part-time nurse. Without a registered nurse, responsibilities fall on unprepared staff. 15-18% of students have chronic health conditions. The percentage of children in special education with health impairments increased by 60% from 2002 to 2008. School nurses play a crucial role in managing children's complex medical conditions. The prevalence of pre-diabetes and diabetes among adolescents aged 12 to 19 years old increased from 9% to 23% between 1999 and 2008. Additionally, more than 30% of children aged 2 to 19 years old are obese or overweight, and over 10 million children in the US had asthma in 2008. The prevalence of food allergies among children under 18 increased by 19% from 1997 to 2007. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, school nurses are actively involved in addressing students' social and emotional issues, spending 32% of their time on mental health services. In 2011, 9.7% of children under 19 were without health insurance, impacting their educational outcomes. Children without health coverage face worse outcomes, missing more school days and experiencing more severe illnesses. Over 1.6 million homeless children in the US suffer from increased health issues and developmental challenges due to their living situation. School nurses play a crucial role in providing healthcare to vulnerable children. Access to a registered nurse in school reduces the number of school days lost to communicable diseases. Access to a school nurse increases immunization rates and saves school personnel time. A balanced student-to-school nurse ratio improves student outcomes. Reducing student-to-school nurse ratios is essential for improving student outcomes and increasing access to healthcare services. Demonstration grants may be provided to eligible local educational agencies to reduce student-to-school nurse ratios in public schools. To receive a grant, agencies must submit an application with information on current ratios, student health levels, and nurse workloads. The Secretary of Education gives priority to high-need local educational agencies for grants to reduce student-to-school nurse ratios in public schools. Recipients may need to provide matching funds and must submit a report within 24 months of receiving the grant. The Secretary of Education prioritizes high-need local educational agencies for grants to reduce student-to-school nurse ratios in public schools. A report on the program's effectiveness in reducing ratios and the impact on student health and learning must be submitted to Congress. Definitions for terms like \"elementary school\" and \"secondary school\" are provided in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The curr_chunk defines terms related to nursing care in schools, such as acuity and workload, as well as criteria for eligible and high-need local educational agencies. The curr_chunk defines terms related to nursing care in schools and authorizes appropriations for fiscal years 2014 through 2018."
