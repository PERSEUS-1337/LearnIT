    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Teen Pregnancy Prevention, Responsibility, and Opportunity Act of 2005\". The United States has the highest teen-pregnancy rate and birth rate in the western industrialized world, costing $7 billion annually. About one-third of young women in America become pregnant before age 20, leading to serious consequences such as dropping out of high school and living in poverty. Sons of teen mothers are more likely to end up in prison, while daughters are more likely to become teen mothers themselves. Teens in disadvantaged circumstances are more prone to risky behaviors. Teens in disadvantaged circumstances are more likely to engage in risky behavior and have a child during adolescence. Strong emotional attachments to parents delay sexual activity. Lack of communication with parents is a common reason for teenage pregnancy. Unsupervised hours increase the likelihood of teens having sex for the first time. After-school programs reduce risky behavior by providing alternative activities. After-school programs involving teens in activities that provide alternatives to sex, such as sports, help prevent teen pregnancy by promoting good decision-making skills, health education, and positive role models in a supervised setting. Eight in 10 girls and six in 10 boys express regret about having sex too early. SEC. 3. EDUCATION PROGRAM FOR PREVENTING TEEN PREGNANCIES. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may grant funds to local educational agencies, public health agencies, and nonprofit entities for projects educating on preventing teen pregnancies. Preference is given to projects in communities with high teen pregnancy rates. Grants are contingent on providing age-appropriate pregnancy prevention information. The project on pregnancy prevention will prioritize preventing teen pregnancies by encouraging teens to delay sexual activity, providing educational services for sexually active teens, educating young men and women about parenting responsibilities, helping parents communicate with teens about sexuality, and teaching responsible decision-making. Matching funds are available for project costs. Matching funds are required for the project on pregnancy prevention, with non-Federal contributions of at least 25% of the costs. Contributions can be in cash or in kind, excluding any Federal assistance. The grant recipient must maintain non-Federal expenditures for authorized activities at a level equal to or higher than the previous fiscal year. The Secretary will establish evaluation criteria for projects, requiring the applicant to conduct evaluations and submit reports on the results.
