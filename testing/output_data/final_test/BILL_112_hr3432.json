    "content": "The \"Rural Economic Vitalization Act\" includes a table of contents with sections on findings, definitions, a rural vitalization program, and the effect of waiving grazing permits or leases. Congress finds that the use of Federal lands for commercial livestock grazing is increasingly difficult due to conflicts with other land uses and mandated goals. Factors such as sustained drought and industry changes have made grazing permits stranded investments for many permittees. Resolving conflicts often requires extensive range developments and intensive herd management. The Federal grazing program is costly and unsustainable, with conflicts arising from factors like drought and industry changes. Many permittees are willing to end commercial livestock grazing on Federal lands in exchange for compensation. Compensating permittees and lessees who relinquish their grazing permit or lease would help revitalize rural America by providing economic options for restructuring ranch operations, starting new businesses, or retiring securely. Paying reasonable compensation for relinquishing permits or leases can prevent the need to sell or subdivide private lands. The curr_chunk is a section titled \"SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\" This section likely provides definitions for terms used in the text. In this Act, definitions are provided for terms related to grazing on Federal lands, such as \"animal unit month,\" \"commercial livestock grazing,\" \"grazing allotment,\" and \"grazing permit or lease.\" These terms clarify the use of Federal lands for domestic livestock grazing purposes. The terms \"permittee or lessee\" refer to a livestock operator with a valid grazing permit or lease. \"Range developments\" include structures for grazing but not water diversions. \"Secretaries\" means the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Interior. \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Agriculture or Interior. The terms \"permittee or lessee\" refer to a livestock operator with a valid grazing permit or lease, as determined by the Secretary of Agriculture or the Secretary of the Interior. SEC. 4. RURAL VITALIZATION PROGRAM. The Secretary shall accept any grazing permit or lease waived by a permittee or lessee, terminate the acquired permit or lease, and ensure no new permit or lease is issued for the grazing allotment, leading to a permanent end to livestock grazing. The Secretary will reduce commercial livestock grazing levels on waived grazing permits or leases to reflect the waiver. A permanent reduction in grazing levels will be enforced, with a limit of 100 permits and leases accepted per year on a first come, first served basis. Effect of waiver of grazing permit or lease: A permanent reduction in grazing levels will be enforced for waived permits or leases, limited to 100 accepted per year on a first come, first served basis. (a) Effect on Range Developments: A permittee or lessee who waives a grazing permit or lease under section 4 forfeits any claim to range developments on the associated grazing allotment. \n(b) Securing Retired Allotments: The Secretary must ensure that grazing allotments retired from grazing are protected from unauthorized livestock grazing. \n(c) Relation to Other Authority: This Act does not impact the Secretary's authority to modify or terminate grazing permits or leases under other laws. \n(d) Relation to Valid Existing Rights: This Act does not affect existing water rights or other valid rights held by the United States or Indian tribes. This Act does not affect existing water rights or other valid existing rights held by the United States, Indian tribe, State, county, municipality, or private individual, partnership, or corporation."
