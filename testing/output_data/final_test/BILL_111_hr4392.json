Congress finds that the demand for higher education in Africa is rapidly increasing, surpassing current infrastructure and staffing capabilities. Africa faces substantial challenges in higher education with important social, economic, and stability dimensions. Despite rising enrollments, sub-Saharan Africa's gross enrollment ratio is only 5 percent compared to higher percentages in other regions. Institutions in Africa lack sufficient staff, with only about 70 percent of the required personnel. Staff development and retention are crucial for higher education programming. In 2005, 28% of African University graduates completed degrees in STEM fields. African higher education institutions collaborate with international partners to address development challenges. Higher education in Africa has expanded to provide more opportunities for advanced education. Africa has doubled its public universities from 100 to 200 since 1990. The number of universities in Africa has doubled from around 100 to 200 between 1990 and 2007, with private tertiary institutions increasing from 24 to approximately 468 during the same period. Historically, sub-Saharan Africa had centers of excellence in higher education like Makerere University, Kenyatta University, Cheik Anta Diop University, and the University of Ibadan, producing highly valued scholars and professionals. These universities are considered \"centres of excellence\" with positive impacts on other institutions in their regions, making significant progress nationally and internationally. Increasing rates of higher education in developing countries are crucial for long-term economic growth, stability, and poverty reduction. A 1-year increase in tertiary education stock in Africa could raise GDP per capita by 12.2%, leading to a 3% income boost after 5 years. Higher education levels are linked to increased entrepreneurial activity and job creation. Higher education enrollment shows a positive correlation with various benefits. Higher education enrollment rates in developing countries correlate with governance indicators like absence of corruption, rule of law, ethnic tensions, bureaucratic quality, and contract repudiation risk. Skilled, educated Africans are crucial for development in areas like poverty alleviation, economic growth, disease control, governance, and human rights. Exchange programs bringing Africans to developed countries for training are essential. Exchange programs bringing Africans to developed countries for training are crucial for building intellectual capacity in Africa, but alone they will not have a transformational effect on African higher education institutions. The Sense of Congress is outlined in Section 3. The Sense of Congress emphasizes the importance of supporting education in sub-Saharan Africa, increasing assistance for qualified teachers and higher education access, promoting partnerships between US and African universities, and recognizing the role of the African Diaspora in enhancing African educational capacity.
