    "title": "SB 734",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature amends Section 21178 of the Public Resources Code to emphasize the importance of identifying and mitigating environmental impacts of development projects under the California Environmental Quality Act. This act ensures public participation in reviewing and commenting on projects, especially those replacing old facilities with new environmentally beneficial ones. These privately financed projects will create thousands of jobs and implement innovative measures to reduce environmental impacts, including traffic and air pollution. They will also fully mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, setting a national standard for pollution reduction. The chapter aims to streamline projects under the California Environmental Quality Act that create jobs and have environmental benefits. The Governor must certify projects as environmental leadership development projects to be eligible for streamlining. Projects must involve a minimum investment of $100 million in California to qualify. The project aims to create high-wage, skilled jobs for Californians, reduce unemployment, and pay prevailing wages to construction workers. Contractors and subcontractors must adhere to prevailing wage requirements for all construction workers involved in the project. The Labor Commissioner can enforce prevailing wage obligations for contractors and subcontractors through civil assessments or by underpaid workers filing complaints or civil actions. Liquidated damages may be imposed on those found liable for underpayment of wages. The project labor agreement requires payment of prevailing wages to all construction workers and enforces this through arbitration. The project must not result in any additional greenhouse gas emissions, as determined by the State Air Resources Board. The project applicant must comply with all mitigation measures required for project certification, with enforceable conditions. They also agree to cover Court of Appeal costs and appoint a special master if needed. The project applicant must pay for the administrative record preparation. A multifamily residential project must offer unbundled parking, except for affordable units. Changes are made to Section 21189.1 of the Public Resources Code. Section 21189.1 of the Public Resources Code is amended to state that if a lead agency fails to approve a project certified by the Governor before January 1, 2019, the certification expires. Section 21189.3 specifies that this chapter is effective until January 1, 2019, and will be repealed unless extended by a later statute. No reimbursement is required for this act as local agencies have the authority to cover mandated costs. This act is an urgency statute to reauthorize the Governor to certify projects as environmental leadership development projects in 2016 without a gap in authorization."
