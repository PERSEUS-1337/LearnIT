    "content": "The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized the Clean Power Plan (CPP) in 2015 to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from electricity generating units. The CPP aims to reduce CO2 emissions by 32% in the electric power sector by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. The rule has sparked controversy and received over 4.2 million public comments. Members of Congress have attempted to block its implementation. The EPA's Clean Power Plan (CPP) final rule faced opposition from Congress and legal challenges, leading to a stay by the Supreme Court. This has delayed the CPP deadlines and could impact its implementation. The EPA's final rule for the Clean Power Plan faced opposition and legal challenges, leading to a stay by the Supreme Court, delaying deadlines and impacting implementation. The report highlights differences between the final and proposed rules but does not provide a legal analysis. For more comprehensive analysis and detailed discussions, refer to CRS reports on the Clean Power Plan. Under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act (CAA), states must establish performance standards reflecting the \"best system of emission reduction\" determined by the EPA Administrator. States need to submit initial or final plans by September 6, 2016. Individual or joint state plans are acceptable. The EPA requires states to submit initial or final plans by September 6, 2016, under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act. States can choose between individual or multi-state plans, with the option to seek extensions. The final rule offers two plan options: an \"emission standards\" approach or a \"state measures\" approach, allowing states to implement emission rate standards directly at affected sources. The state measures approach under the EPA's Clean Air Act allows states to achieve CO2 emission standards through a combination of federally enforceable standards and state-specific elements like renewable energy requirements. This approach requires the inclusion of federally enforceable standards as a backup. States using this approach must set a mass-based target for certainty in emission reductions, and multi-state systems are permitted. EPA cannot force states to submit a plan under CAA Section 111(d). EPA cannot compel a state to submit a state plan under CAA Section 111(d). If a state fails to submit a satisfactory plan, EPA will prescribe a federal implementation plan (FIP). EPA proposed two options for a FIP: rate-based trading program and mass-based trading program. The final rule is pending. FIP would require compliance by individual EGUs and establish a trading program to meet emission limits. The federal plan's stringency would match national CO2 emission performance rates in the CPP. EPA's final rule directs states to establish interim targets. The EPA's final rule for the CPP sets interim targets for states to achieve between 2022 and 2029, with a gradual application of BSER and \"glide paths\" for reductions in three time periods. The rule establishes uniform national CO2 emission performance rates and gives states an additional two years before reductions are necessary. The EPA's final rule for the CPP sets interim targets for states to achieve between 2022 and 2029, with uniform national CO2 emission performance rates for fossil-fuel-fired electric steam generating units and stationary combustion turbines. State-specific emission rate targets and mass-based targets are established, applying to the state's total electricity portfolio. The targets differ from those in the proposed rule, with each state having a 2012 baseline, a 2030 emission rate target, and an implied percentage reduction. The final rule for the CPP sets interim targets for states between 2022 and 2029, with uniform national CO2 emission rates for power plants. Each state has a 2012 baseline, a 2030 emission rate target, and a required percentage reduction. The rule implies varying reduction requirements for different states compared to the proposed rule. Figure 1 compares state-specific emission rate targets in 2030 with baselines in 2012, showing the reduction requirements. EPA did not establish mass-based targets. EPA set emission rate goals for states with varying reduction requirements under the final rule for the CPP. Vermont and the District of Columbia were exempted as they do not have affected EGUs. Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, and Puerto Rico are not required to submit state plans yet due to lack of information. EPA will address their requirements later. Emission rate targets were also established for Indian country, giving tribes the option to submit their plans. EPA will step in if a tribe chooses not to submit a plan. EPA established emission rate goals for states under the final rule for the CPP. States may need to submit plans if deemed necessary by EPA. The methodology used for setting CO2 emission performance standards differed from the proposed rule. EPA divided states into regions to determine emission rates for affected sources. EPA divided states into three regions to calculate CO2 emissions and electricity generation data. The final rule for the CPP included three building blocks: heat rate improvements for coal-fired EGUs, increased NGCC generation displacing steam units, and projected annual increases in renewable energy generation. In its final rule, EPA made changes to the components of the building blocks for the Clean Power Plan. This included eliminating building block 4 and modifying building blocks 1-3. The renewable energy generation assumptions saw a significant increase in the final rule compared to the proposed rule. Additionally, region-specific improvements for coal-fired plant efficiency and changes in natural gas generation assumptions were also made. EPA's building block application resulted in annual CO2 emission performance rates for different types of power plants. The EPA compared annual CO2 emission performance rates for steam and NGCC units in each region to determine the national standard. State-specific emission rate targets were calculated based on each state's baseline fossil fuel generation mix. For example, Arizona's 2030 emission rate target was calculated using the state's 2012 generation mix. EPA used these targets to calculate state-specific emission rates. The EPA calculated state-specific emission rate targets based on each state's baseline fossil fuel generation mix. These targets were used to determine mass-based targets for each state by considering renewable energy generation and excess CO2 emissions. Some states' 2030 mass-based targets are higher than their 2012 emission baselines. EPA made state-specific adjustments in the final rule to address concerns raised by states and stakeholders. Significant adjustments were made in states with a high percentage of hydropower generation due to 2012 being an outlier year for snowpack. EPA used 2012 as the baseline year for emission rate and mass-based target calculations. The EPA made state-specific adjustments in the final rule to address concerns raised by states and stakeholders, particularly in states with a high percentage of hydropower generation. The adjustments were due to 2012 being an outlier year for snowpack, resulting in a decrease in fossil fuel generation. Renewable energy played a significant role in the proposed and final rule, with an increase in EPA's analysis of its contribution to the nation's electricity portfolio by 2030. In the final rule, non-hydro renewable energy generation is projected to increase by 9% in 2030, with lower cost estimates for project installation. A new voluntary program incentivizes states to develop renewable energy projects in 2020 and 2021. EPA's final rule does not include demand-side energy efficiency improvements in its emission rate methodology. In the final rule, EPA removed demand-side energy efficiency improvements from its emission rate methodology, citing that it targets consumer-oriented behavior and demand for goods, which is outside the paradigm of section 111 of the Clean Air Act. The impacts of building block 4 on emission rate targets varied by state, with more pronounced effects in states relying on hydroelectric and nuclear power. The final rule by EPA removed demand-side energy efficiency improvements from its emission rate methodology, focusing on consumer behavior and reducing electricity production. States can still use energy efficiency programs to meet targets. The rule also excludes at-risk nuclear power from emission rate calculations, providing incentives for early investments in low-income communities. EPA's final rule excludes under-construction nuclear power capacity from emission rate calculations, potentially impacting emission rate targets for states like Georgia, South Carolina, and Tennessee. This decision could pose challenges for these states in achieving their emission rate goals. EPA's final rule allows for the use of \"qualified biomass\" to help states meet emission rate or mass-based targets, with additional accounting and reporting requirements. Waste-derived biogenic feedstocks and certain industrial byproduct feedstocks are acknowledged for their CO2 and climate policy benefits. The EPA's Clean Energy Incentive Program (CEIP) complements the CPP by promoting early CO2 emissions reductions. The CEIP awards emission rate credits or allowances for energy efficiency, solar projects in low-income communities, and renewable energy projects in participating states. The program aims to provide additional details, clarify elements, and adjust eligibility requirements. The CEIP credits are awarded for renewable energy projects in participating states, with the form of emission rate credits or allowances. These credits can be sold or used by emission sources to comply with state-specific requirements. Projects in low-income communities receive double credits for solar power or energy efficiency. EPA credits are given for every two MWh of renewable energy generated. The EPA credits/allowances available to states in the CEIP depend on emission reduction requirements. States with greater reductions get more credits. State plans must maintain emission targets with state-issued credits. EPA's matching pool source is unspecified. The final rule includes measures to ensure industry reliability. EPA sought stakeholder comments on CEIP issues in the proposed rule. The final rule includes a reliability \"safety valve\" for power plants to maintain electric system reliability in emergency situations, allowing a 90-day reprieve from carbon emissions limits. Coordination efforts between EPA, DOE, and FERC will ensure power sector reliability during state compliance plan development. The EPA, DOE, and FERC are working together to ensure power sector reliability by cooperating, monitoring, implementing, sharing information, and resolving difficulties."
