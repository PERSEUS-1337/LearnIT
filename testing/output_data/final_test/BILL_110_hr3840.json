The Congress finds that Atlantic menhaden are crucial to the Atlantic ecosystem, serving as a primary food source for various marine species and helping maintain water quality in the Chesapeake Bay. Populations in the bay, a key nursery ground, are at historic lows, especially among juvenile fish. The declining Atlantic menhaden population in the Chesapeake Bay is a major concern, as it is a key indicator of a dwindling population. Industrial harvests for reduction purposes are the primary source of fishing mortality, and more research is needed to determine the health of the population. The declining Atlantic menhaden population in the Chesapeake Bay is a major concern, indicating the need for protection measures for this important fish in the sea. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines \"Atlantic menhaden\" as a species, \"coastal State\" as specific states and entities, and \"coastal waters\" as waters within certain boundaries. The curr_chunk defines the jurisdiction of coastal waters for different entities, including states, the District of Columbia, and the Potomac River Fisheries Commission. It also explains the term \"Commission\" and \"exclusive economic zone\" as per the Magnuson Act. The curr_chunk defines the term \"fishing\" under the Magnuson Act as the commercial catching, taking, or harvesting of Atlantic menhaden for reduction purposes, including support operations at sea. It excludes scientific research authorized by the government. The curr_chunk provides definitions for terms related to fishing for Atlantic menhaden for reduction purposes, the Magnuson Act, moratorium area, and moratorium period. The curr_chunk defines terms related to managing Atlantic menhaden, including the terms \"Plan,\" \"Secretaries,\" and \"Secretary.\" The curr_chunk focuses on monitoring implementation and enforcement by coastal states. The Commission determines if coastal states have fully implemented the Plan and if enforcement is satisfactory. Enforcement is unsatisfactory if it hinders Plan implementation. The Commission notifies Secretaries of its determinations. Establishment of Moratorium: A moratorium on commercial fishing for Atlantic menhaden for reduction purposes is established in the coastal waters of each coastal State. The Secretaries will terminate the moratorium if a coastal State is found to be in compliance with the Plan and a total allowable catch limit has been established for commercial fishing for Atlantic menhaden for reduction. During a moratorium period, it is illegal to fish in the moratorium area, land unlawfully caught Atlantic menhaden, land legally harvested Atlantic menhaden in a coastal State under moratorium, or not release Atlantic menhaden caught incidentally during harvesting. Civil penalties may be imposed on individuals who engage in unlawful acts related to fish-catching activities, with penalties outlined in the Magnuson Act. Vessels and associated items used in connection with unlawful acts may be subject to forfeiture. Fish seized under this Act may be forfeited to the United States. The disposal of seized fish can be done by court order or according to regulations. The Secretaries are authorized to issue regulations for implementing this section. SEC. 6. CONTINUING STUDIES OF MENHADEN POPULATIONS. Continuing, comprehensive studies of Atlantic menhaden stocks are required for the purposes of this Act. These studies include annual stock assessments, investigations into population fluctuations, the role of menhaden on water quality and environmental factors, and their impact on Atlantic striped bass populations. The Secretaries are required to conduct studies on the interactions between Atlantic menhaden and other fish species, as well as the effects of predation and competition on Atlantic menhaden. Additionally, a socio-economic study of the Atlantic menhaden resource must be conducted, with a report due to Congress by September 30, 2008. Biennial reports on progress and findings are also mandated. The Secretaries are required to conduct studies on the interactions between Atlantic menhaden and other fish species, as well as the effects of predation and competition. Biennial reports on progress and findings must be submitted to Congress and the Commission, including recommendations for sustainable management of Atlantic menhaden. Authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2008-2010: $800,000 to the Secretary of Commerce and $250,000 to the Secretary of the Interior. The Secretaries can enter cooperative agreements for financial assistance with the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission or States. Public participation is required in the preparation of management plans and amendments. SEC. 8. Public participation required in preparation of management plans and amendments for Atlantic menhaden in accordance with established standards and procedures. SEC. 9. Prohibition on commercial harvesting of Atlantic menhaden in Exclusive Economic Zone. Prohibition on commercial harvesting of Atlantic menhaden for reduction purposes in the exclusive economic zone established by Proclamation Number 5030, dated March 10, 1983. Violators may face a civil penalty of up to $1,000 for each violation, with each day of continuing violation considered a separate offense. Penalty amount assessed by the Secretary of Commerce. The Secretary considers various factors when determining the penalty amount for prohibited acts, including nature, circumstances, and violator's culpability. Penalties are subject to review, failure to pay, compromise, and subpoenas under the Magnuson Act. Civil forfeitures may apply to vessels involved in violations. Any vessel used in connection with unlawful acts is subject to forfeiture to the United States. The district courts have jurisdiction over proceedings for forfeiture. Subsections of the Magnuson Act apply to judgment, procedure, and rebuttable presumptions. The Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission will amend the Plan to address the ban on commercial harvesting of Atlantic menhaden for reduction purposes. SEC. 10. ENFORCEMENT. Authorized personnel can enforce moratoriums and prohibitions related to fishing activities using resources from other federal departments or state agencies."
