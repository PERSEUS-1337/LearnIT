    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Red River Gradient Boundary Survey Act\" and includes definitions for various terms. The Act defines the term \"affected area\" as land along a 116-mile stretch of the Red River, excluding a specific portion as depicted in a survey. It also defines the term \"gradient boundary survey method\" as the technique used to locate the South Bank boundary line. The South Bank boundary line along the Red River is subject to change due to erosion and accretion. A \"landowner\" is defined as any individual or entity owning land in the affected area. The \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Interior. The \"South Bank\" is the water-washed elevation along the southerly side of the Red River. The South Bank boundary line along the Red River separates the river bed from the adjacent upland and serves to confine waters within the bed and preserve the course of the river. It is identified through the gradient boundary survey method and does not impact the permanent political boundary line between Oklahoma and Texas. The Red River Boundary Compact, section B, was enacted by the States and consented to by Congress under Public Law 106-288 (114 Stat. 919). SEC. 3. SURVEY OF SOUTH BANK BOUNDARY LINE. The Secretary is required to commission a survey to identify the South Bank boundary line in the affected area. The survey must adhere to the gradient boundary survey method, span the length of the affected area, and be conducted by licensed surveyors selected jointly by the Texas General Land Office, Oklahoma Commissioners, and affected Indian tribes. The Oklahoma Commissioners of the Land Office, in consultation with the attorney general of the State of Oklahoma and each affected federally recognized Indian tribe, must complete the survey within 2 years of the enactment of the Act. The Secretary will then submit the survey for approval to the Texas General Land Office and affected federally recognized Indian tribes within 60 days of its completion. The Texas General Land Office and Oklahoma Commissioners of the Land Office, in consultation with relevant parties, must approve the survey within 60 days of receiving it. The survey of individual parcels in the affected area must be approved or disapproved by the Texas General Land Office and Oklahoma Commissioners of the Land Office within 60 days, in consultation with relevant parties. The survey of individual parcels in the affected area must be approved by the Texas General Land Office and Oklahoma Commissioners of the Land Office within 60 days. The approved survey must be submitted to the Secretary along with a notice of approval and a copy of the survey. No federal approval is required for the survey conducted. The Secretary must provide adjacent landowners with a notice of survey approval and a copy of the survey and field notes within 30 days of receiving a notice relating to an individual parcel. The Act specifies the effect of its implementation. The Act specifies that it does not modify any interests or rights related to land north of the South Bank boundary line, patented land under the Color of Title Act, the Red River Boundary Compact, Indian reservations, or valid rights of the State of Oklahoma. The Act does not affect the valid rights of the State of Oklahoma or the Kiowa, Comanche, or Apache Indian tribes to the mineral interest trust fund established in 1926. Authorization of appropriations for the Secretary to carry out the Act is set at $1,000,000."
