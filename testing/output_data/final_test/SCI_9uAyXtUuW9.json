Signals from these electronics were used to create an interactive soundscape in Max/MSP. Research using self-report questionnaires found that Line-Storm did not enhance a sense of presence and engagement during writing tasks, compared to a non-interactive control condition. The study found that Line-Storm did not enhance presence and engagement during writing tasks compared to a non-interactive control condition. However, some participants responded more positively to Line-Storm, showing greater presence and engagement. Future work includes modifying interactive components and improving aesthetics. The study focused on improving aesthetics and using miniaturized electronics, experimenting with a drawing task, and collaborating with a composer to create an engaging interactive soundscape. The goal was to enhance human creativity and create a fun user experience. Our system Line-Storm 1 aims to enhance user engagement and presence. Through performance with Line-Storm, the user experience is improved. Research shows that when people's minds wander, they are less happy. The mantra \"Be Here Now\" is popularized to encourage being present for success. In Silicon Valley, tech workers microdose LSD to boost creativity and improve interactions. Nietzsche's quote highlights the modern obsession with constant activity and fear of missing out. Enhancing creativity is not limited to technocrats chasing wealth. The concept of creative work can have different meanings for different individuals, such as billionaires and poets. Some criticize the extreme measures taken by LSD trippers in the 1960s and aim to turn it into a profitable tool. Creative work can lead to unexpected fortunes, as seen in the case of authors like Joseph Heller. The story of Heller and an investment banker illustrates that what may be beneficial for one person may not be the same for another, even when the definition of creative work is broadened. The curr_chunk discusses the attempt to create a ludic system for creative workers to enhance their sense of presence and engagement. It aims to provide an immersive environment for creative work using tools like a writing stylus. The concept of Taskscape from Ingold's work is mentioned as a reference for the new possibilities that Line-Storm exposes. The curr_chunk discusses the taskscape of the creative worker using Line-Storm, emphasizing the social experience of creative work. It questions whether the taskscape of a user is more conducive to writing poetry or drafting plans. The curr_chunk discusses Line-Storm, a tool that enhances creative work by focusing on the primary activity of using the system rather than the work done with it. It aims to stimulate the creative process through physical drawings, writings, and analog sounds, not digital art. Line-Storm is a tool that produces analog sounds while writing or drawing, capturing natural phenomena sounds like thunderstorms. It can be used for various purposes such as writing letters, recipes, poetry, or simply for the fun of using it. Performance with Line-Storm can involve art, technology, or play. Line-Storm is an interactive system where the performer's actions create sounds that influence subsequent actions. The performance can result in drawings or writings as well as recorded sounds. It is a way of honoring the ordinary and involves play inspired by Nietzsche, contrasting with games with predefined rules. Play is a way of introducing flow into one's life and has an organic quality. Thunderstorm sounds were added to LineStorm to mimic movement and medicative effects. Gamification is seen as contrary to play and personal relationships, with the digital realm raising privacy concerns. The concept of a \"right to be forgotten\" has been discussed in this context. Line-Storm as a medium provides privacy similar to the analog world, preserving handwritten letters. Technology should augment, not replace traditional tools like musical instruments. Previous work includes MusicGrip, a pressure sensor-controlled system for writing stylus to control analog synthesizers. Shichinohe et al. used a camera system for an augmented-reality system to aid in calligraphic writing instruction, providing feedback on brush position and body posture. The Digital Baton, part of the Brain Opera performance, was a wireless baton augmented with sensors for musical expression. The Digital Baton, part of the Brain Opera performance, had infrared LED, pressure-sensitive resistors, and accelerometers controlled by the performer's fingers. Inputs were mapped to musical parameters. Tod Machover's work with hyperinstruments like Guitar Hero and Hyperstring Trilogy, augmented traditional music instruments with sensors for performances. Machover's philosophy of augmenting traditional tools is followed in various projects, such as LiveScribe's wireless pen with handwriting recognition. Other projects include Sonic City system using urban environment as an interface, Bluetooth Radio Ball Interface adding sensors to a sport ball for sound/music capabilities, and Urban Musical Game involving a sport ball and sound/music augmentation. The Urban Musical Game [54] is an augmentation project involving a sport ball and sound/music generation based on the ball's motions. Video demonstrations are available on Vimeo. Handwriting motions can help diagnose obsessive-compulsive disorder. Handwriting is more effective than cell-phone texting for treating Broca's aphasia. Embodied cognition models explore neural relationships with writing. Preschool children in fMRI experiments show the importance of kinesthetic learning in literacy. Existential phenomenology informs teaching personal writing. Phenomenology has influenced teaching personal writing, with recent research showing benefits of handwriting over computer keyboard use. Word processors may enhance writing skills, but handwriting is still important for composition development in college students. Previous studies found no difference in textual production between handwritten and word-processed compositions. The importance of handwritten letter writing has been emphasized by various philosophers, including Thoreau, Heidegger, and Derrida. While word processors may enhance writing skills, handwriting remains crucial for composition development in college students. Heidegger and Ihde criticize the idea that human beings only have one hand, highlighting the limitations of technology like typewriters and digital note-taking apps. They argue against Heidegger's hierarchy of values regarding different media forms. Heidegger and Derrida dismiss Heidegger's criticism of the typewriter and preference for handwriting, highlighting the hastiness in consuming information facilitated by technology. They argue that technology has become autonomous and unstoppable, moving beyond human control. Heidegger and Derrida criticize technology's autonomy and its impact on decision-making. Line-Storm raises questions about augmenting human capability versus replacing it with technology. Csikszentmihalyi's study on creativity interviewed individuals who made significant contributions to their fields. Csikszentmihalyi's study on creativity found that many individuals were skeptical of studying creativity or participating in the study. He emphasizes that creating a conducive environment for creative work is more effective than beautiful surroundings. Creativity involves emotional aspects and attention is crucial for problem-solving. Creativity is praised widely, but it can be used for both good and bad purposes. Sternberg highlights that creativity is mostly domain-specific and partly independent of IQ. Creativity is praised widely and is partly independent of measured intelligence quotient (IQ). Play is compared to the world of production and work, with the act of writing a poem seen as a performance requiring presence and engagement. Line-Storm is interactive, enhancing the traditional tools of pencil and paper. Line-Storm is an interactive tool that enhances the traditional pencil and paper, providing new interaction possibilities and immersive experiences for creative workers. It aims to help users concentrate fully on their writing tasks, but combining technology with art does not guarantee enhanced creativity. Heidegger questioned the neutral nature of technology, suggesting that it shapes our view of the world and everything in it. The essence of technology is seen as a resource to be used, with questions raised about its dominance in our lives. A new technology based on fun is introduced cautiously into writing and drawing practices. The role of money as a motivator for creativity is debated, with the idea that it may not be effective. After reviewing experimental evidence, it was concluded that money is not a strong motivator for creative production. Creativity requires intelligence and cannot be fully mechanized. Counterintuitive incentivization, such as making tasks more difficult with unusual tools, may stimulate creative thinking. Changing the affordances of familiar tasks can induce creative thought. The implementation of Line-Storm is detailed. The implementation of Line-Storm involved using Max/MSP, a graphical programming environment, to create a software interface and sound-synthesis engine. Max/MSP allows for interconnecting objects in GUI windows through patchers, enabling communication with electronic devices via serial-port capabilities. The sensor-fob consists of multiple PCB circuit-boards powered by a lithium-polymer battery and connected by insulated copper wires. An Arduino Fio v3 microcontroller board with an XBee radio transceiver module controls the sensor data transmission through a serial port on a laptop computer using Max/MSP. The Fio v3 microcontroller board is connected to an Adafruit ADXL335 3-axis accelerometer using soldered wires. The boards are oriented parallel to each other with rigid wires holding them in place. The x, y, and z axes of the accelerometer are aligned with the lengths, widths, and surface normals of the boards. The sensor-fob is connected to the stylus allowing quick orientation changes. An Adafruit ADXL335 3-axis accelerometer with +/-3g range is used for experiments. The sensor-fob is maintained with XBeeradio end pointing towards the eraser on the pencil-stylus. The sensor-fob, with its attached ADXL335 unit, has a range of +/-3g. Sensor output values range from 0 to approximately 1000, with a center value of 500. Negative accelerations are below 500, while positive accelerations are above 500. The Fio v3 uses an 8-bit ADC. More details can be found in [FirstSecondAuthor]. Our experimental evaluation of Line-Storm involved twelve participants, with one participant's data discarded for not following directions. Participants were roughly half female and half male, with ages ranging from 18 to 34 years. The study was conducted at two sites, with advertising near the end of the Spring semester attracting many students interested in extra credit. Ten participants were run in three days, and the results of the research study are presented and analyzed. The research study involved ten participants and aimed to compare the sense of presence and engagement between interactive and non-interactive conditions. The results did not support the hypothesis, with no significant difference found in self-reported levels of presence and engagement. The study compared interactive and non-interactive conditions using two statistical tests. A significant difference was found in the naturalness of interaction and adjustment to the system experience, with participants rating these lower in the experimental condition compared to the control condition. Participants in the experimental condition had difficulty adjusting to the system and reported losing track of time. Significant correlations were found between losing track of time and writing more in the experimental condition. One participant was excluded for not following instructions, and two others were excluded for drawing pictures instead of writing. K-means clustering classification was performed on the remaining sample. The study used K-means clustering classification on a sample size of ten participants. Two distinct groups were identified: one responding differently to the experimental condition and another to the control condition. Strong correlations were found between a sense of presence and engagement with specific response items. IBM's SPSS Statistics, Version 25, was used for statistical analyses. The study found strong correlations between a sense of presence and engagement with the system and adjustment to control devices in both control and experimental conditions. Participants who responded more favorably to the experimental condition wrote more in both conditions. K-means clustering tests revealed a group of participants who preferred the experimental condition. Participants in the experiment showed a correlation between a sense of presence and engagement with the system, as well as their ability to adjust to the control devices. They found their interactions more natural in the control condition compared to the experimental condition. Some participants, known as the Preservers of Line-Storm, were identified as preferring the experimental condition. Participants known as the Preservers of LineStorm, roughly half of the group, were deeply engaged during the experimental condition. They wrote more, focused on sound over visuals, and lost track of time. Attention fluctuations and natural wandering of the mind are areas for future investigation. The study participants' interpretations influenced the creation of Line-Storm, viewed as both equipment and a tool with a thingly and equipmental character. Heidegger's concept emphasizes the role of creators and preservers in the existence of a work. Line-Storm is seen as both equipment and a tool, existing as a thing and part of a matrix of all equipment. It can be experienced as ready-to-hand, where it becomes transparent and the user is engrossed in the work, or present-at-hand, where it sticks out as a thing. As an artwork, Line-Storm is not just made but created, preserving its essence beyond mere utility. Line-Storm can be seen as equipment or art work. Some users treat it as equipment for a specific purpose, while others see it as art work existing for its own sake. Participants who rated Line-Storm highly and wrote more while using it are referred to as the Preservers of Line-Storm, letting it be what it is. Line-Storm allows for cross-modal transfer, merging sound and visual aspects in a performance. The sound of the stylus on paper is amplified, creating an overlap with other sounds like a thunderstorm. Users perceive Line-Storm as affordances, highlighting the interrelation of environment, organism, and activity. Line-Storm merges sound, visual, and tactile affordances, highlighting the interrelation of environment, organism, and activity. Preservers of Line-Storm discover hidden affordances, making them prominent in the writing stylus and pad. A performance with Line-Storm is a realization of its affordances, essential for its preservation and fulfillment. In 2006, a Japanese maple tree was enhanced with nitinol wires and sensors to move its branches in response to people. The art work was discussed in the context of Heideggerian phenomenology, with two different implementations using different trees. The first exhibit used a live Japanese maple to hide the mechanical components, while the second exhibit used a mountain laurel, putting the mechanical components on display. Attendees interacted differently with the tree based on whether the mechanical components were visible or hidden. During the first exhibit, interactions with the tree were more natural as the mechanical components were hidden, allowing people to engage with it as an interactive artwork. However, during the second exhibit where the mechanical components were visible, attendees focused more on the engineering of the tree rather than freely interacting with it. This difference in interaction based on visibility of mechanical components was observed in Line-Storm as well. Participants' experience with Line-Storm varied, with some enjoying it as a tool ready-to-hand for writing or drawing, while others found it obtrusive and distracting. Engagement with Line-Storm in a ready-to-hand mode allowed for a flow state, while being present-at-hand indicated a lack of flow. This concept is similar to Csikszentmihalyi's idea of flow in engaging with tasks and tools. The peasant woman uses her shoes in the field without thinking about them, emphasizing the true purpose of equipment. Line-Storm's effectiveness is seen when users are engaged in work, not distracted by its appearance. Lack of enjoyment and presence indicate a failure to experience Line-Storm's interactivity. The interactivity of Line-Storm requires specific actions and intentions from participants. Despite not meeting the goal of increased presence and engagement for all users, some found enjoyment and play in using Line-Storm, viewing it as artwork. Prior knowledge of participants influences their responses to Line-Storm as a tool. Participants' familiarity with related tools influences their perception of Line-Storm. There is a correlation between regular hand-writing practice and the number of words written using Line-Storm, suggesting that those who write or draw by hand regularly may better experience its authenticity. Initially conceived as an entertainment system for journal writing, Line-Storm aims to provide pleasure and engagement for users. Line-Storm was designed to enhance creativity and engagement in writing by presenting writing tools in a new light, encouraging handwritten letters, and increasing participants' sense of presence. Results showed a group of participants responded favorably to Line-Storm, which aimed to provide a ludic environment for creative work. Line-Storm aimed to create a ludic environment for creative work, focusing on the process rather than the outcome. Participants were encouraged to lose themselves in the system, leading to increased absorption and potential for creative thoughts and actions. Future work for Line-Storm includes cleaning up Max/MSP code to trigger multiple thunderstorm samples rapidly, creating a cover for electronic components on the sensor-fob for aesthetic appeal, extending to a mobile platform for more flexibility in usage, and investigating further enhancements. Investigate miniaturized RF components and micro-controller boards for a more compact sensor-fob. Experiment with different styli and consider using a baton-type stylus. Explore the possibility of a wrist-worn appliance for future enhancements. Investigate a wrist-worn appliance to augment or replace the motion-tracking capability of the stylus sensor-fob. Gather more data with a larger sample size. Vary the type of music during the control condition. Experiment with a multi-user system and collaborate with a composer for future improvements. The study aimed to enhance the system by mapping accelerometer data to sonic parameters effectively. More data points were needed for analysis, and statistical techniques like the Student's t Test and Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test were used. The K-means clustering analysis could have been improved with additional data points. Augmentation was considered innovative, offering a different experience. The Preservers of Line-Storm experiment showed promise for the augmented interface, although it may not enhance creativity as initially hypothesized. Our work provided a unique augmented interaction experience in creative writing, enhancing user experience beyond traditional methods like pen and paper or word-processing software."
