Establishment of procedures and fee schedules for testing voting equipment hardware and software; payment of user fees for accredited laboratories.

The Commission will set up a Testing Escrow Account for this purpose. The Commission will establish a schedule of fees for testing voting system hardware and software by accredited laboratories.
