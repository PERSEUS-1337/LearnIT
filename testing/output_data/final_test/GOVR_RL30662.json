The 1970s saw frequent terrorist attacks, culminating in the Tehran hostage crisis in 1979. In response, the Security Enhancement Program (SEP) was initiated in August 1980. The Security Enhancement Program (SEP) was initiated in August 1980 with congressional support to improve protection of mission personnel, U.S. government property, and classified information at posts lacking effective protection. Experts assessed embassy security needs based on threat levels and recommended improvements. The urgency for embassy security was heightened after bombings in Beirut in the 1980s, leading to the passage of the 1984 Act to Combat International Terrorism. The 1984 Act to Combat International Terrorism (P.L. 98-533) authorized reward payments for information leading to the arrest of individuals involved in terrorist acts against Americans or American property and allocated $356.3 million for enhanced embassy security. Secretary of State George P. Shultz formed the Advisory Panel on Overseas Security, headed by Retired Admiral Bobby Inman, which provided recommendations for security measures, known as the Inman standards. Recommendations included reorganizing security and counter-terrorism offices in the Department of State and consolidating operational security offices into a new bureau for Diplomatic Security. The Advisory Panel on Overseas Security, led by Retired Admiral Bobby Inman, provided recommendations for security measures, including improvements in protective intelligence, training of Foreign Service personnel, contingency planning, and physical security standards. They also recommended assigning Marine Security Guard detachments to sensitive posts, pursuing a building program to address security deficiencies, and implementing a capital budgeting procedure to prevent delays in security improvements. The report did not recommend specific setback or wall height standards. The Inman panel set security standards for embassy construction and security programs, leading to the Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986. By 1998, 49 facilities had been upgraded to meet new security standards, but as of 2001, about 80% of U.S. overseas facilities did not meet minimum security requirements. Following the bombings of U.S. embassies in Africa in 1998, there was a disagreement over responsibility for underfunding embassy security. Congress sought increased funding for overseas security, while the State Department aimed to balance embassy visibility with increased security measures. In 1999, the Overseas Presence Advisory Panel recommended improvements in security measures and training. Following the bombings of U.S. embassies in Africa in 1998, there was a disagreement over responsibility for underfunding embassy security. Congress sought increased funding for overseas security, while the State Department aimed to balance embassy visibility with increased security measures. In 1999, the Overseas Presence Advisory Panel recommended improvements in security measures and training. Secretary Albright emphasized the importance of pursuing terrorists and stated that there is no statute of limitations in the fight against terrorism. After the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the United States is leading a global effort to eradicate terrorism. After the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Africa, the belief in attaining 100% security was reinforced. The size of the blasts highlighted vulnerabilities in major buildings in densely populated areas. Administration officials acknowledged the need for continual revision of security standards as bombs become more sophisticated. Threat assessments for U.S. overseas posts are conducted under the Diplomatic Security Act of 1986, with threat levels categorized as critical, high, medium, and low. Each post undergoes evaluation and threat levels can be adjusted as needed. The threat level categories are critical, high, medium, and low for U.S. overseas posts. The State Department is reviewing its methodology for evaluating threat levels after the Africa bombings. Security resource allocation is based on the potential for terrorist activity, location of the facility, and consultation among State's Office. The State Department, in consultation with various offices, determines security measures for overseas facilities. The Secretary of State is responsible for resource requests based on recommendations. U.S. security personnel face challenges in responding to the 10-12 daily threats against overseas posts. Each threat is handled individually, with no set procedure, depending on the country and type of threat. The U.S. response to threats against overseas facilities varies depending on the country, type of facility, and source of the threat. State Department officials take all threats seriously and follow procedures that involve assessing credibility, consulting with officials in Washington, and potentially escalating the response if necessary. Actions that can be taken include closing surrounding streets with local police approval. The U.S. response to threats against overseas facilities involves various security measures such as closing streets, reducing staff, and evacuating personnel. Congress provides funding for security in State Department appropriations, Foreign Operations, and Department of Defense. In 1980, the State Department estimated a $191 million funding need for the Security Enhancement Program (SEP) over the next five years. Congress appropriated $136.3 million from FY1980 - FY1984, with an additional $110.2 million requested for FY1985 after the 1983/84 Beirut attacks. This request was part of the 1984 Act to Combat International Terrorism, which included a $356.3 million program for increased security for U.S. diplomatic missions overseas. The Inman study in 1985 recommended $3.5 billion for security needs overseas. The Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Anti-Terrorism Act of 1986 authorized $2.1 billion for embassy construction and security programs. The Administration requested $5.8 billion for security in various State Department accounts from FY1987 onwards. The State Department received reduced security funds from FY1987 to FY1998, totaling $5.0 billion. Congress made cuts for specific reasons like construction delays. It seems the State Department did not request enough funds to implement Inman recommendations, as Congress rescinded unobligated funds in two years. The State Department had $100 million in unobligated funds for embassy security upgrades, indicating a lack of spending on appropriations received. Embassy security was not a priority in budgets from the early 1990s to the embassy bombings in 1998. In the last 12 years, security funding was not connected to Inman recommendations in budget requests or appropriations reports. In FY1996-FY1997, Congress earmarked funds for security in addition to the Diplomatic Security account and without a request from the Administration. The President requested an emergency supplemental appropriation in FY1998 to address expenses from embassy bombings and improve security worldwide. State Department officials confirmed bills from the bombings were paid. State Department officials stated that funding for the August 1998 bombings was paid with FY1998 appropriations to comply with budget regulations. An emergency supplemental was needed to avoid exceeding FY1999 spending caps. $1.56 billion of the $1.9 billion enacted emergency supplemental went to the Department of State's foreign affairs budget. Congress allocated $790.8 million for Diplomatic and Consular services. Congress allocated $790.8 million for the Diplomatic and Consular Programs Account, $748 million for embassy functions in Kenya and Tanzania, $677.5 million for embassy facilities, $12 million for security improvements, and $12.9 million for emergency expenditures related to the embassy bombings. Additionally, $1 million was provided for the State's Office of Inspector General. Congress provided $1 million for State's Office of Inspector General for additional security oversight and inspections in the omnibus appropriation for FY1999. Appropriations were allocated for Security and Maintenance account and Diplomatic and Consular Programs account for overseas security. Congress criticized the Administration for requesting inadequate funds for worldwide security upgrades in the FY2000 State Department budget request. In November 1999, Congress approved $568 million for overseas security in the FY2000 State Department appropriation. Additional funds were authorized through the Foreign Relations Authorization bill for a total of $4.5 billion from FY2000 to FY2004. This was in response to the Crowe Accountability Review Board's recommendation of $1.4 billion annually for the next ten years. The FY2001 State Department budget allocated $1.07 billion for security funding, with emphasis on improving information technology, embassy security, and hiring security personnel. The FY2002 budget request includes $487.7 million for embassy security in Diplomatic and Consular Programs and $816 million in Embassy Security, Construction, and Maintenance. This represents a 13% increase over the previous year's budget. The House and Senate allocated funds for Diplomatic and Consular Programs and Embassy Security, Construction, and Maintenance accounts. The Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act provided additional funding for emergency communication technology and evacuations. An accountability review board was appointed after the embassy bombings in 1998. An accountability review board, led by Admiral William J. Crowe, found that Administration agencies and Congress shared responsibility for embassy security failures. The report recommended $1.4 billion annually for 10 years to enhance security at U.S. overseas facilities, with specific recommendations for workplace security, crisis management, and intelligence sharing. Additionally, the Secretary of State established the Overseas Presence Advisory Panel in February 1999. In February 1999, Secretary of State Albright announced the establishment of the Overseas Presence Advisory Panel (OPAP) chaired by private sector lawyer, Lewis B. Kaden. OPAP reported nine general recommendations in November 1999, including upgrading security measures, reinforcing accountability, and creating a new Interagency Overseas Presence Committee and Overseas Facilities Authority (OFA) to enhance foreign policy effectiveness and minimize personnel risk. The Overseas Facilities Authority (OFA) was established to manage civilian overseas offices and residences, improve human resources strategies, upgrade information technology, enhance consular services, and redefine the role of Ambassadors. The President should implement these recommendations through an Executive order. The President should establish an implementation mechanism by Executive order and appoint a \"Coordinator for Overseas Presence Reform\" to reshape U.S. overseas presence in partnership with Congressional leaders. Issues discussed in foreign relations authorization legislation (H.R. 1646/S. 1401) are being considered by Congress. State Department Security Appropriations and Requests for FY1992-2002 are detailed in Table 1. The State Department's Security Appropriations and Requests for FY1992-2002 were detailed in Table 2, showing funding amounts ranging from $1.5 million in FY1996 to $19.6 million in the FY2002 request. This information excludes Border Security accounts funded by fees from Machine Readable Visas for diplomatic security personnel, terrorism, crime, and visa fraud investigations. The State Department's Security Appropriations and Requests for FY1992-2002 ranged from $1.5 million in FY1996 to $19.6 million in the FY2002 request.
