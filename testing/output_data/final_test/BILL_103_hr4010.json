The Congress finds that extensive ecological changes have occurred in the Rio Puerco watershed, leading to erosion of lands, impaired waters, reduced productivity, loss of biodiversity, riparian areas, and surface water. This damage has significantly impacted the economic and cultural well-being of inhabitants, causing the loss of communities and affecting traditions and cultures. The impairment of the Rio Puerco watershed has damaged the ecological and economic well-being of the region, including disruption of ecological processes, water quality impairment, reduced water storage capacity of the Elephant Butte Dam, irrigation system maintenance issues, and increased flood risk. The Rio Puerco is a major tributary of the Rio Grande. The Rio Puerco watershed, a major tributary of the Rio Grande, has been stressed by loss of native vegetation, exotic species, and habitat alteration, disrupting ecological processes. It consists of diverse land ownership with varying management objectives. Effective watershed management requires cooperation among different entities like the Bureau of Land Management. Various entities involved in the management of the Rio Puerco watershed include the Bureau of Land Management, Rio Puerco Watershed Committee, National Forest Service, Pueblos of Acoma, Isleta, Jemez, and Laguna, Navajo nation, Jicarilla Apache Tribe, Bureau of Reclamation, Geological Survey, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Fish and Wildlife Service, Soil and Conservation Service, Army Corps of Engineers, National Park Service, State of New Mexico, private landowners, local and regional governmental entities, and other interested citizens. The Secretary of the Interior, through the Bureau of Land Management, in consultation with various entities, is best suited to coordinate management efforts in the Rio Puerco watershed. Accelerating improvement in the watershed will benefit those living in the area and downstream users on the Rio Grande. The management program for the Rio Puerco watershed will be coordinated by the Secretary of the Interior through the Bureau of Land Management, in consultation with various entities. The Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the Rio Puerco Management Committee, will establish a clearinghouse for research and information on management within the Rio Puerco watershed. This includes data on natural resource conditions, watershed impairment causes, and best management practices implementation, monitoring, and evaluation. Support will be provided to the Committee to identify objectives, coordinate practices, and monitor results. The Secretary, in consultation with the Rio Puerco Management Committee, will prepare a plan for the restoration of the Rio Puerco watershed. The plan will identify goals, describe actions and costs, recommend best management practices, and provide guidelines for ecological maintenance. The plan for the Rio Puerco watershed restoration includes guidelines for public and private land management, community outreach programs, cooperative efforts with private landowners, and implementation of best management practices. It also encourages voluntary cooperative programs among the Rio Puerco Management Committee membership and support for best management practices on private lands. The plan for Rio Puerco watershed restoration includes guidelines for public and private land management, community outreach programs, cooperative efforts with private landowners, and implementation of best management practices. It also involves developing proposals for a monitoring system that assesses resource and socioeconomic conditions, identifies priority actions, and evaluates the effectiveness of implemented measures. Additional personnel may be employed if needed. The Secretary may employ additional personnel for the Rio Puerco watershed restoration, prioritizing individuals residing nearby. The Rio Puerco Management Committee is established. The Rio Puerco Management Committee is established and includes representatives from various organizations such as the Rio Puerco Watershed Committee, affected tribes and pueblos, National Forest Service, Bureau of Reclamation, Geological Survey, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Fish and Wildlife Service, Army Corps of Engineers, Soil and Conservation Service, State of New Mexico, and local Soil and Water Conservation Districts. The Rio Puerco Management Committee includes representatives from various organizations and stakeholders such as affected local Soil and Water Conservation Districts, the Elephant Butte Irrigation District, private landowners, and other interested citizens. The committee's duties include advising the Secretary of the Interior on the development and implementation of the Rio Puerco Management Program and serving as a forum for information on activities related to best management practices. Two years after the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Interior will provide a biennial report to the Senate and House committees. The report will include a summary of accomplishments outlined in section 3 and proposals for joint implementation efforts, along with funding recommendations. Additionally, there will be a Lower Rio Grande Habitat Study. The Secretary of the Interior will conduct a study of the Rio Grande from Caballo Lake to the Gulf of Mexico in cooperation with New Mexico and Texas. The study includes assessing habitat conditions, changes in vegetation over 400 years, and feasibility of preventing habitat loss and restoration through native plant species. The Secretary will transmit the study to the Senate and House committees when funds are available for this Act. Authorization of appropriations is granted to carry out the Act and implement the plan prepared under section 3(b)."
