    "title": "SB 45",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 89003 of the Government Code prohibits mass mailings within 90 days before an election by or on behalf of a candidate for city, county, or special district elective office. A mass mailing is defined as meeting specific criteria outlined in the California Code of Regulations. Section 14000 of the Unemployment Insurance Code is amended to emphasize the importance of a well-educated and highly skilled workforce for California's prosperity and global competitiveness. This bill aligns with the Political Reform Act of 1974 and does not require reimbursement under the California Constitution. The state's workforce investment system aims to prepare students and workers for the global economy, increase industry-recognized certifications and degrees, adapt to changing labor markets, and provide good-paying jobs for economic security and upward mobility. State and local workforce investment boards are encouraged to collaborate with various institutions to align resources and build a well-articulated workforce investment system, preparing workers for good-paying jobs that foster economic security and upward mobility. To address the needs of job seekers, workers, and employers, workforce investment programs should adopt local and regional training strategies, build partnerships across education and social services, and be data-driven and evidence-based. Strong partnerships with the private sector are essential for needs assessment and program evaluation. Workforce investment programs should partner with industry employers and unions to prioritize needs of businesses of all sizes. Programs must be outcome-oriented, measuring results for participants in terms of program completion, employment, and earnings. Services should be accessible to individuals with barriers to employment. Section 14005 of the Unemployment Insurance Code is amended to define key terms related to workforce development, including the roles of the Board and Agency, career pathways, cluster-based sector strategies, and data-driven decision-making based on labor market analysis. The definition of \"economic security\" for workers includes earning a sufficient wage to support a family and save for emergencies and retirement. \"Evidence-based\" refers to using policy research to determine effective policies that produce positive outcomes across different populations and settings. High-priority occupations are in-demand jobs in specific industries that offer economic security. Individuals with employment barriers face challenges that limit their ability to find work, such as lack of experience or skills, disabilities, or long-term unemployment. An industry cluster is a geographic concentration of interdependent industries with common resources and relationships in a regional economy or labor market. An industry or sector partnership is a collaborative workforce group that focuses on the needs of a specific industry cluster by bringing together key stakeholders such as firms, labor groups, education providers, and workforce systems. These partnerships develop strategies to address short-term and long-term human capital needs, analyze labor markets, create skill standards and training programs, and establish career advancement opportunities for workers. Industry or sector partnerships involve representatives from multiple firms, state labor organizations, local workforce investment boards, educational institutions, state workforce agencies, and potentially state or local government. Industry or sector partnerships involve representatives from various organizations such as state or local government, economic development agencies, chambers of commerce, nonprofit organizations, philanthropic organizations, and industry associations. These partnerships aim to bring together firms that produce similar products or provide similar services within a regional labor market. Additionally, local labor federations, which are organizations of local unions affiliated with labor councils, may also be involved in these partnerships. Sector strategies prioritize investments in competitive industry sectors based on economic data indicating growth potential, focusing on workforce training for secure jobs and addressing skills gaps. This may involve career pathways and stackable credentials. Sector strategies may target underserved communities, disconnected youths, incumbent workers, and military veterans. They are often implemented through industry partnerships at the regional level, but can also be at the state or local level based on sector needs. The \"Workforce Investment Act of 1998\" is the federal law related to these strategies. The \"Workforce Investment Act of 1998\" (Public Law 105-220) defines terms such as \"labor market area\" as an integrated geographic area for employment, \"recognized postsecondary credential\" as industry-recognized certifications, and \"core program\" as authorized under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (Public Law 113-128). The \"core program provision\" includes specific sections of various federal acts such as the Wagner-Peyser Act and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. This definition is amended in Section 14010 of the Unemployment Insurance Code. The California Workforce Investment Board is responsible for aligning the education and workforce systems to the needs of the 21st century economy. It assists the Governor in coordinating programs under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. Additionally, a new section on Regional Planning is added to the Unemployment Insurance Code. The Unemployment Insurance Code is amended to include provisions for Regional Planning in alignment with the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. The state will identify regions with one local area, regions with multiple local areas, and interstate areas consisting of labor market areas or economic development areas. The local boards and chief elected officials in each planning region engage in a regional planning process resulting in a regional plan, regional service strategies, sector initiatives, labor market data analysis, administrative cost arrangements, transportation coordination, and services coordination with economic development providers. The regional planning process involves coordination of services with economic development providers and negotiating performance accountability measures with the Governor. The state mandates local boards and officials to prepare a single regional plan incorporating local plans for each area. Technical assistance and labor market data will be provided for regional planning. No reimbursement is required as this act implements federal regulations."
