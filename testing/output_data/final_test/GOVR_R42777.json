    "content": "Since President Mikheil Saakashvili took office in 2003, Georgia has seen progress in economic and political freedoms, reduced police corruption and crime. Observers, including international organizations like OSCE and EU, and governments like the US, have noted this progress as uneven. The 2008 legislative and presidential elections were seen as promising but not entirely free and fair. The conduct of the October 2012 parliamentary election was crucial for Georgia's future relations with the EU and NATO. Businessman Bidzina Ivanishvili played a significant role in the lead-up to the election. In late 2011, businessman Bidzina Ivanishvili announced his entry into politics in opposition to Saakashvili. Saakashvili revoked Ivanishvili's Georgian citizenship, leading to constitutional changes allowing EU citizens living in Georgia for five years to run for office, enabling Ivanishvili's participation in the October 2012 election. In late 2011, provisions were passed to allow Bidzina Ivanishvili to participate in the 2012 legislative election as a Georgian citizen. Corporate contributions to political parties were restricted, and state financing for campaigns of existing parties was increased. The State Audit Chamber was tasked with monitoring campaign spending, and a new electoral code was implemented for the election process. In April 2012, Ivanishvili launched his new political party, Georgia Dream-Democratic Georgia (GD), forming a coalition with parties that once supported the Saakashvili government. This included the Republican Party of Georgia, the Conservative Party, and the Free Democrats Party. The new electoral provisions allowed for proportional and constituency voting, ensuring parties with a minimum of 5% of the vote would receive at least six seats in the legislature. In 2008, parties like the National Forum Party and the Industry Will Save Georgia Party moved into opposition during Saakashvili's rise to power. Ivanishvili launched the Georgia Dream-Democratic Georgia (GD) party in 2012, affirming support for NATO and the EU integration, reducing poverty and unemployment, and increasing social services. The State Audit Chamber imposed fines on GD and its campaign donors in 2012. In 2012, fines were imposed on GD and its campaign donors, and satellite dishes belonging to Ivanishvili-related television stations were seized due to alleged illicit vote-buying. Criticism led to the reduction of fines and the enactment of a \"must carry\" law allowing programs from these stations to be aired until election day. The CEC registered 14 parties and two electoral blocs for the legislative election, with a total of 2,313 candidates. The late campaign events included the release of videos showing prison abuse by guards by GD and allegations of organized crime involvement by UNM. The videos led to large protests in Georgia, with Saakashvili acknowledging the human rights abuses but urging voters not to punish UNM. Saakashvili replaced the Minister of Prisons with a human rights official, ousted the Minister of the Interior, and arrested other prison officials, but the videos undermined his image as an anti-corruption fighter and democracy champion. After the release of videos showing prison abuse by guards and allegations of organized crime involvement, the electorate's views may have shifted. Over 100,000 individuals attended a final campaign rally held by Ivanishvili in Tbilisi. Almost 2.16 million voters turned out for the election, with only UNM and GD winning enough votes to secure seats in the legislature. GD won enough party list votes to pass the 5% hurdle and secure seats in the legislature. The Central Election Commission ordered repeat elections in three constituency races due to irregularities, resulting in wins for GD candidates. UNM lost 54 of its 119 seats from the 2008 election. The polarization between GD and UNM overshadowed other parties, leading to the Christian Democratic Union and Labor Party losing their legislative seats. President Saakashvili conceded after GD took a significant lead over UNM in the election. President Saakashvili conceded after GD took a significant lead over UNM in the election. He expressed hope for cooperation between the two parties but emphasized UNM's opposition to any rollback of their achievements. Threats against election officials by GD supporters were reported, drawing criticism from the EU mission chief and prompting a visit from the U.S. Ambassador. On October 4, U.S. Ambassador to Georgia Richard Norland urged GD supporters protesting a local electoral win by a UNM candidate to respect democratic processes. Ivanishvili also appealed for the protests to stop. Georgian National Security Council Secretary Giga Bokeria warned against violence at electoral commissions, emphasizing the need for an orderly transfer of power. The OSCE election observation mission praised the Georgian people for freely expressing their will at the ballot box, noting improvements in the conduct of democratic elections despite some remaining issues. The OSCE election observation mission reported competent voting administration in most polling stations, but noted errors in vote counting. They raised concerns about a polarized campaign environment and highlighted issues with fines and detentions mostly targeting supporters of GD. The Inter-Agency Commission's efforts were praised, but the State Audit Office was criticized for targeting the opposition for campaign finance violations. The 2012 legislative election in Georgia resulted in a peaceful transfer of power, meeting Saakashvili's pledge for a transparent and democratic election. Ivanishvili expected to become the new prime minister and called for Saakashvili's resignation or constraints on his governance. The State Audit Office was criticized for targeting the opposition for campaign finance violations. Saakashvili's governance was questioned by Ivanishvili, who initially suggested the president resign but later softened his stance. Despite Ivanishvili's doubts, government officials from both sides met to discuss future cooperation, with GD planning new cabinet appointments. Bokeria emphasized that the President would nominate a candidate for prime minister. The UNM working group highlighted that the President would nominate a prime minister candidate suggested by GD. According to the Georgian constitution, the president will consult with GD after the new legislature convenes in late October or early November to nominate a candidate for prime minister. Georgian constitutional expert Avtandil Demetrashvili suggested that Saakashvili and Ivanishvili may cooperate to form a new government. Ivanishvili announced prospective cabinet members on October 8, with Maia Panjikidze nominated as foreign minister, pledging to uphold strategic partnerships with the US and Georgia's European orientation. The United States and Georgia's European and Euro-Atlantic orientation are emphasized. Efforts to improve relations with Russia will be made, but diplomatic relations will not be re-established as long as Russia denies Abkhazia and South Ossetia as part of Georgia. Alasania, the nominee for defense minister, vows to continue efforts to join NATO. Pro-Western Davit Usupashvili is nominated as the legislative speaker. Outgoing ministers will brief the nominees for a smooth political transition. The new legislature will not be predominantly a two-party body, as the GD coalition contains 6 political parties. Ivanishvili anticipates that coalition parties will form separate factions in Parliament. Many observers predict that cooperation among coalition parties in Parliament may prove difficult due to their distinct identities. With GD's majority, they may seek to revamp Saakashvili's policies. Concerns are raised that GD might move to constrain democracy, as seen in Ukraine and Russia. Georgian analyst Gia Nodia warns that Ivanishvili is tied to Russia and organized crime. Gia Nodia warns that Ivanishvili is closely tied to Russia and organized crime, displaying authoritarian tendencies by threatening reporters and opponents. UNM must remain an effective opposition party to counter GD coalition's potential constraints on democracy. President Saakashvili's commitment to democracy is questioned, with concerns that he may use illicit means to hinder GD initiatives. Some analysts warn of Saakashvili potentially carrying out another coup, citing past excessive force against opposition. Others suggest cooperation between GD and UNM on social policies, with GD possibly seeking UNM support for legislation. GD may try to attract UNM legislators to pass legislation, but it is unlikely they can gather enough votes to impeach the president. Outgoing Prime Minister assured fiscal balance is healthy. Concerns raised about potential decrease in investment and foreign assistance due to political turmoil. Saakashvili and Ivanishvili met, with Ivanishvili pledging a peaceful transfer of power and no prosecutions against the opposition. The win by GD in the 2013 presidential election sets the stage for constitutional changes granting more power to the legislature and prime minister. The changes allow the party with the most seats in the legislature to nominate the prime minister, who will select ministers and draft a program for approval by the legislature. Regional governors will also be affected by the changes. President Saakashvili and GD leader Ivanishvili agreed on the foreign policy direction and a peaceful transfer of power. The president will confirm the prime minister under new constitutional changes, with regional governors appointed by the prime minister. Concerns raised by the Venice Commission about presidential powers overshadowing those of the prime minister and clashes on foreign policy. Russia maintained noninterference in the election, with Putin welcoming the election results and expressing readiness for dialogue on Georgia-Russia ties. The Georgian election marked the \"end of color revolutions\" according to Russian state television, signaling a decrease in U.S. influence in the region. Saakashvili will not run in the 2013 presidential election but plans to remain in politics. He denied intentions to become prime minister after the election. Saakashvili will not run in the 2013 presidential election but plans to remain in politics. Despite speculation about his future role, the Obama Administration showed interest in the election by sending a delegation to Georgia. The White House congratulated Georgia on its peaceful democratic election in 2012 and called for cooperation between Ivanishvili and Saakashvili for continued democracy and economic development. Several Members of Congress observed the election and emphasized the democratic procedures followed by President Saakashvili. Senator John McCain, Senator Joe Lieberman, and Senator Lindsey Graham commended President Saakashvili for Georgia's peaceful election, while expressing concerns about Ivanishvili's calls for resignation and protests by GD supporters. Lieutenant General John Paxton visited Georgia post-election, congratulating Ivanishvili and emphasizing continued U.S. support for cooperation. Ivanishvili praised U.S. assistance in modernizing Georgia's military and pledged to continue partnership in Afghanistan and other military cooperation. He announced his first foreign visit to the United States after the presidential election, as the U.S. is Georgia's principal partner. Secretary Clinton urged a peaceful transition of power in Georgia and thanked Ivanishvili for deepening ties with the United States. Some observers have raised concerns about two parties in the GD coalition not supporting NATO membership for Georgia. Ivanishvili supports closer relations with NATO and the United States, aiming to accelerate Georgia's democratization to meet NATO's standards for membership. However, concerns have been raised about his links to Russia and intentions to improve Georgia-Russia ties. Observers worry about his past business dealings with Russia, suggesting Kremlin involvement. The Kremlin's active involvement in Georgia-Russia relations raises concerns about potential conditions for improved bilateral ties. Ivanishvili rejects Moscow's claim of independence for South Ossetia and Abkhazia, emphasizing Georgia's sovereignty. Political in-fighting within the ruling party and with former President Saakashvili could escalate before the 2013 presidential election, as the UNM plans to retain power. Constitutional changes may lead to a prolonged divided political situation, requiring statesmanship and a commitment to compromise for good governance. Observers stress that statesmanship and a commitment to compromise are essential for Georgia's democratization. Political instability in Georgia could jeopardize its role as a trade corridor for oil, gas, and NATO goods. This instability could give Russia leverage, forcing Azerbaijan to rely more on Russian export routes and potentially increasing Russia's significance as a transit route. Rising instability in Georgia could also provide opportunities for Russian influence, impacting regional security. The regional security situation in Georgia is of concern to many, with pressure on Azerbaijan to align with a less pro-Western foreign policy. Congress supports Georgia's independence and development, especially amidst ongoing political transitions."
