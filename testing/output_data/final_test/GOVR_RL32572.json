    "content": "The Trump Administration's Nuclear Posture Review, released on February 2, 2018, includes plans for the United States to deploy two new types of nuclear weapons to counter Russia's deployment of lower-yield nonstrategic nuclear weapons. These new capabilities consist of a low-yield nuclear warhead for submarines and a sea-launched cruise missile for Navy ships or submarines. The report emphasizes the need for flexibility and responsiveness in U.S. nuclear forces. The Nuclear Posture Review recommends expanding U.S. nuclear options to include low-yield weapons for credible deterrence against regional aggression. Concerns about new nuclear challenges have led to discussions about deploying dual-capable aircraft and nuclear bombs in Eastern Europe. The Nuclear Posture Review recommends expanding U.S. nuclear options to include low-yield weapons for credible deterrence against regional aggression. Representatives Rogers and Turner noted that Russian actions in 2014 threatened European security and warranted a more potent U.S. response. Some analysts have called for the deployment of more nuclear weapons in Europe in response to Russia's aggression, while others argue for enhancing NATO's conventional capabilities instead. The debate on possible new deployments of U.S. nonstrategic nuclear weapons differs from previous years, with concerns about Russia's larger stockpile and the threat it poses to U.S. allies in Europe. Some argue for expanding U.S. deployments for deterrence, while others suggest enhancing NATO's conventional capabilities. The United States sought negotiations with Russia to address the disparity in non-strategic nuclear weapons stockpiles, but Russia has shown little interest in such talks. Russia has shown little interest in negotiating with the United States regarding nonstrategic nuclear weapons until the US removes its weapons from bases in Europe. The US and NATO are exploring transparency measures for these weapons. The report discusses the differences between strategic and nonstrategic nuclear weapons, historical background, deployment numbers, policies, and reduction efforts by both nations. During the Cold War, nuclear weapons were crucial for deterring Soviet aggression. The United States deployed various systems like nuclear mines, artillery, missiles, cruise missiles, and bombs. The report reviews issues with U.S. and Russian nonstrategic nuclear weapons and suggests policy options for Congress and other nations to address these issues. During the Cold War, the United States developed a complex strategy for using nuclear weapons on various platforms like aircraft, ships, submarines, and land-based launchers. Discussions focused on long-range nuclear weapons such as ICBMs, SLBMs, and bombers carrying cruise missiles or gravity bombs to deter Soviet aggression. During the Cold War, both the United States and the Soviet Union deployed thousands of nuclear weapons, including nonstrategic ones for battlefield use. The deployment of these weapons outside their territories sparked public protests and arms control debates in the 1980s. During the Cold War, the United States and Soviet Union deployed numerous nuclear weapons, including nonstrategic ones. In the 1980s, public protests and arms control debates arose over the deployment of these weapons outside their territories. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, significant arms control agreements were signed, such as the 1987 INF Treaty and announcements by Presidents Bush and Gorbachev to withdraw and eliminate nonstrategic nuclear weapons. These initiatives addressed concerns about the safety of Soviet nuclear weapons amidst political and economic turmoil, allowing the US to adjust its forces in response to changing international security dynamics. In the 1990s, efforts focused on strategic nuclear weapons, with discussions on nonstrategic weapons included. President Clinton and Russia's President Yeltsin signed an agreement to address nonstrategic nuclear weapons in a potential START III Treaty. Questions and concerns about the safety of these weapons persisted among analysts, U.S. government officials, and Members of Congress. In the late 1990s, the U.S. government and Congress raised concerns about the safety of Russia's nonstrategic nuclear weapons. Questions were raised about their role in Russia's security strategy, their deployment in the U.S. arsenal, and their impact on nonproliferation policy. The 9/11 attacks highlighted the risks of terrorists acquiring nuclear weapons, with a focus on Russia's potentially insecure stockpile. The George W. Bush Administration did not have a clear policy on reducing these weapons. The George W. Bush Administration quietly redeployed and withdrew some nonstrategic nuclear weapons from bases in Europe without discussing with Russia during arms control negotiations in 2002. The Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty (Moscow Treaty) signed in June 2002 only limited the number of operationally deployed warheads on strategic nuclear weapons. The Moscow Treaty signed in 2002 did not address nonstrategic nuclear weapons, leading to concerns in Congress about Russia's deployment of these weapons. The FY2006 Defense Authorization Act called for further study on U.S. and Russian nonstrategic nuclear weapons to determine their impact on national security. In response to concerns about Russia's nonstrategic nuclear weapons, Congress called for reports on U.S. efforts to improve accounting and security. Legislation in the 109th and 110th Congress aimed to address this issue but did not progress significantly. In response to concerns about Russia's nonstrategic nuclear weapons, Congress called for reports on U.S. efforts to improve accounting and security. Legislation in the 109th and 110th Congress aimed to address this issue but did not progress significantly. The debate on nonstrategic nuclear weapons has been elevated in recent years, with calls for nations to eliminate short-range nuclear weapons designed for forward deployment. The Congress called for dialogue within NATO and with Russia to enhance security of smaller nuclear weapons designed for forward deployment, which are potential targets for terrorist groups. A Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States addressed the role of nonstrategic nuclear weapons in U.S. national security strategy, emphasizing their importance in assuring allies of U.S. commitment to their security. The 110th Congress mandated a new Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) to reduce the roles and numbers of nuclear weapons in the U.S. arsenal. The NPR recognized the importance of U.S. nonstrategic nuclear weapons in assuring allies of U.S. commitment to their security. The United States indicated its commitment to forward-deploying nuclear weapons on tactical fighter-bombers and expanding consultations with allies to ensure the credibility of the U.S. extended deterrent. Discussions on the presence of U.S. nonstrategic nuclear weapons in Europe and their role in NATO's strategy increased during the drafting of NATO's strategic concept. Some NATO nations called for the removal of these weapons, while others argued for their retention for political reasons. Some NATO nations argued for retaining nonstrategic nuclear weapons in Europe to maintain a political role in NATO and balance Russia's deployment. The Strategic Concept did not call for their removal, emphasizing the importance of deterrence with a mix of nuclear and conventional capabilities. NATO nations share responsibility for these weapons and would be involved in decisions regarding their use. NATO recognized the importance of nonstrategic nuclear weapons in maintaining deterrence and defense capabilities. A comprehensive review was conducted in 2012, which reaffirmed the role of nuclear weapons as a core component of NATO's capabilities. No changes were recommended to NATO's nuclear posture. NATO reaffirmed the importance of nuclear weapons as a core element of its deterrence and defense strategy during summits in 2014 and 2016. The alliance did not call for additional nuclear weapons in Europe but emphasized the value of U.S. nuclear weapons deployed in Europe and nuclear sharing arrangements among allies. NATO reiterated its commitment to nuclear weapons as a key part of its defense strategy, highlighting the importance of U.S. nuclear forces in Europe. The alliance also implemented initiatives in response to Russian aggression, but these are unlikely to change the number of deployed nuclear weapons. The 2018 Nuclear Posture Review echoes past documents, such as the 2009 Strategic Posture Commission Report. The 2018 Nuclear Posture Review (NPR) highlights the imbalance in U.S. and Russian nonstrategic nuclear weapons, with Russia increasing reliance on these weapons for national security strategy. It suggests Russia could use these weapons to coerce the U.S. and NATO allies during a conventional conflict in Europe. The NPR also supports NATO's nuclear modernization and planning changes, emphasizing the U.S.' commitment to upgrading dual capable aircraft with the nuclear-capable F-35. The 2018 NPR calls for upgrading dual capable aircraft with nuclear-capable F-35s and developing a new sea-launched cruise missile (SLCM) to strengthen deterrence. It disputes the 2010 NPR's conclusion on the redundancy of Tomahawk nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missiles. The curr_chunk discusses the distinction between strategic and nonstrategic nuclear weapons, highlighting the military definitions and missions associated with each. Strategic missions target enemy systems for progressive destruction, while tactical operations focus on immediate battlefield use. Strategic operations have a long-range effect on the enemy, unlike tactical operations. During the Cold War, strategic and nonstrategic nuclear weapons were distinguishable by their capabilities suited for different missions. During the Cold War, strategic nuclear weapons had the power to attack key Soviet targets, while nonstrategic nuclear weapons were more suitable for battlefield operations due to their smaller size and range limitations. Both the United States and Russia deployed nuclear weapons that challenged traditional understandings. During the Cold War, the United States and Russia deployed nuclear weapons that blurred the distinction between strategic and nonstrategic categories. For instance, Soviet submarine-launched ballistic missiles with short ranges patrolled close to U.S. shores to reach strategic targets, while U.S. sea-launched cruise missiles were considered nonstrategic but could target similar sites if deployed near Soviet borders. During the Cold War, both the United States and Russia deployed nuclear weapons that challenged the traditional categorization of strategic and nonstrategic systems. The range of delivery vehicles did not always align with the types of targets or objectives associated with the warheads carried. This ambiguity has persisted post-Cold War as many shorter- and medium-range delivery systems have been retired by both countries. During the Cold War, the distinction between strategic and nonstrategic nuclear weapons was blurred as delivery systems and warhead yields overlapped. Modern systems have further eroded this distinction, with both the US and Russia capable of carrying lower-yield warheads on heavy bombers. Improved accuracy allows for the same level of destruction with smaller warheads, challenging traditional arms control definitions. The distinction between strategic and nonstrategic nuclear weapons during the Cold War was not always precise and may not be relevant in the future. Strategic weapons like ICBMs, SLBMs, and heavy bombers are covered by arms control agreements, while nonstrategic weapons are not. This report considers all weapons not covered by these treaties as nonstrategic nuclear weapons. Since the early 1990s, the US and Russia have reduced their nonstrategic nuclear weapons and launchers. However, both countries still include these weapons in their national security strategies. Russia allows for potential use in regional conflicts, while the US maintains these capabilities in its nuclear arsenal. The United States maintains nonstrategic nuclear weapons in its arsenal, including plans for new types of weapons as outlined in the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review. The sea-launched cruise missile fits the definition of nonstrategic nuclear weapons, while a new low-yield warhead for submarine-launched ballistic missiles presents a more complex classification issue. The United States maintains nonstrategic nuclear weapons in its arsenal, including plans for new types of weapons as outlined in the 2018 Nuclear Posture Review. Secretary of Defense James Mattis stated that any nuclear weapon used is a strategic game changer, complicating efforts to distinguish between strategic and nonstrategic SLBMs. NPR's use of \"non-strategic nuclear weapons\" reflects a different definition of strategic effect, where any use of nuclear weapons could escalate conflict beyond the immediate battlefield. The distinction between strategic and nonstrategic weapons is based on target nature or conflict implications, not yield or delivery method. During the Cold War, the US deployed shorter-range nuclear weapons globally to extend deterrence and defend allies. During the Cold War, the US deployed non-strategic nuclear weapons to increase the likelihood of defending allies against aggression and to deter adversaries. These weapons were part of NATO's strategy of \"flexible response\" to control escalation and convince the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact of the risk of nuclear retaliation in any conflict. During the Cold War, NATO acknowledged the reduced need for nuclear weapons to deter a conventional attack from the Soviet Union. However, these weapons still played a crucial political role in ensuring uncertainty in the mind of potential aggressors. The US adjusted its nonstrategic nuclear forces in response to changing threats, deploying them in Asia and on NATO allies' territories to share responsibility for their defense. The United States and NATO allies reduced nonstrategic nuclear warheads from over 7,000 in the mid-1970s to below 6,000 in the 1980s and fewer than 1,000 by the mid-1990s. This was done to maintain deterrence with fewer, more modern weapons. NATO agreed to deploy new intermediate-range nuclear weapons in Europe in 1970, leading to the removal of 1,000 older nuclear weapons. Further reductions were called for in the Montebello Decision in 1983, with modernization programs continuing through the 1980s. In the 1980s, the United States completed various modernization programs for its nuclear arsenal, including deploying Pershing II and ground-launched cruise missiles in Europe, upgrading nuclear artillery shells, and developing new weapons for naval forces. However, as the Warsaw Pact dissolved, the US canceled or scaled back these programs and signed the INF Treaty in 1987, eliminating ground-launched shorter and intermediate-range ballistic and cruise missiles. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union heavily integrated nuclear weapons into its military strategy, emphasizing surprise and preemptive attacks. They planned to use nonstrategic nuclear weapons in theaters of war to achieve success and divert enemy forces. The Soviet Union began reducing its emphasis on nuclear weapons over time. Soviet Union reduced emphasis on nuclear warfighting strategies in the mid-1980s under President Mikhail Gorbachev. Nuclear weapons remained key for deterring conflict with US and NATO. Various delivery vehicles deployed for nonstrategic nuclear weapons at nearly 600 bases. In 1991, the Soviet Union had over 20,000 nonstrategic nuclear weapons, possibly more in earlier years. President Bush and President Gorbachev made unilateral initiatives to reduce their Cold War nuclear arsenals, with the US withdrawing all land-based and sea-based tactical nuclear weapons. In 1991, the United States began dismantling approximately 2,150 warheads from various delivery systems, including missiles, artillery shells, and weapons deployed on surface ships and submarines. NATO decided to reduce the number of nuclear-capable aircraft weapons in Europe by half, leading to the withdrawal of 700 U.S. air-delivered nuclear weapons. By mid-1992, nonstrategic nuclear weapons were removed from bases worldwide, and the Navy had withdrawn nuclear weapons from its ships, submarines, and forward bases. The warhead dismantlement process took most of the 1990s to complete due to capacity limits at the Pantex Plant in Texas. The first Bush Administration decided to withdraw weapons as the threat they were meant to deter had diminished with the collapse of the Warsaw Pact in 1989. The military utility of land-based and sea-based weapons had also declined with changes in warfighting concepts after the Cold War. The withdrawal of sea-based weapons helped ease tensions with allies uncomfortable with nuclear presence. The President's announcement addressed concerns about the safety of Soviet nonstrategic nuclear weapons deployed in remote areas and Eastern Europe. The U.S. initiative was independent of Soviet response and aimed to encourage similar actions from President Gorbachev. President Gorbachev responded to the U.S. initiative by agreeing to withdraw and eliminate nonstrategic nuclear weapons, including destroying nuclear artillery ammunition, warheads for tactical missiles, and naval nonstrategic weapons. Estimates suggested the Soviet Union had between 15,000-21,700 nonstrategic nuclear weapons in 1991. Russia's President Boris Yeltsin pledged to continue these efforts. Russia's President Boris Yeltsin pledged to continue implementing measures to destroy nonstrategic nuclear weapons, including warheads from various sources like short-range missiles, artillery, and air-defense interceptors. The Soviet Union had already begun removing these weapons from bases outside its territory after the collapse of the Warsaw Pact. Reports indicate that nonstrategic nuclear weapons were removed from former Soviet states after the collapse of the Soviet Union. By the end of 1991, they were eliminated from the Baltic States and Central Asian republics, and by mid-late spring 1992 from Ukraine and Belarus. The status of these weapons on Russian territory is uncertain, with naval systems removed by 1993, but Army and Air Force systems remaining until 1996 and 1997. Russia has been slower than the United States in eliminating these warheads, raising concerns about their continued existence and Russia's nuclear strategy. Russia's national security strategy may involve reintroducing nonstrategic nuclear weapons into its deployed forces. NATO views these weapons as crucial for deterrence and alliance cohesion, as stated in a press communiqu\u00e9 from a 1995 meeting. NATO's strategic unity is demonstrated through the basing of deployable sub-strategic nuclear forces in Europe. In various agreements and documents, NATO has affirmed the importance of maintaining a mix of nuclear and conventional forces for deterrence and peacekeeping purposes. NATO's Strategic Concept in November 2010 emphasized the importance of deterrence with a mix of nuclear and conventional capabilities. The alliance would maintain nuclear forces to deter and defend against any threat, with the US strategic nuclear forces being a key element. The 2010 NATO Strategic Concept highlighted the importance of deterrence with a mix of nuclear and conventional capabilities. It mentioned the strategic nuclear forces of the United States, the UK, and France contributing to overall deterrence and security. The document also alluded to the possibility of further nuclear weapons reductions globally and within the alliance in the future, aiming for a world without nuclear weapons while ensuring undiminished security for all. NATO had significantly reduced the number of nuclear weapons in Europe and minimized the role of nuclear weapons in its strategy. The 2010 NATO Strategic Concept emphasized deterrence with a mix of nuclear and conventional capabilities, aiming for further reductions in nuclear weapons. The document highlighted the need for transparency on Russian nuclear weapons in Europe and addressing the disparity in nonstrategic nuclear weapons. NATO recognized the security concerns posed by this disparity and agreed to review its deterrence and defense posture by May 2012. The Deterrence and Defense Posture Review (DDPR) was conducted to assess NATO's capabilities, including nuclear weapons and missile defense, for the 2012 summit in Chicago. The review concluded that NATO's nuclear posture was effective and essential for deterrence and defense, with shared responsibilities among member nations. NATO emphasizes broad participation in nuclear planning and policymaking, including arms control measures with Russia. The alliance seeks transparency and confidence-building with Russia regarding non-strategic nuclear forces in Europe. NATO will assess reciprocal Russian actions for significant reductions in non-strategic nuclear weapons. NATO has reviewed and revised its nuclear posture in response to Russia's actions, focusing on reducing non-strategic nuclear weapons. Summits in Wales, Warsaw, and Brussels addressed the role of nuclear weapons in NATO strategy, emphasizing the defense of all allies against potential attacks. NATO reaffirmed the importance of nuclear deterrence in alliance security, highlighting the role of strategic forces, including those of the United States, the UK, and France. The statement also emphasized the reliance on US nuclear weapons deployed in Europe and capabilities provided by Allies. Additionally, concerns about Russian nuclear doctrine were addressed, emphasizing the need for a strong nuclear deterrence posture. The statement at the Warsaw Summit emphasized NATO's capabilities to impose costs on an adversary in case of a threat to its members. It also acknowledged strains in the arms control relationship with Russia, highlighting the importance of arms control, disarmament, and non-proliferation in achieving security objectives. The communique from the Brussels summit in July 2018 reiterated the importance of honoring disarmament and non-proliferation commitments under existing treaties, specifically calling on Russia to comply with the INF Treaty. It emphasized the need to bolster deterrence as a core element of collective defense, based on a mix of nuclear, conventional, and missile defense capabilities. This robust deterrence and defense posture strengthens Alliance cohesion and provides a vital transatlantic link. The 2018 communique emphasized the importance of equitable distribution of roles and responsibilities among allies. It also expressed concerns about Russia's violation of the INF Treaty, highlighting the need for full compliance. Discussions on U.S. nuclear weapons policy have focused on the role of nonstrategic nuclear weapons in extended deterrence. The U.S. deploys nuclear weapons in Europe and Asia as part of its assurance to allies in NATO and Asia for defense. Recent debates question the necessity of maintaining these weapons for extended deterrence, suggesting other military capabilities may suffice. The Obama Administration's 2010 Nuclear Posture Review emphasized the commitment to assure allies and partners. The United States reassures allies of its commitment to security through actions, not just words. The NPR outlines a wide range of military capabilities to support this goal, including a nuclear dimension as long as threats exist. The Administration plans to retire nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missiles in Asia, believing other capabilities can still provide security assurances. The 2010 NPR outlined regional security architectures as a key part of the U.S. strategy to strengthen deterrence and reduce nuclear weapons. This approach includes missile defense, counter-WMD capabilities, conventional power projection, and integrated command and control, all backed by strong political commitments. The U.S. aims to reassure allies in Asia and deter security threats without deploying sea-based cruise missiles, relying on a range of military capabilities and political commitments instead. The 2018 Nuclear Posture Review reaffirms the U.S. commitment to NATO and allies in the Asia-Pacific region, despite President Trump's previous questioning of alliance relationships and the relevance of NATO. The NPR emphasizes the importance of U.S. assurances to allies in Europe and Asia in the face of regional threats. The 2018 NPR focuses on enhancing U.S. nuclear capabilities and addresses concerns about the credibility of U.S. assurances to allies in Europe and Asia. It recommends developing two new types of nonstrategic nuclear weapons to strengthen extended deterrence. During the Clinton Administration, former Secretary of Defense Perry emphasized the importance of maintaining U.S. nuclear commitments with NATO for deterring aggression, protecting U.S. interests, and reassuring allies. The United States has maintained the option to use nuclear weapons in response to attacks with conventional, chemical, or biological weapons, even after the Cold War and the demise of the Soviet Union. Assistant Secretary of Defense Edward Warner highlighted the U.S. capability for a rapid and devastating military response in 1999. The U.S. strategy for deterring rogue nation threats includes a strong military response using nuclear and conventional forces. The use of nonstrategic nuclear weapons for tactical objectives was not clearly defined in the 1990s, but the Bush Administration in 2001 emphasized their possible use in regional conflicts. The Bush Administration in 2001 acknowledged the possibility of using nuclear weapons in response to attacks by nations with chemical, biological, and conventional weapons. Analysts believed the U.S. was planning for the tactical, first use of nuclear weapons, although the administration never confirmed this. The Obama Administration took a different approach. The Obama Administration's 2010 NPR stated that the US would not use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapons states in compliance with the NPT. The US would respond with conventional force to attacks using conventional, chemical, or biological weapons, without threatening nuclear retaliation. The 2018 NPR reiterates the policy that the US will not use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapons states in compliance with the NPT. It also reserves the right to adjust this assurance based on the evolution of non-nuclear strategic attack technologies. The 2018 NPR emphasizes the US policy of not using nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapons states, but reserves the right to adjust this assurance based on evolving non-nuclear strategic attack technologies. The Trump Administration includes a wider range of circumstances where the US might retaliate with nuclear weapons after an attack, expanding beyond the Obama Administration's stance. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the US maintained around 1,100 nonstrategic nuclear weapons, with approximately 500 air-delivered bombs deployed in Europe. After the Clinton Administration's 1994 Nuclear Posture Review, the United States eliminated its ability to return nuclear weapons to U.S. surface ships and consolidated its weapons storage sites for nonstrategic nuclear weapons. It reduced the number of facilities by over 75% between 1988 and 1994, eliminated two of its four storage sites for sea-launched cruise missiles, and retained only one facility on each coast of the United States. The Bush Administration maintained the status quo for U.S. nonstrategic nuclear weapons after the 2001 Nuclear Posture Review. Reports suggest they kept the capability to deploy cruise missiles on submarines for global crisis response. The deployment of nonstrategic nuclear weapons in Europe was left to NATO members, with the U.S. reducing the number of weapons and storage facilities during the George W. Bush Administration. During the George W. Bush Administration, most U.S. nuclear weapons were withdrawn from Europe between 2001 and 2006. Some are stored at U.S. bases and would be delivered by U.S. aircraft, while others are stored at bases operated by the host nation. The Obama Administration did not announce further reductions but indicated consultation with allies on future basing. Some European politicians proposed the withdrawal of U.S. nuclear weapons, with Germany's foreign minister supporting the idea. NATO did not call for their removal. The Obama Administration indicated in the 2010 NPR that it would maintain the capability to deploy U.S. nuclear weapons in Europe, including conducting a life extension program for the B61 bomb to ensure functionality with the new F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. This program will consolidate multiple versions of the B61 bomb into one version, the B61-12. NATO did not call for the removal of these weapons but expressed openness to reducing them through arms control negotiations with Russia. The Obama Administration's 2010 NPR indicated the consolidation of the B61 bombs into the B61-12 version with enhanced safety features. The U.S. Navy planned to retire its TLAM-N sea-launched cruise missiles as they were deemed redundant in the nuclear stockpile. This decision was based on the capability of ICBMs and SLBMs to strike any potential adversary, allowing the U.S. to extend deterrence and provide assurance to allies in Asia without the need for TLAM-N missiles. The 2018 NPR reaffirms U.S. nuclear policies and programs, including maintaining the capability to forward deploy nuclear bombers and dual-capable aircraft around the world. It also emphasizes U.S. support for NATO's efforts to ensure deterrence and defense posture against potential adversaries. The 2018 NPR emphasizes enhancing NATO's DCA readiness and survivability, promoting Allies' burden sharing, and improving training programs. It also reverses the decision to remove sea-launched cruise missiles, citing the need for a non-strategic regional presence with flexible and low-yield capabilities. The 2018 NPR emphasizes enhancing NATO's DCA readiness and survivability, promoting Allies' burden sharing, and improving training programs. It also mentions a new SLCM program as a response to Russia's violation of the INF Treaty and a necessary incentive for Russia to negotiate reduction of its non-strategic nuclear weapons. Russia has altered its nuclear strategy post-Cold War, rejecting the no-first-use pledge but not maintaining the need for surprise or preemptive attacks with nuclear weapons. Russia has revised its national security and military strategy in the past 20 years, placing a greater reliance on nuclear weapons for defense and retaliation. The doctrine allows for the use of nuclear weapons in response to threats against Russia or its allies, including attacks with weapons of mass destruction or large-scale aggression using conventional weapons critical to national security. In mid-2009, Nikolai Patrushev mentioned Russia's option for a preemptive nuclear strike in defense strategy discussions. However, the final 2010 doctrine did not authorize preemptive nuclear use, stating Russia's right to respond with nuclear weapons to attacks with weapons of mass destruction or conventional weapons endangering the state's existence. This narrowed the circumstances for nuclear weapon use compared to the 2000 version. Russia's nuclear doctrine has evolved to allow for the use of nuclear weapons in a case that threatens the very existence of the state. While Russia may not use nuclear weapons at the start of a conflict, they could resort to them during an ongoing conventional conflict. Factors contributing to Russia's reliance on nuclear weapons include the lack of resources for a strong conventional army after the Soviet Union's collapse. Russia's conventional military forces faced weaknesses in conflicts in Chechnya and Georgia, leading to concerns about threats from former Soviet states. Russia's fear of NATO enlargement and potential nuclear threats contributed to the idea of using nuclear weapons for national survival. NATO's air campaign in Kosovo in 1999 highlighted Russia's perceived weakness and NATO's growing assertiveness. The National Security Concept of Russia in 2000 highlighted the growing military threat and the need for nuclear deterrence against aggression. Russia believed it should possess nuclear forces capable of inflicting damage on any aggressor state or coalition. This was influenced by NATO's air campaign in Kosovo in 1999, which emphasized Russia's perceived weakness and NATO's increasing assertiveness. In the late 1990s, Russia debated the role of nuclear weapons in its national security strategy, focusing on both strategic and nonstrategic nuclear weapons. After the conflict in Kosovo, the government decided to modernize and expand nonstrategic nuclear weapons, with President Yeltsin endorsing the development and deployment of tactical and strategic nuclear weapons. This decision was seen as a response to perceived threats around the borders of the former Soviet Union. Russia debated the role of nuclear weapons in its national security strategy in the late 1990s, focusing on strategic and nonstrategic nuclear weapons. After the conflict in Kosovo, the government decided to modernize and expand nonstrategic nuclear weapons. Some analysts believed Russia was \"walking back\" from its obligation to withdraw nonstrategic nuclear weapons, while others speculated on Russia's development of operations plans for limited nuclear war with strategic means. Russia was also believed to be pursuing the modernization of existing nonstrategic nuclear weapons and the development of new nuclear warheads for shorter-range missiles. Russia's concern about NATO's potential threat is highlighted in its 2010 and 2014 military doctrines, which emphasize the dangers of NATO's military infrastructure moving closer to Russian borders. The presence of NATO troops near Russia is viewed as a security threat, including U.S. missile defense assets. Russia's concern about NATO's potential threat is highlighted in its military doctrines, emphasizing the dangers of NATO's military infrastructure moving closer to Russian borders. This includes U.S. missile defense assets in Poland, Romania, and near Russian territory as part of the European Phased Adaptive Approach. Russia's doctrine allows for the possible use of nonstrategic nuclear weapons during a local or regional conflict on its periphery, with the right to use them in response. Analysts refer to this approach as the \"escalate to de-escalate\" doctrine, supported by military exercises simulating the use of nuclear weapons against NATO members. Russia's use of nonstrategic nuclear weapons to coerce or intimidate neighbors, especially NATO members, has raised concerns. This strategy, combined with recent statements emphasizing Russia's nuclear deterrent, suggests an increased role of nuclear weapons in its military planning. The 2018 Nuclear Posture Review criticizes Russia's belief that nuclear threats could de-escalate conflicts in its favor. The NPR recommends the US develop low-yield nonstrategic weapons to deter Russia from miscalculating nuclear first use consequences. Uncertainty surrounds the number of Russian nonstrategic nuclear weapons due to factors like past Soviet stockpiles. Analysts estimate the Soviet Union may have deployed 15,000-25,000 nonstrategic nuclear weapons in the late 1980s and early 1990s. During the 1990s, Russian officials claimed to have completed mandated weapons withdrawals and were eliminating warheads at a rate of 2,000 per year. However, doubts exist regarding the speed of this process due to financial and technical limitations. Russian officials have provided shifting deadlines for the elimination process, with statements suggesting completion by 2004. In 2007, Russia's Ministry of Defense confirmed the elimination of all warheads. The Ministry of Defense confirmed Russia's completion of eliminating warheads for ground forces, missile defense, air force, and naval forces. Russia revised in 2010 that it reduced nonstrategic nuclear weapons by 75%. Russian officials stated they would retain tactical nuclear weapons in response to U.S. plans. Russia has reduced military bases capable of deploying nonstrategic nuclear weapons. Russia has consolidated its storage areas for nonstrategic nuclear weapons, with an estimated 50 operational storage sites. Uncertainties remain in estimating Russia's nonstrategic nuclear forces, with some sources suggesting up to 4,000 warheads. Recent estimates indicate Russia may have around 2,000 nonstrategic nuclear warheads assigned for delivery. Russia may have around 2,000 nonstrategic nuclear warheads assigned for delivery by air, naval, and defensive forces. The navy maintains about 760 warheads for various purposes, while the Air Force has 570 warheads for delivery by fighters and bombers. Some warheads are allocated to air and missile defense forces, with estimates ranging from 1,000 to 2,000 operational warheads for nonstrategic nuclear weapons. Russia is modernizing its nonstrategic nuclear forces by phasing out older weapons and replacing them with newer, more advanced ones. There are around 2,000 nonstrategic nuclear warheads in total, with 760 warheads for the navy and 570 for the Air Force. Some experts believe Russia may retire more weapons than it acquires as it develops more advanced conventional weapons. Russia is expanding its nonstrategic nuclear forces, including a ground-launched cruise missile in violation of the 1987 INF Treaty. The 2018 Nuclear Posture Review highlights Russia's increase in such weapons and delivery capabilities. Russia violated the 1987 INF Treaty by deploying the 9M729 missile in late 2016. The Cold War standoff between the U.S. and Soviet Union involved nonstrategic nuclear weapons, but the changing international security environment has impacted discussions on this topic in the past 25 years. The changing international security environment in the past 25 years has affected discussions on nonstrategic nuclear weapons, involving U.S. and Russian forces. Both nations consider threats from other adversaries and nonstate actors, highlighting the potential use of nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons. The 2018 Nuclear Posture Review emphasizes the deployment of these weapons for deterrence and response. The 2018 Nuclear Posture Review highlights the deployment of new sea-launched cruise missiles to address threats from North Korea and other nations like India and Pakistan potentially using nuclear weapons in conflicts. These nations continue to review and revise their nuclear strategies, raising questions about the role of nuclear weapons in future conflicts. Pakistan and China have considered deploying short-range tactical nuclear weapons for battlefield use. Concerns have been raised about the potential use of nuclear weapons in conflicts over Taiwan or other areas of China's interests. The report acknowledges the role of nonstrategic nuclear weapons in these nations. During the 2010 New START Treaty debate, Senators expressed concerns about Russian nonstrategic nuclear weapons not covered by the treaty. Russia's possession of a large number of nonstrategic nuclear weapons, concerns about their vulnerability to theft or sale, and the possibility of deploying them in Crimea have raised alarm among some Members. Russia's Foreign Minister suggested the deployment of nuclear weapons in Crimea, which has sparked concerns among NATO allies. The 2018 Nuclear Posture Review continues to highlight worries about Russia's nonstrategic nuclear weapons. The 2018 Nuclear Posture Review raises concerns about Russia's nonstrategic nuclear weapons and their modernization. Debates have questioned the reliance on nuclear weapons for security in NATO and the deployment of U.S. nonstrategic nuclear weapons in Europe. The 112th Congress supported further cooperation between the US and Russia on nonstrategic nuclear weapons reduction. However, recent events like Russia's actions in Crimea and Ukraine have shifted the tone of discussions, leading to less focus on reducing US nuclear weapons in Europe and transparency measures with Russia. Cooperation prospects with Russia appear limited. NATO has enhanced its nuclear capabilities in response to limited cooperation prospects with Russia due to reported violations of the INF Treaty. Concerns arise from Russia's deployment of nonstrategic nuclear weapons, including issues of safety, security, and central control. Economic instability in Russia during the 1990s raised doubts about the reliability of troops responsible for safeguarding these weapons, leading to fears of potential loss, theft, or unauthorized transfer. Some analysts express concerns about the security risks posed by Russian nonstrategic nuclear weapons, including the possibility of accidental, unauthorized, or mistaken use, as well as the risk of terrorist groups acquiring these weapons. Russian officials deny the possibility of losing control over these weapons, citing improvements in security measures since the 1990s. Despite no public evidence of lost, sold, or stolen Russian nuclear weapons, concerns persist about the potential unauthorized transfer of these weapons. Concerns persist about the security risks of Russian nonstrategic nuclear weapons, with worries about potential unauthorized transfer to rogue nations or terrorists. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates expressed concerns about Russia's unknown stockpiles of nuclear weapons, but Russian officials maintain that their nuclear weapons are secure. Analysts fear Russia's increased reliance on nuclear weapons could lead to their early use in conflicts, posing a risk to the United States and its allies. Concerns exist about Russia's nonstrategic nuclear weapons potentially leading to wider conflicts involving NATO or neighboring countries. Russia may use these weapons to counter perceived threats from NATO's expansion. The Strategic Posture Commission has expressed worry about Russia's large stockpile of nonstrategic nuclear weapons stored for possible military operations. The imbalance between U.S. and Russian nonstrategic nuclear warheads is concerning to some U.S. allies in Central Europe. However, arguments have been made that Russia's theater nuclear weapons, even if modernized, may not pose a threat to NATO or U.S. allies. Russia's doctrine suggests these weapons would be used in response to weak conventional forces performance in a conflict, which makes it unlikely for NATO to be involved in such a scenario. In a conventional conflict with Russia, it would be unlikely for Russian weapons to target NATO nations, but they could be used in conflicts along Russia's periphery. Recent Russian actions, including aggression in Ukraine and nuclear saber-rattling, have raised concerns about the possibility of Russia using nuclear weapons to challenge NATO's eastern members. This has led to fears of Russia threatening to use nuclear weapons during a crisis with NATO as part of its \"escalate to de-escalate\" strategy. Russia's strategy involves using nonstrategic nuclear weapons to force NATO forces to withdraw or end a conflict on favorable terms. The United States has reduced reliance on nuclear weapons by increasing missile defenses and precision conventional weapons. The focus is on deterring and defeating any nation with weapons of mass destruction. The United States aims to develop capabilities to destroy hardened and deeply buried targets, including bunkers with chemical or biological weapons. The Obama Administration reduced the role of nuclear weapons in regional deterrence strategies, focusing on missile defenses and precision conventional weapons instead. Unlike the Bush Administration, it did not pursue new nuclear weapons capabilities or extend nuclear deterrence to nations with chemical or biological weapons. It stated that nuclear weapons would not be used in response to conventional, chemical, or biological attacks from compliant nations. The Obama Administration reduced the role of nuclear weapons in regional deterrence strategies, focusing on missile defenses and advanced conventional weapons. They planned to retire the Navy's nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missiles but retain and modernize B-61 warheads. Some questioned the wisdom of this policy change, fearing it could signal weakness to adversaries. The Obama Administration reduced the role of nuclear weapons in regional deterrence strategies, focusing on missile defenses and advanced conventional weapons. They planned to retire the Navy's nuclear-armed sea-launched cruise missiles but retain and modernize B-61 warheads. Despite this change, the U.S. maintained the capability to respond to attacks from non-nuclear nations with overwhelming conventional force, ensuring deterrence against aggression. Questions have arisen about the role of U.S. nuclear weapons in regional conflicts, with some analysts debating the necessity of using them unless in retaliation. Others argue that the U.S. may need to threaten or use nuclear weapons when facing a nuclear-armed adversary seeking to intimidate or coerce. Some suggest deploying lower-yield nuclear weapons forward. The 2018 Nuclear Posture Review suggests using forward-deployed nonstrategic nuclear weapons as a credible deterrent threat in regional conflicts. It emphasizes the importance of U.S. extended nuclear deterrence for allies' security and recommends developing two new types of nonstrategic nuclear weapons. The 2018 Nuclear Posture Review advocates for the need of new nuclear weapons for deterrence, despite questions about their necessity after the collapse of the Soviet Union. NATO still views nonstrategic nuclear weapons as a deterrent and a link among member nations. The United States and its allies debated the need for U.S. nonstrategic nuclear weapons deployed in Europe before NATO's Strategic Concept in November 2010. Some NATO nations called for the removal of these weapons to show commitment to a nuclear-free world, supported by President Obama. Some argued for the removal of U.S. nonstrategic nuclear weapons in Europe to meet political goals and ensure security with other means. However, officials in newer NATO nations believed these weapons were still militarily relevant and symbolized U.S. commitment to NATO security. NATO foreign ministers discussed the issue of U.S. nonstrategic nuclear weapons in Europe during a meeting in Tallinn, Estonia in April 2010. There were differing views on whether these weapons should be removed, with some nations feeling threatened by Russia and others arguing for their continued relevance to security and NATO solidarity. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stated that the U.S. was open to reducing the number of nuclear weapons in Europe, but linked this to a reduction in Russian nonstrategic nuclear weapons. Some NATO members question the removal of nuclear weapons from Europe for safety reasons. An Air Force review highlighted security concerns at bases storing U.S. weapons in Europe. Congress suggested expanding deployment of dual-capable aircraft and nuclear bombs. The United States is considering expanding its deployment of dual-capable aircraft and nuclear bombs into eastern NATO nations in response to Russia's aggression in Ukraine. Some suggest deploying new nuclear-armed missiles in Europe following Russia's violation of the 1987 INF Treaty. However, there are concerns that such actions could lead to a new arms race and destabilize security in Europe. NATO has adjusted its conventional force posture in response to Russia's actions. The United States is considering expanding its deployment of dual-capable aircraft and nuclear bombs into eastern NATO nations in response to Russia's aggression in Ukraine. NATO has adjusted its conventional force posture to assure the eastern allies of its ability to defend them. The George W. Bush Administration's nuclear posture aimed to deter the proliferation of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons by creating a credible threat against nations seeking these weapons. Critics questioned the need for new nuclear weapons for deterrence. Critics questioned the need for new nuclear weapons to deter the acquisition or use of WMD by other nations, arguing that U.S. conventional weapons could achieve this objective. They warned that U.S. policy could actually encourage proliferation by reinforcing the idea that nuclear weapons have military utility, potentially sparking a new arms race. The Bush Administration argued that nations acquire nuclear weapons for their own security or to counter U.S. conventional superiority. The Obama Administration, in the 2010 Nuclear Posture Review, changed the U.S. nuclear weapons policy to discourage non-nuclear nations from acquiring weapons of mass destruction by stating they would not use nuclear weapons against them. The U.S. declaratory policy aims to deter nations from acquiring nuclear weapons by stating they would not be targeted if they comply with nonproliferation obligations. This strategy also offers the possibility of being removed from the U.S. nuclear target list for nations like Iran and North Korea if they abandon their nuclear programs. The 2018 Nuclear Posture Review emphasizes the importance of U.S. extended nuclear deterrence in non-proliferation efforts. Some politicians in South Korea have considered acquiring nuclear weapons in response to North Korea's nuclear development. This view challenges the reliability of U.S. security guarantees. Extended deterrence involves more than just U.S. nonstrategic nuclear weapons. The U.S. and Japan engage in the Extended Deterrence Dialogue to discuss regional security issues and demonstrate military capabilities. Concerns about the disparity in U.S. and Russian nonstrategic nuclear weapons have led to discussions on arms control measures. Nonstrategic nuclear weapons have historically been used to counter perceived weaknesses in conventional forces. Some are concerned about the imbalance in nonstrategic nuclear weapons between the United States and Russia, fearing it could lead to intimidation of NATO nations near Russia's borders. This imbalance may become more significant as strategic nuclear weapons are reduced. Some analysts question the significance of the number of nuclear weapons deployed in Europe, suggesting that NATO's ability to resist Russian pressure is more dependent on political cohesion and overall military capabilities. They also point out that many of Russia's nonstrategic nuclear weapons are deployed closer to China than NATO nations, making them less relevant in the balance of power. The United States and Russia should share information on their nonstrategic nuclear weapons to ensure transparency and monitor compliance with PNIs. Previous discussions on transparency measures have not led to agreements, with Russia appearing reluctant to provide necessary information. After NATO completed its new Strategic Concept in 2010 and Deterrence and Defense Posture Review in 2012, experts recognized that NATO was unlikely to approve reductions in U.S. nonstrategic nuclear weapons in Europe unless Russia agreed to similar reductions. Some argued that NATO and Russia should focus on transparency and confidence-building measures before negotiating actual limits or reductions in nonstrategic nuclear weapons. Discussions about types of weapons could be a starting point. Some suggest starting nuclear weapons negotiations with discussions on types of weapons and data exchange. Others argue for transparency measures like sharing storage facility locations to build confidence. Russian officials are currently uninterested in transparency talks or reductions. The United States and Russia negotiate a formal treaty to limit nonstrategic nuclear weapons, following the New START Treaty. This was part of a step-by-step approach outlined by Presidents Obama and Medvedev in 2009 for nuclear arms control. Negotiations for this treaty could be complex and difficult. Negotiating a treaty to limit nonstrategic nuclear weapons between the United States and Russia may be challenging due to disparities in numbers and security concerns. Crafting an agreement that reduces weapons equitably is complex, as imposing equal ceilings or percentage reductions would heavily impact Russia's forces. Agreement on depth of reductions and weapon types may also be difficult to reach. Negotiating a treaty to limit nonstrategic nuclear weapons between the United States and Russia may be challenging due to disparities in numbers and security concerns. Identifying affected weapons and agreeing on depth of reductions could be complex, especially for Russia with various types of nonstrategic nuclear weapons. Some analysts suggest that the next arms control treaty should cover all types of nuclear warheads to address these challenges. The Obama Administration considered a treaty to limit strategic, nonstrategic, and nondeployed nuclear warheads. However, it is uncertain if parties can limit the scope of the treaty beyond deployed strategic weapons. Each side may want to include their own list of threatening weapons in a comprehensive agreement. Russian officials, including Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, believe that a future arms control agreement should include limits on missile defenses, strategic-range weapons with conventional warheads, and weapons in space. Minister Lavrov emphasized the importance of considering all these factors for negotiations on strategic parity and stability. The United States, however, is not interested in including these limits in the next agreement, raising doubts about the possibility of reaching a consensus. Russia may not agree with the United States on which issues and weapons systems to include in future arms control negotiations. Russia may not be interested in limits on nonstrategic nuclear weapons, considering them essential to their military strategy and national security. Progress on limits or transparency measures related to nonstrategic nuclear weapons is unlikely due to the current security atmosphere in Europe. The INF Treaty's collapse has impacted the security atmosphere in Europe and dampened calls for weapon reductions in NATO nations. Both the Obama and Trump Administrations emphasized the need for a conducive strategic environment and willing partners for arms control progress. The 2018 Nuclear Posture Review highlighted Russia's violations of arms control agreements and aggressive actions in Crimea and eastern Ukraine, hindering the possibility of a future arms control agreement between the U.S. and Russia. The NPR discusses the need for a new sea-launched cruise missile as a potential bargaining chip for a future arms control agreement with Russia. The missile would provide regional presence, assured response capability, and a compliant response to Russia's treaty violations. The pursuit of the missile could incentivize Russia to negotiate reductions in its non-strategic nuclear arsenal. The deployment of intermediate-range nuclear forces in Europe led to the 1987 INF Treaty, with NATO's 1979 Dual Track decision playing a key role in negotiations. The Soviet Union's deployment of the SS-20 missile in the late 1970s prompted NATO to link the modernization of U.S. nuclear weapons with efforts to spur Soviet negotiations for reductions in INF systems. During the 1987 INF Treaty negotiations, NATO and the United States aimed to replace aging Pershing I missiles with more accurate Pershing II missiles and negotiate limits with the Soviet Union on intermediate-range nuclear systems. After years of negotiations, a global ban on all land-based intermediate-range ballistic and cruise missiles was agreed upon, serving as a model for the 2018 NPR offer. The 2018 NPR offers to forgo the new U.S. SLCM in exchange for Russian compliance with arms control obligations and reducing their nuclear arsenal. This decision is reminiscent of the 1979 dual-track decision to deploy new U.S. missiles in Europe to counter the Soviet threat. The NPR's insistence on the importance of the SLCM for extended deterrence in Asia may conflict with negotiations with Russia. The United States may face challenges in negotiating an agreement with Russia to limit nonstrategic nuclear weapons due to complexities in distinguishing between nuclear and conventional cruise missiles. The 2018 NPR emphasizes the importance of sea-launched cruise missiles for extended deterrence in Asia, which could conflict with arms control negotiations."
