    "content": "The Act titled \"United We Stand to Hire Veterans Act\" establishes a federal government internet portal to connect current and former members of the armed forces with employers seeking employees with military service experience. Congress finds that despite progress, veteran unemployment remains high, especially among younger veterans. This issue affects the Department of Defense budget, with over $9.6 billion spent on unemployment benefits in the past decade. The Department invests in veterans' technical training and skills that are valuable in civilian careers. Veterans also bring unique leadership and organizational skills to the private sector. Government agencies, private sector entities, and nonprofit organizations are addressing veteran unemployment through various programs. The Department of Labor, Veterans Affairs, Defense, and Personnel Management are working to consolidate these initiatives into a single Internet portal to connect veterans with employers. The Federal Government aims to create a consolidated internet portal to connect veterans with employers, saving money and streamlining resources by leveraging current programs. This initiative is intended to prevent competition among government agencies and improve coordination in achieving the same goal. The Secretary of Labor, in collaboration with the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, will consolidate federal government internet portals on employment for current and former members of the Armed Forces into a comprehensive portal. This portal aims to connect veterans seeking employment with employers looking to hire individuals with military experience and skills. The comprehensive portal will allow current and former members of the Armed Forces to showcase their skills and desired locations to potential employers. Employers can post job openings and connect with veterans based on their profiles for potential employment opportunities. The consolidated Internet portal will provide employment resources and opportunities for current and former members of the Armed Forces, including resume preparation and local employment networks integration. The Secretaries will consider public and private sector resources, streamlining processes, and determining effective employment programs for the portal. The consolidated Internet portal offers employment resources for current and former Armed Forces members, with a focus on streamlining processes for employers to hire veterans. Participation in the portal is voluntary, and pilot projects may be conducted to evaluate different options for the portal's implementation. The authority for pilot projects under this subsection will expire five years after the enactment of the Act. A preliminary report on the consolidated Internet portal, including a list of redundant federal portals and cost-saving estimates, must be submitted to Congress within six months of the Act's enactment. The Secretaries must submit a report to Congress one year after implementing the consolidated Internet portal, detailing its description and other relevant information. The appropriate committees of Congress include the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. The Secretaries must report to Congress on the implementation of the consolidated Internet portal, with details to be provided to the relevant committees in the Senate and House of Representatives."
