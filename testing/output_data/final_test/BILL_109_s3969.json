    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Lead Poisoning Reduction Act of 2006\". Congress acknowledges the high number of children affected by lead poisoning, especially those under 6 years old who are more vulnerable. The health impacts of lead exposure are significant, leading to organ damage and developmental issues. There is a need for guidance to protect children from lead exposure in older childcare facilities. The EPA has the authority to regulate lead exposure but has not done so yet. The Act elected not to promulgate regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act to reduce lead exposure in child-occupied facilities. SEC. 3. LEAD ASSESSMENT IN CHILD-OCCUPIED FACILITIES. Section 402 of the Toxic Substances Control Act is amended to include definitions for child-occupied facilities, specifying that it refers to facilities built before 1978 regularly visited by children under 6 for a certain amount of time each week and year. A child-occupied facility includes childcare centers, pre-schools, kindergartens, and other facilities where childcare providers receive compensation. Home-based childcare facilities are excluded from this definition. The term 'exposure pathway' for lead includes lead-based paint, drinking water plumbing, furniture, fixtures, and products used by or for children in home-based childcare facilities. The Select Group on Lead Exposure, composed of key officials, is established to address lead exposure issues. The Select Group on Lead Exposure, comprised of key officials, advises the Administrator on necessary actions without compensation for members. The Select Group on Lead Exposure members are allowed travel expenses for duties, including a study on programs to protect children from lead exposure at child-occupied facilities. The Select Group will develop baseline standards and a model program to protect children from lead exposure at child-occupied facilities. The Select Group will consider study results, regulations, and guidance for childcare providers in developing baseline standards and a model program to protect children from lead exposure. The Select Group, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Public Health Association, and the National Center for Healthy Housing, will develop baseline standards for assessing and remediating lead exposure in child-occupied facilities. The model program developed under clause (i)(II) shall meet or exceed applicable standards set by the Administrator for grant programs addressing exposure pathways and hazards in child-occupied facilities. The Administrator sets standards for grant programs regarding child-occupied facilities, including providing notice when a child is diagnosed with lead poisoning. The grant program defines eligible facilities as child-occupied facilities participating in a program for lead testing in exposure pathways. The grant program defines eligible facilities as child-occupied facilities that aim to protect children from lead exposure, excluding home-based childcare facilities. The establishment of these facilities must meet specific standards within a year of development. The Administrator, in consultation with the Select Group, will establish a grant program to assist eligible facilities in protecting children from lead exposure. Eligible facilities must submit an application to receive a grant, and cost sharing may be required. The grant program established by the Administrator, in consultation with the Select Group, requires a 20 percent non-Federal cost share for funded activities. The non-Federal share can be provided by State, tribal, and local government funds, as well as private funds, but not from Federal program appropriations. $42,600,000 is authorized for appropriations over fiscal years. The Administrator must promulgate regulations within 18 months of enactment requiring testing of lead in child-occupied facilities before issuing licenses. The Administrator must promulgate regulations within 18 months of enactment requiring testing of lead in child-occupied facilities before issuing licenses. Within 3 years of enactment, all child-occupied facilities must eliminate exposure to lead through applicable pathways. Regulations must be finalized within 4 years. The Administrator must promulgate regulations within 18 months of enactment for testing lead in child-occupied facilities before issuing licenses. Within 3 years, facilities must eliminate lead exposure. Contractors engaged in renovation, remodeling, and painting of child-occupied facilities must comply with regulations within 18 months of enactment. The Administrator must establish a program to provide information, training, and materials to contractors and workers regarding activities to protect children from lead exposure. Within 3 years, a report must be submitted to Congress listing states and tribes with programs meeting baseline standards for child-occupied facilities. Grants were given to a number of facilities under paragraph (4). The report to Congress must include recommendations for additional Federal funds and resources needed to protect children from lead exposure at child-occupied facilities."
