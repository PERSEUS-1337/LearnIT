    "content": "The Act titled \"Improving Employment Outcomes of TANF Recipients Act\" aims to enhance the economic mobility of TANF recipients. Section 403(a)(4) of the Social Security Act is amended to improve economic mobility of TANF recipients by measuring state performance through collecting and reporting necessary information for indicators. The indicators for a fiscal year include the employment percentage, calculated based on the number of families receiving assistance under State programs funded with qualified State expenditures. The retention percentage for the fiscal year is calculated by dividing the number of families with an adult in unsubsidized employment after exiting the program by the number of families who received assistance in the exit quarter. The retention percentage is calculated by dividing the number of families exiting the State program who have an adult in unsubsidized employment in the 4th quarter after exit by the total number of families receiving assistance in the exit quarter. The advancement measure for the fiscal year is the median earnings of adults receiving assistance under the State program funded with qualified State expenditures. The State must agree with the Secretary on performance levels for indicators in fiscal years 2019 and 2020 for individuals exiting the program and entering unsubsidized employment. The State and the Secretary must establish performance levels for indicators, comparing them with other States and adjusting them using an objective statistical model.

The State must agree with the Secretary on performance levels for indicators before fiscal year 2021 to promote continuous improvement in performance. Revisions may be made based on economic factors.
