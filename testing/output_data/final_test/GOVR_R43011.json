The industry is looking to expand overseas coal market penetration to offset declining domestic demand. Despite record production levels and increased exports, domestic demand for coal has decreased. The future of coal in meeting U.S. and global energy needs is uncertain due to ongoing debates on energy policy and environmental regulations. The gap between U.S. coal production and consumption may widen as natural gas becomes a more attractive option for power plants. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts rising coal exports to the Asian market, but potential bottlenecks like infrastructure may slow growth. Factors contributing to lower coal demand in the United States include economic growth, high coal prices, lower natural gas prices, and plant retirements. The coal industry in the US is concentrated among a few major producers, primarily operating in four states, with the US government holding about one-third of reserves. Coal deposits are widespread in the United States, with the US government holding about one-third of reserves. There is significant congressional interest in coal, with over 100 bills introduced in the 112th Congress. This report provides background on US and global coal resources, production, and congressional interest in coal production on federal lands. It covers the past 10 years of coal activity, future production projections, and federal coal incentives. Coal is formed from ancient plant remains transformed into carbon-rich mineral through metamorphosis. Coal is formed from ancient plant life transformed into carbon-rich mineral deposits through metamorphosis. It occurs in sedimentary rock strata as old as 300 million years, with the most abundant deposits in the US dating back to the Carboniferous period. Coal classification considers type, rank, and grade based on the plant life it originated from and the degree of metamorphosis. Qualities like moisture, carbon, sulfur, and ash content affect its heating value as a fuel. Sulfur content is crucial due to emissions during combustion, regulated under the Clean Air Act. Coal is classified based on type, rank, and grade, with qualities like moisture, carbon, sulfur, and ash content affecting its heating value. Western coal from the Powder River Basin is used for power generation, while eastern coal is used domestically and exported for coking and metallurgical purposes. Mining techniques in the US include underground mining and surface mining, with 69% of coal coming from surface mines and 31% from deep underground mines. Underground mining techniques include room and pillar and longwall methods. In underground coal mining, two main techniques are used: room and pillar (2%) and continuous mining (48%). Room and pillar involves manual cutting, drilling, blasting, loading, and roof bolting, while continuous mining uses a mechanical excavator to cut and load coal. The most efficient method is longwall mining, where a large machine with a rotating drum extracts coal from a wide seam. Coal is then transported out of the mine using conveyor belts or shuttle cars. Surface mining, including open-pit and strip mining, involves blasting rock above the coal with explosives. The overburdened rock is then removed with electric shovels and draglines to reveal the coal seam. Reclamation work is done concurrently with coal extraction, following federal regulations. Mountaintop removal mining is a type of strip mining where a coal seam is removed from one side of a mountain to the other, often involving excess spoil being placed in valley fills. After being mined, coal goes through a cleaning prep facility to remove impurities like rock, clay, and ash. The cleaned coal is then stockpiled and transported to customers by rail, barge, truck, or conveyor. Utilities burn pulverized coal to generate high-pressure steam for electricity, but this process produces emissions like sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon dioxide, particulate matter, ash, and mercury. Assessing coal in the United States involves distinguishing between resources and reserves, which have different meanings. Resources represent the total coal potential, including identified and undiscovered deposits, while reserves are known quantities that can be economically produced. Factors like bed thickness, depth, coal rank, and quality influence recoverability. The U.S. Geological Survey conducted an assessment in February 2013. The U.S. Geological Survey estimated the Powder River Basin coal resource at 1.07 trillion short tons in February 2013. A National Research Council study warns that not all resources can be economically mined, cautioning against using coal resources to estimate the U.S. coal base's lifespan. Reserves are temporary and subject to change based on various factors like public policy, prices, production rates, and technology. Reserves are estimates of recoverable coal and must be developed from a well-defined resource base. The United States has the largest amount of coal reserves in the world, with about 261 billion short tons of recoverable domestic coal reserves and a total demonstrated resource base of 484.5 billion tons. More than half of U.S. coal reserves are located in the West, with Montana and Wyoming accounting for 43%. The Interior and Appalachian regions have less than a 0 maturity index, indicating their recoverable reserves are less than the amount already mined. This may lead to more underground mining in the eastern regions due to thinner and lower-quality resources. The U.S. coal reserves are mainly located in the West, with Montana and Wyoming holding 43% of the total reserves. The top three reserve owners, including the government, Great Northern Properties Limited Partnership, and Peabody Energy Corporation, account for 45% of U.S. coal. Coal production has shifted from high-sulfur to low-sulfur due to demand from power plants to meet environmental standards. Production has fluctuated since 2002 but has been higher overall, reaching a record high in tonnage in recent years. Coal production in the United States peaked at 1,174.8 million short tons in 2008 before declining. Natural gas has become the preferred fuel for new power plants, reducing coal's market share from 42% in 2011 to 32% in 2012. Coal has the largest domestic reserve base and has historically been a significant energy source, but its share has been decreasing in favor of natural gas since 2011. Predictions suggest coal's market share will continue to decline to 24% by 2040. Coal production in the United States is projected to decline, with market share dropping to 24% by 2040. Factors influencing coal production include higher natural gas prices, lower coal prices, and higher economic growth. Production from the Powder River Basin is expected to increase, while Appalachian coal continues to decline. Federal lands account for a significant portion of U.S. coal production. U.S. coal production has declined over the past few decades but is projected to increase after 2020, with a focus on coking coal exports. Surface mining in the western region has become dominant since the mid-1970s, accounting for 69% of production in 2011. Western coal production now makes up 58% of U.S. coal production and is projected to reach 68% by 2040. Underground eastern coal production peaked in 1990. The shift from underground eastern coal to western-based surface coal and from bituminous coal to sub-bituminous coal is influenced by factors such as mining ease, utilization, technology, and environmental laws. Five states produce 72% of U.S. coal. Future coal production is linked to carbon emissions policy and other factors like natural gas prices. In 2011, the top five coal mining companies accounted for about 58% of U.S. coal production, led by Peabody Energy Corp. and Arch Coal, Inc. Other major producers included Alpha Natural Resources, Llc, Cloud Peak Energy, and CONSOL Energy, Inc. The concentration of production among the top five producers was similar in 2002. The number of coal mining firms has decreased in the United States. The number of coal mining firms in the United States has decreased, with larger average mines and increased output per mine. The number of mines has declined by 60% since the 1990s. Despite a decrease in coal production levels, the number of coal miners has increased. Production per miner hour has decreased since 2001. The concentration of global coal production is spread among the top five producers, accounting for 18% of world production. The top 30 coal firms, including Coal Mining Group-China and Arch Coal, produced 40% of world production. There are significant federal coal resources, with about 957 billion short tons available. The Bureau of Land Management administers coal leasing on federal lands, with a focus on seeking international markets for PRB coal and potential growth in thermal coal exports to Asian markets. Federal coal leasing is governed by the Mineral Leasing Act and involves planning screens to identify areas for leasing. There are two processes for leasing federal lands for coal production: regional coal leasing and leasing on application. Regional coal teams select tracts for leasing based on regional requirements, while mining companies can submit applications for specific tracts. The federal coal leasing process involves mining companies submitting applications to lease tracts, with regional coal leasing levels established by the Secretary of the Interior. Areas are ranked for interest in coal leasing, and an environmental impact statement is produced. The BLM sets fair market value and maximum economic recovery for tracts before lease sales, with bids not accepted below fair market value. The BLM sets the minimum bid for lease sales at no less than $100 per acre. Coal producers submit applications indicating interest in specific tracts, providing data for environmental analysis. The BLM determines fair market value and maximum economic recovery for proposed lease tracts before conducting the lease sale. The highest bidder meeting requirements is awarded the lease, with the BLM reserving the right to reject bids. The BLM conducts lease sales for coal on federal land, with restrictions on ownership and control of coal leases. Leases are for 20 years with extensions, requiring rental payments and royalties on coal production. Diligent development and operation are conditions for all leases. Federal coal leases require diligent development and operation, along with furnishing bonds for compliance. Revenues from federal coal production have significantly increased since the 1990s, with states receiving 50% of generated revenues. In 2011, revenue reached $774.1 million, with Wyoming receiving the majority of the states' share at $319.6 million. In 2009, coal leases peaked at $780.4 million, providing states with $348.6 million in revenues. Wyoming is the top coal producer on federal lands, receiving the majority of federal coal revenues. A study under Section 437 of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 assessed federal coal resources, focusing on the Powder River Basin (PRB) which contains 550 BST or 58% of federal resources and represents 88% of coal production on federal lands. The study identified lands available for coal development and restrictions, evaluating environmentally compliant resources. The study assessed 5.4 million acres in the Powder River Basin (PRB) for coal leasing, with 591,000 acres prohibiting leasing, 4.3 million acres allowing possible leasing, and 513,000 acres available for leasing under different terms. Congressional concerns include potential undervalued coal auctions. The BLM sets a floor bid price of $100 per acre for coal auctions, but bids are typically offered on a dollar-per-ton basis. The minimum acceptable bid amount is confidential and recent bids have ranged from $0.25 to over $1.00 per ton. Coal reserve estimates are based on exploration information gathered by the industry. Questions arise about whether the federal government is receiving fair market value for the leases. Questions have been raised about the fair market value the federal government receives for coal leases, especially in the international market. The Office of Natural Resources Revenue uses different methods to value coal for royalty purposes, depending on whether the sales are arms-length or non-arms-length transactions. Senators Wyden and Murkowski have expressed concerns about potential underpayment of federal royalties and have requested more information about the royalty management program. The BLM justifies non-competitive leasing of coal tracts in the PRB area due to low industry interest. Critics argue this gives unfair advantage to existing producers. Environmental groups push for PRB to be recertified as a coal producing region, raising concerns about limited public input on lease sales. The Powder River Regional Coal Team (RCT) reviews the region's status and could recommend recertification as a coal producing area. Federal tax incentives support coal production, clean coal technologies, and coal mine safety. Coal mining corporations paid $207.4 million in corporate income taxes in 2009. The black lung excise tax is imposed on domestically mined coal, with revenues going to the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund. The tax rate is $1.10 per ton for underground mines and $0.55 per ton for surface mines, with a maximum rate of 4.4% of the coal's sales price. In 2010, collections were $610.1 million, and in FY2011, the Trust Fund had a negative balance of $5.5 billion. The tax will continue until all amounts borrowed are repaid or until December 31, 2018. Coal producers benefit from federal tax provisions, including the ability to deduct exploration and development costs. The coal industry benefits from various tax incentives, including the ability to deduct exploration and development costs, claim percentage depletion, and receive tax credits for investment in clean coal facilities. Incentives for mine safety equipment and training have been extended in the past. Additionally, coal mining activities may qualify for the Section 199 production activities deduction available to all domestic manufacturers. The President's FY2013 Budget proposes eliminating tax incentives for coal mining, including repealing expensing of exploration and development costs, requiring cost depletion for coal mines, and repealing capital gains treatment of coal royalties. This would generate an estimated $2.6 billion in additional federal revenues over the FY2013 to FY2022 budget window. The President's FY2013 Budget proposes eliminating the Section 199 production activities deduction for coal to increase the deduction for advanced manufacturing activities. Severance taxes are charges based on the value or volume of natural resources extracted. Several states impose severance taxes on coal, but they are not collected at the federal level. The top three countries with the largest coal reserves are the United States, Russia, and China, holding 59% of the world's recoverable coal reserves. The top five coal producing countries, including the United States, China, India, Australia, and Indonesia, hold 75% of the world's recoverable coal reserves. China has seen a significant increase in coal production, accounting for 50% of global production in 2011. Other countries like Colombia, Indonesia, and India have also experienced notable production growth since 2002. Indonesia, a major coal exporter, is expected to increase domestic consumption. The EIA projects a 40% increase in world coal output. The EIA projects a 40% increase in world coal output by 2035, with China accounting for 61% of production increases. India is expected to increase production by 50%, while U.S. production is projected to rise by 17%. U.S. coal exports are forecasted to increase by over 80% from 2009-2035, with coking coal exports more than doubling. According to the OECD/IEA World Energy Outlook report (2011), global coal output is projected to rise by 37%. The report indicates that under the \"New Policies Scenario,\" coal production in non-OECD countries like China, India, and Indonesia would increase significantly. India is expected to increase production by 70% and its share of world output from 5.6% to over 10%. In contrast, U.S. coal output is forecasted to decline from 14.1% to 12% of world coal output. Overall, coal output from OECD countries would fall by 14%, while output from non-OECD countries would rise by 32%. The report also highlights a 65% growth in U.S. coal exports between 2009 and 2035, mainly in coking coal, with a weak outlook for coal in the domestic market. Global coal production and demand have grown significantly over the past decade, with coal projected to be the dominant fuel for power needs. Despite regulatory concerns, U.S. coal production reached a peak in 2008 before a slight decline. The EIA forecasts a slight increase in U.S. coal production through 2040, slightly above projected demand. In 2011, coal fell below natural gas as the leading source of energy production in the U.S. and is unlikely to reclaim the top spot. If trends continue, the U.S. coal industry may become more concentrated and produce more on federal lands, potentially affecting the competitiveness of lease sales. It is crucial for the federal government to accurately value federal coal and set appropriate royalty rates. Despite most federal coal in the Powder River Basin being accessible, low interest and high costs have hindered leasing, limiting potential development. Overall, U.S. coal production has faced challenges, with a peak in 2008 followed by a slight decline. The U.S. coal industry has seen strong production in the past decade, with potential for growth in global markets. Metallurgical coal is in demand, but increased steam coal exports could widen the gap between production and consumption."
