    "content": "Since 2001, students in education have been affected by natural disasters and national emergencies. This report outlines existing authorities and programs to assist students and educational institutions in such situations, including temporary provisions enacted by Congress. Issues such as utilities outages, displaced students, and damage to school property may need to be addressed following a disaster. The federal government responds to disasters affecting education by providing financial support, waivers, and new programs. Federal assistance is mainly through FEMA under the Stafford Act, funding activities like debris removal and facility repair. Congress has also created temporary assistance programs for the Department of Education. The Department of Education has temporary targeted assistance programs to support education levels during disasters, providing funds for school operations, reopening, and student enrollment. Additionally, disaster aid is provided under specific statutory authority for elementary and secondary education to comply with accountability and fiscal requirements. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) includes statutory flexibilities for meeting fiscal requirements during disasters. Institutions of higher education (IHEs) have needed assistance with federal student aid disbursement and reimbursement, including relief for interruptions in study and challenges with fund reimbursement. In response to disasters in 2017, FEMA provided federal assistance for education-related recovery. President Trump declared disasters for Texas and Louisiana after Hurricane Harvey, and for Florida after Hurricane Irma. The report also covers education-related disaster appropriations from 2005 to 2010. In 2017, President Trump issued emergency declarations for Louisiana, Florida, U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico in response to hurricanes. California also faced multiple wildfire incidents. The natural disasters caused extensive adverse effects, including damage to schools, possible closures, and displacement of students. Legislation was enacted to provide the Secretary of Education with waiver authority for certain provisions related to the Higher Education Act of 1965. The Further Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Act, 2018 was enacted to provide funding for disaster relief efforts, including assistance for hurricane recovery. Additionally, the Act made private schools eligible for funding under the Project School Emergency Response to Violence Program. The Department of Education also released updated guidance for schools and students related to federal student aid programs and other programs administered by the Department. The Further Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Act, 2018 provided $2.5 billion for immediate aid to restart school operations and temporary emergency impact aid for displaced K-12 students affected by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, or wildfires in 2017. Funds are targeted to schools and states that have been damaged or enrolled displaced students due to these disasters. The temporary emergency impact aid program provides funds to states and LEAs based on displaced student enrollment, with additional support for students with disabilities and English Learners. Project SERV receives up to $35 million for trauma-related education services after natural disasters. $25 million is allocated for LEAs serving homeless children and youths affected by disasters. $100 million is designated for FSEOG, FWS, and FIPSE programs. Funds from the FSEOG and FWS programs, as well as the FIPSE program, are allocated to institutions in disaster-affected areas and students enrolled there. Matching requirements are waived for these institutions. The funds can be used for various expenses, including student financial aid and staff salaries. Up to $75 million is available to help institutions cover unexpected costs from enrolling displaced students. The Secretary is authorized to waive or modify HEA Title IV program provisions for affected individuals, students, and institutions in disaster areas. Authorization for the Secretary to waive, modify, or extend HEA provisions for individuals, students, and institutions in disaster areas. Forgiveness of outstanding balances under the HBCU Hurricane Supplemental Loan program. $4 million allocated to ED's Office of the Inspector General for oversight activities. Report provides current information on education-related disaster response and flexibilities. The Robert T. Stafford Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act) governs federal assistance for emergencies and disasters in the United States. The Federal Emergency Management Agency administers the President's Stafford Act authorities for declared tribal, state, and local governments, as well as certain private nonprofit facilities and individuals. Public educational institutions in declared disaster areas may also receive assistance. Public and private nonprofit educational institutions in disaster areas can receive FEMA grants for various needs like facility repair, debris removal, and equipment replacement. Private nonprofit facilities must meet FEMA policy guidelines and can also apply for hazard mitigation grants. Federal government has long supported elementary and secondary education. Federal support for public elementary and secondary education is less than 10% of overall K-12 education revenues. In FY2017, $38 billion was allocated for education programs under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, and Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Improvement Act. Title I-A program, funded at $15.5 billion, provides aid to disadvantaged children for supplementary educational services. Title I-A grants provide supplementary educational services to low-achieving students in schools with high concentrations of low-income families. It also includes various requirements for K-12 education. Other ESEA programs like Improving Teacher Quality and 21st Century Community Learning Centers are collectively funded at $8.4 billion in FY2017. IDEA provides federal funding for special education services for children with disabilities. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) provides funding for special education services for children with disabilities, totaling $13.0 billion in FY2017. The Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act supports career and technical education skills development, with funds distributed to states and local recipients like LEAs and community colleges. Perkins was last reauthorized in 2006 with appropriations authorized through FY2012, and has received consistent funding through FY2016. Total Perkins funding for FY2017 was $1.1 billion, with existing statutory and regulatory authorities enabling the Secretary of Education to waive or modify education requirements. Temporary authorities granted by Congress in response to disasters, along with programs for disaster recovery in elementary and secondary education, are discussed. Other actions taken in response to disasters affecting education are also examined. The report examines disaster recovery efforts related to Gulf Coast hurricanes in 2005, Hurricanes Ike and Gustav in 2008, and other natural disasters up to 2010. The Secretary of Education has authority to respond to disasters without additional legislation, including using waivers under the ESEA to address funding and accountability issues. The Secretary of Education has flexibility under the ESEA to address accountability issues and provide waivers for schools affected by disasters. Waiver requests have focused on relief from accountability requirements and fiscal regulations. Secretarial waiver provisions are included in Section 8401 of the ESEA. The Secretary has broad authority to issue waivers of statutory or regulatory requirements under Section 8401 of the ESEA for state education agencies, local education agencies, Indian tribes, or schools receiving ESEA funds. Waivers cannot be granted for certain requirements such as fund allocation, maintenance of effort, comparability of services, supplanting of funds, private school participation, parental involvement, civil rights, and other specified purposes. The Secretary has the authority to grant waivers under Section 8401 of the ESEA for various educational entities. Waivers cannot be given for certain requirements like fund allocation, maintenance of effort, and private school participation. The report discusses the use of ESEA Section 9401 waiver authority, including parental involvement, civil rights, charter school requirements, and prohibitions on certain fund uses. Waivers can be approved for up to four years and extended if proven effective in improving student achievement. The ESSA maintained the waiver authority previously provided under Section 9401 of the ESEA for the Secretary to approve or deny waivers requested by educational entities. Requests for waivers do not need to be related to specific circumstances like disasters or financial issues. Previous waivers granted under Section 9401 may provide insight into potential availability of waivers under the ESSA. The ESSA maintained waiver authority under Section 9401 of the ESEA for the Secretary to approve waivers requested by educational entities. Waivers were granted in response to natural disasters and other circumstances, such as school violence incidents. From 2005 to 2010, 33 waivers were granted in response to natural disasters. From 2005 to 2010, a total of 33 waivers were granted in response to natural disasters. The waivers addressed funding flexibility and educational accountability issues under the ESEA. Louisiana received 40% of the waivers due to being disproportionately affected by disasters during that period. Additional flexibilities beyond Section 8401 of the ESEA exist for the Secretary, SEAs, or LEAs to exercise in response to disasters or other reasons. The ESEA allows for flexibilities in response to disasters or financial decline in LEAs, including waivers for MOE requirements and funding flexibility. The Charter Schools Program provides grants to SEAs or LEAs, with waivers available for exceptional circumstances like natural disasters. The Charter Schools Program (CSP; ESEA Title IV-C) provides grants to SEAs or charter school developers to support the development of public charter schools. The Secretary has the authority to waive requirements to promote the program's purpose. Funds from the ESEA can also be used for activities authorized under other ESEA programs. Title V-A of the Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999 (ED-Flex; P.L. 106-25) allows LEAs and SEAs to transfer formula grants among various ESEA programs. SEAs with this authority can grant waivers similar to those under ESEA Section 8401, with restrictions on certain waivers. Prior to ESSA, 10 states participated in ED-Flex, retaining this authority for up to five years under ESSA pending Secretary approval. Under the Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999 (ED-Flex), states can participate for up to five years with Secretary approval. States can waive provisions in various ESEA programs and the Perkins Act. The Secretary can waive MOE requirements for states under certain circumstances. The Secretary has authority to waive MOE requirements for states under certain circumstances under IDEA provisions. States may not reduce financial support for special education below the previous year's amount. The Secretary can grant waivers for exceptional circumstances like natural disasters. For FY2006, the Secretary waived Louisiana's state MOE requirements under IDEA Section 612(a)(18)(c). Waivers can be granted if a state proves FAPE availability for all children with disabilities. Failure to meet MOE doesn't reduce future financial support required. IDEA funds must supplement, not supplant, state, local, and federal funds. The Secretary can waive the state-level supplement, not supplant requirement with evidence of support for all children with disabilities. The state must provide evidence of FAPE availability for all children with disabilities to avoid sanctions under the Perkins accountability system. The Secretary can waive sanctions for exceptional circumstances like natural disasters. Additionally, the Secretary has flexibility to waive up to 5% of the MOE requirement for states due to exceptional circumstances. In response to natural disasters, Congress has enacted legislation to create temporary programs and provide waivers and flexibilities in education. These programs offer funding to restart school operations, reopen schools, re-enroll students, and support school staff in disaster-affected areas. The state must still meet MOE requirements despite receiving waivers for exceptional circumstances. Funds have been provided for various education-related purposes in disaster-affected areas, including replacing materials, supporting charter school expansion, and assisting displaced students. Temporary programs were created for Gulf Coast hurricanes between 2005 and 2010, with more recent legislation for 2017 natural disasters. In response to the 2017 natural disasters, the Further Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Act, 2018 was enacted, providing $2.5 billion for immediate aid to restart school operations and temporary emergency impact aid for displaced K-12 students. The Further Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Act, 2018 provided $2.5 billion for immediate aid to restart school operations and temporary emergency impact aid for displaced K-12 students, including funds for schools damaged by disasters, states and LEAs enrolling displaced students, and additional support for students with disabilities and English Learners. Additionally, funds were allocated for the Project SERV Program to help students recover from trauma, and assistance to LEAs serving homeless children and youths displaced by disasters. The federal government provides support for postsecondary education through programs authorized by the Higher Education Act of 1965. In FY2016, nearly $136 billion in grant, loan, and work-study aid was available to 13 million students. Additionally, about $948 million was appropriated for postsecondary programs, including support for institutions of higher education and federal student aid. The Department of Veterans Affairs administers educational assistance programs for eligible servicemembers and veterans, including GI Bills and Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment. Approximately $15 billion is estimated to be obligated in FY2017 for these programs. This section discusses statutory and regulatory authorities supporting education-disaster recovery. The Secretary of Education and IHEs have authority to waive or modify HEA requirements, including education disaster relief loans. Temporary higher education provisions enacted by Congress in response to disasters are administered by ED. Existing statutory and regulatory authorities provide flexibility to respond to disasters without additional legislation, particularly under Title IV of the HEA for federal student aid. Title IV of the HEA provides federal student aid for postsecondary education, including the Pell Grant and Direct Loan programs. Flexibility is available for aid recipients affected by federally declared disasters. Assistance is offered to IHEs, lenders, servicers, and guaranty agencies in disaster areas. ED may provide case-by-case help with regulatory requirements. Support for IHEs after a disaster may include temporary closure without losing eligibility. IHEs may temporarily close and reopen without losing eligibility for Title IV student aid programs. Flexibility is granted for shortening academic years, providing data for reports, complying with financial management requirements, and meeting filing deadlines. Exceptions may be made for records retention in cases of loss or destruction. IHEs may be exempt from verification requirements for FSA applicants whose records were lost due to a disaster, as long as efforts were made to reconstruct the records. Waivers may be granted for obtaining signed documentation from parents of dependent undergraduate students in cases where documentation cannot be provided due to a disaster. IHEs unable to meet deadlines for reporting aid disbursement or enrollment status must promptly inform the appropriate authorities. IHEs must inform authorities promptly about any issues with aid disbursement or enrollment status. They may request extensions for reporting deadlines for Federal Pell Grant payments. Waivers may be granted for under-utilization of funds due to disasters. Waivers may also be granted for Federal Work-Study program requirements. Support may be available for Title IV student aid recipients after a disaster. Support available for Title IV student aid recipients after a disaster includes continuing education at another institution, excluding disaster aid from Expected Family Contribution, using professional judgment for adjustments to cost of attendance, and maintaining eligibility for Title IV federal aid. Students affected by a disaster may maintain Title IV federal student aid eligibility despite academic progress issues. Leave of absence requirements can be waived, and Title IV grant overpayment return may be waived under certain conditions. FWS payments can continue during employment disruptions due to a disaster. Borrowers in \"in-school\" status when attendance is interrupted due to a disaster have relief options for Direct Loan, FFEL, and Perkins Loans. Borrowers of DL program loans, FFEL program loans, and Perkins Loans affected by a disaster may receive forbearance or have collection activities suspended. Defaulted loans may have collection activities suspended for three months. Borrowers trying to rehabilitate or consolidate loans during a disaster are not penalized for missed payments. The HEROES Act provides the Secretary with authority to waive or modify requirements for Title IV student aid programs during a national emergency or military action. This helps individuals affected by disasters, active duty, or residing in affected areas. The HEROES Act allows for waivers or modifications to Title IV student aid programs during national emergencies or military actions, providing support to individuals affected by disasters, active duty, or residing in affected areas. Examples of support include exceptions for financial aid administrators to adjust cost of attendance or expected family contribution for affected individuals. The HEROES Act allows waivers or modifications to Title IV student aid programs during national emergencies. IHEs are exempt from certain requirements for affected individuals, including notifying them of grant overpayments and denying federal student aid eligibility. IHEs may accept alternative documentation for income verification for FSA applicants with IRS tax return extensions. For students who withdraw due to being affected individuals, IHEs must attempt to contact them regarding Title IV credit balance payments within 14 days. IHEs are exempt from certain requirements for affected individuals under the HEROES Act, including notifying them of grant overpayments and denying federal student aid eligibility. They may disburse Title IV funds to designated bank accounts, use funds for charges other than tuition and fees, and hold funds with oral consent. IHEs are excluded from attempting to collect defaulted Perkins Loans from affected individuals and during a three-month transition period. Under the HEROES Act, IHEs are exempt from certain requirements for affected individuals, including notifying them of grant overpayments and denying federal student aid eligibility.

Support available under the HEROES Act for Title IV aid recipients who are unable to meet specified requirements may include adjusting expected family contribution based on more recent income information. The FAA must document reasons for any adjustments, and unearned grant funds may be waived for repayment. Post-withdrawal loan disbursement response time is extended to 45 days for certain affected individuals, and the requirement for a written leave of absence may be waived for those who must interrupt enrollment. Students in the 1st or 2nd categories of affected individuals have extended response times for loan cancellation requests and may continue to receive Title IV funds despite not making satisfactory progress in coursework. Borrowers in these categories have an initial grace period that excludes any period, not to exceed three years, during which they are affected individuals. Borrowers of various types of student loans who left school due to being affected individuals may retain their in-school status or deferment for up to three years. The Secretary will pay any interest that accrues on Subsidized Stafford Loans during this period. For Perkins Loan borrowers in the 1st or 2nd affected categories, any forbearance granted based on their affected status is excluded from the usual three-year limit. For Perkins Loan borrowers in the 1st or 2nd affected categories, forbearance based on their affected status is excluded from the usual three-year limit. Borrowers of FFEL program loans in these categories may also be granted forbearance without written documentation for a one-year period and an additional three-month transition period. For borrowers of defaulted FFEL or DL program loans seeking loan rehabilitation, missed payments during the affected period or the three-month transition will not interrupt the payment series. Similarly, for borrowers seeking to reestablish eligibility for federal student aid, missed payments during the affected period or transition will not be counted against them. During the affected period or the three-month transition, missed payments for borrowers of defaulted FFEL or DL program loans seeking consolidation or repayment under specific plans will not interrupt the payment series for reestablishing Title IV eligibility. Under the PAYE or REPAYE plan, affected individuals unable to provide annual income documentation can maintain their current payment amount for up to three years, with a three-month transition period. The requirement for parental verification of family size and enrollment is waived if no responsible parent is available to sign. The College Access Challenge Grant Program (CACG) aimed to increase low-income students' access to postsecondary education through partnerships between federal, state, and local governments. Waivers for parental signatures on financial aid forms are granted for dependents of affected individuals in certain circumstances. The College Access Challenge Grant Program (CACG) required states to meet maintenance of effort requirements to remain eligible. The Secretary could waive these requirements in exceptional circumstances. The authority to award new CACGs expired in FY2014. Title III and Title V of the HEA authorize programs that provide institutional aid to eligible higher education institutions. Title V, Part A of the HEA authorizes programs that provide institutional aid to IHEs serving low-income students with low expenditures. Recipients can use awards to establish or increase endowment funds. The Endowment Challenge Grants program under Title III, Part C allows the same. The endowment fund corpus must be maintained for 20 years, with 50% of income available for institutional costs. In emergencies, the Secretary may permit IHEs to spend from the endowment fund. The Secretary may permit an IHE to spend more than 50% of the endowment fund income in cases of arson or exigent circumstances. The Education Disaster and Emergency Relief Loan Program can be established for IHEs impacted by disasters, allowing funds for construction, renovation, and operations costs. Previous Congresses have enacted temporary programs to support education during natural disasters, with examples like Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. In response to natural disasters, additional funds were appropriated to support recovery efforts for IHEs and grants to students. The Secretary was authorized to modify program requirements to prevent loss of grant funding for affected IHEs. Special authority was given to ensure historically black colleges and universities could access capital financing for recovery. Temporary provisions were provided up to FY2010, with legislation enacted for education-related funds and flexibilities in response to 2017 disasters. The Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria Education Relief Act of 2017 made modifications to the Federal Work Study and Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant programs for postsecondary education in response to natural disasters. It waived nonfederal share requirements for affected institutions and allowed reallocation of unexpended funds to eligible institutions. The Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria Education Relief Act of 2017 modified the Federal Work Study and Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant programs for postsecondary education in response to natural disasters. It waived nonfederal share requirements for affected institutions and allowed reallocation of unexpended funds to eligible institutions for award years 2016-2017 and 2018-2019. The act also authorized the Secretary to recall and reallocate funds to ensure assistance is received by eligible institutions. These provisions expire on September 30, 2018. The Further Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Act, 2018 provided $100 million for postsecondary education programs in areas affected by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, or wildfires in 2017. The Further Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Act, 2018 allocated $75 million for institutions of higher education (IHEs) in disaster-affected areas, waiving matching requirements for certain funds. Flexibilities were authorized for HEA programs, allowing for waivers, modifications, or extensions of provisions for affected individuals, students, and IHEs. The HEA provisions allow for waivers, modifications, or extensions for individuals, students, and IHEs in disaster areas. The Secretary can modify uses of funds for minority-serving grant programs. The Secretary can forgive balances owed under the HBCU Hurricane Supplemental Loan program. GI Bills and Vocational Rehabilitation programs provide educational benefits. For example, the Post-9/11 GI Bill offers 36 months of benefits. VA can continue paying benefits during interval periods. The VA can continue paying benefits during interval periods when a school is closed due to an emergency, with a limit of four weeks per year. Benefits may also be paid for withdrawn courses due to mitigating circumstances. Entitlement is not reduced if benefits are interrupted for a school closure during a certified enrollment period. The Survivors' and Dependents' Educational Assistance Program provides benefits to children. The Department of Education administers educational benefits for children under Title 38 U.S.C., Chapter 35, extending benefits in certain situations beyond age 26 but generally not past age 31. Other programs include state grants for adult education and vocational rehabilitation grants. State Grants authorized under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 support vocational rehabilitation services for individuals with disabilities. Disaster-affected grantees can receive waivers for maintenance of effort and reporting requirements but not for state matching funds. The Adult Education and Family Literacy Act provides grants for education of out-of-school adults and English language training, with a requirement for states to match federal grants and maintain effort levels. The Adult Education and Family Literacy Act (AEFLA) requires states to maintain a level of effort (MOE) to receive federal grants, with waivers granted for exceptional circumstances. AEFLA does not allow waivers for states' nonfederal match requirements. State grantees must submit annual performance reports to receive funding, with no financial sanctions for late submissions due to exceptional circumstances. The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 allows for waivers of the Maintenance of Effort (MOE) requirement in cases of exceptional circumstances like natural disasters or economic downturns. States receive grants to provide vocational rehabilitation services to individuals with disabilities, with a matching requirement for federal funds. Failure to submit timely reports may result in financial sanctions. The Rehabilitation Act allows waivers of the Maintenance of Effort requirement in cases of natural disasters or economic downturns. States must submit annual performance reports for funding, with exceptions for exceptional circumstances like disasters. Congress allocated $2 billion between 2005 and 2010 for education support after Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, or Gustav. Funding was provided for elementary, secondary, and higher education. Following the Gulf Coast hurricanes, funding was allocated for elementary and secondary education through public laws, creating new programs to support schools affected by Hurricane Katrina or Rita. The funding totaled $1.4 billion from P.L. 109-148, $235 million from P.L. 109-234, and $30 million from P.L. 110-28. The federal government allocated additional funding to support schools affected by hurricanes, including $5 million for homeless children, $235 million for displaced students, $30 million for educator assistance, $15 million for homeless student enrollment, and $12 million for the Gulf Coast. In 2008, Congress appropriated $12 million through P.L. 111-117 for the Gulf Coast Recovery Initiative to improve education in areas affected by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, or Gustav. The Immediate Aid to Restart School Operations program provided $750 million to support schools in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Texas. The Temporary Emergency Impact Aid for Displaced Students program assisted schools in enrolling students displaced by the Gulf Coast hurricanes. The Temporary Emergency Impact Aid for Displaced Students program provided funds to schools enrolling students displaced by Gulf Coast hurricanes, with a total appropriation of $880 million. Louisiana, Texas, and Mississippi received the largest proportion of funds. This program is no longer authorized. The Education for Homeless Children and Youths program allocated $5 million for LEAs serving homeless children displaced by Hurricanes Katrina or Rita, with Texas and Louisiana receiving the largest grants. The Hurricane Educator Assistance Program provided federal funding to Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama for recruiting, retaining, and compensating school staff. The Hurricane Educator Assistance Program allocated funds to Louisiana and Mississippi for school staff affected by Hurricanes Katrina or Rita. The program is no longer authorized. The Homeless Education Disaster Assistance program provided funds to LEAs with increased homeless student enrollment due to natural disasters in 2008. The Homeless Assistance Act provided $15 million to LEAs in Gulf Coast states affected by Hurricanes Gustav and Ike, as well as other natural disasters. $13.5 million went to Florida, Louisiana, and Texas. The Gulf Coast Recovery Initiative allocated $12 million for education improvement in counties affected by Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, or Gustav. The Homeless Assistance Act provided funds to LEAs in Gulf Coast states affected by hurricanes and natural disasters, with a majority going to Louisiana. Temporary flexibilities under ESEA P.L. 109-148 allowed the Secretary to grant waivers related to fiscal requirements to ease the burden on entities in disaster-declared states. The waivers of MOE under the Stafford Act did not reduce the required level of effort for the following year. The additional authority to waive fiscal accountability requirements did not allow for waivers or modifications under IDEA. Congress mandated that affected LEAs be held harmless at 100% of their prior-year grant amount under Title I-A of the ESEA to prevent funding decreases due to student displacement. Temporary flexibilities under IDEA P.L. 109-148 allowed the Secretary to extend administrative deadlines. In 2005-2006, an annual report on the progress of children with disabilities was authorized. The Secretary could extend deadlines for initial evaluations under IDEA, without waiving key provisions like the right to education. Higher Education Appropriations supported IHEs affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, 2006, and 2007. Additional funding of $15 million was provided in 2008. In 2008, additional funding of $15 million was provided for higher education institutions affected by hurricanes, floods, or natural disasters. Specifically, $95 million each was allocated for the Louisiana Board of Regents and the Mississippi Institute of Higher Learning for hurricane recovery. Additional funds were provided under the Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education to assist institutions affected by the 2005 Gulf Coast hurricanes. Under P.L. 110-28, $80 million was provided for IHEs affected by Hurricane Katrina or Rita for hurricane recovery, with the majority of funds going to Mississippi and Louisiana. Additionally, $10 million was allocated under P.L. 109-148 to assist IHEs with unanticipated costs related to enrolling students displaced by the hurricanes. Overall, 99 IHEs in 24 states and the District of Columbia received funds for displaced student enrollment, with Louisiana and Texas receiving the largest state grants. These programs are no longer authorized. The Higher Education Disaster Relief program provided $15 million for IHEs affected by natural disasters in 2008. Funds were used to help institutions forced to close or relocate and to provide grants to affected students. Louisiana and Texas received the majority of funds for hurricane-related assistance. This program is no longer authorized. Under P.L. 109-148, the Secretary had the authority to modify the uses of funds for various grant programs in response to Gulf hurricane disasters. This included TRIO programs, GEAR UP, Strengthening Institutions, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities programs. However, new construction or improvements not previously authorized were not permitted. Under P.L. 109-148, the Secretary could modify fund uses for grant programs in response to Gulf hurricanes, including TRIO, GEAR UP, Strengthening Institutions, and Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Waivers under Title III programs ensured IHEs affected by Hurricane Katrina or Rita did not lose funding. Teacher Quality Enhancement Grants could be modified to aid in recruiting and retaining qualified teachers in hurricane-affected areas. The Historically Black College and University (HBCU) Capital Financing program provided low-cost capital financing to assist HBCUs affected by Gulf Coast hurricanes. The program allowed the Secretary to waive or modify provisions to reflect changes in financial conditions due to the hurricanes. This helped in the recovery efforts of HBCUs in hurricane-affected areas. The law relaxed program financing requirements and authorized the Secretary to forgive outstanding loan balances for institutions affected by Gulf Coast hurricanes. Waiver of nonfederal match requirements for disaster-affected states was also granted. The law waived nonfederal match requirements for disaster-affected states and gave them preference in claiming VR State Grant funds. An affected state is defined as one with a declared major disaster by the President."
