    "content": "The Act titled \"Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund Reform Act of 2016\" aims to reform spending from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund Reform Act of 2016 amends Section 9505(c) of the Internal Revenue Code to specify required distributions for expenditures from the fund without the need for appropriation. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund Reform Act of 2016 specifies distributions for expenses related to harbor maintenance tax administration by the Department of the Treasury, Army Corps of Engineers, and Department of Commerce. The applicable amount is determined by taxes received in the previous fiscal year and amounts credited to the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund. The Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund allocates funds for various purposes, with $5,000,000 for subparagraph (A)(iii), $40,000,000 for subparagraph (A)(ii), and the remainder for subparagraph (A)(i) after applying specified distributions. The Trust Fund, as allocated in appropriations Acts, is available for expenditures described in paragraph (1)(A). The amendment applies to fiscal years after the enactment of the Act. SEC. 3. ADDITIONAL MEASURES AT DONOR PORTS AND ENERGY TRANSFER PORTS. Section 2106 of the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 is amended to redesignate subparagraphs, add clauses, and specify calculations for percentage calculations. Subsection (b) is also revised to address authority. The Secretary may provide amounts to donor ports and energy transfer ports in equal amounts each fiscal year, divided based on Harbor Maintenance Tax revenues generated. The Maintenance Tax revenues generated at eligible donor ports and energy transfer ports are divided equally among all States with an energy transfer port. Ports can only receive funding as either a donor port or an energy transfer port, not both. Subsection (f) is removed. SEC. 4. EXPENDITURES FROM THE HARBOR MAINTENANCE TRUST FUND. The amendment to the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 includes provisions for the allocation of funds for certain donor ports, energy transfer ports, and emerging harbor projects. The Secretary is required to allocate a minimum of 20 percent of funds for activities under the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 for each fiscal year. The amendment to the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 mandates allocating funds for emerging harbor projects, ensuring maintenance costs are not less than 10 percent of funds for fiscal year 2012. Expanded uses include in-water improvements benefiting commercial navigation and activities to maintain slope stability at accessible berths. The amendment mandates allocating funds for emerging harbor projects, ensuring maintenance costs are not less than 10 percent of funds for fiscal year 2012.
