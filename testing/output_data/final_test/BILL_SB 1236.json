    "title": "SB 1236",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature declares that corruption in small charter cities in California is a growing and concerning issue. Small charter cities like Vernon, Bell, and Industry have a history of power abuses, including inflated salaries for officials, misappropriation of funds, risky bond issuances, and conflicts of interest. The voter base in small charter cities is tightly controlled by city officials who rent out housing units to handpicked tenants at below-market cost, keeping residents indebted to those in power. Efforts to increase homeownership face resistance, with some officials resorting to cutting power to new residents. Criminal charges, including voter fraud and misappropriation of public funds, have been filed, eroding voter trust and taxpayer funds. The corruption in small charter cities has eroded voter trust, citizen confidence, and taxpayer funds. An audit in January 2016 revealed inadequate administrative and internal accounting controls, with 85 percent of control elements found to be inadequate. None of the ethical components evaluated were deemed adequate. In 1970, the Constitution was amended to allow any city to adopt a charter for local governance. Small charter cities in California have been plagued by corruption, with leaders enriching themselves at the expense of taxpayers. The Legislature has the authority to impose heightened governing requirements to ensure open, honest, and transparent government statewide. Section 34096 of the Government Code imposes restrictions on a city in Los Angeles County incorporated for commerce and industry with no residentially zoned land as of January 1, 1992. It limits city-owned housing occupancy and requires annual disclosure of city-owned property. The city must conduct an annual audit following specific guidelines and internal control components. The compensation for city council service in a city promoting commerce and industry in Los Angeles County is capped at $1,000 per month. Additionally, a new section is added to the Public Contract Code. Section 1100.8 of the Public Contract Code applies to contracts by a city in Los Angeles County promoting commerce and industry without residentially zoned land. It includes contracts for waste collection services and is effective until January 1, 2028. The Legislature deems a special law necessary for a city in Los Angeles County focused on commerce and industry without residentially zoned land. If state-mandated costs are found, reimbursement will follow government guidelines. Section 34450 of the Government Code is amended. Any city or city and county can create, modify, or revoke a charter for its government under Section 34450 of the Government Code or Article 3 of the Elections Code."
