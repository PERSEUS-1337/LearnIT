    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Ensuring the Safety of Imported Meat and Poultry Act of 1999\". The Congress finds that prior to 1994, imported meat and poultry had to meet the same safety standards as domestically produced products. The World Trade Organization's SPS Agreement requires countries to allow food imports if the foreign inspection system meets their safety standards. In 1994, Congress amended the Federal Meat Inspection Act and the Poultry Products Inspection Act to align with the SPS Agreement. The Congress amended the Federal Meat Inspection Act and the Poultry Products Inspection Act in 1994 to align with the World Trade Organization's SPS Agreement. The Secretary of Agriculture determined that countries exporting meat and poultry to the US before 1994 had equivalent inspection systems. In July 1996, the USDA introduced the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) program to enhance meat and poultry safety. The HACCP program was implemented in phases for domestic meat and poultry plants to improve safety. By January 27, 1997, standard operating procedures for sanitation and testing for E. coli were required. Plants with 500+ employees had to establish the entire HACCP system by January 26, 1998. Small plants had to implement the rest of the HACCP system by January 25, 1999. The Department of Agriculture is allowing imports of meat and poultry from 32 countries without enough information to determine if their inspection systems meet new HACCP requirements. The department publishes a quarterly report listing domestic plants not in compliance with HACCP. The Department of Agriculture conducts audits of foreign meat and poultry plants but does not publicly reveal non-compliant foreign firms. They take random samples of 20% of imported meat and poultry at the US border, with rejection rates not specified by country of origin in public reports. Consumers in the US have the right to know the safety of imported meat and poultry from specific countries. The end of the grace period for imported meat and poultry is addressed in Section 3. The Federal Meat Inspection Act is amended to ban imports of meat from countries that do not meet US sanitary standards within 6 months to 1 year. The Secretary may extend the ban on imports of poultry from countries not meeting US standards for up to 1 year if no risk to public health. The decision must be transmitted to Congress and published in the Federal Register with reasons provided at least 60 days prior. The Secretary may extend the ban on poultry imports from countries not meeting US standards for up to 1 year if no risk to public health. The ban will take effect within 6 months for existing standards and within 1 year for new standards after the passage of this Act. The Secretary may extend the ban on poultry imports for up to 1 year if no risk to public health. The decision must be transmitted to Congress and published in the Federal Register at least 60 days before the final decision is made, taking into account received comments. SEC. 4. PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN DECISIONS ON EQUIVALENCY. In decisions regarding the equivalence of foreign inspection systems, the Secretary of Agriculture must publish a notice in the Federal Register and provide the public with the justification provided by the foreign government at least 90 days before making a final determination. The Secretary must publish a notice in the Federal Register regarding the equivalence of foreign inspection systems, along with scientific analysis. The public can comment on the proposed determination before a final decision is made. The Secretary of Agriculture must publish in the Federal Register every 3 months the names and locations of non-compliant meat and poultry plants exporting to the US, as well as the rejection rates of foreign meat and poultry by country of origin at the US border."
