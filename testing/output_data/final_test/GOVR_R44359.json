    "content": "The federal government manages 56 million acres of land for Indian tribes, primarily using cars and trucks for transportation. Grants and technical assistance support highway transportation on these lands through the Tribal Transportation Program (TTP) administered by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). Other relevant highway programs include the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) State Highway Safety Program. The Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act reauthorized the Tribal Transportation Program (TTP) and NHTSA's safety programs for FY2016-FY2020. The report discusses federal funding for highways on Indian lands, highway safety, environmental review, and rights-of-way for 566 federally recognized Indian tribes and 326 land areas administered by the federal government as Indian reservations. Indian reservations, including state-authorized ones, are typically rural and remote, lacking services like medical centers and schools. About 4.8 million people live in American Indian areas, with 1.1 million identifying as American Indian or Alaska Native. Federally recognized tribes are sovereign nations subject to U.S. authority, eligible for federal services and benefits. Federal policy towards Indian tribes has evolved since the 1970s. The Indian Self-Determination and Educational Assistance Act of 1975 (ISDEAA; P.L. 93-638) allowed tribes to contract with the federal government to administer federal funds in areas like health and education. Tribes can establish their own funding priorities through compacts with the federal government, but tribal self-determination and self-governance in transportation have been slow to develop compared to other policy areas. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) has historically managed the Tribal Transportation Program, formerly known as the Indian Reservation Roads Program, since 1928. The Tribal Transportation Program (TTP) has evolved since its inception in 1928, with funding shifting from the general fund to the Highway Trust Fund in 1982. Tribal self-governance in road funding was further empowered by the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century in 1998, allowing Indian tribes to administer federal road funding under contracts or compacts with the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The Tribal Transportation Program (TTP) was established in 1928 and has evolved over the years. The administration of the TTP was authorized by SAFETEA in 2005, allowing tribes to enter contracts with BIA or FHWA for oversight. The FAST Act in 2015 further empowered tribes to enter into compacts with FHWA. Many Indian tribes now manage federal funds for road maintenance, construction, and safety through their own transportation departments. Responsibility for road infrastructure on Indian reservations lies with tribal, federal, state, and local governments, as reflected in the National Tribal Transportation Facility Inventory (NTTFI). The National Tribal Transportation Facility Inventory (NTTFI) is maintained by the BIA in cooperation with FHWA. It includes 157,000 miles of roads, with 31,400 miles being BIA-system roads, 26,000 miles tribal-system roads, and 100,000 miles state and local government roads. Most BIA-system roads are unpaved, with 17% in acceptable condition in 2014. Data on road characteristics and conditions on Indian lands are limited. In 2014, 17% of BIA-system road miles and 68% of bridges were in \"acceptable\" condition. 14% of BIA-owned bridges were structurally deficient and 6% were functionally obsolete. Nationally, 10% of bridges were structurally deficient and 14% were functionally obsolete. Functional obsolescence in bridges can be attributed to factors such as handling more traffic than intended, narrow lanes, inadequate overhead clearance, and extreme roadway curves. BIA-owned bridges on lightly traveled routes, common in tribal lands, are more likely to be structurally deficient due to growing traffic demands. Motor vehicle crashes on Indian lands are believed to be underreported. Motor vehicle crashes on Indian lands are significantly underreported in the NHTSA Fatal Accident Reporting System due to voluntary reporting by tribes, lack of training in crash reporting, inadequate record-keeping, and incompatible computer systems. This makes it challenging to assess the safety of highways on tribal lands. A study in South Dakota in 2005 found that only a small fraction of crashes on tribal lands were reported in enough detail for inclusion in the state's accident reporting system, with less serious crashes being the most underreported. Fatalities in motor vehicle crashes on Indian reservations are underreported in crash databases. In 2013, 316 crash fatalities were reported, with over half being Native Americans. A study in 2004 showed a 47% increase in fatalities on reservations from 1975 to 2002. Despite a decline since 2006, fatalities on reservations remain higher than in the mid-1970s. Rural motor vehicle fatalities declined by 38% between 1977 and 2013. Various factors contribute to these fatalities. The Indian Highway Safety Program (IHSP) has identified personal, vehicle, and environmental factors contributing to safety trends on Indian lands highways. Alcohol impaired driving, speed, and non-use of seat belts are significant factors in fatal and injury crashes on reservations. Other factors include road characteristics, emergency response times, low child-seat use, and pedestrian safety issues related to alcohol use and lack of pedestrian facilities. Seat belt use on reservations was found to be low in a 2013 survey funded by IHSP. Seat belt use on Indian reservations was found to average about 70% in a 2013 survey funded by IHSP, with rates ranging from 36% to 91%. This is lower than the national average of 87% in 2013. A previous study in 2004 and 2005 showed an overall seat belt use of 55% on reservations. The variation in seat belt use is attributed to seat belt laws on reservations, with primary laws resulting in higher usage compared to secondary or no laws. Highway safety on Indian reservations is complex due to the interjurisdictional nature of law enforcement. Traffic laws on reservation roads are determined by tribal governments and may differ from surrounding nonreservation roads. Enforcement involves tribal police, BIA police, state highway patrol, and sheriff's deputies, with varying authority to stop, detain, and cite motorists based on tribal status, violation seriousness, and agreements between tribes and nontribal agencies. For example, a tribal police officer on some reservations may need assistance from state or local police to issue a citation to a speeding nontribal motorist. The largest federal program supporting highways on Indian lands is the Tribal Transportation Program, funded at $465 million in FY2016 and increasing to $505 million in FY2020. The program is primarily for road construction and maintenance, with funds coming from the Highway Trust Fund. Maintenance funds are capped at 25% or $500,000 of a tribe's allocation. The Tribal Transportation Program (TTP) funding, totaling $465 million in FY2016 and increasing to $505 million in FY2020, is used for road construction, maintenance, planning, and research. Funds are distributed directly to tribes based on a formula considering tribal population, road mileage, and past funding. Tribes must establish funding agreements with either BIA or FHWA to receive funds, which are subject to set-asides for administration and discretionary purposes by FHWA. The Tribal Transportation Program (TTP) funding includes set-asides for administration, Tribal Technical Assistance Program (TTAP) centers, transportation planning, improving deficient bridges, safety projects, and a new Nationally Significant Federal Lands and Tribal Projects Program (NSFLTP) at $100 million per year. Funds are distributed directly to tribes based on a formula considering tribal population, road mileage, and past funding. The Tribal High Priority Projects Program (THPP) was authorized in MAP-21 at $30 million per year in general funds, but no funding was appropriated. Tribal roads are eligible for emergency funding through the Emergency Relief (ER) Program for road repair after natural disasters. Funding for safety from the Tribal Transportation Program goes to the Tribal Transportation Program Safety Funds (TTPSF). The Tribal Transportation Program Safety Funds (TTPSF) receive funding for projects in four categories: safety planning, engineering improvements, enforcement and emergency services, and education. In FY2014, $8.5 million was distributed to 94 projects out of 126 applications requesting $27.1 million. Examples of funded projects include equipping emergency responders in California and paving an airport access road in Montana. The Tribal Transportation Program Safety Funds (TTPSF) allocated $180,000 to pave Poplar Airport Access Road for improved emergency response times. The Kialegee Tribe of Oklahoma received $78,000 for a traffic signal installation in Wetumka, enhancing safety. The Nome Eskimo Community in Alaska was granted $60,868 to upgrade warning lights near Nome Elementary School for pedestrian and driver safety during dark winter months. Many tribes utilize TTP safety funds for transportation safety planning. BIA and FHWA established a Safety Management System Steering Committee for strategic plan implementation. The FHWA sponsors tribal safety summits at national and regional levels. Indian tribes receive funding from NHTSA's State Highway Safety Program, with $5.0 million available for Section 402 safety grants on Indian lands in FY2015. The Indian Highway Safety Program (IHSP) within BIA administers these funds for Indian lands. Recipient entities must develop and implement a highway safety plan to receive Section 402 safety grants. Entities, mainly states, must develop and implement a highway safety plan. BIA's IHSP works with tribes to develop and implement a safety plan. In FY2016, grants were allocated for various purposes such as law enforcement, traffic records, child passenger safety seats, and impaired driving adjudication court. The BIA's Road Maintenance Program received $26 million in FY2015 for maintaining roads and bridges on the BIA system. These funds can also be used on non-BIA-system roads at the tribe's discretion. Maintenance activities include road surface patching, grading, shoulder repair, vegetation control, culvert cleaning, and snow removal. The Road Maintenance Program includes activities like smoothing gravel or dirt roads, shoulder repair, vegetation control, culvert cleaning, snow and ice removal, and emergency repair work. Annual funding for the program has ranged between $24 million and $28 million over the past 10 years, with additional funds available through federal highway programs. Tribes may need to work with state departments of transportation to access certain funds, including those for the Highway Safety Improvement Program. Additionally, FHWA and the Department of Transportation administer discretionary funding programs that tribes are eligible for. In FY2014, the Department of Transportation awarded a $1 million grant to the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Nation for updating plans due to oil and gas development on the Fort Berthold Reservation. An $8.8 million grant was given to the Oglala Sioux Tribe in FY2013 to pave a gravel road in the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. There are proposals for increased funding for highway construction and maintenance on Indian lands due to safety concerns and poor road conditions. Funding for the Tribal Transportation Program (TTP) is expected to remain an issue despite nominal increases in the FAST Act. Despite nominal increases in funding for the Tribal Transportation Program (TTP) in the FAST Act, funding remains a concern. A coalition of tribal groups proposed a significant funding increase for TTP and associated programs, but most of their recommendations were not included in the legislation. Safety program funding is also expected to be an ongoing issue. The tribal coalition proposed increased funding for safety programs by redirecting funds from highway safety programs to tribes, but these proposals were not included in the FAST Act. The Act requires two studies by the Secretary of Transportation on highway safety on tribal lands. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) retains responsibility for BIA-owned or trust lands, leading to differing requirements for environmental reviews compared to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). BIA may require more resource-intensive assessments for projects on BIA-owned or trust lands, even if a tribe has an agreement with FHWA. This discrepancy can result in BIA requiring environmental assessments for existing roads when FHWA would process the request as a categorical exclusion. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) may require more resource-intensive environmental assessments for projects on BIA-owned or trust lands, even if a tribe has an agreement with the Federal Lands Highway (FLH) that grants categorical exclusion. This discrepancy in environmental review requirements between BIA and FLH can lead to unnecessary effort, time, and cost for tribes. One proposed solution is to require BIA to apply Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations when implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). Additionally, there have been suggestions to allow tribes the option of assuming NEPA responsibilities similar to states, which could expedite transportation project approvals. However, tribes electing this option would need to waive sovereign immunity to be sued in federal court for carrying out federal official responsibilities. The complexity of land ownership and rights in Indian Country poses challenges for transportation projects. Proposals include clarifying BIA's authority to document existing rights-of-way and allocating $10 million annually for a national database of rights-of-way."
