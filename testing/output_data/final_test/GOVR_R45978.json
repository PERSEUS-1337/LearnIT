    "content": "Congress plays a significant role in shaping outdoor recreation nationwide through legislation and oversight. This includes supporting programs on federal lands and waters, as well as facilitating recreation on nonfederal lands. Congress recognizes the economic importance of outdoor recreation and uses data to inform debates on federal resources, planning efforts, and funding. The Secretary of the Interior announced a feasibility study to analyze outdoor recreation's impact on the U.S. economy, with Congress later authorizing these efforts through the Outdoor Recreation Jobs and Economic Impact Act. This act ensures methodological uniformity with other statistical activities of the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The Outdoor Recreation Jobs and Economic Impact Act directed the Bureau of Economic Analysis to assess the economic impact of outdoor recreation in the United States. BEA developed the Outdoor Recreation Satellite Account (ORSA) to analyze employment, sales, and contributions to travel and tourism. The first official ORSA statistics were released in September 2018, with the most recent statistics released in September 2019. Congress has approved the ORSA and directed BEA to develop regional statistics in the future. BEA is developing regional statistics and refining the Outdoor Recreation Satellite Account (ORSA) as required by the Outdoor Recreation Jobs and Impact Act. The ORSA measures the outdoor recreation economy's size and its connection to the broader U.S. economy by isolating outdoor recreation spending and production from other industries. The Outdoor Recreation Satellite Account (ORSA) isolates and combines parts of various industries related to outdoor recreation, such as apparel specifically for outdoor activities. It divides outdoor recreation into core activities (directly related goods and services) and supporting activities (facilitating access). The Outdoor Recreation Satellite Account (ORSA) categorizes outdoor recreation activities, including travel, tourism, local trips, construction, and government expenditures that support outdoor recreation. It distinguishes between conventional activities like camping, fishing, hiking, and hunting, and additional activities like outdoor concerts and sports fields. ORSA combines these activities to provide a broad view of the outdoor recreation economy, using data similar to that used for calculating GDP. The Outdoor Recreation Satellite Account (ORSA) is directly comparable to other BEA products and follows internationally recognized standards for national accounting. The ORSA combines data from various industries, making direct comparisons risky due to the potential for double-counting. Comparing the ORSA to specific industries like apparel may lead to inaccurate conclusions. According to the Outdoor Recreation Satellite Account (ORSA) statistics, in 2017, the outdoor recreation economy had a current-dollar value added of $427 billion, accounting for 2.2% of GDP. Supporting activities like construction and travel expenses made up half of this value added. The arts, entertainment, recreation, accommodation, and food services industry was the largest contributor, with $112.9 billion in value added, followed by retail trade with $95.7 billion. The outdoor recreation economy in 2017 had a current-dollar value added of $427 billion, accounting for 2.2% of GDP. The arts, entertainment, recreation, accommodation, and food services industry was the largest contributor with $112.9 billion in value added, followed by retail trade with $95.7 billion. The outdoor recreation economy generated approximately 5.1 million jobs in 2017, with boating/fishing being the top activity contributing $21 billion in current-value dollars. The outdoor recreation economy in 2017 had a current-dollar value added of $427 billion, accounting for 2.2% of GDP. The activities that generated the most value added are not necessarily the most popular. For example, equestrian activities were among the six largest activities in terms of value added but among the three smallest activities for number of participants. Multiuse apparel and accessories accounted for over 11% of value added. The outdoor recreation economy grew 3.9% between 2016 and 2017. The outdoor recreation economy grew by 3.9% between 2016 and 2017, outpacing the overall U.S. economy. Real gross output, compensation, and employment all saw faster growth in the outdoor recreation sector. Hawaii, Montana, Maine, Vermont, and Wyoming had the highest proportions of state GDP from outdoor recreation in 2017. California, Florida, and Texas had the highest total outdoor recreation value added, while Wyoming, Hawaii, Alaska, and Maine had the highest percentage of state employment from outdoor recreation. The outdoor recreation economy's importance varies by state based on its size, overall economy, and employment patterns. BEA's estimates may change with method adjustments, with official state statistics due in fall 2020. Various groups create estimates of economic activity in outdoor recreation, with the Outdoor Industry Association's report being the most comprehensive. The Outdoor Industry Association (OIA) has been producing annual estimates of the outdoor recreation economy since 2006. According to OIA's 2017 report, the outdoor recreation economy generated $887 billion in consumer spending, supporting 7.6 million jobs and generating significant tax revenue. OIA's estimates cannot be directly compared to other estimation efforts due to differences in method, assumptions, and statistics reported. The Outdoor Industry Association (OIA) reports on consumer spending, tax revenue, and job estimates in the outdoor recreation economy. OIA's job estimate of 7.6 million is higher than BEA's 5.2 million, but comparisons are challenging due to differences in measurement and data inclusion. BEA excludes exports and imports in its calculations, while OIA's statistics may capture these figures. Other reports may include spending on items not used for outdoor recreation, leading to varying estimates compared to the OIA's Outdoor Recreation Satellite Account (ORSA). The ORSA and other reports may not be in agreement due to methodological differences, despite similarities in findings. Both reports show that expensive purchases like vehicles drive economic activity in outdoor recreation, with travel expenses also playing a significant role. National trends in outdoor recreation participation are primarily based on the National Survey on Recreation and the Environment conducted by the U.S. Forest Service. The National Survey on Recreation and the Environment (NSRE) conducted by the U.S. Forest Service measures participation and consumption in 17 outdoor activities. The most recent NSRE estimated that 194 million people participated in visiting developed sites annually, with a minimum of 8 million people participating in primitive skiing. Approximately 82% of NSRE respondents engaged in visiting developed sites. Between 1999 and 2009, participation in nature-based outdoor recreation increased, with certain activities like viewing nature, off-highway vehicle activities, and physically challenging activities seeing significant increases in participation. The most popular activity, viewing nature, was engaged in over 32.4 billion times, while other popular activities ranged from 8.3 billion to 1.8 billion times. Between 1999 and 2009, outdoor recreation participation increased, with activities like surfing showing large increases. More people participate in outdoor recreation in the eastern United States due to higher population density, but participation rates are higher in the West for most activities. Demographic factors like age, gender, and income are correlated with outdoor recreation rates, as well as availability and proximity to recreation settings. Approximately 60% of lands in the United States are privately owned, while 28% are federally owned, with the majority located in 11 western states and Alaska. The distribution of federal land between the eastern and western United States impacts outdoor recreation opportunities, as many visits come from people living within 50 miles of the properties. Private lands are a more popular recreation setting in the East, with four times more visits than in the West. Respondents in the West mainly spend their activity days on publicly owned lands, while those in the East split their time between private and public lands. Congressional interest in the economic impact of recreational opportunities on federal lands is evident through legislation and reports. In the past decade, federal agencies and interagency groups have conducted studies measuring economic contributions specific to federal lands. Visitors spent approximately $54 billion in local economies of federal recreation areas in FY2012 and $49.8 billion in FY2016, generating $55 billion in value added in FY2012 and $53.9 billion in value added in FY2016. The studies on economic contributions from federal lands show that outdoor recreation directly supported 880,000 jobs in FY2012 and 826,000 jobs in FY2016. The limitation of studies to areas within 50 miles of federal recreation sites may underestimate the true value if travel-related expenses beyond this radius are not captured. Federal lands in the United States cover approximately 640 million acres, with the majority located in 11 western states and Alaska. The Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management manage most of this land, which is open to the public for recreation. Different methods are used to measure visitation and economic activity, leading to potentially undercounted estimates. Major purchases like vehicles contribute significantly to the outdoor recreation economy, but may not always be reported by visitors, further impacting accuracy of data. Federal lands in the United States, managed by agencies like the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management, offer a variety of recreation opportunities. Each agency has its own niche, with activities ranging from camping and birdwatching to water-based activities. These resources attract visitors from local, regional, national, and international markets. Data on recreation visits to federal lands is presented in Table 3 from FY2012. Table 3 shows recreation visits to federal lands from FY2012 to FY2017. The statistics indicate that FS and NPS had the most visits, highlighting that size and location do not always predict visitation rates accurately. Factors like proximity to population centers and available resources also play a role in visitation numbers."
