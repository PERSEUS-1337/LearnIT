Congress finds a shortage of physicians and general surgeons in the United States, with projections showing a growing gap between supply and demand by 2030. Comprehensive research and data are needed to address future workforce demands. Quality data is essential for projecting physician workforce needs, considering factors like health outcomes, utilization trends, population growth, and system changes. Additional efforts are required to assess the adequacy of the current general surgeon workforce, especially in rural and surgical shortage areas. SEC. 3. STUDY ON DESIGNATION OF GENERAL SURGERY SHORTAGE AREAS. Part D of title III of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include a new section on the designation of General Surgery Shortage Areas. The term 'general surgery shortage area' refers to areas in the US underserved by general surgeons. The Secretary will conduct a study on the accuracy of current shortage designations in assessing the adequacy of general surgeons in addressing the needs of underserved populations. The Secretary will analyze methodologies for designating general surgery shortage areas in underserved populations, including assessing the accuracy of current shortage designations. The Secretary will analyze the effectiveness and accuracy of developing surgery service areas, identifying surgeons, establishing surgeon-to-population ratios, and determining threshold ratios for general surgeons in underserved populations. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress on the study conducted regarding the supply of general surgeons, consulting with relevant stakeholders and publishing data. The Secretary will periodically publish data in the Federal Register comparing availability and need of general surgery services in different areas, and designate general surgery shortage areas through a methodology developed via regulation. The Secretary will designate general surgery shortage areas in the United States using a methodology established through regulation. This includes publishing a list of the areas, reviewing and revising designations annually, and following procedures for notice, comment, dissemination of information, and reports to Congress. The Secretary will consult with stakeholders, including medical societies, surgical facilities, experts in general surgery, and patient organizations when designating general surgery shortage areas."
