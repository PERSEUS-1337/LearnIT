    "content": "The Act titled \"Pulmonary and Cardiac Rehabilitation Act of 2005\" covers items and services under cardiac and pulmonary rehabilitation programs. The Social Security Act is amended to include items and services provided under cardiac and pulmonary rehabilitation programs. The term 'cardiac rehabilitation program' is a physician-supervised program that provides specific items and services. The program must be delivered in a physician's office, clinic, or hospital on an outpatient basis. A physician must be readily available for medical consultation and emergencies during the program, and individualized treatment must be provided according to a written plan. The cardiac rehabilitation program requires individualized treatment under a physician's written plan every 30 days, detailing diagnosis, items/services, and patient goals. Services include physician-prescribed exercise, cardiac risk factor modification, and psychosocial assessment. The Secretary shall establish standards to ensure that a cardiac rehabilitation program includes individualized treatment tailored to the individual's needs, psychosocial assessment, outcomes assessment, and other necessary items and services determined by the Secretary. These items and services must be reasonable and necessary for diagnosis or treatment, expected to improve or maintain the individual's condition, and furnished under established guidelines. The Secretary will set standards for a cardiac rehabilitation program to be overseen by a licensed physician with expertise in cardiac management, responsible for the program and involved in directing individual patient progress. The Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program is overseen by a licensed physician with expertise in pulmonary management. The Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program, overseen by a licensed physician, includes physician-prescribed exercise, education or training tailored to individual needs, psychosocial assessment, outcomes assessment, and other necessary services determined by the Secretary.

The amendments made by this section involve directing individual patients in the program and apply to items and services furnished after the date of enactment of this Act."
