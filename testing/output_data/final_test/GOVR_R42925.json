    "content": "The Alien Tort Statute (ATS) grants district courts original jurisdiction over civil actions by aliens for torts committed in violation of the law of nations or a U.S. treaty. Codified at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1350, the ATS is a unique jurisdictional provision created in 1789 to provide redress for foreign nationals. In 1980, Paraguayan plaintiffs used the ATS in a case involving the wrongful death of their son by a Paraguayan official, marking the beginning of ATS \"foreign cubed\" cases where foreign plaintiffs sue foreign defendants for torts on foreign soil. In April 2013, the Supreme Court decided the case Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co, where Nigerian nationals sued Royal Dutch Petroleum Co. and Shell for aiding the Nigerian government in human rights violations during protests against oil drilling in the Ogoni Region. The debate focused on holding foreign corporations accountable for human rights abuses under the Alien Tort Statute. The Supreme Court ruled in the case Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co that the Alien Tort Statute does not apply to cases occurring abroad, preventing foreign cubed cases like Kiobel from being heard in federal courts. Royal Dutch and Shell argued against corporate liability, leading to a new inquiry on the recognition of causes of action under the ATS for violations of the law of nations within a foreign sovereign's territory. The Kiobel court held that the Alien Tort Statute does not apply to cases occurring abroad, preventing foreign cubed cases from being heard in federal courts. The Court left a door open for cases that \"touch and concern the territory of the United States,\" but only if those cases do so with enough force to rebut the presumption. The majority declined to comment on corporate liability, resolving the case on the issue of extraterritorial jurisdiction. The curr_chunk discusses the history of the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) over the past 30 years, focusing on the Filartiga case, corporate liability, the Kiobel decision, and its implications on future cases. In 1781, the Continental Congress struggled to provide redress for violations of international law, leading to the ATS. In 1781, Congress urged state legislatures to punish treaty violations and uphold international norms. Despite pleas, states' response was lacking, leading to friction with other nations. In 1784, the US faced criticism when a French official was assaulted in Philadelphia, causing tension with France. The Continental Congress faced diplomatic challenges when the French Minister Plenipotentiary threatened to leave the United States unless provided with a remedy for a violation of diplomatic immunity. The federal government was unable to act, leading to concerns about potential conflicts under the law of nations. This incident, along with a similar one involving the Dutch Ambassador in New York City, highlighted the lack of judicial powers at the federal level to address such cases, raising concerns about the ability to provide judicial relief to foreign officials. These incidents contributed to the need for a solution to prevent potential conflicts with other nations. The need for a federal judiciary in the United States was highlighted by incidents involving foreign officials being injured, leading to concerns about potential conflicts with other nations. Alexander Hamilton emphasized the importance of having a national tribunal to address cases involving foreigners, as the denial of justice could lead to just causes of war. The federal judiciary was seen as necessary to prevent such conflicts and ensure the peace of the whole. The Alien Tort Statute (ATS) was enacted in 1789 and later codified in 1878 as 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1350, granting district courts jurisdiction over civil actions by aliens for torts committed in violation of international law or U.S. treaties. The legislative history of the ATS is sparse, with few successful cases brought under it in the following 200 years. In 1980, the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) was revived after two centuries of dormancy in the landmark human rights case, Filartiga v. Pena-Irala. The case involved allegations of torture and murder by a Paraguayan police officer, leading to a significant legal interpretation by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Filartiga opened the federal courts for adjudication of international law rights, leading to \"foreign cubed\" claims. Tel-Oren v. Libya exemplifies the controversy surrounding the modern understanding of the ATS, involving survivors of a terrorist attack in Israel. The survivors of a terrorist attack in Israel, allegedly committed by the Palestine Liberation Organization and assisted by Libya, brought a case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The court agreed to dismiss the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, with three separate concurring opinions reflecting the challenges of interpreting the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) due to a lack of historical context and precedent. Judge Robb found the case nonjusticiable under the political question doctrine. Judge Robb argued that decisions about terrorism should be left to the political branches, as interfering with foreign affairs and national interest is beyond the federal courts' responsibilities. Judge Bork also concluded that the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) does not provide a cause of action, citing the lack of legislative intent and the risk of encroaching on political matters. Judge Edwards disagreed with his colleagues, affirming the lower court's decision to create a private cause of action under the ATS based on evolving international normative law. He focused on individual liability of non-state actors, stating that the ATS permits some individual liability despite the established international law. Judge Edwards found that the law of nations attributes individual responsibility for a \"handful of crimes,\" opening the possibility for some individuals to be liable under the ATS. Interpreting the ATS has been a challenge for judges, leading to varied interpretations and confusion in its application in courts. The 1995 decision in Ka dic v. Karadzic was a landmark case in determining individual liability under the ATS. The case involved allegations of human rights violations by the self-proclaimed president of the Bosnia-Serb Republic. The Second Circuit held that certain conduct can violate the law of nations, reversing a federal district court decision. The Second Circuit reversed a decision, stating that certain conduct can violate international law regardless of state involvement. The issue of corporate liability under the Alien Tort Statute sparked a debate, with varied conclusions from appeals courts. The first case addressing corporate liability was Doe v. Unocal Corp in 2002, where villagers from Myanmar sued Unocal for human rights violations. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held Unocal liable for human rights violations during the construction of a gas pipeline. This case marked the beginning of addressing corporate liability under the Alien Tort Statute, with Unocal being the first corporation held responsible for violating international law. The 2004 Supreme Court decision in Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain addressed corporate liability through an ambiguous footnote. The case involved the abduction of a Mexican physician accused of prolonging the torture of a DEA agent. Alvarez-Machain sued Jose Francisco Sosa and others, claiming a violation of international law under the ATS. The Supreme Court in Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain determined that the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) is a strictly jurisdictional statute and does not create a cause of action. Despite this, the statute was intended to have immediate practical effect without requiring congressional action. The Court specified that any cause of action under the ATS must be carefully determined by courts to align with 18th-century norms and consider the practical consequences. The Supreme Court in Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain emphasized the need for caution in crafting remedies for violations of new norms of international law under the Alien Tort Statute. The Court highlighted the importance of considering potential foreign policy consequences and mentioned the issue of corporate liability in a debated footnote. In the decade following Unocal, several appeals courts addressed corporate liability under the Alien Tort Statute (ATS). The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit held a corporation explicitly liable in Romero v. Drummond Co. in 2008. The D.C. Circuit also discussed corporate liability in Doe v. Exxon Mobil Corp in 2011, stating that the law of nations does not create civil remedies or private rights of action. The court examined corporate liability under federal common law, stating that corporations are liable for their torts like individuals. It criticized Exxon's reliance on Sosa footnote 20, clarifying that it did not distinguish private actors from corporations. The D.C. Circuit, Seventh Circuit, and Ninth Circuit all addressed corporate liability under the Alien Tort Statute. In 2010, the Second Circuit ruled in Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co. that the Alien Tort Statute does not grant jurisdiction over corporations. The case involved foreign plaintiffs from Nigeria suing Royal Dutch Petroleum Co. The Supreme Court later focused on the issue of extraterritorial jurisdiction under the ATS, sidestepping the debate on corporate liability. The respondents, Royal Dutch Petroleum Company (Royal Dutch) and Shell Transport and Trading Company PLC's (Shell) subsidiary, Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria (SPDC), are accused of aiding human rights violations in Ogoni by the Nigerian government. The SPDC has been exploring for oil in Ogoni since 1958, leading to protests by the \"Movement for Survival of Ogoni People.\" The Nigerian military allegedly attacked Ogoni villages in collaboration with the oil companies. The plaintiffs accused Royal Dutch Petroleum Company and Shell of aiding human rights violations in Ogoni by the Nigerian government. They alleged that the companies provided support to the military forces involved in attacking Ogoni villages, leading to crimes against humanity, torture, and arbitrary arrest. The plaintiffs sought justice under the ATS in the Southern District of New York. The Second Circuit ruled that international law, not domestic law, governs under the ATS and does not recognize liability for corporations. Citing Sosa and international law treatises, the court emphasized the need to look to international law for determining liability. It also examined whether international law holds corporations liable, focusing on Nazi Germany's war crimes and its partnership with I.G. Farben. The tribunal found that I.G. Farben, despite its complicity in Nazi war crimes, was not held criminally liable as international law does not recognize corporate liability under the ATS. The court emphasized the need to establish individual guilt for human rights crimes, stating that corporations act through individuals who must be proven to have participated or authorized the illegal acts. The Kiobel court emphasized individual moral responsibility for crimes against international law, stating that corporate liability is not recognized. The Supreme Court later focused on the jurisdiction for extraterritorial torts under the ATS. The Kiobel ruling addressed extraterritorial jurisdiction under the ATS, determining that it did not apply based on the specific facts of the case. The Court's decision was unanimous, but there was disagreement on the rule moving forward. Chief Justice Roberts wrote the majority opinion, questioning the presumption against extraterritorial application. The Court examined whether the presumption against extraterritorial application applied to the ATS, concluding that it does in foreign cubed ATS cases. The presumption ensures that legislation applies only within the U.S. territory, as observed in Chief Justice Rehnquist's Aramco opinion. Congress is assumed to legislate with this presumption unless clearly indicated otherwise. The presumption against extraterritoriality applies to the ATS in foreign cubed cases, ensuring legislation applies only within U.S. territory. This principle, as stated in Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd., restricts laws to domestic conditions unless clearly indicated otherwise by Congress. The Chief Justice emphasized that decisions affecting foreign policy, whether jurisdictional or on the merits, can have serious consequences. The ATS poses a higher level of danger in jurisdictional cases due to potential unwarranted judicial interference in foreign policy. Courts must exercise caution in recognizing causes under the ATS to avoid impinging on the discretion of the Legislative and Executive Branches in managing foreign affairs. The ATS poses a danger of unwarranted judicial interference in foreign policy, requiring caution to prevent courts from affecting foreign affairs managed by the Legislative and Executive Branches. Amici briefs from other countries, like the Federal Republic of Germany, express concerns about ATS jurisdiction interfering with their sovereign interests. Applying the ATS to extraterritorial torts goes against the statute's purpose of preventing diplomatic issues. The Court warned that allowing extraterritorial reach under the ATS could lead to diplomatic discord and potential legal actions against American citizens in foreign courts. This decision-making power should remain with the political branches to avoid international conflicts. The Court concluded that dangerous decision making should remain with the political branches to avoid international conflicts. Justice Breyer disagreed with the majority's use of the presumption against extraterritoriality, stating that the ATS was enacted with foreign matters in mind. The Court responded to the petitioners' contention regarding the application of the presumption against extraterritoriality for causes of action under the statute. The Court examined the text, history, and purposes of the ATS to determine if it applies extraterritorially. It concluded that there is no clear indication of extraterritoriality in the ATS, as it covers torts brought by aliens without specifying where the actions should take place. The petitioners argued that the use of the word \"torts\" implied jurisdiction, but the Court disagreed. The Court disagreed with petitioners' argument that the word \"torts\" in the ATS implied jurisdiction over transitory torts in foreign territories. The Court emphasized that jurisdiction is based on a well-founded belief in the cause of action's validity in that place, not on generic terms like \"any civil action.\" The Court found that the historical background of the ATS did not indicate intent for extraterritorial reach. Contextual understanding of international law violations at the time of the ATS creation was considered, focusing on violations like safe conducts, rights of ambassadors, and piracy. The Court pointed out that violations of safe conducts and rights of ambassadors under the ATS did not involve extraterritorial activity but rather domestic conduct. Examples of international law violations toward ambassadors on American soil were cited, including incidents in the mid-1780s. The majority concluded that contemporary incidents involving wrongful seizures in U.S. territory did not support the expectation of causes of action under the ATS for violations of the law of nations occurring throughout. The Court distinguished piracy from other international law violations, stating that applying U.S. law to acts on pirate ships was different from acts on sovereign ships. The ATS does not necessarily apply extraterritorially to actions against pirates. The Court differentiated piracy from other international law violations, stating that applying U.S. law to pirate ships was not the same as applying it to sovereign ships. Pirates were considered fair game, operating outside any jurisdiction. The Court referenced a 1795 opinion by Attorney General William Bradford, where U.S. citizens joined a French privateer fleet to attack Sierra Leone during the Napoleonic wars. Bradford's response to the British ambassador's protest suggested that the ATS may not necessarily apply extraterritorially to actions against pirates. The ambassador stated that crimes committed on the high seas fall under the jurisdiction of U.S. courts, allowing for legal prosecution. However, there is uncertainty regarding the application of criminal law in these cases. Victims of such acts have the option to seek remedy through civil suits in U.S. courts. The ATS application to law of nations violations on foreign sovereign territory was debated, with different interpretations presented. The Court declined to adopt a definitive reading of the passage by Attorney General Bradford, stating it related to actions by U.S. citizens violating a treaty with Great Britain. The Court considered the violation of a treaty between the United States and Great Britain under the ATS, questioning the intention of the First Congress and the presumption against extraterritoriality. It was suggested that the ATS was not meant to make the US the \"custos morum of the whole world\" but to provide judicial relief for incidents involving foreign diplomats in the US. The Supreme Court applied the presumption against extraterritoriality to the Alien Tort Statute (ATS), barring a case where the conduct occurred outside the US. The Court emphasized that even if claims touch US territory, they must do so strongly enough to overcome the presumption. This decision referenced the Morrison v. National Australia Bank case regarding extraterritorial application of laws. The Morrison Court found that the Securities Exchange Act's focus was on the location of securities purchases or sales, not the place of origin. The presumption against extraterritorial application requires further analysis, as some domestic activity does not automatically trigger its application. The Court in Morrison focused on the location of securities purchases or sales, not the place of origin. The \"touch and concern\" test for foreign cubed cases was not clearly defined, with Justices Kennedy and Breyer providing some suggestions. Justice Alito believed the test should be narrowed to only include cases occurring in the United States. Justice Kennedy concurred with the Court's decision in Morrison, suggesting that the test for foreign cases should be narrowed to those occurring in the United States. He noted that while some human rights abuses abroad are addressed by existing statutes like the TVPA, there may be cases in the future that require further clarification on the application of international law principles. The \"touch and concern\" test in foreign cubed cases under the ATS may allow for redress, according to Justice Kennedy. Justice Alito, on the other hand, believes the ATS should not apply to conduct outside U.S. territory. He suggests a broader standard should be applied, contrary to the Court's preference for a narrow approach. In Morrison, Justice Alito interprets the ATS to only allow redress for domestic conduct that violates an international law norm and meets Sosa's requirements. Justice Breyer, in his concurring opinion, disagrees with the majority's reasoning and looks to international law principles to determine who can be held accountable under the ATS. Justice Breyer interprets the ATS to allow jurisdiction in cases where the alleged tort occurs on American soil, the defendant is an American national, or the defendant's conduct substantially affects an important American national interest. This includes providing safe harbor for criminals who commit human rights violations. Breyer's test is broader than the \"touch and concern\" test, but he found the Kiobel plaintiffs' case did not sufficiently involve American interests. In his 1984 Tel-Oren concurrence, Judge Bork expressed hope for clarification on the ATS, which still remains unclear after 30 years. The Supreme Court's narrow approach in recent ATS cases has limited its jurisdiction, leading to varied responses from the academic community. Some believe the \"touch and concern\" test will push human rights plaintiffs to seek redress elsewhere, while others argue against this notion. The Kiobel case has sparked debates on the future of transnational litigation and corporate liability under the ATS. While some believe the ATS door is closed, others see potential for corporate liability based on ties to U.S. territory. The Court's comment on \"mere corporate presence\" has implications for future cases involving abuses by corporations. The Kiobel case has sparked debates on the future of transnational litigation and corporate liability under the ATS. Some argue that even injuries in foreign countries involving abuses by corporations can still be brought to court. However, uncertainty remains regarding the application of the \"touch and concern\" test, leaving the fate of corporate liability cases uncertain. Commentators suggest that the Court's decision may radically change how the statute has been applied, but it is not surprising given the political atmosphere surrounding the ATS as a human rights vehicle. The Filartiga line of cases, including the 2004 Sosa decision, relied heavily on judge-made law due to the lack of guidance from the statute itself. The Court's silence in the Sosa decision was interpreted as approval of Filartiga, but also as a limitation on ATS jurisdiction. This shift in power within the federal courts has led to uncertainty regarding the future application of the ATS in human rights cases. The Sosa decision was seen as both approving of Filartiga and limiting ATS jurisdiction with a specificity test. Some caution against reading too much into Kiobel, especially regarding corporate liability. Lower courts have been cautious in their post-Kiobel decisions, with some cases being remanded due to lack of jurisdiction. Judges seem to be interpreting the Supreme Court's stance on ATS cases very carefully. Recent cases show judges being cautious in asserting jurisdiction under the ATS for claims arising abroad. One notable case, Mwani v. Bin Laden, involves Kenyan victims of an Al Qaeda explosion outside the American Embassy in Nairobi. The events were directed at the US government with the intention of harming the country and its citizens, potentially meeting the \"touch and concern\" test. Judge Facciola certified the issue for appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) due to potential disagreement among judges on the application of the \"touch and concern\" test in extraterritorial cases, particularly in human rights litigation involving terrorist attacks on US Embassies. The importance of addressing human rights cases globally has been recognized since the Nuremberg trials, but future cases may distinguish based on the specific circumstances, especially in foreign cubed cases involving corporate aiding. Plaintiffs in foreign cubed cases, especially those involving corporate aiding and abetting, face challenges in overcoming the presumption against extraterritorial application. Justice Kennedy's concurrence suggests human rights cases may be an exception, but clarification on the fate of ATS cases may need to come from other sources. The Torture Victim Protection Act (TVPA) provides redress for victims of torture and extrajudicial killing by individuals in official capacities in other countries, but foreign cubed cases claiming corporate liability cannot seek redress under the TVPA. The Kiobel case has created uncertainty for foreign cubed human rights cases under the new jurisdiction test of the ATS. Congress has the power to provide redress for extraterritorial torts and establish corporate liability in human rights cases."
