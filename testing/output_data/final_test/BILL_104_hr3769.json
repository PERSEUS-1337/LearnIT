Conditions for transfer of Railroad Grant Lands, Wagon Road Grant Lands, federally owned timberlands managed by the Bureau of Land Management, and related property in Oregon require a resolution of assent by the state legislature by December 31, 1999. The State of Oregon must manage the lands for sustained-yield timber production, in trust for the O&C counties, and for the benefit of the people of Oregon and the United States. The State of Oregon will manage the lands conveyed by this Act for permanent timber production under sustained yield principles to support local economies. They will also protect watersheds, regulate stream flows, provide wildlife habitat, and facilitate land trades with private and public landowners within the O&C Counties. The State of Oregon will manage transferred lands based on scientific information. Prior to 2004, management will follow Northwest Forest Plan standards. After 2004, a habitat conservation plan under the Endangered Species Act will guide management. The State of Oregon will manage transferred lands based on scientific information and coordinate with management on lands remaining in Federal ownership. A fund called the \"O&C Lands Fund\" has been established in the treasury of Oregon for revenues derived from timber sales. Prior to January 1, 2004, annual disbursements will be made to O&C counties from the fund. Beginning January 1, 2004, 50 percent of gross revenues deposited in the O&C Lands Fund will be utilized for management of the lands conveyed by this Act. 50% of gross revenues deposited in the O&C Lands Fund will be disbursed annually to the O&C counties based on past disbursements. The remaining 50% will be used by the State of Oregon for land management purposes outlined in the Act, with any leftover funds available for public use at the state's discretion. Payments to O&C counties will not affect other state program payments. The State of Oregon will accept title to lands subject to existing rights and obligations of the United States. A mineral rights program will be administered for individuals with mining claims or patents. Patented lands within transferred lands are exempt, except for access protection. The State program ensures that mining claim holders and patent applicants will have rights no less favorable than under Federal law as of January 1, 1996. Holders of first-half final patent certificates will receive full patents within two years. Unpatented mining claims and patent applications will have the same rights as under Federal law. The State program established under this Act ensures that mining claim holders will have rights no less favorable than under Federal law as of January 1, 1996. Any fees charged under the State program shall be paid to the State. Lands capable of timber production will not be sold, transferred, or disposed of except in specific cases. The State will manage lands as parks and campgrounds, and reserve some lands from commercial timber production as of January 1, 1996. The State will hold conveyed lands open for recreational uses and give employment preference to former Bureau of Land Management employees in Oregon. The United States retains a right of reentry on lands transferred to Oregon until January 1, 2025, if not managed according to specified conditions. This right can be enforced if noncompliance is not resolved within two years after a determination by the Secretary. The United States retains a right of reentry on lands transferred to Oregon until January 1, 2025, if not managed according to specified conditions. The right of reentry will vest if the Secretary files a declaration within three months after the two-year period and records it in the county recorder's office before January 1, 2050. The United States must manage the lands upon reentry. The United States shall manage transferred lands for permanent timber production for local communities, with revenues distributed as per the Act of August 28, 1937. The right of reentry will expire on January 1, 2050 if not exercised sooner. The Act requires the preparation of amendments to Federal land management plans to anticipate land transfer and State management by January 1, 2004. It also suspends laws made obsolete by the transfer of railroad and wagon road grant lands. The Act suspends certain laws effective January 1, 2004, related to the transfer of lands and reversion to the United States."
