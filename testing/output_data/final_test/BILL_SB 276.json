    "title": "SB 276",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature declares that local educational agencies must have an approved agreement with the State Department of Health Care Services to provide services under the LEA Medi-Cal billing option program. They must reinvest federal reimbursements in health and social services for children and families, and have a collaborative committee for decision-making. Qualified medical practitioners employed or contracted by the LEA provide assessment and necessary health services. The LEA billing option allows schools to reinvest in health and social services for students and families, providing comprehensive health services to eligible Medi-Cal students. Practitioners can bill for services provided after January 1, 1993, without expanding the scope of practice or changing Medi-Cal billing requirements. For enrollment under this section, the local educational agency must be the service provider and maintain a contract with the department. Services should be provided by existing safety net and traditional health care providers. Covered services may include various local educational agency services. The curr_chunk discusses exemptions for medical transportation billing under specific regulations in California. It mentions conditions where certain regulations do not apply and specifies when these exemptions will become inoperative. The department will post the declaration on its website and send copies to relevant committees. If a statute doesn't extend the date, certain services will become inoperative on January 1, 2018. These services include nursing, occupational therapy, physical therapy, physician services, and mental health counseling. (g) Local educational agencies may provide various services including physical therapy, physician services, mental health counseling, speech pathology, audiology, and targeted case management for children. These services can be offered by licensed professionals or credentialed individuals as authorized by law. For the purposes of this section, a \"local educational agency\" includes the governing bodies of school districts, community college districts, county offices of education, charter schools, state special schools, California State University campuses, and University of California campuses. Community college districts, California State University campuses, and University of California campuses can bill for services provided to any student who is a Medi-Cal recipient, regardless of age. The department must annually report funds collected from federal Medicaid payments for local educational agencies, including withheld funds. Costs for this report should not exceed $250,000. The department can seek federal funding for services provided by local educational agencies to eligible Medi-Cal beneficiaries, regardless of whether the child has an IEP or IFSP. The local educational agency must determine if the child has an IEP or IFSP and if services are provided at no cost. They are required to pursue claims for payment of covered services from third parties as per federal law. If a legally liable third party receives a claim from a local educational agency, they must either reimburse the claim or issue a denial of coverage. If there is no response within 45 days, the agency can bill the Medi-Cal program. The agency must keep a copy of the claim for three years. This process is pending federal approvals before implementation."
