    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Healthy Air for Federal Workers Act\". Congress finds that in 2006, the Surgeon General concluded that there is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke, which causes disease and premature death in children and adults. Exposure to secondhand smoke has immediate adverse effects on the cardiovascular system, leading to coronary heart disease and lung cancer. The only way to prevent exposure is to eliminate it, as other approaches like air ventilation systems do not work. According to the American Lung Association, 23 States are affected by secondhand smoke. According to the American Lung Association, 23 States have passed comprehensive smoke-free laws protecting workers. The smoking of tobacco products is prohibited within 25 feet of any entrances, exits, windows, or ventilation intakes of Federal buildings. An exception is made for smoking conducted solely for research purposes by an agency. Enforcement measures are outlined. The Administrator of General Services, along with agency heads, enforces compliance with the Act in Executive Branch buildings. The House Office Building Commission, Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, and Architect of the Capitol enforce the prohibition in Legislative Branch buildings. The Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts will enforce the prohibition in Federal buildings used by the Federal courts and the judicial branch. Implementation of this Act will begin within 3 months of enactment. The Administrator of General Services, in collaboration with agency heads, will oversee activities in Federal buildings described in the Act.
