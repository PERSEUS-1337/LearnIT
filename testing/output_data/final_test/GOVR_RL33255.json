    "content": "The legal framework for international civil aviation rights dates back to the 1919 Paris Convention, which established the principle of national sovereignty over airspace. The Chicago Convention in 1944 further solidified this principle and favored bilateral air transport agreements over multilateral accords. The signatories agreed to grant each other two of the \"five freedoms\" of air transport. The Chicago Convention in 1944 established the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to regulate international civil aviation. International civil aviation rights have developed through bilateral agreements between the United States and foreign countries, favoring the U.S. with executive agreements. These agreements allowed the U.S. to designate gateway cities and carriers, and air carriers had the right to determine capacity with vague guidelines. The Federal Aviation Act of 1958 governs air transportation and commerce, requiring air carriers to hold a certificate for providing air transportation. The Secretary of Transportation issues certificates of public convenience and necessity to U.S. citizens after determining their fitness. To operate as an air carrier in the United States, an entity must be a U.S. citizen and comply with regulations. Cabotage, the right of a foreign airline to transport passengers and cargo within the same country, is generally prohibited in U.S. law. Aircraft can only carry passengers or cargo within the U.S. if specifically authorized. Foreign aircraft are not permitted to perform cabotage within the United States unless specifically authorized under certain conditions. The Secretary of Transportation has the authority to waive economic-related statutory provisions in the public interest, but the cabotage prohibition is not among them. The Civil Reserve Air Fleet Program is an incentive program exclusively available to domestic air carriers. The Civil Reserve Air Fleet Program (CRAF) allows domestic air carriers to supply aircraft voluntarily to increase military airlift capacity. In 1992, the Department of Transportation announced the \"Open Skies\" initiative to liberalize international civil aviation with 11 principles including open entry on all routes, unrestricted capacity, and frequency, flexibility in setting fares, and liberal cargo arrangements. The \"Open Skies\" initiative, announced in 1992, aimed to liberalize international civil aviation by allowing U.S. carriers free access to foreign markets. It included principles such as open entry on all routes, unrestricted capacity, flexibility in setting fares, and liberal cargo arrangements. The United States is party to 74 \"Open Skies\" Agreements worldwide, including in Europe where agreements were reached with various countries. This allows U.S. carriers quasi-cabotage rights within the European Union, enabling them to operate hub and spoke networks within Europe. The European Commission sought a mandate to negotiate a bilateral aviation agreement with the United States due to the growing dominance of U.S. air carriers in Europe. In 2002, legal action was taken against EU Member states that independently negotiated \"Open Skies\" Agreements with the U.S. The European Court of Justice found certain provisions discriminatory and contrary to EU law. The European Court of Justice found certain provisions in bilateral aviation agreements between EU Member states and the United States discriminatory and contrary to EU law. This led to questioning the legal status of existing \"Open Skies\" Agreements and granted the European Commission a mandate to negotiate a civil aviation agreement with the United States. Negotiations for a comprehensive air transportation agreement, known as the \"Open Aviation Area\" or \"Transatlantic Common Aviation Area,\" have faced challenges due to differences on key issues. In November 2005, a negotiations breakthrough was announced between the EU and the US for a preliminary aviation agreement. The agreement would allow every EU and US airline to fly between any city in the EU and the US, determine flights, routes, and fares based on market demand, and enter into cooperative arrangements with other airlines. This agreement was seen as providing new opportunities for airlines and promoting healthier competition in the travel market. The draft agreement allows carriers to enter cooperative arrangements like code-sharing and leasing. However, meaningful reform in the international aviation market may require Congress to repeal the \"citizenship test\" limiting foreign ownership of U.S. carriers. The proposed agreement does not address foreign ownership, leaving each party to set its own rules. U.S. law mandates air carriers to be \"citizens of the United States\" to operate domestically. The definition of \"Citizen of the United States\" includes individuals, partnerships, and corporations with certain citizenship criteria. This statutory language has been in place since 1938 and was amended in 2003 to align with the Department of Transportation's requirements for actual control. The Department of Transportation has a long-standing precedent for requiring actual control of an air carrier for citizenship purposes, as established through administrative decisions by the Civil Aeronautics Board. This interpretation dates back to a 1940 case involving Urbana, Medellin, and Central Airways, where the CAB reviewed the airlines' corporate structure and stockholders to determine citizenship eligibility. The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) focused on the citizenship requirement for air carriers, emphasizing the need for actual control by U.S. citizens in management. They expanded their inquiry to ensure that foreign influence did not overshadow U.S. control, allowing them to look beyond formalities to assess the substance of management. The CAB's interpretation of the citizenship requirement for air carriers emphasized the need for actual control by U.S. citizens in management, expanding their inquiry beyond formal compliance with the statute. In a case involving Interamerican Airfreight, the CAB examined whether a Swiss citizen's control over the airline disqualified it from U.S. citizenship. The CAB scrutinized the control of Interamerican Airfreight by a Swiss citizen, concerned about foreign control masking as U.S. citizenship. Mr. Daetwyler's significant control over operations raised red flags for the CAB. The CAB found significant control by Mr. Daetwyler over Interamerican, with 25% stock ownership and one-third of the board. Foreign control was noted due to close relationships with foreign stockholders. In a separate case, the DOT reviewed a merger involving Northwest Airlines and Wings Holdings, where a Dutch company held the largest equity stake, raising citizenship concerns. The DOT cited the Daetwyler decision favorably, stating that the control test has traditionally been complex. They declined to list specific factors for determining control, emphasizing a case-by-case analysis. The merger between Northwest Airlines and Wings Holdings raised citizenship concerns due to KLM's substantial power and equity interest in the new company. The DOT found that Wings Holdings, Inc. was not a U.S. citizen as defined by the Federal Aviation Act due to KLM's increased incentive to participate in business decisions, corporate structure allowing influence without voting rights, and competition with Northwest. Additionally, the DOT considered foreign control factors regarding equity/debt relationships. The DOT's methodology involves looking beyond corporate structure to determine \"actual control\" by U.S. citizens. Factors considered include equity ownership, relationships, voting rights, veto power, agreements, competitive status, and other transaction features. A case involving DHL Airways raised the issue of foreign ownership and control, questioning if control by DHL Worldwide, a foreign company partially owned by Deutsche Post, made ASTAR Air Cargo not a U.S. citizen. The ACMI agreement between ASTAR and DHL Worldwide Express was a \"wet lease\" that allowed DHL to transport air cargo in the US. Challengers claimed it accounted for over 90% of ASTAR's revenues, included crucial payment provisions, and shifted risks to DHL. The agreement also gave DHL power to veto control changes, limit third-party business, and audit ASTAR's financial records. The case was decided by an ALJ who found that DHL had significant control over ASTAR. The ASTAR case was decided by an ALJ who concluded that ASTAR is a US citizen. The ALJ provided a two-step analysis to determine control by a predominant customer, but in this case, control by DHL Worldwide as a predominate customer could not be established. The ALJ concluded that ASTAR is a US citizen and not a \"captive supplier\" due to its ability to pursue third-party business independently of its agreement with DHL Worldwide. The agreement provided ASTAR with incentives to expand its business, including a guaranteed payment of $15 million from DHL Worldwide. Despite administrative provisions in the agreement, ASTAR retained control over essential decisions. The DOT proposed clarifications on \"actual control\" in the ACMI, where U.S. citizens must demonstrate control over organizational documentation to be considered U.S. citizens. The DOT proposed clarifications on \"actual control\" in the ACMI, focusing on organizational documentation, CRAF commitments, transportation security requirements, and safety requirements. In cases where a foreign investor's home country denies reciprocal investment rights to U.S. citizens, traditional actual control analysis would apply. The DOT justifies its new interpretation based on nonlegal or policy grounds. The DOT proposes changes to the interpretation of \"actual control\" in the airline industry, citing the need to adapt to global economic changes and support U.S. carriers' competitiveness. They acknowledge legal requirements for U.S. citizenship but argue for flexibility to facilitate commercial opportunities. The DOT proposes changes to the interpretation of \"actual control\" in the airline industry, citing the need to adapt to global economic changes and support U.S. carriers' competitiveness. They assert that this proposal does not circumvent statutory requirements and would likely be reviewed based on the Chevron two-part test for judicial review of agency statutory interpretations. The Court emphasized that if Congress has not clearly addressed an issue, courts must defer to an agency's interpretation as long as it is permissible. When Congress implicitly delegates authority to an agency, the agency's interpretation of a statute should be respected over a court's own construction. Judges lack expertise in technical fields, while agencies are better suited to make policy choices and resolve competing interests. The rationale for judicial deference to agency interpretations is based on not assessing policy choices or resolving competing public interests, as agencies have greater expertise in regulatory matters. The DOT received comments on its NPRM, with focus on its legal authority to reinterpret the \"actual control\" requirement, argued to be vague and ambiguous. The DOT's interpretation of the \"actual control\" requirement is contentious, with supporters citing Chevron deference while opponents argue it goes against the statute's express language. Opponents of the NPRM argue that relinquishing control over key economic decisions of an air carrier makes other statutory requirements pointless. They also raise concerns about the military's reliance on the Civil Reserve Air Fleet Program (CRAF) for increasing airlift capacity. Prior to the NPRM, concerns were raised about changes to U.S. civil aviation ownership affecting the Civil Reserve Air Fleet Program (CRAF). The NPRM emphasizes the need for U.S. citizens to control decisions related to CRAF, but questions remain about foreign partners pressuring them to alter their participation. Continental Airlines and Delta Airlines highlighted the risk of new foreign owners divesting long-haul aircraft crucial to CRAF. The DOT issued a \"Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking\" in response to concerns about foreign investors influencing U.S. civil aviation ownership and the Civil Reserve Air Fleet Program (CRAF). The DOT clarified that delegations of authority to foreign interests must be revocable by the board of directors or voting shareholders. The DOT clarified that delegations of authority to foreign investors must be revocable to ensure \"actual control\" by U.S. citizens, as required by the Federal Aviation Act. The agency responded to legal arguments, asserting its authority to interpret and administer the statute based on established administrative law principles. The DOT asserts that the amendment to the Federal Aviation Act, which added the phrase \"actual control,\" did not limit the agency's discretion to interpret the statute. Congress recognized the need for continued agency interpretation and did not direct them to follow past interpretations. The floor manager stated that the amendment reflected existing law and would not impact the Department's determination of U.S. citizenship. The SNPR addressed legal and policy arguments, clarifying that airline participation in national defense operations must be controlled by U.S. citizens to prevent foreign influence. The DOT would investigate if national defense airlift operations were affected by decisions of foreign investors. Participation in CRAF is voluntary, and DOD can adjust incentives to maintain sufficient military airlift capacity. DOT argues that domestic carriers can make fleet decisions independently. The DOT argues that foreign owners making fleet decisions would be motivated by commercial incentives, so there should be no significant changes to CRAF commitment levels. A Memorandum of Understanding between DOT and DOD outlines procedures for considering air carrier citizenship issues related to CRAF commitments. The Memorandum of Understanding between DOT and DOD outlines procedures for air carrier fitness reviews related to CRAF commitments. DOT will notify DOD of fitness requests and share relevant documents, consulting with DOD on decisions. Meetings can be arranged in case of disagreements, and DOT will conduct fitness reviews if DOD demonstrates \"good cause.\" DOD agrees to provide necessary information for fitness reviews promptly to air carriers. Members of Congress have expressed concerns about CRAF commitments, airline employees, and consumer protection. Bills introduced in Congress aim to delay DOT's decision on the NPRM for one year and require a report to Congress before a final decision is made. The DOT must submit a report to Congress 180 days before making a final decision on the proposed rule regarding foreign control of U.S. airlines. The House and Senate addressed this issue in the 2006 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill, emphasizing the importance of U.S. airlines being under the 'actual control' of U.S. entities. The House Appropriations Committee suggested a 120-day delay in issuing a final rule on U.S. airlines' foreign ownership. The Senate proposed legislation to prevent the Department of Transportation from finalizing the rule, but it was not included in the final bill. The House Appropriations Committee proposed a delay in finalizing a rule on U.S. airlines' foreign ownership. The Senate suggested legislation to prevent the Department of Transportation from implementing the rule, which was not included in the final bill. The House Appropriations Committee proposed a delay in finalizing a rule on U.S. airlines' foreign ownership. The Senate suggested legislation to prevent the Department of Transportation from implementing the rule, which was not included in the final bill. The language in the rule does not have an independent enforcement mechanism, requiring Congress to rely on oversight functions or other laws like the Anti-Deficiency Act for compliance. Another issue in international civil aviation law is cabotage, which is currently prohibited for foreign air carriers under the Federal Aviation Act. Foreign aircraft are not allowed to perform cabotage within the United States unless specifically authorized. The Secretary of Transportation has the authority to waive certain economic-related provisions, but the cabotage prohibition is not included. Congress amended cabotage laws as part of the Vision-100 Century of Aviation Authorization Act. The enacted changes allow \"eligible cargo\" to be removed from foreign aircraft in Alaska without breaking its international journey. \"Eligible cargo\" is defined as cargo transported between Alaska and the US on a foreign air carrier under specific conditions. This exception provides a limited statutory allowance against the general prohibition on cabotage. The provisions allow for a limited exception to the general prohibition on cabotage activities. While the current draft \"Open Skies\" Agreement with the European Union does not require granting more cabotage rights to foreign carriers, it remains a significant issue in international civil aviation. Statutory changes would be needed for the executive branch to enter into any agreement to liberalize cabotage rules. Foreign aircraft can fly within U.S. airspace but are not allowed to engage in cabotage activities without specific authorization from Congress. The economic impact of a more liberal cabotage policy on the domestic airline industry is uncertain, as only Congress has the authority to amend the Federal Aviation Act to permit foreign carriers to engage in cabotage. The executive branch would need statutory changes to allow foreign carriers to engage in cabotage activities within U.S. airspace."
