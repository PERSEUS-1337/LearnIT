    "content": "The \"Keep It in the Ground Act of 2015\" is the short title of this Act. It includes findings and a statement of policy. Congress finds that global temperatures have increased by 0.9 degrees Celsius from 1880 to 2014, primarily due to human activities like burning fossil fuels. Greenhouse gas emissions and concentrations continue to rise, impacting the economy and leading to increased droughts, rising seas, and heat waves. The United States policy aims to manage Federal land and waters for the benefit of its people. To prevent catastrophic consequences like droughts, rising seas, and mass extinctions, at least 80 percent of carbon from proven fossil fuel reserves must be kept in the ground. Ending new leases for fossil fuels can prevent the release of 90 percent of potential emissions from Federal fossil fuels. The Federal Government aims to manage Federal land and waters for the benefit of the people of the United States by avoiding the dangerous impacts of climate change and promoting a rapid transition to a clean energy economy. This includes not issuing new leases or renewing nonproducing leases for coal, oil, or natural gas on Federal land or waters. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, the terms \"extend,\" \"nonproducing lease,\" \"reinstate,\" and \"renew\" are defined in relation to the Mineral Leasing Act. The term \"Secretary\" in this Act refers to the Secretary of the Interior. SEC. 4. STOPPING NEW OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS LEASES in the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific, Atlantic, and Arctic Oceans. Prohibition on new oil and gas leasing on the Outer Continental Shelf, including definitions for terms like \"extend\" and \"nonproducing lease.\" The lease contract allows extraction of oil shale, tar sands, or other fossil fuels. Terms like \"reinstate\" and \"renew\" are defined. The Secretary of the Interior is prohibited from issuing new leases or extending nonproducing leases for oil and gas exploration. The Secretary of the Interior is prohibited from issuing new leases or extending nonproducing leases for oil and gas exploration in specific areas of the Arctic, Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf of Mexico. Existing leases in the Beaufort Sea, Cook Inlet, or Chukchi Sea must be canceled within 60 days of the enactment of this Act. SEC. 5. STOPPING NEW COAL, OIL, TAR SANDS, FRACKED GAS, AND OIL SHALE LEASES ON FEDERAL LAND. The Secretary is prohibited from conducting any new lease sales or renewing existing nonproducing leases for onshore fossil fuels on federal land. The Secretary may exempt provisions of the Act for a lease in case of imminent national security threat, with the exemption lasting as long as the threat persists. Nonproducing leases can be renewed or extended if the lease contract was signed. The Secretary can renew or extend nonproducing lease contracts signed before the Act if it may lead to a court ruling of breach. Renewals or extensions should be for the shortest time possible. SEC. 7. SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Act or its amendments is deemed invalid or unconstitutional, the rest of the Act and amendments, as well as their application, will not be affected."
