It introduces an income tax credit for congressional campaign contributions under section 24 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Common Sense Campaign Reform Act\" introduces an income tax credit for congressional campaign contributions. Individuals can receive a credit against their tax for the taxable year, with limitations on the amount based on contribution percentages and maximum credit limits. Contributions must be verified to qualify for the credit. The \"Common Sense Campaign Reform Act\" defines a qualified congressional campaign contribution as a contribution made to a candidate for Congress in a primary, general, or special election, from a taxpayer who is a resident of the state where the election is held. The term 'candidate' is defined as an individual who publicly announces their candidacy for office and meets the qualifications prescribed by law. Dollar amounts in the legislation are subject to inflation adjustments based on the cost-of-living. The legislation allows for inflation adjustments to dollar amounts, with specific provisions for the calendar year in which the taxable year begins. No credit is allowed for estates and trusts. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections. The legislation includes amendments to the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, reducing the ceiling on multicandidate political committee contributions to candidates to $2,500 and increasing the ceiling on contributions to candidates by persons other than multicandidate political committees to $2,000. It also prohibits leadership committees. These changes apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 1993. SEC. 5 prohibits leadership committees for Federal office candidates. SEC. 6 prohibits contributions between multicandidate political committees. SEC. 7 adds reporting requirements for certain contributions.
