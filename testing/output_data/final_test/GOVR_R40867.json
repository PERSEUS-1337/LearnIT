    "content": "The report compares provisions for carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) in H.R. 2454 and S. 1733, two cap-and-trade bills aimed at reducing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. CCS is highlighted for its potential to reduce CO2 emissions from industrial sources like coal-fired power plants. This is crucial for the coal industry, which generates half of U.S. electricity and 40% of CO2 emissions from fossil fuels. CCS is seen as vital for reducing emissions without disrupting the U.S. economy. The CCS provisions in H.R. 2454 and S. 1733 aim to spur commercial deployment of CCS to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from industrial sources like coal-fired power plants. Without federal incentives, low emission allowance prices and high CCS installation costs could hinder additional deployment. Questions remain about the consequences of accelerated CCS development, including financial, legal, regulatory, infrastructure, environmental, and public acceptance issues. Both bills attempt to address these concerns to some extent. Both H.R. 2454 and S. 1733 aim to promote the commercial development of CCS projects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. They both require the EPA to regulate CO2 sequestration and share the goal of widespread CCS deployment by 2030. The House and Senate bills aim to regulate geologic sequestration of CO2 under the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Clean Air Act. They also propose creating financial incentives for commercial-scale CCS development. The Carbon Capture and Storage Early Deployment Act, introduced by Representative Boucher, would provide $1 billion annually for eligible projects. The program would be largely controlled by the electricity generating industry once a private corporation is established. Additionally, S. 1733 and H.R. 2454 propose distributing emission allowances to electric generating plants and industrial facilities, with S. 1733 offering significant financial incentives for CCS technology. S. 1733 allocates allowances to a larger proportion of electricity generating capacity in the first phase, favoring CCS technology with higher bonus allowance values. The program focuses on CO2 capture and assumes requirements for transportation and sequestration stages are in place. The regulatory requirements for transportation and sequestration stages must be in place before capture technology is operational. H.R. 2454 and S. 1733 aim to address these requirements through amendments to existing acts and national strategy development for CCS. Challenges remain in meeting transportation and sequestration aspects alongside technological and financial hurdles. CCS success hinges on regulatory structure, transportation capacity, liability resolution for CO2 storage, and public acceptance. The provisions in H.R. 2454 and S. 1733 aim to address key legal and regulatory barriers to the deployment of carbon capture and sequestration technology. The Administrator of the EPA would be required to submit a report to Congress detailing a national strategy for overcoming these barriers within one year of enactment. This report would identify barriers that could be addressed using existing federal authority and those that would require new legislation, as well as barriers that could be best addressed at the state, tribal, or regional level. The report is to include regulatory, legislative, or other recommendations to address gaps and barriers at the state, tribal, or regional level. The Senate bill calls for wide deployment of commercial-scale CCS in the US and Asia before 2030. Section 112 of the House bill requires the EPA Administrator to regulate geologic sequestration of CO2 under the Clean Air Act and Safe Drinking Water Act. The EPA Administrator is directed to establish a coordinated certification and permitting process for geologic sequestration sites, reducing redundancy with SDWA requirements and minimizing regulatory burden. Within two years, CAA regulations must be promulgated to protect human health and the environment from atmospheric release of carbon dioxide during geologic sequestration, including enhanced oil and gas recovery. The regulations will include a certification process, monitoring, record keeping, and reporting requirements. The EPA Administrator is required to report on geologic sequestration activities, including monitoring, record keeping, and reporting on injected and escaped emissions. The report must be submitted to specific congressional committees every three years, evaluating sequestration sites and federal regulations, with recommendations for improvement. The EPA's proposed geologic sequestration rulemaking aims to expand regulatory authority to protect against atmospheric CO2 releases under the CAA. H.R. 2454 would amend SDWA to require regulation of CO2 sequestration wells, including financial responsibility provisions for emergency response, well closure, and post-injection care. H.R. 2454 aims to delegate oversight of geologic sequestration wells to states, with EPA oversight. It also calls for a task force to study the legal framework for CO2 storage. The bill H.R. 2454 delegates oversight of geologic sequestration wells to states with EPA oversight and calls for a task force to study the legal framework for CO2 storage, including state environmental statutes, liability models, private sector mechanisms, and property rights issues. EPA would report to Congress within 18 months on how environmental statutes apply to CO2 injection and sequestration activities. The bill H.R. 2454 delegates oversight of geologic sequestration wells to states with EPA oversight. EPA would report to Congress within 12 months on how environmental statutes apply to CO2 injection and sequestration activities. Section 114 of H.R. 2454 allows for the creation of a Carbon Storage Research Corporation to accelerate the commercial availability of CO2 capture and storage technologies. A Carbon Storage Research Corporation could be established by owners or operators of distribution utilities delivering fossil fuel-based electricity, representing at least 20% of the volume. Voting rights would be based on electricity delivery quantity, with approval requiring two-thirds majority. State regulatory opposition could prevent its establishment. The corporation would support carbon capture or storage technology projects through grants, contracts, and assistance. The Carbon Storage Research Corporation aims to support commercial-scale demonstration projects for carbon capture technology in coal and fossil fuel plants. Eligible entities include distribution utilities, electric utilities, academic institutions, and more. Grants would be provided to early movers in deploying large-scale electricity generation units with CCS integration. The Carbon Storage Research Corporation aims to provide grant funds to defray costs for early movers deploying large-scale electricity generation units integrated with CCS. Funding would be raised through assessments on distribution utilities for fossil fuel-based electricity, generating $1.0 to $1.1 billion per year for a 10-year period. The corporation would dissolve after 15 years unless extended by Congress, accumulating approximately $10 billion to be awarded. The legislation allows the Carbon Storage Research Corporation to accumulate $10 billion over 15 years, with provisions for cost recovery, ratepayer rebates, and reimbursement to distribution utilities if funds are not fully utilized. Specific provisions are also made for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). The Carbon Storage Research Corporation is required to prepare an analysis and report to Congress within five years, assessing its activities, project selection, fee disbursement, impacts on carbon capture technologies, and funding adequacy. It operates under the Electric Power Research Institute and is managed by a board with members from various utility and fossil fuel producer groups. S. 1733 and H.R. 2454 both involve a \"wires charge\" program with similar entities eligible for grants. S. 1733 includes the National Energy Technology Laboratory and the Environmental Protection Agency on the board, and requires projects to meet Clean Air Act eligibility. The Carbon Storage Research Corporation, under the Electric Power Research Institute, will report to Congress on its activities and funding within five years. The proposed program under S. 1733 and H.R. 2454 would create a consistent funding stream for CCS technology development over 10 years, exempt from annual appropriations. Funding for CCS technology from DOE has varied significantly over the past decade, with a sharp increase in funding under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Concerns may arise over the effectiveness of a short-term funding increase compared to a consistent stream of funding for technology development. Title I, \u00a7116 of H.R. 2454 proposes adding performance standards for CO2 removal for new coal-fired power plants under the Clean Air Act. Covered plants must reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 65% if initially permitted on or after January 1, 2020. This reduction would require the installation of carbon removal technology. A covered unit permitted between January 1, 2009, and January 1, 2020, must achieve a 50% reduction in CO2 emissions by a compliance date determined by future developments. The compliance date is the earliest of (1) four years after 4 gigawatts of generating capacity with commercial CCS technology are operating in the US and sequestering 12 million tons of CO2 annually, or (2) January 1, 2025 (extendable by up to 18 months). The Administrator will review standards for new covered units by 2025 and every five years after, reducing the maximum CO2 emission rate accordingly. The Administrator determines emission limitations achievable through best system of reduction. Biennial reports on commercial CCS technology capacity in the US are required. \"Initially permitted\" status is crucial. New coal plants permitted before Jan 1, 2009, exempt from carbon control requirements. Units permitted after Jan 1, 2009, must achieve 50% CO2 reduction by a set compliance date. Compliance date based on CCS technology capacity and CO2 sequestration levels. Review of standards for new units by 2025 and every five years after. In H.R. 2454 and S. 1733, new coal plants permitted before January 1, 2009, are exempt from carbon control requirements. Plants permitted after this date must achieve a 50% reduction in CO2 emissions by a compliance date, which can be triggered by market developments but is typically no later than January 1, 2025. The criteria for meeting this target include installing a certain amount of generating capacity with carbon capture and sequestration equipment. The compliance deadline can be earlier if specific market developments occur. H.R. 2454 would require the EPA Administrator to promulgate regulations for distributing emission allowances to support carbon capture and sequestration technologies in electric power generation and industrial operations. Eligibility for allowances includes implementing the technology in large electric generating units and industrial sources to achieve significant reductions in carbon dioxide emissions. The bill would distribute emission allowances to support carbon capture and sequestration technologies in electric power generation and industrial operations. Eligible projects would receive allowances based on the amount of carbon dioxide captured and sequestered, with a bonus allowance value determined by the rate of carbon capture and sequestration. The bill incentivizes early movers in carbon capture and sequestration by offering bonus allowance values based on capture rates. Phase II distribution of emission allowances would occur after reaching a 6 Gw threshold, with allowances distributed through reverse auctions based on CO2 sequestration incentives per ton. The Administrator may prescribe an alternative distribution method if reverse auctions are not efficient for deploying CCS technologies. Emission allowances would be divided into tranches supporting up to 6 Gw of capacity each, distributed on a first-come, first-serve basis with bonus values based on capture rates. The EPA Administrator would adjust bonus allowance values for projects sequestering CO2 in geological formations for enhanced hydrocarbon recovery, considering lower net costs from income generated by selling recovered hydrocarbons. Section 115 of H.R. 2454 limits allowances and total cumulative electric generating capacity eligible for allowances to 72 Gw, including industrial applications. H.R. 2454 limits emission allowances for CCS projects to the first 10 years of operation. The bill allocates 1.75% of allowances for CCS from 2014-2017, 4.75% from 2018-2019, and 5% from 2020-2050. Section 115 prioritizes allowances for electricity generating units over industrial sources, with a maximum of 15% going to industrial sources. Industrial sources may receive allowances through a reverse auction or incentive schedule. Sources using a reverse auction method or an incentive schedule, similar to Phase II methods for electric generating units, are excluded if they produce liquid transportation fuel from a solid fossil-based feedstock. S. 1733, \u00a7 111 allows for the disposition of emission allowances for a global warming pollution reduction program. This section would distribute emission allowances to electricity generating plants and industrial facilities to promote CCS technologies, similar to H.R. 2454. S. 1733, like H.R. 2454, distributes allowances for CCS technology in phases, with varying percentages allocated over different years. Phase I of S. 1733 distributes allowances to the first 20 Gw of generating capacity in two 10-Gw tranches based on CO2 emissions reduction levels achieved through CCS technology. S. 1733, similar to H.R. 2454, distributes allowances for CCS technology in phases, with varying percentages allocated over different years. Phase I of S. 1733 distributes allowances to the first 20 Gw of generating capacity in two 10-Gw tranches based on CO2 emissions reduction levels achieved through CCS technology. The second tranche offers a maximum bonus allowance value of $85 per ton for 90% capture, with an additional $10 per ton for \"early mover\" projects starting operations by January 1, 2017. Allowances would be distributed under Phase II by reverse auction, with the EPA Administrator having the authority to establish reverse auctions for specific project categories. Under S. 1733, the Administrator would establish a separate reverse auction annually for industrial projects, with a requirement to segregate industrial sources from electricity generating sources. The emission allowances would be divided into multiple tranches to support specific quantities of electricity generating capacity, with each tranche supporting 10 Gw of generation capacity. In contrast, H.R. 2454 would support 6 Gw per tranche. No more than 15% of total emission allowances allocated for CCS would be allowed. S. 1733, like H.R. 2454, limits the distribution of emission allowances for CCS to industrial sources. Industrial projects can receive allowances in Phase II under S. 1733, while H.R. 2454 allows for this in Phase II after the first 6 Gw of generating capacity. S. 1733 includes a certification provision for qualifying projects not found in H.R. 2454. The distribution method of Phase II under S. 1733 requires a certification from the EPA Administrator for projects eligible to receive emission allowances. Successful bidders in the reverse auction method must also request certification. This formal requirement reserves emission allowances for CCS technology deployment, with projects needing to provide technical information and CO2 reduction projections for eligibility. The qualifying project for emission allowances must demonstrate commitment to construction and operation along a timeline of milestones. This includes taking one of three qualifying actions: securing financing, executing a surety bond, or obtaining authorization for cost recovery. Projects not requesting certification will have eligibility determined separately by the Administrator. Senator Boxer released the chairman's mark to S. 1733 on October 23, 2009, introducing a new provision for the distribution of emission allowances for CCS projects. This provision allows for advanced distribution of allowances under Phase I of the program, enabling fossil fuel-fired electricity plants and industrial facilities to receive allowances before actual CO2 capture and sequestration. The chairman's mark to S. 1733 introduced a new provision for the distribution of emission allowances for CCS projects. This provision allows for advanced distribution of allowances under Phase I, with plants needing a 50% capture rate to qualify. 70% of the first tranche and 50% of the second tranche of allowances would be eligible for advanced distribution, totaling 12 Gw of generating capacity. The chairman's mark of S. 1733 introduces a provision for advanced distribution of emission allowances for CCS projects, incentivizing early movers to build CCS-ready facilities or retrofit existing plants. The EPA Administrator has discretion to determine when to provide the advanced distribution, ensuring expeditious deployment of CCS technology. This provision allows access to emission allowances before a firm commitment to building and operating a CCS unit is made, with limitations on covering costs for retrofitting existing plants for CCS. The bill assigns responsibility for cost estimates for retrofitting existing plants and new plant costs to the requesting organization. Certification is required for plants to receive advanced allowances, with an additional criterion of state legislative authorization for cost recovery for CCS projects. The advanced allowance scheme incentivizes power plants and industrial facilities to commit to building CCS, potentially accelerating early deployment. It could make up to 12 Gw eligible for advanced allowances, compared to H.R. 2454 which only allows for 6 Gw in Phase I. The long-term deployment of CCS will depend on factors like the value of bonus allowances and \"learning-by-doing\" gains in efficiency and knowledge. The \"learning-by-doing\" gains in efficiency and knowledge come from demonstration projects and early deployment at a commercial scale."
