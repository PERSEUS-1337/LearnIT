    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Saving Women's Lives Act of 2002\". The Congress acknowledges the role of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in global population stabilization and women's health. UNFPA focuses on maternal and child health, family planning, contraception, HIV/AIDS prevention, and women's empowerment. UNFPA does not fund abortion services. UNFPA aims to reduce abortion rates by improving access to contraception and treating complications from unsafe abortions. It operates in over 130 countries and complements the work of USAID. US contributions to UNFPA last year provided contraception to 870,000 women, preventing 500,000 unintended pregnancies and 200,000 abortions. UNFPA assists countries in planning and slowing population growth to address global environmental problems. It upholds the right of individuals to decide on the number and spacing of their children and opposes coercion in any form, aligning its programs with human rights principles. UNFPA plays a constructive role in reducing coercive practices in China through its successful country program, promoting voluntary family planning and informed consent. It improves contraceptive choices, expands reproductive health services, and enhances the status of women. The UNFPA country program in China aims to promote voluntary family planning, improve contraceptive choices, expand reproductive health services, and enhance the status of women. The United States Government has provided financial support to UNFPA, with a voluntary contribution of $21,500,000 for fiscal year 2001 and a budget request of $25,000,000 for fiscal year 2002. Additionally, the US pledged an additional $600,000 in October 2001 to address the health conditions of Afghan women. In October 2001, an additional $600,000 was given to UNFPA to address the reproductive health care needs of Afghan refugees and internally displaced individuals in Afghanistan. Congress showed bipartisan support for a voluntary US contribution of up to $34,000,000 in the fiscal year 2002 foreign operations appropriations bill, signed into law by the President on January 10, 2002. The Bush Administration acknowledges the US history of providing international health care services, including voluntary family planning. The President is committed to maintaining funding for voluntary family planning programs to help prevent abortion by allowing individuals to make informed decisions about the number and spacing of their children. The United States will reappropriate funds for voluntary contributions to the United Nations Population Fund, with $34,000,000 allocated for fiscal year 2002 and an additional $50,000,000 authorized for fiscal year 2003. There are limitations on these voluntary contributions. The United States reappropriates funds for voluntary contributions to the United Nations Population Fund, with restrictions on funding for a country program in China and conditions on the use of funds by UNFPA, including the prohibition of funding for abortions as a method of family planning."
