    "content": "Title X of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended by adding a new section called \"PART L--PREKINDERGARTEN PROGRAMS\" which includes findings related to prekindergarten programs. High-quality preschool education programs have been proven to be effective in preparing children for school, increasing their IQ, improving test scores, and boosting their chances of graduating from high school and pursuing higher education. These programs also reduce the need for special education services, saving educational agencies money. Prekindergarten education has a significant impact on children from lower-income families, leading to better employment outcomes later in life. Children who attended prekindergarten programs were more likely to be employed in higher-paying jobs by age 27 compared to those who did not receive prekindergarten education. Children who attended a prekindergarten program had better outcomes in adulthood compared to those who did not. For example, 36 percent of prekindergarten attendees owned their own homes, while only 13 percent of non-attendees did. Additionally, less than 13 percent of boys from the prekindergarten group were arrested 5 or more times, in contrast to 49 percent of boys who did not attend prekindergarten. The Secretary is authorized to provide grants to local educational agencies to establish or expand prekindergarten early learning programs. Priority is given to agencies with the highest population of children ages 3 to 5 not enrolled in such programs. A local educational agency seeking a grant for a prekindergarten program must submit an application to the Secretary, demonstrating the need for the program, ensuring certified staff with a 10-1 ratio, and providing matching funds. The local educational agency applying for a prekindergarten program grant must show the need for the program, ensure certified staff with a 10-1 ratio, provide non-Federal matching funds of at least 50%, develop a sliding fee schedule for parental contributions, describe how funds will coordinate with existing early childhood programs, and use a collaborative process with community organizations. The agency must collaborate with community organizations and experts in early childhood development to establish prekindergarten programs. They should coordinate with existing programs, review research on early childhood education, cater to diverse needs of children aged 3-5, and ensure a smooth transition to kindergarten. The prekindergarten programs must describe intended results, measurement tools, operational plan without using funds from this part, and assurance that funds won't be used for construction or renovation of facilities. \"SEC. 10995D. USES OF FUNDS.\" A local educational agency receiving a grant under this part can use funds to establish prekindergarten programs for children aged 3 to 5. These programs focus on children's developmental needs, including social, cognitive, and language development, using research-based approaches for school success, especially in language and literacy. Children in the program are expected to communicate effectively, use a wide vocabulary, and develop language skills. The prekindergarten programs funded by the grant focus on children's developmental needs, including language development, vocabulary expansion, and acquisition of English language skills for children with limited English proficiency. The prekindergarten programs funded by the grant focus on children's developmental needs, including language development, vocabulary expansion, and acquisition of English language skills for children with limited English proficiency. Local educational agencies must submit annual reports on program effectiveness, and the Secretary must submit an annual report to Congress evaluating the prekindergarten programs. Authorization of appropriations for this part includes $210,000,000 for fiscal year 2001, $210,000,000 for fiscal year 2002, $1,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2003, $1,500,000,000 for fiscal year 2004, and $2,100,000,000 for fiscal year 2005."
