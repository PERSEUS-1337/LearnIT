The Congress finds that the free exchange of ideas and information through modern telecommunications equipment promotes democratic institutions, economic reforms, and international commerce. Exporting advanced telecommunications technology benefits the US economy and creates high-skill, high-wage jobs. Outdated export restrictions limit the US competitiveness by controlling the export of old technology. Foreign availability of telecommunications equipment and technology exists from countries not cooperating with export control committees, both within and outside of controlled countries. Export controls on telecommunications are addressed in Section 2. The Secretary proposes to exempt certain countries from requiring a license for exporting telecommunications equipment and technology for civil use.
