It aims to preserve the authority to prevent discrimination in the rating of state and municipal securities. Section 15E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is amended to include a new subsection (p) regarding Ratings Clarity and Consistency for nationally recognized statistical rating organizations. The Commission shall require these organizations to establish policies to assess the risk of investors not receiving payment for securities and money market instruments. The nationally recognized statistical rating organizations must establish policies to assess the risk of investors not receiving payment for securities and money market instruments. This includes defining rating symbols clearly and applying them consistently, as well as allowing the use of additional credit factors that impact investor risk. The Commission shall not impose restrictions on nationally recognized statistical rating organizations from considering unique credit factors for municipal securities not backed by full faith and credit in assessing investor repayment risk. Additionally, organizations can create complementary ratings to measure specific aspects of security or instrument risk. The Commission establishes performance measures for reviewing whether a rating organization adheres to its procedures for issuing ratings on securities or money market instruments. Performance measures considered include evidence in various categories outlined in the rules. The Commission determines performance measures for rating organizations, including transition and default rates in asset classes. SEC. 102. GENERAL ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE STUDY OF CREDIT RATINGS.
