It assesses the industry's potential to invest in oil supply projects. The oil industry's profits have been volatile over the past three decades, influenced by oil price changes and market effects. Net income for major energy companies increased significantly during the Iran-Iraq war but declined below 1977 levels by 1986. This volatility in profits makes investment planning risky due to uncertainty in oil prices, leading to cyclical investment patterns and capacity expansion in the industry. The oil industry's profits are influenced by oil price changes. Figure 1 shows the movement of WTI crude oil prices from 2003 to 2005, with peak levels in October 2004. The average price for the second half of 2004 was 25% higher than the first half. Profit performance in the industry is related to oil prices, leading to cyclical investment patterns and capacity expansion. The refiner's acquisition cost of crude oil is a key factor in determining profits for the oil industry. This cost, shown in Table 1 for 2003-2005, reflects the mix of domestic and imported crude oils used by refiners. Different refineries use varying mixes of crude oil to produce different petroleum products within technological limits. The ability to vary the production mix of crude oil can enhance profitability when price differentials between light and heavy crude oils change. The average monthly difference between light and heavy crude oil increased from $7 per barrel in 2003 to over $10 per barrel in 2004, reaching $15 per barrel at times in 2005. (Source: Energy Information Administration) The movement of monthly spot market prices for reformulated regular gasoline at New York Harbor from 2003 to 2005 showed peaks in 2004, reaching record levels of almost $1.41 per gallon in May and almost $1.38 per gallon in October. Prices remained high in 2005, peaking at over $1.52 per gallon in April. This led to a partial decoupling of the oil and gasoline markets due to fears of limited refinery capacity, low inventory levels, and strong demand growth in China and other regions. Refinery capacity, low inventory levels, and strong demand growth in China and other parts of the world led analysts to predict high gasoline prices even if crude oil markets weakened. Financial performance of major integrated oil companies improved in 2004 compared to 2003, with aggregate net income rising. ExxonMobil had a gain of less than 20%, while Marathon saw a decrease in net income in 2004. In 2004, major integrated oil companies saw an average net income gain of approximately 40%, with some companies experiencing gains exceeding 50%. Total revenue growth for the group was 35%, lower than the net income growth of 44%. Profit rate on sales for the companies was 7% in 2004, 6.5% in 2003, and 4.3% in 2002, indicating a growth in profitability over the years. The major integrated oil companies experienced significant profit rate growth in 2002, with stronger market fundamentals translating into increased performance. In 2004, the upstream segment accounted for 60% of net income, with most companies not deriving increased income from oil production despite high prices. Total oil production increased by 1.9%, mainly due to a 19% increase by a few companies. In 2004, the major integrated oil companies saw a 1.9% increase in total oil production, driven largely by a 19% increase from BP. However, natural gas production decreased by 3.1% for the group, with Occidental being the only company to produce more. The downstream sector, responsible for 23% of total net income, saw a nearly 100% increase in net income despite only a 1.5% increase in production. Integrated oil companies relied on price increases rather than production growth for profit gains. The major integrated oil companies in 2004 saw a 1.9% increase in total oil production, driven by a 19% increase from BP. However, natural gas production decreased by 3.1% for the group. The downstream sector, responsible for 23% of total net income, saw a nearly 100% increase in net income despite only a 1.5% increase in production. The recent record of expanding production may be hindered by unfavorable geologic and political factors, especially in the United States where many oil and gas fields have peaked or are in decline. Overseas production decisions may reflect host government policies. The major oil companies' slow production response to high oil prices may be due to significant investments required for projects like gas to liquids and liquefied natural gas, which take up to five to seven years to complete. Shareholder ownership and managerial decisions also play a role in production decisions. The major oil companies' slow production response to high oil prices may be due to significant investments required for projects like gas to liquids and liquefied natural gas, which take up to five to seven years to complete. Shareholder ownership and managerial decisions also influence production decisions. Independent oil and gas producers saw a rise in net income and total revenues in 2004, similar to major integrated companies, with profits possibly being returned to investors through dividends or share buybacks. In 2004, independent oil and gas producers increased output significantly compared to major integrated oil companies. Oil production rose by over 12.5% and natural gas production by almost 4%. This growth may be attributed to asset acquisitions from major companies. The increased production in the sector and minor production increases by major companies could be related to ownership transfers of existing assets. Independent refiners and marketers in the oil industry saw strong financial performance in 2004, surpassing even major integrated oil companies. They expanded product sales by 9% in response to high prices. Financial data for this sector is detailed in Table 6 from Oil Daily's Profits Profile Supplement. In 2004, independent oil firms significantly increased product sales by 9%, leading to a 45% rise in revenues and a 190% surge in net income. This strong performance, along with major integrated oil companies' downstream profitability, suggests that petroleum product markets, particularly gasoline, were no longer solely influenced by crude oil prices. Key indicators for profitability in the refining industry include gross and net refining margins. The refining industry's key profit indicators are the gross and net refining margins. Data from major energy companies shows that the gross refining margin increased significantly in 2003 and 2004, with a notable surge in profitability for downstream operations and independent refiners. The profit performance of oil companies' downstream operations and independent refiners is evident from the increased gross refining margins in 2003 and 2004. Tightness in the gasoline market, reflected in record levels of imports, has led to higher profits despite a decline in the number of operating refineries in the United States. The profit performance of oil companies' downstream operations and independent refiners has improved due to capacity creep at existing facilities in the United States since 1990. An expansion of refinery capacity could help lower petroleum product prices not solely due to high crude oil prices. Building new refineries would enhance supply stability for gasoline and other products, reduce dependence on imports, and support business growth. However, economic factors will determine if new refinery capacity will be constructed in the US. In 2005, an oil company seeking to meet gasoline demand in the U.S. market can expand existing refineries, build a new refinery, or import additional gasoline from overseas. The economics dictate that companies choose the cheapest alternative, with imports likely being the cheapest source of gasoline. Expansion of existing refineries is the next cheapest option, while building new refineries is the most expensive. Europe is considered to have surplus gasoline capacity due to transitioning vehicle fleets. The profitability of new refineries is uncertain, with recent returns being volatile. The industry questions if current profitability is sustainable or a temporary increase. Long-term projections for crude oil prices also impact investment decisions in the oil supply chain. The profitability of major petroleum projects depends on projected oil prices, with analysts suggesting a range of $50 to $80 per barrel for significant investment. Historical trends show that price levels impact investment decisions in the oil market. Investments in the oil industry were influenced by oil prices, which ranged from $50 to $80 per barrel and dropped to $11 per barrel by 1985. Refinery investments were also affected by environmental regulations, reducing profitability by 42% from 1996 to 2001. The industry is now preparing for investments in low sulfur gasoline and diesel fuels, which may impact returns. The permitting process for refinery investment in the United States is seen as a barrier due to lengthy approval times, making investments less attractive. An example is the planned $2.5 billion refinery near Yuma, Arizona, with a capacity of 150,000 barrels per day, owned by Arizona Clean Fuels. The refinery will process Mexican crude oil and market gasoline in southern California. The company's refinery in Arizona is awaiting various permits, including an air permit from the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality. Once obtained, around two dozen additional permits are needed, such as zoning approval and a presidential permit for importing Mexican crude oil. The tight petroleum products market in California contributes to high prices. The tight petroleum products market in California, along with high prices, has maintained interest in the project despite construction delays. The oil industry has evolved through mergers, acquisitions, and joint ventures, with over 2,600 transactions in the U.S. petroleum industry between 1991 and 2000. The U.S. petroleum industry has seen significant merger activity, with major deals such as Exxon acquiring Mobil, BP merging with Amoco to form BP-Amoco, and ChevronTexaco being formed. In 2005, ChevronTexaco made a bid to acquire Unocal, while Valero Energy Corp. bid to acquire Premcor Inc. Companies with large cash reserves are benefiting from the industry's profitability. Companies with large cash reserves are seeking to improve their position in the oil market through mergers and acquisitions, returning profits to investors through these transactions. However, these actions do little to address the nation's demand and supply balance for oil and petroleum products in the short term. Oil industry firms use shareholder capital for operations and are obligated to return profits to shareholders. The major oil companies, like ExxonMobil, have increased dividends for shareholders, but by less than the increases in available funds. For example, ExxonMobil increased quarterly dividends by $0.02 per share in 2004, an 8% increase, while earnings per share increased by $0.42, a 47% increase. Despite earnings per share increasing by approximately 130% from 2002 to 2004, dividends only increased by about 15%. ExxonMobil also reduced the number of shares outstanding by about 300 million during this period. ExxonMobil increased quarterly dividends by $0.03 per share in 2004, an 8% increase, while earnings per share almost doubled compared to the last quarter of 2003. ChevronTexaco also saw an increase in dividends and earnings per share, with earnings per share increasing by a factor of 10 from 2002 to 2004. ConocoPhillips increased yearly dividends by about 21% from 2002 to 2004. ConocoPhillips increased earnings per share from a loss of $0.31 in 2002 to $5.81 in 2004, with a 21% increase in dividends. The oil industry has seen increased profits since 2004, possibly due to factors like tightness in the U.S. gasoline market. Increased supply in the oil industry is necessary for prices to decrease. Investment in the oil industry production process leads to expanded supply, but uncertain economic parameters and regulatory environment may hinder investment. Profit can be used for dividends, acquisitions, and new product areas, benefiting shareholders and positioning the firm globally. However, these uses may not directly reduce prices for consumers. Time lags in the industry make it unclear if investments will lead to increased supply. Investments in the oil industry may not immediately result in increased supply to reduce prices for consumers. Profit is crucial for firms to attract funding and support growth. Slow growth and failure can occur if firms consistently earn inadequate profits. Profit calculation in the oil industry is complex due to various factors. The oil industry's profit calculation is complex due to the difficulty in separating revenue and costs, especially with crude oil price changes affecting both. It is not always clear how price changes will impact profits for firms in different segments of the industry. Additionally, passing on increased costs to consumers without losing market share is a key factor in profit calculation. The oil industry's profit calculation is complex due to the difficulty in separating revenue and costs, especially with crude oil price changes affecting both. Passing on increased costs to consumers without losing market share is crucial for profit. Companies with significant upstream business interests can benefit from price increases in crude oil. Total profit ranking may not accurately reflect performance, as the value of resources used to earn profit and firm size relative to total profit are important factors for investment analysis. Profit measures are commonly expressed as percentages for comparison. Profit in investment analysis is expressed as percentages for meaningful comparisons between companies of different sizes. It can be measured to include or exclude special, non-recurring items that may affect a company's revenues and costs temporarily. Excluding one-time charges may provide more informative profit numbers for some purposes. Profit in investment analysis is expressed as percentages for meaningful comparisons between companies of different sizes. Stakeholders may have varying interests in the conceptual definition of profit. Accountants follow accounting practices and tax codes, economists consider opportunity costs, and potential investors evaluate profit relative to assets management and risk. Measurement issues arise when determining an appropriate base for expressing profit as a rate. Three common bases used in business analysis are sales. The profit margin on sales is a widely used base for analyzing business profitability. It calculates profit as a percentage of sales revenue, helping to assess the impact of increasing sales on profitability and identify pricing and cost control issues. Another variation is using operating income instead of net income in the calculation. Profit based on assets, or return on assets, divides net income by the value of assets. Return on assets measures how effectively management uses the asset base to generate profits for investors. Return on equity calculates profit as a percentage of shareholders' equity in the firm. Intangibles may not receive adequate weight in the return on assets measure. The return on assets measures the effectiveness of management in generating profits, while the return on equity calculates profit as a percentage of shareholders' equity. Investors are interested in the profit rate, which should be greater than the return on assets. However, differences in return on net worth can be misleading due to the amount of debt financing. Earnings per share is another measure of profitability. Earnings per share is a measure of profitability that divides net income by the total number of shares outstanding. It can be influenced by the company's capital structure, strategic decisions like share buybacks, and may indicate a lack of profitable investment opportunities. The firm returns money to shareholders due to lack of profitable investment opportunities. Comparative profit analysis over time or with similar companies can indicate market trends and identify factors influencing profits. Time trends can show if profit rates are rising or falling, helping to identify key lags affecting profit. Comparative profit analysis over time or with similar companies can indicate market trends and identify factors influencing profits. Comparisons with other firms in the same industry can help determine if a firm is a profit leader, average, or low earner. Differences in profit rates between firms with similar asset bases may suggest superior management strategies. Analyzing profit rates of firms of different sizes within the same industry can reveal advantages or disadvantages in scaling for profitability. Comparing with firms of comparable levels is crucial for investment decisions. When making investment decisions, it is important to compare firms with similar risk levels, regardless of their line of business. Prospective investors are more interested in a firm's profits and risk compared to an index of average market returns."
