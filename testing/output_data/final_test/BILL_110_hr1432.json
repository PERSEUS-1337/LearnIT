    "content": "The Act titled \"Preserve Access to Affordable Generics Act\" is cited as the short title. Congressional findings and declaration of purposes are outlined in the Act. The Congress finds that prescription drugs account for a significant portion of healthcare spending, with generic drugs being a cost-effective option. Competition in the pharmaceutical market and enforcement of antitrust laws can lead to lower prices for consumers and the healthcare system. The Federal Trade Commission has found collusion between brand name pharmaceutical manufacturers and generic drug manufacturers to delay competition, which goes against free competition and antitrust laws. Appellate court decisions in 2005 upheld settlements involving pay-offs to keep generic competition off the market. The Federal Trade Commission found that settlements between brand name and generic drug manufacturers, involving pay-offs to delay competition, are anti-competitive and against consumer interests. This Act aims to enhance competition in the pharmaceutical market. The Act aims to enhance competition in the pharmaceutical market by prohibiting anticompetitive agreements and collusion between brand name and generic drug manufacturers to keep generic drugs off the market, support antitrust laws, and clarify the prohibition of payments from brand name to generic drug manufacturers to prevent competition from generic drugs. SEC. 3. UNLAWFUL COMPENSATION FOR DELAY. The Clayton Act is amended to include a new section prohibiting interference with generic marketing. It is unlawful for any person to be involved in an agreement settling a patent infringement claim related to a drug product, where an ANDA filer receives something of value and agrees not to market the product for a period of time. However, a resolution can be made where the NDA holder pays the ANDA filer for the right to market the product before the patent expires. In this section, the term 'agreement' refers to agreements under the Sherman Act or the Federal Trade Commission Act. The term 'agreement resolving or settling a patent infringement claim' includes any agreement related to resolving the claim. 'ANDA' means an abbreviated new drug application, and 'ANDA filer' is a party who filed an ANDA. 'ANDA product' refers to the product to be manufactured under the ANDA. The term 'drug product' refers to a finished dosage form containing a drug substance, and 'NDA' stands for a new drug application. The term 'NDA holder' refers to the party that received FDA approval to market a drug product under an NDA. The FDA Orange Book, also known as Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, is used in connection with NDA. Patent infringement refers to the violation of any patent or filed patent application. The term 'patent infringement claim' refers to any allegation made to an ANDA filer that its ANDA or ANDA product may infringe a patent held by the NDA holder of the drug product. SEC. 4. NOTICE AND CERTIFICATION OF AGREEMENTS. Section 1112(c)(2) of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 is amended to include a description of any additional agreements entered into within 30 days of the initial agreement. Additionally, a certification requirement is added for agreements filed under subsections (a), (b), or (c). The Assistant Attorney General and the Commission must provide a certification stating that the filed materials represent the complete agreement between parties, include any related ancillary agreements, and describe any oral agreements that have not been reduced to writing. SEC. 5 amends a section of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act regarding the forfeiture of 180-day exclusivity period. SEC. 6 authorizes appropriations to the Federal Trade Commission for implementing the Act."
