Despite the end of the recession, the country is still experiencing slow and uneven economic recovery, with indicators like high unemployment rates and foreclosures. There is ongoing debate on whether economic factors can influence crime rates. The economy's impact on crime rates is debated, with concerns raised by Congress over funding for law enforcement programs. Advocates argue for increased funding due to potential crime rate increases during economic uncertainty, while opponents question the efficiency of federal grant programs. The report examines the relationship between economic strength and crime rates in the United States during times of recession. It focuses on national-level data, analyzing the impact of variables like unemployment and foreclosures on the national crime rate. Local trends may be overlooked due to the aggregation of data, and the report does not discuss potential relationships at the state or local level. The conclusions drawn about the relationship between national crime rates and economic variables may not be applicable to all levels. The report discusses the relationship between the economy and crime, highlighting that national data may not reflect local trends. It suggests further research on economic indicators and raises questions for Congress to consider regarding the impact of economic recovery on crime rates. The NBER defines a recession as a significant decline in economic activity. The NBER has identified seven recessions in the United States since 1960. Figures 1 and 2 show property and violent crime rates from 1960 to 2009, with no consistent relationship between economic recessions and crime rates. During some recessions, crime rates increased, particularly in the 1970s, while in others, they remained stable or decreased. The literature focuses on how macroeconomic trends impact crime rates, rather than directly linking recessions to crime. Each recession may affect different economic variables, making it challenging to analyze the relationship between recessions and crime. Researchers often use individual economic indicators, like the unemployment rate, as a proxy for economic conditions. During economic downturns, researchers use specific economic indicators like the unemployment rate as proxies for analyzing individual effects. The unemployment rate is widely referenced in discussions about the economy's impact on crime rates. The relationship between the economy, specifically unemployment, and crime rates has been a topic of interest for scholars and policymakers since the 1970s. The most recent recession saw a rise in the national unemployment rate, reaching a peak of 10.1% in October 2009 before decreasing slightly. As of November 2012, the unemployment rate was at 7.7%, the highest level since the early 1990s. The economic theory of crime suggests a positive correlation between unemployment and property crime rates, as individuals may turn to criminal activities for economic gain when faced with joblessness. According to economic models, there is a positive correlation between unemployment and crime rates. This is because when there are fewer job opportunities, people may turn to illegal activities. Another theory considers both the motivation and opportunities for committing crimes, predicting that unemployment may increase criminal motivation but decrease property crime rates due to limited opportunities. Unemployment may decrease criminal opportunities as potential targets are also unemployed and better able to guard their property. The theory predicts a negative correlation between unemployment and violent crime rates, based on individuals having more time in close-knit situations and violent crimes involving casual acquaintances or strangers. If the effects on increased motivation outweigh the effects on decreased opportunity, crime rates are expected to rise. The economic model of crime predicts a positive correlation between unemployment and property crime rates. Studies show small correlations between unemployment and property crime, but not with violent crime. Congressional hearings found a generally insignificant relationship between unemployment and crime rates, more so for property crime than violent crime. Researchers found varying magnitudes of correlation, with some suggesting unemployment accounts for about 2% of the change in property crime rates. Steven Levitt examined studies on the relationship between unemployment and property crime rates, finding a small but statistically significant correlation. A one percentage point increase in unemployment is associated with about a one percent increase in property crime. Levitt estimated that changes in the economy accounted for only about 2% of the changes in property crime rates between 1991 and 2001. The decline in property crime rates during the 1990s can be attributed to non-economic factors like increases in police numbers, prison population, and abortion rates, rather than the declining unemployment rate. The relationship between unemployment and property crime rates may vary over different time periods. During the 1960s and 1970s, there was an inconsistent relationship between unemployment and property crime rates. Research suggests a positive relationship in the 1970s. Studies from 1979 to 1997 found varying correlations, with no long-term relationship between unemployment and property crime rates. The relationship between unemployment and property crime rates varied between 1970 and 1997. Steven Levitt found a small impact of unemployment on property crime rates in the 1990s, with a stronger correlation in the late 1990s. The level of data aggregation influences the relationship between unemployment and crime statistics. Theodore Chiricos noted that the data's level of aggregation affected the conclusions drawn in studies using state-level data. The level of data aggregation influences the relationship between unemployment and property crime rates. Theodore Chiricos found that state-level data showed a mix of positive and negative relationships, while city-level data had a higher proportion of positive relationships. This suggests that the unemployment-crime relationship may vary across different parts of the country. The relationship between unemployment and property crime rates varies across different parts of the country. External factors may influence this relationship, and there is no conclusive evidence for a strong correlation between the two. Factors like employment stability and wages may have a stronger correlation with property crime rates than unemployment. The recent recession has been linked to falling home prices and mortgage delinquencies, leading to an increase in foreclosures. Homeowners found themselves owing more on their mortgages than their homes were worth, causing a rise in delinquency rates and foreclosures. Unemployment of non-college-educated men was associated with an increase in property crime rates, but a decrease in wages for this group was more strongly correlated. At the peak of the recession in June 2009, 4.30% of home loans were in foreclosure, which increased to 4.43% by September 2011. Foreclosures have since decreased, with 4.07% of home loans in foreclosure by September 2012. There is interest in the impact of foreclosures on crime rates, with anecdotal evidence suggesting a correlation between foreclosures and increased crime rates in neighborhoods. Despite a lack of scientific studies on the impact of home foreclosures on crime rates, existing literature stems from the \"broken windows\" theory by Wilson and Kelling in 1982. This theory suggests that physical signs of disorder in a neighborhood can lead to apathy and fear among residents, potentially increasing crime rates. The \"broken windows\" theory by Wilson and Kelling suggests that focusing policing on minor misdemeanor laws in a neighborhood can help reduce more serious crime. This approach, known as \"order maintenance\" policing, has been adopted by many urban police departments. Studies show a relationship between neighborhood disorder and crime, but there is mixed evidence on whether this policing strategy can effectively reduce crime rates. Foreclosures can impact neighborhoods differently based on various factors like demand for residential property and concentration of foreclosures. Studies show that prolonged presence of foreclosed properties can lead to neighborhood decline. A study in Chicago found a link between foreclosures and violent crime, with a 1% increase in foreclosures leading to a 2.3% increase in violent crime. Property crimes may have been underreported due to vacant houses or lower-income neighborhoods. The study's findings may not be generalizable to less urban areas and only analyzed one year of data. The study focused on one year of data, making it challenging to generalize the results over a longer period. Similar findings from the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department showed a consistent rise in violent crime in high-foreclosure neighborhoods over a five-year period. Property crime rates were not as closely linked to foreclosures. Factors like the age of homes in foreclosure were not controlled for in the analysis. The study found a link between increases in violent crime rates and mortgage delinquencies leading to foreclosures, indicating an indirect relationship between crime and foreclosures. The author found that increases in violent crime had a three-year lag effect on property values, while increases in property crime had a more immediate one-year lag effect. However, other socioeconomic factors were not considered. Aggregate data may have affected the study's results. Research suggests that other economic variables could better reflect the relationship between the economy and crime rates. In a study by Reza Fadaei-Tehrani and Thomas Green, factors affecting property crime rates from 1980 to 1997 were analyzed. They found that unemployment was not significantly related to property crime rates, but public expenditures for education, median income, and GDP were. These three variables explained 74% of the variation in property crime rates, with GDP accounting for 28%. This suggests a link between crime rates and the economy. Thomas Arvanites and Robert Defina used inflation-adjusted, per capita gross state product (GSP) as an indicator of economic strength and found a significant relationship between GSP and property crime rates from 1986 to 2000. They argue that GSP may be a more valid proxy for economic strength than the unemployment rate because it reflects changes in other economic indicators like work hours, wages, job mobility, and job security. A limitation of their study is that crime rates were generally declining during that time, suggesting a larger range would provide more generalizable findings. Consumer sentiment may correlate with crime rates, especially for economically motivated crimes like robbery, burglary, and larceny. Richard Rosenfeld and Robert Fornango used the Index of Consumer Sentiment as a proxy for individuals' perception of the economy and found a high correlation with these crimes. The correlational nature of the study limits conclusions about causality. Consumer sentiment is more correlated with robbery and property crimes than traditional economic measures like unemployment rate. The study did not consider the impact of consumer sentiment on other violent crimes. Most research fails to establish a reliable link between economic variables and violent crimes. Different recessions may affect economic variables differently. During recessions, crime rates may fluctuate, with some showing a lag in the relationship between economic indicators and crime rates. Despite inconclusive research on this link, recent years have seen a decline in both violent and property crime rates. Policy makers should consider the implications of this relationship between recessions and crime rates. Preliminary research suggests a possible correlation between economic factors like GDP and crime rates, warranting further investigation. Research using state or city-level data shows more conclusive results than national-level data. Congress may need to consider the link between the country's economic health and crime rates, as well as the impact of changes in law enforcement numbers. Despite speculation, historical evidence of a correlation between economic downturns and crime rates is limited. The CRS found limited historical evidence of a correlation between broad macroeconomic trends or foreclosures and crime rates. Research using city- and state-level data showed stronger relationships between economic variables and crime rates, particularly property crime rates. Some areas may experience a greater relationship between economic indicators and crime rates during the ongoing recovery. One policy option could involve directing law enforcement assistance to localities experiencing larger increases in crime. Limited evidence of correlation between crime and microeconomic indicators was also found. The CRS review found limited evidence of a correlation between crime and microeconomic indicators such as consumer sentiment. This suggests that people's perception of the economy may be more related to crime increases than actual economic trends. Consumer sentiment reached its lowest level in almost three decades in November 2008 but rebounded before declining again. If consumer sentiment continues to improve, policymakers may need to monitor crime rates closely. If consumer sentiment remains positive, policymakers may monitor crime rates to see if they continue to decrease. There is inconclusive evidence on the relationship between economic decline and crime rates. Local measures may be needed to address any increases in crime related to economic downturns. While national data showed a decrease in both violent and property crime rates in 2011, some regions experienced localized increases in crime. Some suggest additional funding for law enforcement agencies to hire more police officers to counter potential crime rate increases during economic recovery. Deterrence theory predicts that increasing police presence deters crime, but empirical literature shows inconclusive evidence on the impact of police force size on crime rates. The research on the impact of police force size on national crime rates is inconclusive, with studies showing mixed results. Recent research suggests that more law enforcement officers could have a negative impact on crime. However, methodological and analytical problems in past research make drawing conclusions difficult. Limited data and current theories also hinder the ability to study the relationship between law enforcement levels and crime rates. Congress may need to consider funding issues related to law enforcement. Congress may need to consider funding issues related to law enforcement, including whether funding additional law enforcement officer positions is cost-effective in reducing crime or if other programs addressing correlates of crime may be more effective than hiring programs like COPS."
