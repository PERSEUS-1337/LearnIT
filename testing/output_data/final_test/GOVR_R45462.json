    "content": "Economic growth and increased global trade have led to higher goods movement, causing congestion in the transportation system. Federal support for freight infrastructure investment is a significant concern for Congress in the reauthorization of the surface transportation program. The current program, authorized by the FAST Act, is set to expire on September 30, 2020. Congress is focusing more on freight, but national policy remains unclear on certain issues. There are ongoing disagreements about improving freight system infrastructure, including raising new funds, determining required amounts, prioritizing projects, and the federal government's role. Technological advances in mobility raise questions about efficient movement of people and goods. Autonomous vehicle technology and automation could impact the trucking, rail, and port industries. The focus of the report is on truck freight and intermodal transportation. Operational issues are not addressed. The freight transportation system is a complex network of different modes that carry various goods, both domestically and internationally. Shipments often move across multiple modes, such as road, rail, air, pipeline, and maritime, in a process known as multimodal transport. The report does not delve into operational issues or environmental concerns related to freight movements. Rail carries the second-largest share of domestic freight in ton-miles, while trucks carry the most freight by value. Air transportation is expensive for domestic shipments. International shipments to and from the United States are mainly by ship. Trucks account for about 9% of vehicle miles traveled on the U.S. road system, but 15% on Interstates and 24% on rural Interstates. The railroad sector is dominated by seven large railroads, with more than 500 short line and regional railroads complementing them. The U.S. railroad network consists of over 500 short line and regional railroads that haul freight shorter distances, connect Class I networks, and ports. Railroad infrastructure is mostly owned by carriers themselves, totaling approximately 140,000 miles, with 94,000 miles being transcontinental/mainline and 46,000 miles regional/local. Freight traffic has recovered to pre-recession levels, but the modal composition has shifted, with truck tonnage increasing by 33% while rail tonnage dropped sharply in 2008-2009.

Railroad infrastructure is mostly owned by carriers themselves, totaling approximately 140,000 miles. Freight traffic has recovered to pre-recession levels, with truck tonnage increasing by 33% while rail tonnage dropped sharply in 2008-2009. Increased intermodal traffic has offset declining volumes of coal and crude oil shipped by rail. Barge traffic on inland waterways has grown only slightly since 2010. The growth in truck traffic is linked to e-commerce and just-in-time delivery services, with new distribution centers in urban areas relying on large trucks for inventory replenishment and small trucks for quick consumer deliveries. Coal remains a significant revenue source for the rail industry, but the decline in rail traffic reflects a general decline in coal demand since 2011. The decline in rail traffic since 2011 reflects a decrease in coal demand. Despite a slight rebound in 2017, coal shipments by rail have significantly decreased. Intermodal traffic has partially offset this decline, along with short-lived booms in other commodity groups. Oil production spikes and a shortage of pipeline capacity led to increased rail shipments from 2012 to 2016, but this trend has since receded. Truck tonnage has increased modestly by 2% over the past decade, while rail tonnage has decreased by 16%, mainly due to the decline in coal shipments. Intermodal tonnage, involving combined truck/rail shipment, has seen the most growth in surface freight. Intermodal tonnage, mainly involving combined truck/rail shipment, has increased by 188% in 10 years. The U.S. Department of Transportation forecasts that domestic freight tonnage will increase by an average of about 1.4% per year from 2015 to 2045, with truck tonnage projected to increase by 38%, rail tonnage by 20%, and multimodal tonnage by 120%. This represents an acceleration compared to recent trends. River and coastal ports are hubs for truck and rail activity, making road and rail links to these facilities crucial for surface transportation infrastructure. The volume of containerized cargo has grown rapidly in the last two decades, with container traffic at Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach increasing by 64% between 2000 and 2017. Congress has requested studies on the condition of road and rail links to ports in past surface transportation legislation. The recent study by DOT shows that about half of the 1,484 miles of freight intermodal connectors in the National Highway System are two lanes wide. Certain port projects can receive funding from programs like BUILD and INFRA grants, with a focus on improving intermodal connections. Most capital programs for marine transportation, such as harbor dredging and lock repair, are managed by other federal agencies like the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, rather than DOT. Historically, these programs were not part of surface transportation legislation. The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act (SAFETEA) funded over 70 highway programs, which have now been combined into a few broader formula programs. Core surface transportation funds are distributed to states by formula, but freight transportation is often interstate. Single state funds may not be enough to relieve congestion at freight bottlenecks. Congress created the Projects of National and Regional Significance program within SAFETEA to address congestion at freight bottlenecks. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 established the BUILD program for transportation infrastructure investments, with grants distributed at the discretion of the Secretary of Transportation. The Projects of National and Regional Significance program was created by Congress to address congestion at freight bottlenecks. Funding for the program has been included in appropriations bills since FY2009. The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act of 2012 introduced a national freight policy, sparking debate on whether the federal government should focus on funding projects benefiting freight movement. The Senate version of MAP-21 proposed a separate program for freight-related projects, but it was not enacted. Instead, MAP-21 allowed a larger share of project costs to come from federal sources if they improved transportation. The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act of 2012 directed the Department of Transportation to designate a \"Primary Freight Network\" (PFN) based on freight volume. States could also designate \"critical rural freight corridors\" based on truck traffic density. The Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act of 2012 directed the Department of Transportation to designate a \"Primary Freight Network\" (PFN) based on freight volume, including critical rural freight corridors and portions of the Interstate System. States were encouraged to create state freight advisory committees and plans to improve national freight goals. The FAST Act updated national freight policy by repealing the Primary Freight Network and National Freight Networks established by MAP-21. It directed the Department of Transportation to create a National Freight Strategic Plan and identify components of a National Highway Freight Network and a National Multimodal Freight Network. The multimodal network was to be designated within a year, but final action has not been taken yet. The FAST Act updated national freight policy by creating a National Highway Freight Program with funding of $1.1 billion in FY2016 rising to $1.5 billion in FY2020. Funds are administered by state departments of transportation and must be directed toward highway components important to freight movement. The program aims to increase U.S. global economic competitiveness, reduce congestion, improve network efficiency, and minimize environmental impact. The National Highway Freight Program allocates funds to states for highway components crucial to freight movement, including the Primary Highway Freight Network, critical rural and urban freight corridors. States with 2% or more of the PHFN mileage must spend funds on designated corridors, while others can allocate funds to the National Highway Freight Network. Up to 10% of a state's funding can be used for rail or port terminal projects. The Nationally Significant Freight and Highway Projects Program, now called Infrastructure for Rebuilding America (INFRA), provides funding for port terminals and surface transportation infrastructure. Public entities like states, local governments, and port authorities are eligible to apply for grants to support highway projects, railway-highway grade crossing projects, and connections to ports and intermodal facilities. The INFRA program provides grants for highway projects, railway-highway grade crossing projects, connections to ports and intermodal freight facilities, and private freight rail projects with public benefits. Grants are capped at $500 million and can cover up to 60% of project costs, with a total federal share of 80%. Projects must cost at least $100 million or a significant share of a state's highway funding. 10% of funds are reserved for smaller projects with minimum grants of $5 million. The DOT reserves funds for smaller projects with minimum grants of $5 million, considering geographic dispersion. Congress has 60 days to disapprove a DOT grant approval. Projects not directly serving freight can still reduce traffic congestion. For example, the Memorial Bridge reconstruction in Washington, DC, partially funded by a $90 million FASTLANE grant in 2016, aimed to alleviate congestion on other Potomac River crossings used by freight carriers. In October 2015, DOT published a draft National Freight Strategic Plan as required by MAP-21. The FAST Act updated the plan's requirements with a new deadline of December 2017. However, as of year-end 2018, this requirement had not been met. The Federal Highway Administration's Conditions and Performance Report in May 2018 fulfilled the FAST Act's requirement to report on the conditions of the National Highway Freight Network. The 2014 report found that 77% of network mileage had \"good\" pavement, with 19% graded \"fair\" and 4% \"poor.\" Approximately 4.3% of the 57,600 bridges on the network are structurally deficient. The report also includes congestion measures at the 25 most congested points in the freight network and key freight corridors. The FAST Act required DOT to report on the National Multimodal Freight Network, but no report has been issued as the network has not been defined yet. Financing for surface transportation projects is mainly through funds distributed to states. The federal government supports freight infrastructure financing through direct loans, loan guarantees, and tax preferences. The Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) program provides loans for various projects, totaling $30.1 billion since FY1999. This assistance was given to 77 projects with a total cost of $108.4 billion. Highway projects are among those eligible for TIFIA financing. The TIFIA program provided assistance to 77 projects totaling $108.4 billion, with approximately 60% going to highway and freight projects. The largest freight-related project, the Port of Miami Tunnel, received a $341 million TIFIA loan. The FAST Act allocated $1.435 billion for TIFIA loans, with funding covering subsidy costs and administrative expenses. The TIFIA program has a significant loan capacity, estimated to provide up to $20 billion in credit assistance under the FAST Act. The RRIF program offers loans and guarantees for rail projects up to $35 billion, with $7 billion reserved for Class II and III railroads. Direct loans can cover 100% of project costs for a maximum of 35 years, with interest rates based on U.S. Treasury bonds. Eligible borrowers include state and local governments, government-sponsored entities, railroads, and joint ventures. The RRIF program offers loans and guarantees for rail projects to various entities, including railroads, joint ventures, and interstate compacts. Loans do not receive appropriations from Congress and are based on creditworthiness and collateral. Since 2002, there have been 40 loan agreements totaling $6.3 billion, with loans typically ranging in size. The RRIF program offers loans and guarantees for rail projects to various entities, with loans typically ranging in size. The size of a loan is $142 million, with the median at $21 million. Class II and Class III freight operators have received most loans, while the largest loans by value have gone to Amtrak or commuter railroads. Projects financed by TIFIA or RRIF loans may benefit passengers as well as freight. Key questions for Congress include setting funding levels and creating a dedicated revenue stream for freight-related purposes. One proposal before Congress suggests creating a new revenue stream for freight infrastructure through a 1% tax on freight shipments, with funds distributed to states for exclusive use on freight projects. Another proposal involves reserving 5% of import duties for freight purposes. Various taxes and fees on freight traffic have been considered, including trucking charges and weight-distance taxes. Some proponents advocate a combined weight-distance or ton-mile tax for freight projects, while others see it as a way to raise funds for general surface transportation. Existing law allows tolling of federal-aid highways only when rebuilt, with exceptions for some toll roads. Congress created a pilot program in 1998 for states to toll Interstate segments for repair or rehabilitation. Missouri was accepted into the program to reconstruct 200 miles of Interstate 70. The pilot program in Missouri proposed reconstructing 200 miles of Interstate 70 with two truck-only lanes in each direction funded by tolls, but faced strong resistance and is no longer being pursued. Virginia and North Carolina also did not undertake proposed projects. The decision to impose highway tolls is up to the state or local entity that owns the infrastructure, but Congress could widen the circumstances under which states are permitted to toll Interstate Highways. Tolls could provide funding for freight-related projects. Trucking interests are involved in the discussion. Trucking interests oppose tolling for funding highway improvements, preferring higher motor fuels taxes. Studies show trucks receive a cross-subsidy from gas tax payments. Freight and passenger transportation growth leads to congestion in urban areas with important freight hubs. Many delayed trucks are passing through rather than serving local shippers. The 25 most congested segments for trucks are generally urban Interstate Highway interchanges, with several metropolitan areas consistently ranking high on the congestion list. Five segments are in Houston, and two are in Chicago, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Seattle, and Cincinnati. Some interchanges have been among the top 20 most congested for the last five years, with specific interchanges in Chicago and Fort Lee, NJ, consistently ranking poorly. The trucking industry study shows that 86% of congestion costs for trucks are concentrated on 17% of Interstate Highway mileage. The projected increase in highway freight traffic is unevenly distributed, with some segments expected to see a significant rise in truck traffic. The distribution of federal surface transportation funds does not consider anticipated increases in truck traffic. The National Highway Freight Program does not account for expected increases in truck traffic volume, leading to states with the largest increases not receiving additional federal funding to address capacity constraints. Truck traffic is projected to increase significantly at intersections of Interstates and along highways connecting busy nodes. This could result in states like Arkansas, where much of the truck traffic may be passing through rather than serving local businesses, not having enough incentive to improve road capacity using federal funds. One way for Congress to address the lack of federal funding for states like Arkansas to improve road capacity is to adjust the methodology for calculating each state's apportionment of funds under the National Highway Freight Program to consider freight-related metrics. Dedicated freight funding proposals in previous Congresses aimed to incorporate measures such as each state's share of ports, freight rail track miles, cargo-handling airports, freight tonnage, and freight value relative to the national total into the distribution formula. Congress has instead provided discretionary funds to the Department of Transportation for distribution. Congress has provided DOT with discretionary funds for freight and other purposes through the INFRA and BUILD grant programs. These programs receive more funding applications than they can accommodate, criticized for lacking transparent project selection processes. A 2017 report found broad discretion in the INFRA application review process, leading to projects being approved without meeting statutory requirements. Another option is for Congress to direct spending directly. From 2011 to 2019, the House and Senate had a ban on earmarking, preventing Members of Congress from designating funds for specific freight projects. The ban was established by House and Senate Republican Conferences and the Senate Appropriations Committee. The current Democratic majority in the House has not adopted a similar ban, leaving the possibility of earmarks in proposed legislation uncertain. Knowing truck characteristics on highway segments would aid transportation planners due to decentralized freight infrastructure decision-making at the state or local level. The Bureau of Transportation Statistics and the Census Bureau conduct a survey of shippers every five years to gather information on outbound shipments, but the sample size is not sufficient for specific urban areas. The survey does not capture through traffic, distinguish between imports and domestic freight, or identify trends in freight patterns. It was designed to provide a national overview of freight transport rather than meet local or regional needs. The FAST Act requested DOT to improve freight data collection efforts to address gaps and deficiencies. Congress must decide if the federal government should provide adequate freight data for state and local planners. Autonomous trucks could offer significant cost savings in the freight sector due to reduced driver compensation and fuel costs. Truck drivers are limited to driving 11 hours per day, making it challenging for carriers to improve labor productivity. Automation in the trucking industry could improve labor productivity by reducing driver error and turnover. However, the feasibility of driverless trucks in the near future is uncertain. An alternative scenario could involve drivers monitoring autonomous systems, similar to airline pilots. The unique skills of truck drivers, such as backing up an 18-wheeler, may still be essential. The 115th Congress debated federal policy on autonomous vehicle technology, with H.R. 3388 focusing on cars and light trucks, and S. 1885 addressing safety evaluation for commercial vehicles. Congress considered granting exemptions for testing autonomous vehicles and preempting state regulations. The 115th Congress debated federal policy on autonomous vehicle technology, focusing on cars, light trucks, and safety evaluation for commercial vehicles. Congress considered preempting states from issuing regulations contrary to federal regulations or other states' regulations to avoid differing requirements, relevant to the trucking industry's \"platooning\" technology. Platooning involves trucks following closely to save fuel by reducing drag, with drivers in all trucks but only the lead truck driver having full control. Wireless communication from the lead truck controls the speed of following trucks, reducing braking response times and wind resistance. The 115th Congress debated federal policy on autonomous vehicle technology, focusing on cars, light trucks, and safety evaluation for commercial vehicles. Congress considered preempting states from issuing regulations contrary to federal regulations or other states' regulations to avoid differing requirements, relevant to the trucking industry's \"platooning\" technology. Absent federal legislation, states may enact conflicting limits on platooning, reducing its utility in interstate commerce. Congress may also be asked to support Hyperloop technology, which proposes high-speed transport of containers in vacuum-sealed tubes. Hyperloop projects are not currently eligible for federal funding under transportation grant programs. The FAST Act authorizes $250 million for the Highway Research and Development Program and $135 million for the Technology and Innovation Deployment Program through FY2020."
