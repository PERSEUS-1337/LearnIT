The Federal Trade Commission will consider the scope, technical feasibility, and costs of implementing mechanisms for individuals to indicate their preference on personal information collection by online service providers. The Federal Trade Commission will consider standards for personal information collection by online service providers, including mobile applications. This includes publicizing mechanisms, collecting information anonymously, and setting standards for data collection and usage. The Federal Trade Commission will promulgate standards and rules for online services, including mobile applications, to respect individuals' preferences regarding personal information collection.

A report on the findings must be submitted to Congress."
