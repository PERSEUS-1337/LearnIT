    "content": "Afghanistan is in the process of reconstruction, with the lack of security being a major challenge. The need for substantial international support for long-term reconstruction is emphasized, with questions raised about funding, priorities, and coordination. The report examines U.S. foreign aid to Afghanistan and the major issues for Congress in the context of the international effort. The United States and other countries have a history of providing assistance to Afghanistan, dating back to the 1980s. After the Soviet Union left Afghanistan, the United States reduced its aid programs. USAID did not have a mission in Afghanistan from FY1994, but continued to provide aid through U.N. agencies and NGOs. The international donor community focused on humanitarian aid during the violent civil war in the 1990s. Donors hesitated to support the Taliban, who came to power in 1996. After the Taliban came to power in 1996, the United States provided significant aid to Afghanistan. Following the Taliban's removal, humanitarian assistance and reconstruction plans were implemented, culminating in the formation of an interim government led by Hamid Karzai in 2001. Karzai was chosen to lead the new government named the Islamic Transitional Government of Afghanistan (ITGA). The Afghan government, under the Transitional Government of Afghanistan (ITGA), has been collaborating with international donors on reconstruction programs since 2002. Afghanistan requires extensive reconstruction due to decades of conflict, including various economies that influence the country's future. These economies include the war economy, arms trafficking, looting, and black market activities controlled by factions funded by neighboring countries. The Afghan economy is influenced by factions funded by neighboring countries, controlling border crossings and generating revenue through trade and smuggling. The drug economy, particularly the poppy trade, has led to addiction rates and diverted focus from other forms of agriculture. The humanitarian aid economy, while essential in the short-term, can create market distortions and few incentives for local production. Development aid agencies will be crucial in assisting Afghans with long-term sustainability. Before reconstruction recently got underway, the United States and the international community provided other forms of assistance: humanitarian, military, and security. Effective reconstruction assistance could reconfigure Afghanistan's economy, reduce the war and drug economies, and provide incentives for viable economic growth. Afghanistan has various economic sectors, including transportation, coal mines, oil and natural gas reserves, and a carpet weaving industry. Development aid agencies will play a critical role in assisting Afghans with local production and long-term sustainability. During the anti-Taliban war, assistance focused on humanitarian aid and quick-impact projects. The United Nations and other organizations have been providing humanitarian assistance to Afghans since 1979. Reconstruction efforts are ongoing, but humanitarian relief assistance remains crucial. The United States has been the largest contributor of humanitarian assistance to Afghans, with a focus on refugees and internally displaced persons. Since March 1, 2002, over two million Afghan refugees have returned, double the expected number. Additionally, 230,000 IDPs have returned with the help of the International Organization for Migration. Returnees require ongoing humanitarian aid and transitional assistance for resettlement. The return of Afghan refugees and IDPs has exceeded expectations, causing concerns for aid agencies about resource availability. Winter challenges affect a large part of the population, prompting prepositioning of aid items. The region has been facing a severe drought since 1999, impacting agricultural production and necessitating continued assistance. The international military involvement in Afghanistan, Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), began in 2001 with 27 nations deploying troops. The cost of the war for the United States in FY2002 was $12.595 billion. Troops continue to search for Taliban and al Qaeda fighters in southern and eastern Afghanistan. The lack of security in Afghanistan remains a significant challenge, hindering the extension of the national government, provision of humanitarian aid, and reconstruction efforts. Former commanders control their areas and engage in ongoing conflicts, impeding progress. Efforts to demobilize and integrate combatants have been slow, but a plan was announced in 2003 for militiamen to surrender weapons in exchange for benefits. The International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and Afghan National Army (ANA) have been key in improving security. The International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) is a multinational peacekeeping force deployed in and around Kabul since December 20, 2001. Its mission is to assist the Afghan government in building a national security infrastructure, reconstruction, and training security forces. ISAF has been commanded by various countries, with U.S. troops providing support but not engaging in peacekeeping. Calls have been made to expand ISAF's peacekeeping efforts beyond Kabul. The Pentagon has shifted focus from military action to reconstruction and security in response to security concerns. The US military plans to allocate 75% of its efforts towards reconstructing security services and supporting civil reconstruction outside Kabul. The US will also play a central role in training the Afghan National Army and keep troops in Afghanistan for several years. The international recovery and reconstruction effort involves various entities including the Afghan government, UN agencies, bilateral donors, and international organizations. The international community, Afghan government, and various organizations are working together to establish common goals for utilizing donor funds effectively in Afghanistan. The goals include political stability, security, access to basic services, economic growth, and independence from foreign aid in the long term. Afghanistan's history of war and underdevelopment complicates the separation of humanitarian assistance, reconstruction, and development efforts. Reconstruction and development efforts in Afghanistan overlap, with humanitarian assistance playing a key role in providing clean water and building materials. Various institutions are involved in coordinating post-conflict reconstruction, drawing on lessons learned from other countries. Afghanistan serves as a test case for new forms of donor coordination, benefiting from past practices and international initiatives. The United States has significantly increased its aid to Afghanistan since 2001 through agencies like USAID, the State Department, and the Department of Defense. Funds are distributed to NGOs or the Afghan government through various programs within USAID. The United States provides aid to Afghanistan through various agencies such as USAID, the State Department, and the Department of Defense. Funds are distributed through different programs including the Bureau for Population, Refugees, and Migration, Overseas Humanitarian, Disaster and Civic Aid program, and other institutions like the United Nations. The United States provides aid to Afghanistan through various agencies and international organizations like the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, U.N. Development Program, World Food Program, World Health Organization, World Bank, and International Monetary Fund. Funding comes from U.S. dues, voluntary donations, and allocations through the Treasury Department for countries emerging from conflict. The international donor community, including international organizations and donor countries, plays a key role in Afghanistan's reconstruction. Pre-existing institutions like the United Nations and the World Bank have been active in conflict and post-conflict areas. The Geneva Peace Accords in 1988 led to the United Nations establishing a presence in Afghanistan. The United Nations has separate offices in Afghanistan for political and peace processes (Pillar I) and humanitarian and reconstruction operations (Pillar II). The offices have had different names over the years, with the most recent being UNSMA for Pillar I and UNOCHA for Pillar II. UNDP conducted a study in 1993 for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Afghanistan after peace accords, but fighting resumed in 1997. In 1997, hope for a peace accord in Afghanistan arose again. The UNDP developed a Strategic Framework to coordinate international development efforts, leading to the formation of the Afghanistan Support Group (ASG) with major donor countries and the EU. Since September 11, 2001, this structure has been utilized for humanitarian and reconstruction efforts, with the World Bank also playing a role. The World Bank has a continuing role in monitoring countries in conflict and providing support for reconstruction efforts. In 1997, Afghanistan entered Watching Brief status, receiving funds for training women's organizations and teachers in refugee camps in Pakistan. After the fall of the Taliban in 2001, the international donor community formed the Steering Group for Assistance in the Reconstruction of Afghanistan to support sustainable reconstruction work. The Steering Group for Assistance in the Reconstruction of Afghanistan, chaired by the EU, Japan, Saudi Arabia, and the US, assessed Afghanistan's needs. An Implementation Group was formed in January 2002 to coordinate donor activities at an operational level, providing support to the Afghan government. The World Bank and other organizations organized conferences for reconstruction discussions, with the World Bank preparing a Transitional Support Strategy (TSS) and the UNDP organizing an Immediate Transitional Assistance Program (ITAP). In March 2002, the United Nations formed the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) to bring together political and humanitarian/reconstruction efforts. The international donor community emphasizes Afghan ownership of reconstruction efforts. The Afghan government plays a central role in planning and managing aid funds through the Afghan Assistance Coordination Authority (AACA). A database funded by UNDP tracks donors, pledges, and programs to ensure aid supports government programs. The Afghan government has its own priorities in the National Development Framework (NDF), which is being revised into the National Development Budget (NDB) by March 2003. The Consultative Group in Kabul, led by Afghan finance minister Ashraf Ghani, has taken over responsibilities from the ASG. This group will focus on economic development while also addressing humanitarian needs. International organizations and financial institutions have organized donor conferences and trust funds to support Afghanistan's reconstruction plans. The first major donor conference in Tokyo saw pledges of $1.8 billion for 2002, with the U.S. government alone pledging $297 million. The U.S. government pledged $297 million, around 25% of total pledges, for Afghanistan's reconstruction in 2002. The total pledges reached $4.5 billion, with some states pledging over multiple years. The next donor conference is scheduled for March 2003 to allocate funds based on the Afghan government's National Development Budget. Trust funds have been established to support government expenditures and capacity building. The UNDP created the Afghan Interim Authority Fund (AIAF) to mobilize $65.8 million for immediate operating costs, including salaries for civil servants and ministry repairs. The Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) succeeded AIAF on July 22, 2002, providing funds for the government's budget, investment activities, and quick-impact recovery projects. Donors have contributed over $95 million to date. The Law and Order Trust Fund for Afghanistan (LOTFA) has received contributions totaling $95 million, with an additional $200 million expected. Managed by UNDP in cooperation with the Afghan government and UNAMA, LOTFA covers police needs in Kabul, including facility rehabilitation, salary payments, training, and equipment procurement. Coordination challenges exist in the international community's efforts in Afghanistan, with mechanisms in place to facilitate reconstruction progress. The institutional networks in Afghanistan have evolved over time, with UNAMA playing a key coordinating role since March 2002. However, there are concerns about the lack of coordination among the Afghan government, international organizations, NGOs, and donor countries. Some argue that complete coordination may not be necessary or effective, especially when organizations have different goals and strategies. For instance, the United Nations and the United States have supported regime change in Afghanistan, leading to a specific strategy for reconstruction. Those who do not support regime change or have been marginalized may not align with this goal. Some argue for coordination only among like-minded organizations, separate from political and military groups, to avoid partisanship in humanitarian assistance. Concerns include funding levels and reconstruction in Afghanistan, tracked by the Afghan government's donor assistance database. International funding levels are self-reported and may include double counting. Donor countries have committed $1.7 billion for reconstruction in Afghanistan, with $1.5 billion disbursed. The top donor countries include the United States, European Commission, Japan, Germany, United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, the Netherlands, Italy, France, and China. Pledge fulfillment has been a problem, with delays in fund delivery causing frustration for the Afghan government. Delays in fund delivery for Afghan reconstruction have caused frustration for the government. As of October 11, 2002, 67% of pledges have been disbursed. Some delays are due to donor countries needing Congressional or Parliamentary support for funds. Efforts have been made to ensure countries fulfill their pledges, with some changing their commitments. The U.S. Defense and State Departments have assigned officials to raise money for Afghan army training and equipment. The Afghan government seeks significant funding for reconstruction, with estimates ranging from $8 billion to $45 billion over the next twenty years. Donor countries have pledged around $4.5 billion, causing concerns about the adequacy of funding levels. The Afghan government seeks substantial funding for reconstruction, with estimates ranging from $8 billion to $45 billion over the next twenty years. Donor countries have pledged around $4.5 billion, falling short of the estimated $15 billion needed. The U.N. Secretary-General criticized the pledging levels, stating that Afghanistan remains under-resourced. Comparatively, Afghanistan has received smaller pledges and less funding than other post-conflict countries. The Afghan government has complained about inadequate funding for reconstruction. The majority of U.S. funding for Afghanistan has gone to the war against the Taliban and al Qaeda. In FY2002, $12.595 billion was allocated for the war, which is 24 times more than the $531 million spent on humanitarian and reconstruction assistance. The $6.1 billion received by DOD for Afghanistan and the global war on terrorism covers ongoing deployment costs. Most non-military assistance funds were allocated for urgent humanitarian aid, mainly food, shelter, and medical care. However, experts argue that excessive food aid can disrupt market prices and agricultural production. The Afghan government advocates for a different funding approach. The Afghan government argues for a different funding process, as they do not have access to humanitarian aid funds controlled by the United Nations and NGOs. The US provided $184.3 million in FY2001 and $320 million in FY2002 for humanitarian assistance in Afghanistan. Multiple US agencies are involved in providing humanitarian and reconstruction aid. The United States provided over $530 million in FY2002 Afghan humanitarian assistance, exceeding the original commitment of $320 million. At the Tokyo donor conference in January 2002, a total of $1.8 billion was pledged for 2002, with the U.S. government pledging $297 million from existing sources. In FY2002, the US provided over $530 million in Afghan humanitarian assistance, exceeding the original commitment. The FY2002 Supplemental Appropriations allocated $304 million for economic, humanitarian, and security aid for Afghanistan, but not all funds intended by Congress were available due to a dispute. The Administration allocated $258 million for Afghanistan in September 2002, slightly above the requested level. In addition to the $297 million in FY2002 funding, the Administration pledged an extra $80 million for road reconstruction in Afghanistan in FY2003. The Senate recommended $157 million, while the House recommended $295.5 million for Afghanistan. The Pentagon's potential shift in strategy in Afghanistan may lead to additional funds being available. The Senate adopted a revised FY2003 Foreign Operations measure with $220 million recommended for Afghanistan, double the Administration's request. $75 million was earmarked for Afghan women and children. The House bill recommended $295.5 million for Afghanistan, nearly triple the Administration's request. In H.J.Res.2, $295.5 million was appropriated for humanitarian and reconstruction assistance in Afghanistan. The Afghan Women and Children Relief Act of 2001 authorized educational and health care assistance for Afghan women and children. The Afghanistan Freedom Support Act of 2002 authorized an additional $3.3 billion for Afghanistan over four years. The Afghanistan Freedom Support Act of 2002 authorized $2 billion for humanitarian, reconstruction, and enterprise fund assistance through FY2006, $300 million in drawdown from U.S. military stocks for Afghan security, and an additional $1 billion for an expanded ISAF over two years. The Afghan government and international community aim to accelerate reconstruction to address the impact of 23 years of war and economic distortions caused by conflict and drugs. Successful reconstruction is crucial for sustaining peace. Successful reconstruction in Afghanistan is vital for sustaining peace and preventing the country from becoming a haven for terrorists. Quick-impact programs have transitioned towards long-term reconstruction efforts in education, health, and other areas. Numerous small and large projects, especially road construction, are ongoing. The international community has concerns regarding Afghanistan's reconstruction progress. The lack of security in Afghanistan has hindered reconstruction progress, leading to frustration among Afghans. Limited evidence of reconstruction success is attributed to small programs and insufficient funding allocation. International donor interest in Afghanistan relies on both security and visible progress in reconstruction. Progress on reconstruction is crucial to maintain international donor interest, encourage private investment, and uphold Afghan hope for improvement. The goals of reconstruction include recovery, reconstruction, and development, with priorities set by the international community and Afghan government. Lead countries were assigned specific project areas, while the Afghan government outlined national priorities in the National Development Framework (NDF), focusing on programs like the National Solidarity Program, Education Infrastructure Program, and Urban Infrastructure Program. The TAPA, developed by UNDP and the Afghan government, includes various programs such as government capacity building, refugee and IDP returns, culture and media, mine action, and narcotics control. Government capacity building is crucial for reconstruction in Afghanistan to establish a legitimate and effective national government that can provide services to the population. Afghanistan has established national institutions like the Loya Jirga, ministries, Central Bank, and a national army. The international community supports the Afghan government's expenditures through funds like AIAF, ARTR, and LOTFA. Partnerships with ministries and organizations aim to build capacity and transfer skills. The Bonn Agreement mandates the creation of new government institutions. The establishment of various commissions in Afghanistan, including a Human Rights Commission, Judicial Commission, Constitutional Drafting Commission, and Defense Commission, is being supported by the United States with $5 million. The Human Rights Commission is being strengthened to implement a human rights program, investigate abuses, educate the public, and train Afghans in international human rights law. The United States is leading army training efforts to form an army of 70,000 soldiers. The U.S. government is supporting the establishment of an army of 70,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, with four battalions already trained and equipped. Additionally, the Central Bank introduced the new Afghani currency with U.S. assistance, including technical expertise and funding for the currency exchange process. The U.S. government provided $3.3 million for an extended exchange period in Afghanistan, but the value of the Afghani has been unstable, causing consumer prices to rise. U.S.-funded projects focus on women's participation, including refugee care, health, and job training. Despite improvements since the fall of the Taliban, more needs to be done to improve the standard of living for Afghan women. USAID announced grants to support the refurbishing of the Ministry of Women's Affairs building. In FY2002, $2.5 million was allocated to support the construction of women's resource centers in Afghanistan, with plans to establish one in each of Kabul's districts and eventually in all 32 provinces. Additionally, $1.6 million was allocated to the U.S.-Afghan Women's Council. The project aims to provide training and initiatives focused on women's health and education. The U.S. allocated $1.6 million to the State Department for the U.S.-Afghan Women's Council, established in 2002 to promote public-private partnerships and women's participation in Afghanistan's rebuilding. The Afghanistan Freedom Support Act of 2002 authorized $15 million for women's programs, but specific figures were not provided in the FY2003 budget request. The Senate included provisions in the FY2003 Foreign Operations measure to address the needs of Afghan women. The FY2003 Consolidated Appropriations Resolution allocated $75 million for Afghan women and children, with $5 million earmarked for the Afghan Ministry of Women's Affairs. Lack of employment opportunities in Afghanistan has led to migration to Iran, with the Afghan government and the U.N. Mine Action Center being the largest employers in the country. The rehabilitation of the agricultural sector in Afghanistan could provide livelihoods for many Afghans, including demobilized fighters and returning refugees. International organizations and NGOs are implementing cash-for-work programs to combat high unemployment levels and a \"cash famine.\" Road and bridge construction, along with road clearing, are major employment areas for Afghans, crucial for the economy and government expansion. Historic trade routes connect Afghanistan to Central Asia, the Middle East, Pakistan, India, and China, making transportation a significant revenue source. Reconstruction of major roads, like the Kabul-Kandahar-Herat road, is funded by the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Japan, with the US contributing the largest amount at $80 million. The United States is funding the reconstruction of major roads in Afghanistan, including the Kabul-Kandahar-Herat road with $80 million. Other countries like Russia, Iran, and the European Commission are also involved in road construction projects in different parts of the country. Agricultural rehabilitation is a key focus for the Afghan economy's reorientation. The agricultural sector in Afghanistan was historically self-sufficient and a significant exporter of products like fruit, silk, and cotton. Despite a severe drought in 1998, some regions have seen increased agricultural production, but the effects of the drought still persist. The consequences of successive years of drought persist in Afghanistan, affecting agricultural production. The drug economy is a significant issue, with the British government leading eradication efforts and the US focusing on alternative agricultural incentives. However, aggressive eradication programs could worsen political tensions and lead to new conflicts. The agricultural sector in Afghanistan faces challenges such as lack of water and landmines. Water access is crucial for production, requiring infrastructural reconstruction like drilling wells and de-mining efforts to remove millions of mines. This is essential as over 80% of the population relies on agriculture for livelihood. With over 80% of the Afghan population relying on agriculture for its livelihood, obstacles to refugee and IDP returns and recovery plans include the need for farming resources like seeds, trees, fertilizer, and livestock. USAID funded the implementation of Famine Early Warning System in Afghanistan to monitor drought and famine conditions. Debt relief is crucial for farmers burdened by war and drought-related debts. Opium cultivation distorts the agricultural economy, requiring farmers to seek credit and loans to sustain themselves outside the drug economy. Urban reconstruction is a priority as refugees and IDPs return to major cities like Kabul. The majority of refugees and IDPs are returning to Kabul and other major cities due to the concentration of humanitarian and reconstruction resources there, leading to an acute housing shortage. The international aid community has inadvertently worsened the situation by increasing housing rents and reducing availability. Afghanistan's power supply is mainly hydroelectric, but drought and war damage have limited its capacity. Agreements with neighboring countries aim to improve the energy situation. The Back-to-School Campaign by UNICEF in Afghanistan aimed to help children return to school by providing essential materials like textbooks, blackboards, pencils, and teaching aids. USAID also supported the effort by providing 10.6 million textbooks at a cost of $7.75 million. The State Department contributed $2 million to the Back-to-School Campaign in Afghanistan. The World Bank is funding tertiary education, especially for teachers. Health initiatives include immunizations against polio and measles for millions of children. Reconstruction efforts focus on building healthcare capacity in rural areas. Reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan focus on building healthcare capacity in rural areas and rehabilitating hospitals and clinics, with funding from various sources. USAID is also involved in training midwives and constructing primary health care facilities. Communication is vital for coordination, with reliance on cell phone and satellite services. The United States supports the radio sector to connect the country. The United States supports the radio sector in Afghanistan, while Japan leads in the television sector by providing technical support and equipment for broadcasting. The goals of reconstruction in Afghanistan involve humanitarian assistance, development initiatives, and addressing issues like aid-induced pacification and promoting livelihoods outside of drug and war economies. The United States and Japan support different sectors in Afghanistan's development. Some in Congress suggest a Marshall Plan for Afghanistan, but it differs from the European Marshall Plan in scale and regional focus. Afghanistan's reconstruction involves nation-building and addressing development challenges. Senator Biden proposed a regional Marshall Plan for Central and South Asia to aid in Afghan reconstruction, involving coordination with neighboring countries to avoid conflicting programs and negative consequences. Afghanistan's neighbors and other countries have historically influenced the civil war, making peace processes challenging in such situations. The Congress took steps with the Afghanistan and Central Asian Republics Sustainable Food Production Trust Fund Act of 2001, but further action on the bill was stalled in 2002. Afghanistan and its neighbors signed the Kabul Declaration on Good Neighborly Relations in 2002. Security is a top priority in Afghanistan, with plans for U.S. military involvement in provincial reconstruction teams conflicting with the Afghanistan Freedom Support Act's call for ISAF expansion. Demobilization of local militia could be encouraged through employment programs. The Afghan government and others are proposing a mass cash-for-work program similar to the U.S. Civilian Conservation Corps to address high unemployment levels. Food aid contributions by the United States and other countries are also being discussed in Congress, with concerns about market prices and agricultural production. In March 2003, the next major donor conference for Afghanistan will take place to address the country's assistance needs. The pledges at the first donor conference in Tokyo in January 2002 were primarily used for humanitarian aid, but now there is a focus on reconstruction efforts. The U.S. Administration's request for FY2004 for Afghanistan totals $531 million, excluding disaster assistance. Some members of Congress are concerned about maintaining donor interest in Afghan reconstruction. The U.S. Administration's FY2004 request for Afghanistan totals $531 million, excluding disaster assistance. Congress debates the need for greater funding with fewer constraints, as well as burden sharing and sustaining donor interest. Many criticize donors for not fulfilling pledges at donor conferences, citing slow disbursement of funds, weak mechanisms for assistance, and poor coordination. The international community has tried to address these issues in Afghanistan through the AACA aid database. Some question the effectiveness of donor conferences and trust funds for reconstruction. The Pentagon is shifting its strategy from military to security and reconstruction goals in Afghanistan. Military assistance in reconstruction efforts is increasing, but NGOs argue that it comes at a high cost by associating humanitarian agencies with military objectives. The increased humanitarian programs conducted by DOD in Afghanistan and elsewhere are being questioned for their impact on non-military assistance programs. Afghanistan requires long-term international attention for successful reconstruction and to avoid another civil war, while discussions have turned to the possibility of war in Iraq. President Bush has pledged to continue funding reconstruction in Afghanistan despite the projected costs of a war in Iraq. The United States will continue to fund and organize reconstruction in Afghanistan despite doubts about its commitment due to focus on Iraq. Can the US maintain a central focus on Afghanistan while dealing with Iraq? Afghanistan Assistance Donor Funds Committed and Disbursed by Country as of February 10, 2003."
