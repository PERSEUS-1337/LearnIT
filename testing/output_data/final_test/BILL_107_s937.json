Eligible individuals are those in the Armed Forces with critical military skills. Members of the Armed Forces with critical military skills who have completed six years of service can transfer educational assistance entitlement to their dependents by serving at least four more years. Members of the Armed Forces with critical military skills can transfer their educational assistance entitlement to their spouse, children, or a combination of both, not exceeding 18 months. The transfer must specify the recipient and percentage of entitlement, as well as the effective period. Members of the Armed Forces can transfer their educational assistance entitlement to their spouse or children at any time after approval, with the ability to modify or revoke the transfer. The commencement of use for the dependent is also specified. Dependents receiving transferred educational assistance must wait for specific criteria to be met before using the entitlement. For spouses, the transferor must complete 6 years of service, while for children, the transferor must complete 10 years of service and the child must either have a high school diploma or be 18 years old. The use of transferred educational assistance entitlement is charged against the transferor's entitlement at a rate of one month for each month used. Dependents receiving transferred entitlement are entitled to the same benefits as the transferor. The death of the transferor does not affect the use of the entitlement. Children receiving transferred entitlement cannot use it until specific criteria are met. The transferred entitlement under this section must be used before the age of 26. The administrative provisions of this chapter apply to the use of transferred entitlement, with the dependent treated as the eligible veteran. The entitlement can be used for pursuing a secondary school diploma. In case of overpayment, both the dependent and the transferor are liable. The transfer of entitlement under this section must be used before the age of 26.

The Secretary may approve transfers of educational assistance entitlements only if military personnel appropriations are available. The Secretary of Defense will establish regulations for modifying or revoking entitlement transfers and specify administrative provisions for dependents receiving transferred entitlements.
