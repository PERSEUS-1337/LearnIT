    "content": "The \"Design-Build Flexibility Act\" may be cited as the short title of this Act. It pertains to design-build contracting. The \"Design-Build Flexibility Act\" allows the use of design-build contracts for transportation projects, with compliance required with the National Environmental Policy Act before construction begins. The scope of work under a design-build contract may include environmental review assistance, such as preparing impact assessments and analyses, under the oversight of the transportation department. Design-build contracts can be awarded before complying with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, with the request and approval of the transportation department or agency, and the Secretary's concurrence. Project approval must still be obtained after compliance with the Act. The Secretary's concurrence for design-build contracts is a preliminary action that does not impact the environment. Within 90 days of the Act's enactment, the Secretary must issue regulations amending previous regulations related to transportation projects. The Equity Act for the 21st Century allows State transportation departments and local agencies to use various procurement processes for design-build contracts. The regulations may include \"best practices\" guidelines and allow proposers to include alternative technical concepts in their proposals. The Equity Act for the 21st Century allows State transportation departments and local agencies to use different procurement processes for design-build contracts. Guidelines are provided for compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act and oversight of environmental impact assessments by contractors."
