    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Consumer Debit Card Protection Act\" and includes Congressional findings. The Congress finds a trend towards issuing debit cards that can be used like credit cards, with 1,300,000 new cards issued monthly. Experts predict these cards will rival credit cards in popularity, with over 2/3 of US households having one by 2000. Many of these cards are issued without adequate disclosure. Millions of Americans are receiving debit cards without adequate disclosure, leading to potential unauthorized transactions and larger liabilities compared to credit cards. Consumers are receiving debit cards with expanded capabilities and risks, without understanding the potential for unauthorized transfers. Informed use of debit cards would enhance economic stimulation and competition among financial institutions. SEC. 3. DEBIT CARD CONSUMER PROTECTION. The Electronic Fund Transfer Act is amended to include a warning to consumers regarding the issuance of debit cards for electronic fund transfers without proper protection. The Electronic Fund Transfer Act now includes a warning to consumers about debit cards that can be used without proper protection, such as a unique code or means of access. Replacement cards issued without these protections are exempt from this requirement, and a signature is not considered a sufficient means of identifying the consumer. The Electronic Fund Transfer Act warns consumers about debit cards issued without proper protection, requiring unique identification for access. If a consumer rejects such a card, the issuer must promptly provide one with the necessary security measures. Consumer liability for unauthorized transfers is limited to $50 under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act. If the only form of identification required is a signature, the consumer is not liable. Provisional recredit must be provided within 3 business days upon notice of error. Provisional recredit is required within 3 business days upon notice of error for transactions initiated without code or unique access under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act. Financial institutions must provisionally recredit a consumer's account within 3 business days upon notice of an error for electronic fund transfers initiated without a unique access code. An investigation must be completed within 45 days to determine if an error occurred, and the consumer has full access to the funds during this time. The Electronic Fund Transfer Act requires financial institutions to provisionally recredit a consumer's account within 3 business days of an error notification for transfers without a unique access code. The consumer has full access to the funds during the investigation period, which must be completed within 45 days. Additionally, there are requirements for consumer inquiries and notices regarding contacting the financial institution directly. The consumer can contact the institution directly to report errors, loss or theft of access means, or make inquiries about their account. Detailed procedures, time limits, and consequences for not meeting them must be provided to ensure consumer rights protection. The Electronic Fund Transfer Act requires issuers to provide consumers with necessary information for protection against unauthorized transfers. The Electronic Fund Transfer Act prohibits financial institutions from charging fees for insufficient funds caused by unauthorized electronic fund transfers initiated without consumer identification. Financial institutions must promptly credit a consumer's account for any fees imposed before receiving notice of an alleged unauthorized transaction."
