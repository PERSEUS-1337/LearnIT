    "content": "Expulsion is the process by which the Senate or House can remove a Member from membership with a two-thirds vote. This authority is granted in the Constitution and is influenced by English parliamentary practice. Expulsion is a disciplinary action different from exclusion. The Senate can exclude a Member-elect with a simple majority vote if they do not meet constitutional qualifications or were not duly elected. This authority is limited to these specific questions, as clarified by the Supreme Court in Powell v. McCormack. The Supreme Court ruling in Powell v. McCormack stated that the House and Senate cannot exclude a duly elected member who meets all constitutional requirements. Precedents considering moral character or past misconduct are now of questionable relevance. The decision prohibits the exclusion of Members-elect for prior criminal, immoral, or disloyal conduct. The Constitution does not limit the authority to expel a Member of Congress, other than requiring a two-thirds vote. The Framers did not intend to impose any restrictions on Congressional power to determine expulsion, according to one study. Justice Joseph Story also noted that expulsion could be for any misdemeanor without clear distinction from other punishments. The Supreme Court has recognized the broad discretion and authority of each house of Congress to expel a Member for conduct inconsistent with their trust and duty, even if not a statutory offense or committed during a session of Congress. The Supreme Court has recognized the broad discretion and authority of each house of Congress to discipline its Members under its own standards, generally without established right to judicial review. The process of disciplining a Member in Congress lacks protective shields present in a criminal case, with no specifically articulated standards and almost unbridled discretion of the charging body. There is no established right of review for the decision. The issue of expulsion of a Senator or Representative by Congress is considered a non-justiciable \"political question\" with no clear constitutional commitment to judicial review. Unlike the Powell exclusion case, an expulsion for misconduct does not conflict with any constitutional provision or individual rights. Justice Douglas noted the difference in justiciability between exclusion based on qualifications and expulsion based on misconduct. The authority of Congress to expel a member for misconduct is within its discretion, but policy considerations may restrain the Senate and House from doing so, especially if the misconduct occurred before the member was elected or if the electorate knew of the misconduct and still reelected the member. This restraint has been seen as evidence that both Houses have doubted their power to punish in such cases. The Court in Powell v. McCormack noted that congressional precedents show the House will not expel a member for past misconduct. Justice Douglas concurred that each house can expel by a two-thirds vote. The Court did not rule on the House's authority to expel for past misconduct. The House will not expel a member for prior misconduct, as seen in the case of Representative John W. Langley. The committee found that the House could not allow a person serving a sentence for a crime to remain as a member. Langley agreed not to participate in House proceedings during his appeal and resigned after his appeals were denied. Arguments against expelling a member for past misconduct were based on the concept. The House does not expel members for prior misconduct, as shown in the case of Representative John W. Langley. The Senate views itself as a \"continuing\" body, which may affect how past misconduct is addressed. Congressional precedents suggest that expulsion or censure for conduct in a previous Congress is possible. In past cases, there have been divisions of opinions on the House's authority to expel a Member for past misconduct when reelected, with conflicting opinions in disciplinary cases. Modern congressional practice shows restraint in expelling a Member after reelection, influenced by Supreme Court rulings. The House and Senate show restraint in expelling a Member for past misconduct after reelection, reflecting deference to the popular will. Justice Story emphasized the need for caution in using expulsion power, requiring a two-thirds majority. In 1807, Senator John Quincy Adams discussed the Senate's authority to expel a Member, emphasizing the need for caution and a two-thirds requirement. He addressed the issue of expelling a Senator even after indictment had been dropped, highlighting the potential conflict with the freedom of election. The power of expelling a Member is given to each of the two Houses of Congress without limitation other than a two-thirds concurrence. This limitation is seen as a wise guard against abuse. The House of Representatives has the power to expel or punish a Member for misconduct, which is essential in extreme cases to exclude corrupt individuals from its deliberations. The House has the power to expel corrupt individuals in extreme cases, but this prerogative should be used with caution and only in cases where misconduct was public knowledge before the Member's election. The House has the power to expel corrupt individuals in extreme cases, but this prerogative should be used cautiously to avoid undermining representative government by substituting its standards for those of the electorate. The Senate's power to expel members was historically intended to rely on voters to keep members \"virtuous\" through frequent elections, but there are no explicit limitations on this power in the Constitution. Expulsions have typically been for disloyalty to the government or criminal violations related to official positions. The Senate has historically expelled members for disloyalty or criminal violations related to official positions. In 1995, the Senate Select Committee on Ethics recommended expulsion of a Member for abuse of authority, unwanted sexual advances, financial gain, and obstruction of investigation. 15 Senators have been expelled, mostly during the Civil War, with one expulsion in 1797. Some Senators have resigned to avoid expulsion. In the House of Representatives, five Members have been expelled for various reasons, including disloyalty, bribery, and corruption. The Senate has also expelled members for criminal violations related to official positions, showing that they can independently investigate and adjudicate such cases without waiting for judicial appeals to be exhausted. Several other Members have resigned to avoid potential expulsion. The Senate Select Committee on Ethics proceeded with a disciplinary investigation and hearing for a Senator convicted of a crime, recommending expulsion before the appeals process. The Senator continued to participate and vote in the Senate until the full Senate considered the expulsion recommendation. The Senate Select Committee on Ethics can recommend disciplinary actions such as censure or expulsion for a Member based on precedents and constitutional authority. The term \"censure\" is not in the Constitution but is derived from the same clause allowing Congress to punish its Members for disorderly behavior. The Standing Orders of the Senate give the Committee the authority to recommend disciplinary actions, including censure, expulsion, or other measures. The Senate can recommend disciplinary actions like censure for a Member's conduct, which may impact their seniority or positions of responsibility within the party conference. Censure in the Senate involves a formal resolution expressing disapproval of a Member's behavior, with potential consequences in party and committee leadership positions. The Senate has historically used resolutions to express disapproval of a Member's behavior, without necessarily using specific terms like \"censure\" or \"condemn.\" This approach was seen in cases involving Senator Pickering in 1811 and Senator Tappan in 1844. In more recent cases, Senators Bingham in 1929 and McCarthy in 1954 were explicitly \"condemned\" by the Senate in resolutions. The Senate has historically used resolutions to express disapproval of a Member's behavior, without necessarily using specific terms like \"censure\" or \"condemn.\" In recent cases, Senators were \"condemned\" in resolutions, with no significant distinction between the terms \"condemn\" and \"censure\" noted. The Senate historically used resolutions to express disapproval of a Member's behavior, with recent cases showing no significant distinction between the terms \"condemn\" and \"censure.\" The resolution referred to the committee condemned the Senator's conduct, with a discussion on the use of the terms \"censure\" and \"condemn\" during floor consideration. The modification in Section 2 removed the word \"censure\" and included the words \"and condemn.\" The Senator from Utah refers to the resolution as a censure resolution, but there is a debate on whether \"condemn\" is a stronger word than \"censure.\" The Select Committee did not officially distinguish between the two terms, but some Senators perceived \"condemn\" to be a stronger disapproval in a censure resolution. The term \"condemn\" is perceived as a stronger form of disapproval in a censure resolution, with historical references to past Senate cases. The full Senate formally \"denounced\" Senator Talmadge's conduct in a resolution, distinguishing it from past cases where the Senate 'censured' or 'condemned' a Member. The term \"denounce\" was used to express judgments and recommendations without relying on historical analogies. Senator Schmitt argued that \"denounce\" is essentially equivalent to \"censure\" or \"condemn.\" The term \"denounce\" was used to express judgments and recommendations without relying on historical analogies, indicating a gross neglect of duty by Senator Talmadge towards his office affairs, while the actual wrongdoing was done by staff. The Committee applied words defined in terms of \"censure\" to his misconduct, even though they avoided using the word censure. The Senate Select Committee on Ethics used the term \"denounce\" instead of \"censure\" or \"condemn\" in the resolution regarding Senator Durenberger's case. The committee's decision was based on the belief that the specific verb used in a censure resolution is not as crucial as the overall characterization of the conduct. Senator Lott of Mississippi, a member of the committee, made note of this during the Senate's consideration of the resolution. Senator Lott of Mississippi, a member of the Select Committee on Ethics, highlighted that the term \"denounce\" was chosen over \"censure\" in the resolution regarding Senator Durenberger's case. He believed that \"denounce\" signified a lesser disapproval due to mitigating circumstances. The Chairman of the Committee, Senator Heflin of Alabama, clarified that the specific term used was a matter of interpretation and semantics, emphasizing the Senate's formal adoption of the resolution. The Senate adopted a resolution using the term \"denounce\" in the case of Senator Durenberger, which some viewed as weaker while others saw it as stronger than \"censure\". The Parliamentarian considered \"denouncement\" to fall within the parameters of censure, emphasizing that the Senate acts to show disapproval in strong language. It is up to individuals to interpret the meaning of the terms used. The Constitution allows Congress to \"punish\" members for disorderly behavior, including through censure. While expulsion requires a two-thirds majority, censure is seen as a form of discipline for misconduct that reflects discredit on the institution. The Senate and House have the power to censure members for reprehensible conduct that brings disrepute to the institution. The House Judiciary Committee views its authority to discipline members through expulsion or censure as full and plenary, with the requirement of a two-thirds vote for expulsion. The House Select Committee described censure cases as appropriate for breaches of House privileges, including unparliamentary language, assaults, insults, and corrupt acts by Members. Censure can also be based on noncooperation with and abuse of committees. The power to punish for disorderly behavior is vested by a two-thirds vote. The Senate has discretionary power to censure Members for misconduct related to official duties, noncooperation with committees, or behavior bringing the Senate into disrepute. This authority is based on Constitutional provisions and Senate rules, extending to actions contrary to ethical norms and public trust. The Senate has the power to censure Members for misconduct that goes against ethical norms and public trust, bringing dishonor to the Senate. Before 1968, there were no written Senate ethics rules, but a code of conduct was established in 1968 to complement existing unwritten standards. The Select Committee on Standards and Conduct (now the Select Committee on Ethics) was authorized in 1964 to investigate and report on matters concerning official conduct. The Senate has the power to censure Members for misconduct, including violations of rules and codes related to official duties. This can include issues such as financial irregularities, non-cooperation with investigating committees, and allowing lobbyists access to secret meetings. There is no precedent for the full Senate to reprimand a Member for misconduct, but such actions have been considered. In the censure case of Senator Thomas Dodd, Senator Tower proposed substituting \"reprimand\" for \"censure\" to express disapproval without severity. Senator Stennis argued against using \"reprimand,\" stating it lacked historical context in Senate procedure. The term \"censure\" was deemed appropriate and less severe than \"condemn.\" Mr. Stennis argued against using \"reprimand\" in the Senate, citing historical precedent for using \"censure\" or \"condemn\" for serious matters. In the House of Representatives, a resolution of censure may be followed by a public reprimand, but this practice has never been done in the Senate. The Senate rejected using \"reprimand\" as it was deemed too mild and insignificant, opting instead for the word \"censure\" to convey a stronger stance. This decision was influenced by past instances, such as Senators Tillman and McLaurin being \"censured\" in 1902 for fighting on the Senate floor. The Senate, after rejecting a \"reprimand\" as too mild, recommended a resolution to \"censure\" the Members from South Carolina for their conduct. The Committee stated that expulsion was not necessary, but a reprimand was too slight a punishment. The Senate unanimously agreed that the Senators were in contempt, and a reprimand was considered insufficient. In the House of Representatives, there is a distinction between \"reprimand\" and \"censure\" resolutions. A reprimand is seen as a lesser form of disapproval compared to a censure. A censure resolution involves the Member going to the well of the House for a verbal castigation, while a reprimand resolution is simply adopted by a House vote. These procedures do not apply to the Senate. In the Senate, a resolution using the word \"reprimand\" would have a similar effect as a \"censure\" but may be perceived as a minor rebuke, differing from the House practice. The Senate Select Committee on Ethics may issue a \"reprimand\" as a form of rebuke, not requiring a full Senate vote. In 1991, a reprimand was issued to Senator Cranston in the \"Keating Five\" investigations. The Committee's action was discussed on the Senate floor, but no formal Senate action was taken. The Senate Select Committee on Ethics can issue a \"letter of admonition\" for minor violations, not considered discipline. In 1797, Senator William Blount was found guilty of inciting Indians against the government and faced expulsion. Several Senators were expelled from the Senate for failing to support the government during the Civil War, including Mason, Hunter, Clingman, Bragg, Chestnut, Nicholson, Sebastian, Mitchell, Hemphill, Wigfall, and Breckinridge. They were accused of being part of a conspiracy to destroy the Union. Several Senators were expelled from the Senate during the Civil War for disloyalty, including John C. Breckinridge, Jesse D. Bright, and Waldo P. Johnson. Breckinridge was expelled for joining the enemies of his country, Bright for recommending an arms manufacturer to the Confederacy, and Johnson for failing to take his seat and show loyalty to the Union. Trusten Polk of Missouri was expelled from the Senate on January 10, 1862, for failing to rebut allegations of disloyalty to the Union and for going clandestinely within the lines of the enemy. The expulsion resolution was adopted by a vote of 35-0. The Senate expelled Trusten Polk of Missouri for disloyalty to the Union and going behind enemy lines. Benjamin Tappan of Ohio was also reprimanded for leaking confidential Senate documents to the press. The Senate expelled Trusten Polk of Missouri for disloyalty to the Union and going behind enemy lines. Benjamin Tappan of Ohio was reprimanded for leaking confidential Senate documents to the press. A resolution was adopted by a vote of 61 - 0 declaring Senators Tillman and McLaurin \"in contempt of the Senate\" after a physical altercation between them on the Senate floor. The matter was referred to the Committee on Privileges and Elections for further action. The Committee on Privileges and Elections recommended a resolution of censure for disorderly behavior and violation of Senate rules. The resolution was agreed to by a vote of 54 - 12 on February 28, 1902. Hiram Bingham of Connecticut was investigated for placing an individual with a conflict of interest on the Senate payroll. The Manufacturers Association of Connecticut employee had access to secret committee deliberations due to his position, leading to a resolution condemning the actions of the Senator. Senator McCarthy of Wisconsin was under investigation in 1951 and 1952. Senator McCarthy faced an investigation and subsequent censure in 1954 for alleged misconduct, including contempt of the Senate and obstruction of the legislative process. The full Senate voted to \"condemn\" McCarthy on two counts after a resolution to censure him was introduced and amended to include 46 separate counts. The full Senate voted to \"condemn\" McCarthy on two counts in 1954 for his misconduct, including non-cooperation with a Subcommittee and abuse of a Select Committee. The resolution was adopted by a vote of 67 - 22. Senator Thomas J. Dodd of Connecticut was investigated for unethical conduct related to campaign funds and reimbursements, leading to a recommendation of censure. The Senate censured Senator Dodd for using political funds for personal benefit, despite not violating any specific laws or Senate rules at the time. This conduct was deemed contrary to accepted morals and brought dishonor to the Senate. The Select Committee on Ethics found Senator Talmadge responsible for financial irregularities and misuse of campaign funds, recommending a finding to the full Senate that his conduct was reprehensible and brought dishonor to the Senate. The Senate adopted S.Res. 249 by a vote of 81 - 15, denouncing the conduct of Senator Talmadge as reprehensible and bringing dishonor to the Senate. The action was categorized as a \"censure\" of the Member. The Committee on Ethics recommended denouncing the Senator for violating statutes and ethical norms, including evading honoraria limits and misusing funds through a publishing arrangement. The Senate censured a Member for misconduct involving misuse of funds, failure to disclose travel reimbursements, improper acceptance of gifts, and conversion of campaign contributions for personal use. The full Senate accepted the Committee's recommendation in S.Res. 311, 101st Congress, by a vote of 96-0. This action is considered a formal censure of the Member's conduct. Expulsions in the US Senate and House of Representatives are reserved for serious misconduct, such as disloyalty, corruption, or abuse of power. A formal censure is the strongest form of disapproval, which may include financial restitution, privilege limitations, or reduction in seniority status. While there are no automatic consequences, public reprobation and formal rebuke by peers can result from a Senate censure. The Senate's formal censure involves adopting a resolution disapproving of a Senator's conduct, leading to public reprobation and potential impact on reelection. The resolution may use terms like \"condemning\" or \"denouncing\" without a strict hierarchy, but the censure signifies strong disapproval. The severity of terms like \"condemn\" and \"denounce\" in a censure resolution is subjective, with \"condemn\" carrying a harsher connotation based on past disciplinary actions. Censure can be imposed for misconduct not necessarily violating specific rules, focusing on ethical conduct and senatorial ethics. The Senate censure resolution can be imposed for conduct that goes against accepted morals and senatorial ethics, bringing dishonor to the Senate."
