    "content": "The \"Basel III Impact Study Act\" requires a study to be conducted. The Federal banking agencies are required to conduct a study and issue a report to Congress before making any final rule changes to general risk-based capital requirements, including revising advanced-approaches risk-based capital requirements and determining risk-weighted assets. The Federal banking agencies issued proposed rulemaking in June 2012 for determining minimum regulatory capital ratios, as part of the Basel III NPR, Advanced Approach NPR, and Standardized Approach NPR published in August 2012. SEC. 3. STUDY AND REPORT. The Federal banking agencies will conduct a study on the impact of NPRs on regulatory capital requirements of insured depository institutions and holding companies. The study will determine current capital levels and identify specific provisions in the Basel III framework. The identified provisions from the Dodd-Frank Act include sections 115 and 165 regarding enhanced supervision and prudential standards. The Dodd-Frank Act includes provisions on enhanced supervision, prudential standards, early remediation requirements, leverage and risk-based capital requirements, prohibitions on proprietary trading, removal of statutory references to credit ratings, and regulation of credit risk retention. The Dodd-Frank Act includes provisions on enhanced supervision, prudential standards, early remediation requirements, leverage and risk-based capital requirements, prohibitions on proprietary trading, removal of statutory references to credit ratings, and regulation of credit risk retention. The Federal banking agencies are required to estimate and evaluate the impact of identified provisions on affected United States institutions, including regulatory capital levels and capital quality. The Federal banking agencies are required to assess regulatory capital levels, capital quality, asset quality, and risk management at US financial institutions. They must provide an assessment on changes to required capital levels, risk-weighted asset levels, and the impact of Basel III and Dodd-Frank provisions on institutions. The Federal banking agencies assess regulatory capital levels, asset quality, and risk management at US financial institutions. They evaluate the impact of NPRs on capital fluctuations and risk management tools. The NPRs assess the impact of risk management tools on financial institutions and the financial system, as well as the cumulative effects on economic growth, credit availability, and residential mortgages. The curr_chunk discusses the variance in required capital levels, assets, and asset quality between institutions using different risk weighting approaches, such as advanced approaches and standardized approach. It also mentions the impact on competition and historical probability of default and loss given default of residential mortgages. The curr_chunk discusses the proposed risk weightings in the Standardized Approach NPR and the voluntary participation of insured depository institutions in the study. The Federal banking agencies will rely on available data and may seek input from institutions without imposing undue burden. The Federal banking agencies will issue a report on the results of the study within 9 months of the enactment of the Act. The report will include methodologies, assumptions, and required elements of the study. SEC. 4. COMPETITIVE EQUALITY. Federal banking agencies must ensure that differences in capital standards for banking institutions do not create competitive advantages, unless required by law, and do not undermine enhanced supervision requirements."
