    "content": "Unanimous consent agreements in the Senate are special orders agreed to without objection by all Senators. They are used to structure floor proceedings and expedite business. There are two types: \"simple\" for routine matters and \"complex\" for more significant issues. Simple requests have been used since the First Congress in 1789. The focus of this report is on the complex variety of unanimous consent agreements in the Senate, their historical origin, evolution, and reflection in the Senate's rulebook. These agreements establish tailored procedures for various Senate matters like bills, resolutions, amendments, nominations, treaties, and conference reports. Senate parliamentarians highlight the difference between operating under unanimous consent agreements and the Standing Rules. Unanimous consent agreements in the Senate limit debate and amendment rights, facilitating workload processing and serving individual lawmakers' interests. These agreements, like binding contracts, can only be changed by unanimous consent. The Senate began using these agreements in the mid-1840s. In the mid-1840s, Senator William Allen urged the Senate to set a definite day for a final vote on the Oregon Territory resolution after debating for over two months. Despite his recommendation, no action was taken initially. After Senator William Allen's recommendation for a final vote on the Oregon Territory resolution, a consensus among Senators led to a vote three days later on April 16, 1846. The Senate employed unanimous consent agreements to end debate and facilitate votes, becoming more common and sophisticated by 1870. These agreements set time limits for debate and voting, as seen in an exchange on April 24, 1879. The use of unanimous consent agreements in the Senate to limit debate and set voting times became more common and sophisticated by 1870. Bill managers took the lead in proposing these agreements, leading to complaints from some Senators about the Senate's voting process. The Senate adopted Rule XII to clarify uncertainties with unanimous consent agreements, which were seen as informal and easily violated. In the early 1900s, steps were taken to require these agreements to be written, read aloud, and printed in the daily calendar. More changes were expected to address confusion among members. The Senate adopted Rule XII to address ambiguities and confusion surrounding unanimous consent agreements, which were previously informal and easily violated. The need for a formal rule was underscored by a Senator being caught by surprise with an agreement. Key issues included whether agreements could be modified and if the presiding officer could enforce them. Today, these principles are accepted, but in the past, there was uncertainty. The Senate's adoption of Rule XII addressed ambiguities and confusion surrounding unanimous consent agreements, which were previously informal and easily violated. Senators debated whether these agreements could be modified, with some arguing for their rigid preservation. Senator George Hoar and Henry Cabot Lodge emphasized the importance of upholding unanimous-consent agreements, while others believed they could be modified by another unanimous consent agreement. The enforcement of unanimous consent agreements in the Senate was debated, with presiding officers taking different positions. While some believed it was up to the honor of Senators to uphold the agreements, others like Vice Presidents Charles Fairbanks and James Sherman were more assertive in enforcing them. Senator John Sherman advocated for enforcing agreements with respect to the bill under consideration, while Senator Eugene Hale suggested addressing issues as they arise. Senators Fairbanks and Sherman were assertive in enforcing unanimous consent agreements. Various issues arose, such as debates over motions violating agreements and objections on behalf of absent Senators. Senator Martin emphasized the importance of Senators being present to object, stating that business cannot be conducted by proxy. Senator Smoot was surprised when an agreement he opposed was accepted regarding a bill on prohibiting interstate commerce of alcohol in 1913. The Senate debated the legitimacy of a unanimous consent agreement on the liquor bill, with Senator Smoot initially planning to object but being distracted. After a vote, the agreement was resubmitted and accepted, leading to the adoption of a formal rule to govern unanimous consent agreements on January 16, 1914. The Senate adopted Rule XII on January 16, 1914, to govern unanimous consent agreements. Senator Lodge opposed allowing modifications to these compacts, while Senator Thomas argued for the Senate's ability to undo unanimous agreements. The rule passed with a vote of 51 to 8, establishing that such agreements are orders of the Senate and can only be changed by unanimous consent. The Senate adopted Rule XII in 1914 to govern unanimous consent agreements, establishing them as orders of the Senate that can only be changed by unanimous consent. Unanimous consent agreements are now printed in the Senate Journal and are extensively relied upon by party leaders and floor managers to process the chamber's business. Unanimous consent agreements in the Senate are crucial for managing the workload and protecting senators' procedural rights. Today, these agreements are more comprehensive and detailed compared to those from the early 1900s, covering a wide range of procedures. They are used to determine when measures will be taken up and voted on, with a body of precedents guiding their interpretation and application in various situations."
