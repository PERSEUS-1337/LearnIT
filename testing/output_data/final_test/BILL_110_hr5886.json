    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Limiting the Intrusive Miles of International Terrorist Sponsors Act of 2008\" or the \"LIMITS Act of 2008.\" Congress finds that countries designated as state sponsors of terrorism pose a threat to US national security. The US allows officials from these countries to travel to New York City for UN meetings. Visas are issued to delegates from these countries for diplomatic purposes, including the 2007 UN General Assembly meeting. Between 2002 and 2007, the Department of State issued visas with full diplomatic immunity to delegates and representatives from Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria. Delegates from Iran, North Korea, and Cuba, all state sponsors of terrorism, are allowed to travel up to 25 miles from Columbus. Delegates and representatives from Syria and Sudan, state sponsors of terrorism, can travel throughout the United States without mileage restrictions. Iranian diplomatic personnel were expelled for suspicious activities in New York City. The United States faces a security vulnerability due to issuing visas to individuals from state sponsors of terrorism without proper boundaries. The presence of diplomatic personnel with immunity from these countries overwhelms counterterrorism efforts, obligating the US to protect its citizens from such threats. SEC. 3. RESTRICTION ON DIPLOMATIC TRAVEL OF OFFICIALS AND REPRESENTATIVES OF STATE SPONSORS OF TERRORISM. The President shall restrict travel of officials from state sponsors of terrorism to the designated area at the UN headquarters, with exceptions for national defense interests.

The President can also place restrictions on officials from state sponsors of terrorism. The Act will take effect 60 days after enactment.
