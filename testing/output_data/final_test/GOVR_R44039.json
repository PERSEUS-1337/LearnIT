    "content": "The national defense budget function (050) is the largest in discretionary spending and includes Department of Defense, atomic energy defense activities, and other defense-related activities like FBI counterintelligence. Discretionary spending is funded through annual appropriations bills, while mandatory spending covers entitlement programs. Since 9/11, federal outlays have increased. The national defense budget has almost doubled from $306 billion in FY2001 to $590 billion in FY2017, projected to reach $655 billion in FY2021. However, as a percentage of total federal outlays, defense spending has decreased from 16.4% in FY2001 to 13.2% in FY2021. Annual federal budget deficits exceeded $1 trillion between FY2009 and FY2012, attributed to reduced tax revenues from the 2007-2009 recession and increased spending from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The Budget Control Act of 2011 aimed to reduce federal budget deficits by $2.1 trillion from FY2012 through FY2021, with half of the savings from defense. It reinstated spending limits on discretionary budget authority starting in FY2012. Congress provides budget authority to federal agencies for goods and services, but does not directly control outlays. The Budget Control Act of 2011 aimed to reduce federal budget deficits by $2.1 trillion from FY2012 through FY2021, with half of the savings from defense. Congress does not directly control outlays, which occur when obligations are liquidated. Spending limits in FY2012 and FY2013 were initially specified in separate \"security\" and \"nonsecurity\" categories, but after the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction failed to reach a deal, the \"security\" category was revised to the narrower \"defense\" category. The Budget Control Act of 2011 aimed to reduce federal budget deficits by $2.1 trillion, with half from defense. Critics argue that the spending limits disproportionately affect defense programs, with Senator John McCain and Representative William Thornberry stating the law has \"failed.\" Defense Secretary James Mattis emphasized the harm caused to military readiness by the BCA's defense restrictions. The Budget Control Act of 2011 has harmed U.S. military readiness more than the defense spending caps. Proponents argue the limits are necessary due to deficits and debt. Critics, like Representative Mark Meadows, question the cost of funding the military. Lawrence Korb acknowledges the BCA's impact on defense capability but notes Congress has mitigated it by increasing caps and exemptions. The Budget Control Act of 2011 aimed to reduce deficits by $2.1 trillion from FY2012 to FY2021, with half of the savings from defense. Congress increased caps and exempted Overseas Contingency Operations funding. Attempts to repeal the BCA fully have failed. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction failed to reach an agreement on a deficit-reduction plan, leading to automatic spending cuts through sequestration. The Budget Control Act of 2011 required steeper reductions to discretionary spending limits each year from FY2013 through FY2021, with Congress amending the act multiple times to revise the limits. The Budget Control Act of 2011 sets limits on discretionary spending for defense programs, excluding Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) or emergencies. OCO funding is exempt from these limits, with Congress and the President designating the spending on an account-by-account basis. There are no restrictions on the amount of funding that can be designated as OCO, reflecting differing perspectives on the Global War on Terrorism. The Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) has evolved over time, with Congress and the President designating funding for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) to increase defense and foreign affairs spending. The Trump Administration's FY2019 DOD budget initially included $89.0 billion for OCO, but later shifted $20.0 billion into the base budget after Congress raised spending caps. The FY2019 budget request includes a shift of $20.0 billion from OCO funding to the base budget, addressing long-time budget gimmicks. The Administration plans to return certain costs funded in OCO to the base budget starting in FY2020. The BCA limits on DOD-Military base budget activities are estimated at approximately $600 billion in FY2018, $617 billion in FY2019, and $549 billion in FY2020. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 amended the Budget Control Act of 2011 to increase defense discretionary spending caps significantly. Congress has raised the limits by a total of $264 billion, reducing their deficit-reduction effect. The increases over previous caps range from 2% to 15% in various fiscal years. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the national defense budget authority would total $6.26 trillion over 10 years, with automatic reductions decreasing projected discretionary defense base budget authority by approximately $868 billion to $5.39 trillion. A sequester enforces budgetary limits through across-the-board reductions to nonexempt programs and accounts. The sequestration process, triggered in 2013 due to the absence of legislation to reduce the federal budget deficit, resulted in automatic reductions to nonexempt federal government accounts. President Obama ordered the sequestration of budgetary resources on March 1, 2013, enforcing spending limits specified in law. The sequestration process in 2013 resulted in automatic reductions to federal government accounts. DOD applied a $37 billion sequester to $528 billion in available budgetary resources, a 7% reduction. Legislation like the NDAA does not trigger a sequester for violating discretionary spending limits. Defense discretionary outlays decreased from $671 billion in FY2012 to $590 billion in FY2017, projected to reach $655 billion in FY2021. Adjusting for inflation, defense discretionary outlays peaked at $784 billion in FY2010. Defense discretionary outlays peaked at $784 billion in FY2010 during the U.S.-led wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. After the Budget Control Act (BCA), outlays decreased to $599 billion in FY2017, projected to reach $620 billion in FY2021. Over the past half century, defense outlays as a percentage of federal spending have trended downward, from nearly half in FY1962 to 15% in FY2017, and projected to decline further to 13% in FY2021. In FY2021, discretionary defense outlays are projected to decline to 2.9% of GDP, while the deficit is projected to increase to $1.1 trillion (4.9% of GDP). Federal debt held by the public is also projected to increase to $19 trillion (83.1% of GDP) in FY2021. The Trump Administration has proposed increasing defense spending beyond the statutory limits of the Budget Control Act of 2011. The President's FY2019 budget request proposed increasing caps on defense discretionary base budget authority by $84 billion to $660 billion in FY2020 and by $87 billion to $677 billion in FY2021. Defense funding for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) is also proposed to total $73 billion in FY2020 and $66 billion in FY2021.
