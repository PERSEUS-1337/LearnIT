    "content": "The \"Child Tax Credit Improvement Act\" is the short title of this Act. It includes findings related to the child tax credit. The Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit are effective in lifting children out of poverty, especially young children who often receive smaller credits. Experts emphasize the importance of early childhood development. Economists have found that early childhood income is crucial for school achievement and development. Fluctuations in family income can harm young children, as parents struggle to focus on their needs. Indexing the child tax credit value would prevent its erosion due to inflation. The Young Child Tax Credit is addressed in Section 3. The Young Child Tax Credit under Section 24 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 provides a credit of $3,600 for qualifying children under age 6. The credit is refundable and subject to income limitations. The credit allowed to a taxpayer under subpart C is increased by the credit allowed under this section. The credit under this subsection reduces the amount of credit otherwise allowable under subsection (a). The amount of the credit allowed under subsection (a) is reduced by any advance payments of the credit for the taxable year. The tax credit under section 7527A for the taxable year may be reduced by excess advance payments, leading to an increase in the tax imposed for that year. Additionally, a new section in Chapter 77 allows for advance payment of the credit. \"SEC. 7527A allows for advance payment of Young Child Tax Credit.\" The Secretary will establish a program for advance payments of the credit allowed under section 24 within 1 year of enactment. Payments will be made monthly or as determined feasible. The total payments to a taxpayer in a year cannot exceed the amount allowed under section 24(h). The program will make efforts to apply the limitation of section 24(b) to the payments. The program for advance payments of the credit under section 24 will adhere to the limitation of section 24(b) with respect to payments made. Amendments are made to sections 6211(b)(4)(A) and 6402(m) of the Code to reflect these changes. Sec. 7527A allows for advance payment of young child tax credit. Amendments to section 1324(b)(2) of title 31, US Code, are made. Effective date for these changes is after December 31, 2016. The Secretary of the Treasury must establish the program by a specified date. SEC. 4 amends the Child Tax Credit to include 45 percent of the taxpayer's earned income in computing taxable income. These changes apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2016. SEC. 5 adjusts for inflation. The Child Tax Credit is amended to include inflation adjustments for taxable years starting after 2016. The $1,000 credit amount will be increased based on the cost-of-living adjustment for the calendar year. The Child Tax Credit amount of $3,600 for taxable years starting after 2017 will be increased annually based on the cost-of-living adjustment. The increase will be rounded to the nearest multiple of $50. These amendments are effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2016."
