    "content": "DNA is a crucial tool in law enforcement investigations due to its unique genetic makeup in each individual. It can be extracted from various sources like hair, bone, teeth, saliva, and blood, providing valuable information even in small amounts. State and federal DNA databases have been essential in solving crimes and preventing wrongful convictions. DNA evidence is crucial in law enforcement for solving crimes and establishing innocence. It can be used to compare suspects' DNA to evidence at crime scenes or to identify perpetrators through DNA databases. DNA databases help link biological evidence from different crime scenes to the same perpetrator. This report provides an overview of how DNA is used in investigations and current laws on collecting and sharing DNA samples and profiles. The report summarizes statutory laws on collecting and sharing DNA samples, maintaining a national DNA database by the FBI, and authorizing DNA sample collection from federal offenders, arrestees, and military offenders. State laws determine which profiles are entered into state DNA databases, while federal laws dictate which profiles are entered into the national database. Additionally, Congress has authorized grant programs to help reduce DNA backlogs, provide postconviction DNA testing, and promote new technology in the field. Increased demand for DNA analysis due to awareness of its crime-solving capabilities has led to a backlog of casework for laboratory personnel. DNA testing can also help exonerate wrongfully incarcerated individuals. States began requiring DNA samples from offenders in the 1980s, with profiles entered into state databases. The FBI Laboratory established guidelines for forensic DNA analysis in the late 1980s, forming the basis of current national quality assurance standards. The FBI established guidelines for forensic DNA analysis in the late 1980s, leading to the creation of a national DNA database known as the National DNA Index System (NDIS) in 1994. Currently, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, federal government, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Laboratory participate in the NDIS, storing DNA profiles from federal, state, and local crime laboratories. The NDIS stores DNA profiles from federal, state, and local crime laboratories. Participating laboratories use CODIS software to compare DNA profiles at national and state levels. CODIS searches three indexes (convicted offenders, arrestee, and forensic) to generate investigative leads. The NDIS stores DNA profiles from crime laboratories and uses CODIS software to search three indexes for potential matches. Matches can provide law enforcement with suspect identities, link crime scenes, and help coordinate efforts between jurisdictions. No personal identifiers are stored in the NDIS, so laboratories are notified of matches and verify them independently. The NDIS contacts parties to verify and coordinate efforts after a match is found. DNA profiles in CODIS are based on 13 core STR loci selected by the FBI, providing high discriminatory power. The probability of two unrelated individuals sharing all 13 pairs of alleles is extremely low. Quality assurance is crucial for DNA profiles entered into the NDIS. The FBI ensures the quality of DNA profiles in the NDIS by signing agreements with state labs to adhere to Quality Assurance Standards. Labs must be accredited and audited annually, with external audits required every two years. Failure to pass audits can result in labs being barred from entering profiles into CODIS. Most labs in the US are audited by ASCLD/LAB and FQS. DNA analysts must pass semiannual proficiency testing to enter profiles into CODIS. Labs must conduct two reviews before profile entry. Only public labs meeting QAS can submit to NDIS, but can outsource to accredited private labs. Public labs must visit private labs before contracting for DNA analyses. If a public laboratory signs a contract with a private laboratory longer than one year, an annual site visit is required. Public labs must review outsourced DNA profiles in addition to private labs' reviews per QAS. Offender profiles in DNA databases consist of 26 numbers representing alleles for 13 STR loci, agency and sample ID numbers, and analyst identifier. Most jurisdictions retain DNA samples for quality assurance and future technology testing. Privacy advocates are concerned about stored DNA samples. Privacy advocates are concerned about the misuse of stored DNA samples, leading to criminal penalties for unauthorized use. The NDIS has seen an increase in offender profiles, with approximately 15.6 million new profiles added since 2000. States have expanded their DNA collection laws to include profiles from a broader range of convicted offenders and arrestees. Since 2000, new convicted offender and arrestee profiles, as well as approximately 795,000 forensic profiles, have been added to NDIS. These additions have increased investigative leads and aided in solving nearly 381,000 crimes. Delays in DNA evidence processing can lead to delays in apprehending offenders or wrongful convictions. Backlogs may prioritize DNA analysis for violent crimes, potentially impacting the collection of evidence for minor offenses. The policies discourage collecting DNA for minor offenses, potentially hindering apprehension of future serious offenders. Context is crucial in assessing DNA backlogs, considering lab capacity, workload, and turnaround times. Recent data on DNA backlogs are from a November 2016 report by the Bureau of Justice Statistics. The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) report from November 2016 compares data from 2009 to 2014 on DNA analysis requests. In 2009, there were 103,500 backlogged forensic casework analyses, and in 2014, there were 107,800. The increase in backlogged cases was not statistically significant. Public crime labs completed more forensic casework samples in 2014 (296,000) compared to 2009 (239,000), despite an increase in requests for analysis. The requests for forensics casework analysis increased from 260,000 in 2009 to 333,000 in 2014. The backlog of convicted offender and arrestee samples decreased significantly from 502,500 in 2009 to 64,800 in 2014. Public crime labs processed 1,027,000 samples in 2009 and 904,000 in 2014. There was a decrease in requests for analysis of these samples, from 1,053,000 in 2009 to 908,000 in 2014. Federal law allows for the collection of DNA samples from certain federal offenders for analysis and inclusion in the NDIS. Federal law dictates the inclusion of DNA samples from federal offenders in the NDIS, with specific standards for agencies participating in the program. The FBI is required to issue Quality Assurance Standards for forensic laboratories conducting DNA analyses, as mandated by the Rapid DNA Act of 2017. The Rapid DNA Act of 2017 (P.L. 115-50) mandates the FBI to establish standards and procedures for rapid DNA instruments and analyses. The Quality Assurance Standards (QAS) cover various areas such as proficiency testing, personnel, facilities, validation, and safety for forensic DNA analysis. The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 authorized the FBI to establish an index of DNA profiles (NDIS) containing profiles from convicted individuals, crime scenes, unidentified remains, and missing persons' relatives. Profiles must meet FBI standards and be analyzed by accredited labs. The FBI is required to expunge the DNA profile of an individual entered into the NDIS based on certain criteria, including accreditation by a professional organization and undergoing external audits. Profiles must comply with FBI's QAS and be used for specific purposes by criminal justice agencies. The FBI is required to expunge DNA profiles from the NDIS if certain conditions are met, such as overturning a conviction or having charges dismissed. States must also have procedures in place to expunge profiles from their databases. Under current law, the Department of Defense must expunge DNA profiles from the NDIS if a conviction is overturned. The Attorney General can collect DNA samples from individuals arrested, facing charges, or convicted of a crime. The Bureau of Prisons is required to collect DNA samples from federal prisoners convicted of specific crimes. Federal probation offices supervise individuals on probation, parole, or supervised release. The FBI requires DNA samples from individuals convicted of certain crimes for analysis and inclusion in the NDIS. The Rapid DNA Act allows for expedited analysis and inclusion in the database. Similar provisions apply to District of Columbia offenders, with BOP and CSOSA mandated to collect DNA samples from relevant individuals. The government of the District of Columbia determines qualifying offenses for DNA sample collection from individuals on probation, parole, or supervised release. Samples are submitted to the FBI for analysis and inclusion in the NDIS. The Rapid DNA Act allows for expedited analysis using rapid DNA instruments for District of Columbia offenders. The Justice for All Act of 2004 established procedures for postconviction DNA testing in federal courts. Upon written motion from an individual sentenced for a federal offense, the court must order DNA testing of evidence if the applicant asserts innocence under penalty of perjury. The Justice for All Act of 2004 allows for postconviction DNA testing in federal courts if the evidence was secured during the investigation or prosecution of the crime, and the applicant asserts innocence under penalty of perjury. The evidence must not have been previously tested or the applicant must request testing using a new method. The Justice for All Act of 2004 allows for postconviction DNA testing in federal courts if the evidence was secured during the investigation or prosecution of the crime. The applicant must assert innocence under penalty of perjury and may request DNA testing using a new, more probative method. The proposed DNA testing must be reasonable in scope, use scientifically sound methods, and be consistent with accepted forensic practices. It should support a theory of defense that establishes the actual innocence of the applicant, especially if the identity of the perpetrator was at issue in the trial. The Justice for All Act of 2004 allows for postconviction DNA testing in federal courts if the evidence was secured during the investigation or prosecution of the crime. The proposed DNA testing may produce new material evidence that would support the affirmative defense theory presented at trial and raise a reasonable probability that the applicant did not commit the crime. If the court orders DNA testing, the testing is carried out by the FBI or another qualified laboratory. The cost of DNA testing is borne by the applicant unless they are indigent, in which case the government covers the cost. The results of the DNA test must be provided to the court, applicant, and U.S. Attorney's office simultaneously. If the DNA test excludes the applicant as the source of the biological evidence, the... If the DNA test excludes the applicant as the source of the biological evidence, the DNA profile is required to be run through CODIS to see if it matches any profiles in the NDIS. Results are provided to the court, applicant, and U.S. Attorneys office. If inconclusive or shows the applicant was the source, their DNA profile may be retained in the NDIS. If the applicant's DNA profile matches other forensic profiles in the NDIS, DOJ contacts the appropriate agency and preserves the DNA sample. If the test results exclude the applicant as the source, their DNA sample is preserved. If DNA test results exclude the applicant as the source of evidence and no match is found in NDIS, DOJ must destroy the DNA sample. Inconclusive results may lead to further testing or denial of relief. If applicant is found to be the source, relief is denied, and false claims of innocence can lead to contempt of court. BOP may deny good conduct time based on findings. Under current law, if DNA test results show the applicant is not the source of evidence, they can file for a new trial or resentencing. If convicted of making false assertions regarding DNA testing, the applicant faces a minimum of three years in prison. The findings are forwarded to BOP, U.S. Parole Commission, or state officials depending on the case. The Justice for All Act of 2004 established standards for preserving biological evidence, requiring the federal government to preserve such evidence. If DNA test results, along with other evidence, show compelling evidence for acquittal, a new trial or resentencing may be granted. The federal government is mandated to preserve biological evidence from federal offenses, unless certain conditions are met, such as notification to the defendant and no motion filed within 180 days. Grant programs offer assistance to states in this regard. The defendant was the source of the evidence. Grant programs provide assistance to state and local governments for forensic sciences, focusing on reducing backlogs of forensic and convicted offender samples. Some grants also cover the cost of postconviction DNA testing. The Debbie Smith DNA Backlog Grant Program offers grants for various purposes related to DNA analysis and laboratory capacity. The Katie Sepich Enhanced DNA Collection Act of 2012 and the SAFER Act of 2013 aim to increase DNA analysis capacity, collect DNA samples from individuals, and ensure timely forensic DNA analysis. Funding from these acts assists states in collecting DNA samples from arrestees and conducting audits of sexual assault evidence samples. The Attorney General is required to distribute funds among state and local governments to maximize the effective utilization of DNA technology for solving crimes and protecting public safety. Funding must also be allocated to reduce backlogs by considering the number of offender and forensic samples awaiting DNA analysis, along with the population and number of violent crimes in the jurisdiction. The program distributes funds to states, territories, and the District of Columbia for DNA analysis. Recipients must meet FBI's QAS standards and can use grants for DNA sample analysis and forensic casework. State and local governments must report to DOJ on fund usage. The SAFER Act of 2013 sets conditions for states or local governments receiving grants under the Debbie Smith program for conducting audits of sexual assault evidence. States must submit a plan for the audit of samples as part of the requirements. The SAFER Act of 2013 mandates states or local governments receiving grants under the Debbie Smith program to submit an audit plan for sexual assault evidence samples. The act also requires completing the audit within a year, submitting reports to the DOJ every 60 days for at least a year after the audit, and developing protocols for DNA evidence collection and processing, specifically for sexual assault cases. The Debbie Smith program outlines guidelines for evidence collection, testing, communication among criminal justice actors, and audits of sexual assault evidence. It was authorized under the Justice for All Act of 2004 and reauthorized in 2008 with appropriations of $151 million. The Debbie Smith Reauthorization Act of 2014 extended the authorization of $151 million per fiscal year until FY2019. The Kirk Bloodsworth DNA Post-Conviction DNA Testing Grant program was authorized by the Justice for All Act of 2004 with appropriations of $5 million for FY2005-FY2009. The Justice for All Reauthorization Act of 2016 reauthorized appropriations for this program at $5 million per year for FY2017-FY2021. The Sexual Assault Forensic Exam Program Grants were also authorized under the Justice for All Act of 2004. The Debbie Smith Reauthorization Act of 2014 extended the authorization of $30 million per fiscal year until FY2019 for grants related to DNA sample and evidence collection for sexual assault victims. The Justice for All Act of 2004 authorized grants for research and development to improve forensic DNA technology. The Justice for All Reauthorization Act of 2016 reauthorized funding for DNA technology grants at $5 million per year for FY2017-FY2021. The program provides training and assistance for law enforcement, court officers, and forensic professionals in DNA sample analysis and preservation. The Debbie Smith Reauthorization Act of 2014 extended the $12.5 million per fiscal year authorization until FY2019."
