    "content": "In June 2014, the EPA proposed a rule to address CO2 emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units under Section 111(d) of the Clean Air Act. The proposal sets CO2 emission rate goals for each state to achieve by 2030, sparking debate over EPA's authority and receiving attention from Congress and stakeholders. The EPA's proposed rule aims to reduce CO2 emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units by setting emission rate goals for each state to achieve by 2030. This includes opportunities for increased renewable energy generation and energy efficiency improvements. If states meet their goals, CO2 emissions from the electric power sector in the US could be reduced by 30% compared to 2005 levels. States have flexibility in how they meet these goals, including converting emission rate targets to mass-based targets measured in metric tons of CO2. The EPA's proposal aims to reduce CO2 emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units by setting state-specific mass-based targets. States have flexibility in how they meet these goals, including linking with existing mass-based programs or continuing state emission reduction efforts. This report discusses the differences between mass-based reduction requirements and emission rate requirements in state emission reduction goals. It outlines the EPA's mass-based conversion methodologies and provides observations on the results of the mass-based conversions. The report complements other CRS reports on EPA's proposed greenhouse gas regulations. This report complements other CRS reports on EPA's proposed greenhouse gas regulations. It discusses EPA's emission rate methodology and state-specific emission rate goals for existing power plants. EPA calculated emission rate goals based on each state's 2012 emission rate baseline. The EPA calculated emission rate goals for existing power plants based on each state's 2012 emission rate baseline. The state baselines vary due to different energy sources used for electricity generation. EPA applied four building blocks to decrease emission rates, including coal-fired power plant efficiency improvements, natural gas displacement of carbon-intensive sources, increased use of renewable energy, and energy efficiency improvements. The EPA's emission rate methodology for existing power plants allows states flexibility in meeting their emission rate goals by focusing on different building block strategies or alternative methods. States can choose to convert their emission rate targets to mass-based targets using two approaches outlined in EPA's November 2014 support document. For more details, refer to CRS Report R43652. Authorities may adopt different approaches for mass-based emission rate goals, with EPA providing state-specific targets equivalent to rate-based goals. The first approach is based on 2012 emissions from existing sources, while the second includes projected emissions from new sources. Converting from an emission rate to a mass-based target requires an annual estimate of future electricity generation, with EPA offering methodologies for calculation in their support document. The EPA used two methodologies to calculate electricity generation estimates based on 2012 baseline data and specific emission rate building blocks. The agency projected state-specific electricity generation levels for 2029 by determining electricity generation from affected electric generating units in 2012. The EPA calculated state-specific electricity generation levels for 2029 by adjusting the fossil-fuel electricity generation baseline and combining it with renewable energy, nuclear power, and energy efficiency generation values. This resulted in the \"mass equivalent generation level\" for 2029. EPA calculated state-specific electricity generation levels for 2029 by adjusting the fossil-fuel electricity generation baseline and combining it with renewable energy, nuclear power, and energy efficiency generation values. This resulted in the \"mass equivalent generation level\" for 2029. EPA's second mass-based conversion approach considers historical emissions from existing sources and projected emissions from new fossil fuel-fired electricity generation sources, particularly NGCC units. EPA sought comments on the role of new NGCC units in addressing projected growth in electricity demand. EPA proposed a second mass-based approach to account for new NGCC units in meeting emission targets. They estimated states' 2029 electricity generation by projecting sales and using growth factors. This approach considers historical emissions and projected emissions from new fossil fuel-fired sources. EPA sought comments on the role of new NGCC units in addressing electricity demand growth. The EPA proposed a mass-based approach to calculate emission targets for each state, considering growth factors and new electricity demand in 2029. They calculated the \"mass equivalent generation level\" for 2029 by combining incremental demand with existing sources. State-specific emission targets were determined by multiplying mass equivalent generation levels with emission rates. Table 1 shows each state's 2012 CO2 emission baseline, 2030 CO2 emission target, and required percentage reduction to meet the target. The EPA proposed a mass-based approach to calculate emission targets for each state, considering growth factors and new electricity demand in 2029. Table 1 lists state-specific, mass-based targets for 2030 and compares them to each state's 2012 CO2 emission baseline. The percentage reductions required by emission rates and mass-based targets generally match, but in some cases, they differ. In nine states, including California, Colorado, Florida, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Ohio, Virginia, and Wyoming, the mass-based targets for existing sources result in a smaller percentage reduction requirement from the 2012 baseline compared to the emission rate target. The differences in percentage reductions range from 1% to 14%, with Virginia's mass-based target requiring a 24% reduction compared to a 38% reduction with an emission rate target. These differences are due to EPA's treatment of NGCC units under construction in these states. In nine states, including California, Colorado, Florida, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Ohio, Virginia, and Wyoming, the mass-based targets for existing sources result in a smaller percentage reduction requirement from the 2012 baseline compared to the emission rate target. The differences in percentage reductions range from 1% to 14%, with Virginia's mass-based target requiring a 24% reduction compared to a 38% reduction with an emission rate target. This discrepancy is due to EPA's treatment of NGCC units under construction in these states. Additionally, Washington and Idaho also have lower percentage reduction requirements under the mass-based methodology. In some states, the mass-based targets for existing sources result in smaller percentage reduction requirements compared to the emission rate targets. This discrepancy is due to EPA's treatment of renewable energy in the emission rate methodology, particularly in building block 3. Four states have larger percentage reductions under the mass-based targets approach, with adjustments made to hold affected fossil fuel generation at zero. EPA's emission rate methodology in building block 3 applies growth rates to estimate future renewable energy generation. States exceeding their 2030 targets have their RE use held constant at regional levels, potentially lowering emission rate targets. Mass-based methodology captures RE generation in target calculations, resulting in greater reductions compared to emission rate targets in some states. The EPA's second approach for converting to mass-based targets includes electricity generation from both existing and new sources, resulting in greater reductions in some states. Table 1 shows state-specific 2012 emission baselines, 2030 targets, and percentage changes. While all states have lower reduction requirements compared to approach 1, the range of reduction requirements varies significantly. Some states have targets higher than their baselines, while others have minimal reduction requirements. Several factors contribute to the variation in reduction requirements. The EPA's second approach for converting to mass-based targets includes electricity generation from both existing and new sources, resulting in greater reductions in some states. Factors such as regional growth factors and electricity sales data in 2012 contribute to the variation in reduction requirements. For example, Arizona's demand for electricity is projected to increase by 25% between 2012 and 2029, while Massachusetts will see a 5% increase over the same period. The different accounting mechanisms have an impact on states' emission rate methodology. The accounting mechanisms for emissions in states with high hydropower generation and electricity growth factors, like Idaho, Washington, and Oregon, have an impact. CO2 emissions from under-construction NGCC units are counted towards states' baselines, particularly in Virginia where these units make up 20% of fossil-fuel fired generation in 2012."
