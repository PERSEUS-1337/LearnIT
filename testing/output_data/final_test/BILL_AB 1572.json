    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature in California aims to support school participation and high school attainment among low-income youth based on findings that show a link between access to transportation and improved school attendance. This intention is reflected in the proposed legislation to amend Section 39800 of the Education Code. Section 39800 of the Education Code is amended to allow school districts to provide transportation for pupils to and from school when deemed advisable by the governing board. The board may purchase, rent, and maintain vehicles for this purpose. The governing board of a school district may contract for transportation of middle and high school pupils by public transit or with parents. Preschool or nursery school pupils can be transported in school buses owned by the district. No state reimbursement is given for transporting preschool or nursery school pupils. Title 1 federal funding eligible public school pupils entitled to free transportation if residing more than half a mile from school or in unsafe neighborhood. Safety factors defined in plan. School districts not providing transportation to eligible schools must do so. The plan required for Title 1 federal funding eligible public school pupils entitled to free transportation shall accommodate homeless youth and be developed in consultation with various stakeholders. If free transportation is not available, the school district must ensure that eligible pupils receive it. Transportation for middle and high school pupils can be provided by a public employee or a municipality-owned transit system. The transit system must have public employees as drivers and ensure consistent routes and schedules. Additionally, local transportation agencies can offer free transit passes to students attending Title 1 schools. The Transportation and Access to Public School Fund, created in the State Treasury, will reimburse all transportation provided for middle and high school pupils. Funds from this fund will be allocated to local educational agencies as per the process established by the Superintendent. Starting in the 2017-18 fiscal year, the Superintendent will allocate funds from the Transportation and Access to Public School Fund to cover the actual costs of entitled transportation for school districts, county offices of education, and other entities providing pupil transportation. This allocation is in addition to any home-to-school transportation apportioned under Article 10 of Chapter 5 of Part 24. This section will only be effective if funding is provided in the annual Budget Act or another statute for this purpose. The Commission on State Mandates will reimburse local agencies and school districts for costs mandated by the state as per the Government Code."
