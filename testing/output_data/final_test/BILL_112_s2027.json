The Microfinance and Microenterprise Enhancement Act of 2011 acknowledges the importance of inclusive markets and small income gaps for poverty reduction. It highlights the significant role of microenterprises in developing economies, especially in employment generation and food security. Microfinance institutions have helped micro-entrepreneurs move out of extreme poverty through financial services and skills development. Support for microenterprise development assistance programs has been demonstrated by Congress through the enactment of three comprehensive laws. Microcredit alone is not enough to reduce poverty sustainably and promote inclusive economic growth. The United States Agency for International Development has prioritized microenterprise development to help reduce poverty and promote inclusive economic growth. In fiscal year 2010, they allocated over $262 million for microenterprise development in 64 countries through various partners. Innovative approaches are crucial to address poverty and connect poor households to economic opportunities for sustainable poverty reduction. Public funding for microfinance and microenterprise should be accessible to benefit the poor globally, especially in countries with high poverty rates. Sense of Congress on targeted and effective programming. The United States Agency for International Development should expand microfinance programming to help very poor and vulnerable populations access economic opportunities. Funding targets should be set based on poverty indicators to ensure the poorest benefit from economic growth. The United States Agency for International Development should focus on aiding poor women, who are a significant portion of microentrepreneurs, to promote financial self-reliance and gender equality. Providers of financial services should adhere to client protection principles to ensure benefits from assistance. The \"Smart Campaign\" Client Protection Principles aim to protect clients from harmful financial products and ensure fair treatment, including avoiding over-indebtedness, transparent pricing, responsible collection practices, grievance redress mechanisms, and client data privacy. The United States Agency for International Development should encourage financial service providers to offer cost-effective services, achieve financial sustainability, and focus on their target goals. The United States Agency for International Development should increase access to financial services for poor micro-entrepreneurs and smallholder farmers by supporting various financial intermediaries, including NGOs, banks, savings and credit cooperatives, and mobile network operators. They should also utilize cost-effective technologies to lower costs and manage risks effectively. The United States Agency for International Development aims to lower costs, manage risks, and scale up access to financial products and services through various technologies such as mobile phones, smart cards, ATMs, GIS mapping, and cloud computing. Efforts should be made to support smaller community-led partner organizations. Congress believes that future microfinance programs should adopt holistic approaches addressing financial and non-financial needs like nutrition, health, and education for households, as well as the functioning of enterprises and markets in the economy. The United States Agency for International Development promotes responsive financial services for poor households, including savings, remittances, and money transfer services. They also support tools like insurance and savings deposits to help manage income fluctuations and crises. Additionally, they identify and support partners that promote informal savings-led and asset-building approaches. The United States Agency for International Development supports informal savings-led and asset building approaches in microfinance. They also aim to link social protection programs with microfinance services to help stabilize food consumption, alleviate extreme poverty, and create sustainable livelihoods. SEC. 6. ENTERPRISE AND MARKET-BASED APPROACHES. The Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development will align household-level interventions for the poor with interventions that promote inclusive markets and economic opportunities. They will also support the development of financial products tailored to enterprise needs and provide agriculture-specific tools. The United States Agency for International Development will support microfinance institutions using agriculture-specific tools like household profiling, crop analysis, and linking farmers to supply chains. Investments will focus on linking microenterprises to global value chains to promote economic growth. The United States Agency for International Development supports small- and medium-sized enterprises to improve productivity and competitiveness in key subsectors, benefiting poor micro-entrepreneurs and strengthening channels for growth. SEC. 7. MEASURING AND REPORTING RESULTS.\n\nThe Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development will modify the Poverty Assessment Tools (PATs) for expanded data management purposes. Additionally, alternatives to PATs will be identified and approved within one year of the enactment of this Act.\n\nSEC. 8. FINANCIAL ACCESS AND MICROENTERPRISE INNOVATION FUND. The Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development can use one percent of the Agency's budget for a financial access and microenterprise innovation challenge fund. This fund aims to support innovative products and technologies for improving financial services for the poor, testing new microfinance products, and facilitating their widespread adoption. The financial access and microenterprise innovation challenge fund provides grants to organizations and companies to support the transition of innovative methods and technologies to widespread adoption. Grants may require recipients to invest their own funds and could include challenge grants and bounties for achieving targets."
