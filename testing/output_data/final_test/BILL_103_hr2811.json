The Act authorizes appropriations for the National Weather Service for operations, research, and systems acquisition. $473,256,000 is allocated for fiscal year 1994 and $492,185,000 for fiscal year 1995 for operations and research duties, including public warnings and forecasts. Additionally, $76,299,000 is allocated for fiscal year 1994 and $14,600,000 for fiscal year 1995 for public warning and forecast systems duties, including development and implementation. The funds authorized for public warning and forecast systems development and implementation are restricted from being used for other purposes. Expenditure on Next Generation Doppler Weather Radar (NEXRAD) is contingent on meeting specific requirements. Installation of NEXRAD must be identified in the National Implementation Plan. The installation of Next Generation Doppler Weather Radar (NEXRAD) must be identified in the National Implementation Plan for modernization of the National Weather Service. The Secretary, in consultation with the Modernization Transition Committee, must determine the technical and programmatic necessity for the installation within a specified timeframe. If not needed for installation at a specific site, NEXRAD can only be used for spare parts. The Automated Surface Observing System and related systems, including replacement units, are authorized to receive funding for acquisition and deployment until September 30, 1996. The Automated Surface Observing System and related systems are authorized for funding until September 30, 1996, subject to certification by the Secretary to Congress regarding technical specifications, deployment, and operational schedule. The Secretary is required to provide a certification to Congress regarding circumstances preventing program certification, remedial actions, effects on deployment schedule, and justification for program continuation. $315,887,000 is authorized for the completion of the Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System and NOAA Port deployment. The Secretary must certify to Congress that the systems meet technical specifications, can be deployed without further appropriations, and will not face delays in deployment schedule. No funds can be appropriated unless this certification is provided within 60 days of the President's budget request. The Secretary must certify to Congress that the systems meet technical specifications, can be deployed without further appropriations, and will not face delays in deployment schedule. If unable to certify, a report must be submitted detailing the circumstances, remedial actions, effects on schedule, and justification for proceeding with the program. Authorization is given for funding construction, repair, and modification activities for weather forecast offices. Authorization is given for funding construction, repair, and modification activities for new and existing weather forecast offices, totaling $62,784,000 for fiscal year 1994 and $14,739,000 for fiscal year 1995. Activities include planning, design, and land acquisition. SEC. 102. ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH. Climate and Air Quality Research funding for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is authorized at $105,922,000 for fiscal year 1994 and $138,737,000 for fiscal year 1995. This includes research on interannual and seasonal climate, long-term climate and air quality, and studying climate and global change with a focus on global observations and monitoring. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is authorized funding for climate and air quality research. This includes research on atmospheric processes critical to climate prediction, solar-terrestrial research, and services. Funding amounts to $42,103,000 for fiscal year 1994 and $52,980,000 for fiscal year 1995. SEC. 103. NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL SATELLITE, DATA, AND INFORMATION SERVICE. The Secretary is authorized funds for satellite observing systems duties, including spacecraft procurement and operation of environmental satellites. No funds can be used for Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite until specific requirements are met. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Authorization Act of 1992 authorizes funds for the procurement of Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites J, K, L, and M, along with launching and ground systems. No funds can be used for Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites until specific requirements are met. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Authorization Act of 1992 authorizes funds for the procurement of Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites J, K, L, and M, along with launching and ground systems. The Act requires certification to Congress that satellite instruments meet technical specifications, procurements can be completed within authorized amounts, and there are no gaps in service operations. If certification cannot be provided, a report detailing the circumstances and remedial actions must be submitted. No funds for Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites, other than for Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites J, K, L, and M, are authorized to be appropriated unless an implementation plan for a single operational polar environmental and weather satellite system is submitted. This plan should also include the policy for polar satellite system convergence with the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT). The Secretary is authorized to appropriate funds for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration for environmental data and information services, including climate and geophysical data services, totaling $34,068,000 for fiscal year 1994 and $41,227,000 for fiscal year 1995. SEC. 104. PROGRAM SUPPORT.\n\nAuthorized appropriations for Administration and Services are $73,319,000 for fiscal year 1994 and $76,252,000 for fiscal year 1995. For Aircraft Services and Aircraft Critical Safety, $9,495,000 is authorized for fiscal year 1994 and $9,875,000 for fiscal year 1995.\n\nSEC. 105. LIMITATION ON APPROPRIATIONS.\n\nNo funds are authorized for fiscal years after 1995, except for specific programs. This section excludes programs in section 102(a)(2) or section 104(a).\n\nTITLE II--MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS\n\nSEC. 201. STRATEGIC PLAN FOR ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LABORATORIES. The Secretary will assess the long-term role and mission of the Environmental Research Laboratories of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, considering resources, research support for coastal and ocean management, and data processing capabilities. The Environmental Research Laboratories of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration collect and process data for solar-terrestrial services, support weather service modernization, monitor Earth's climate changes, and provide scientific data for policy makers to address environmental concerns. The Environmental Research Laboratories of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration are tasked with responding to national and global environmental concerns, improving operational efficiency, interacting with the academic community, determining the number and distribution of labs, and addressing any other issues identified by the Secretary. Within one year of the Act's enactment, a Comprehensive Strategic Plan must be developed and submitted to specific committees in the Senate and House of Representatives. The House of Representatives requires a strategic plan to modernize the Environmental Research Laboratories of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration based on a conducted assessment. SEC. 202. HYDROLOGICAL RESEARCH AND FLOOD FORECAST MODERNIZATION REPORT. The Secretary, in consultation with other Federal agencies, must submit a report to Congress within 6 months of this Act's enactment, outlining actions to enhance hydrological research programs and update the Flood Forecasting System. The report should address technological advancements in data collection and the utilization of satellite and airborne surveys for hydrological data collection. The Federal agencies are focusing on improving hydrological data collection, data analysis, computer modeling for flood forecasts, and integrating River Forecast Centers into the National Weather Service Modernization Plan. The sense of Congress is that transfers of National Weather Service employees should not degrade services in the field office's service area."
