    "content": "The Congressional Award Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 amends sections of the Congressional Award Act regarding implementation, presentation, and terms of appointment for Board members. Appointed members serve at the pleasure of the appointing officer for a 4-year term. Members of the Board may be reappointed for a term of 4 years, with a limit of 2 full consecutive terms. The term of each member begins on October 1 of the even-numbered year, with staggered appointments. Members serving as Chairman are exempt from term limits and may be reappointed for an additional full term after their Chairmanship ends. The Congressional Award Act of 2009 applies to Board appointments made after its enactment. Section 104(c) is amended to change financial reporting requirements, with the Comptroller General determining compliance annually. Non-compliance results in Board instructions to the Director. The Board instructs the Director to correct deficiencies and may replace the Director if not promptly corrected. Funding for the Board comes from non-Federal sources and grant programs. Statewide Congressional Award Councils are subject to amended regulations. Each Statewide Council established under this section may receive contributions for the Program and use them accordingly. The Board will ensure proper financial management methods for these funds. Statewide Councils must comply with specific regulations. Amendments are made to the Congressional Award Act regarding contracting, use of funds for scholarships, and the incorporation of a nonprofit corporation. The Board will establish a nonprofit corporation called the Congressional Award Foundation to assist in carrying out the Congressional Award Program. The Foundation's Board of Directors will consist of members appointed by the Board, with the Director serving as a nonvoting member. The Congressional Award Foundation will have the same authority as the Board. Directors, officers, or employees cannot receive compensation from both the Corporation and the Board. Section 108 of the Congressional Award Act is amended to change the termination date to October 1, 2013. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
