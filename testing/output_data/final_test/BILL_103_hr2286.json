The Congress finds that the United States' failure to manage solid waste has led to critical problems, emphasizing the importance of recycling to reduce municipal waste, save energy, and prevent depletion of landfill space. Comprehensive recycling programs are essential for successful waste management. The importance of comprehensive recycling programs is highlighted as the most cost-effective and efficient method to meet recycling goals. Limited approaches may hinder national efforts, and responsibility for recycling should be shared by all consumers. All Americans should have access to recycling opportunities in their community. The Act aims to require each State to develop and implement recycling programs. The Act aims to require each State to develop and implement a comprehensive recycling plan to eventually recycle at least 25 percent of its municipal waste stream. The Act establishes a national goal of recycling municipal waste to the maximum extent practicable, in line with market demand for recycled materials. Technical assistance will be provided. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will provide technical assistance and guidance to States on recycling methods and opportunities, including developing elements for effective State recycling programs. This program includes approaches for waste separation, drop-off centers, and information exchange services for successful recycling programs. The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency will provide technical assistance and guidance to States on recycling methods and opportunities, including planning and information exchange services for the creation of State and regional information clearinghouses on markets for secondary materials and recycled goods.

Program components include specific elements. State programs must include provisions for material separation and recycling, yard waste separation, and notice requirements. Materials like metal cans, glass, paper, and plastic containers must be separated for recycling. Yard waste must be separated unless composted. States or their subdivisions must provide notice regarding these requirements. In addition to material separation and recycling requirements, states must establish public education programs on recycling. Preference should be given to businesses engaged in recycling activities. States can comply with the section by implementing alternative collection programs like curbside or drop-off centers. The State and its political subdivisions must meet the requirements of this Act. Within 2 years of this Act's enactment, states must include a recycling program in their solid waste management plan. Once approved by the EPA Administrator, states can apply for federal grants to implement the program. Additionally, a new section on recycling grants is added to the Solid Waste Disposal Act. The Administrator will provide grants to States for implementing recycling programs approved under the Comprehensive Recycling Act of 1993, focusing on promoting recycling techniques. Specific consideration will be given to rural areas' needs for material collection, separation, and transportation, as well as the availability of recyclers and markets.
