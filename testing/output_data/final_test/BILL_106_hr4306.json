    "content": "The \"Commercial Competitiveness and Labor Rights in China Act of 2000\" includes provisions on rule of law programs, administrative authorities, prohibition of human rights abuses, and authorization of appropriations. The United States and China signed a bilateral agreement in 1999 for China's accession to the World Trade Organization. China made concessions to eliminate trade barriers and must amend laws to comply with international trade rules. The China-WTO Agreement does not require China to make changes in the labor rights area, despite the need for independent labor unions and resources to inform workers of their rights. The United States provides some assistance to promote the rule of law in China but lacks authorization to help Chinese officials write laws to implement their WTO obligations. Major US trade competitors like the EU, Japan, France, Germany, Canada, and Australia have initiated rule of law programs in China to enhance the administration of commercial law and assist in aligning trade laws with WTO requirements. It is crucial for the US to actively engage in similar efforts. The United States must protect its concessions from China regarding WTO membership by ensuring fair and transparent laws and revising labor legislation to meet international standards. The Commercial Law Development Division has been active in this effort for the past eight years. The United States Department of Commerce's Development Division has sent lawyers to developing countries to help improve laws and institutions for economic reform and trade compliance. Specifically, programs are being extended in China to enhance commercial and labor rule of law, aiming to strengthen justice administration, labor rights, and pave the way for further reforms. The United States Department of Commerce's Development Division is extending programs in China to enhance commercial and labor rule of law, aiming to strengthen justice administration and labor rights. The United States Department of Commerce is expanding programs in China to improve commercial and labor rule of law. The program involves rule of law training and technical assistance for commercial activities, with guidance from the Secretary of State to ensure integration into U.S. foreign policy. Additionally, a separate program for labor rule of law training and technical assistance is being established by the Secretary of State in consultation with the Secretary of Labor. The program authorized by the Secretary of State in China includes rule of law training and technical assistance related to labor activities. Assistance will not be provided to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. Activities may include seminars, workshops, drafting of codes, legal training, publications, financing for NGOs, and funding for travel to provide and receive training. SEC. 4. ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITIES. The Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of State can use authorities from the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and the Foreign Service Act of 1980 for authorized programs. SEC. 5. PROHIBITION ON HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES. Funding cannot be given to entities in China involved in human rights violations if credible evidence exists. SEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization of appropriations for the Commercial Law Program under the Secretary of Commerce and the Labor Law Program under the Secretary of State for fiscal year 2001 and subsequent years. Funds can be used without restriction by other laws."
