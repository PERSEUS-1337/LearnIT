    "content": "President Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 into law on February 17, 2009. The ARRA is estimated to cost $787 billion over 10 years, with most of the budget authority allocated for FY2009-FY2010. It was passed by the House and Senate in February 2009 as a response to the economic recession. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, signed by President Obama in February 2009, is a $787 billion economic stimulus package focused on boosting individual and business economic activity through government spending on infrastructure programs, tax incentives, and benefits. $308 billion of the total amount is allocated for discretionary spending on infrastructure development, benefits programs, and government loan and grant programs. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, a $787 billion economic stimulus package, allocates $26.6 billion for agriculture, nutrition, and rural programs. This funding supplements existing programs and is part of the overall stimulus package aimed at boosting economic activity. The spending will be tracked online at http://www.recovery.gov. The $26.6 billion allocated for agriculture, nutrition, and rural programs in the stimulus package includes $20.8 billion for nutrition assistance programs, a significant increase in food stamp benefits, $4.4 billion for rural development, $2.5 billion for rural broadband, and $744 million for farmer assistance programs. The USDA receives funding for various programs including farm loans, conservation, facilities maintenance, and computer infrastructure. The USDA Office of Inspector General receives funding for increased oversight. Trade Adjustment Assistance for Farmers is reauthorized. The conference agreement combines provisions from the House and Senate bills for nutrition programs, rural broadband, and conservation. Funding amounts for rural development programs are reduced to accommodate the Senate bill. The Senate bill allocated broadband funds to the Department of Commerce with a focus on rural areas. USDA facilities and computer infrastructure funding followed Senate levels, reducing requested Farm Service Agency computer improvements. Farmer assistance programs were included, but farm loan program supplements were reduced. The ARRA did not fund USDA biorefinery programs, Rural Energy for America Program, or agricultural research grants. It also excluded language on \"downer\" cattle and increased spending on domestic food assistance programs. The Congressional Budget Office estimates $11.5 billion in new spending on domestic food assistance programs in the first two years and $20.8 billion over ten years. The funding would primarily go towards increased benefits, relaxed eligibility standards, and administrative costs for programs like SNAP and nutrition assistance grants for Puerto Rico and American Samoa. Other programs included in the ARRA are WIC, nutrition programs for seniors, school meal equipment assistance, TEFAP, and FDPIR. The House-passed version of the new law included eight items that would have increased spending on domestic food assistance programs, totaling $11.4 billion in the first two years and $21.2 billion over ten years. The majority of spending would have gone to added benefits, loosened eligibility standards, and administrative costs under SNAP, along with more funding for nutrition assistance grants for Puerto Rico and American Samoa. Other programs included in the House bill were management information system support for the WIC program, Older Americans Act nutrition programs, child nutrition after-school efforts, and TEFAP. The Senate-approved version covered seven of the eight areas touched on by the House and added three new items affecting equipment assistance. Under the ARRA, SNAP benefits will increase significantly, with time limits on eligibility for able-bodied adults without dependents suspended. State agencies operating SNAP will receive extra administrative funding to help low-income households cover their food costs. Monthly allotments are based on the estimated cost of a minimally adequate diet. The ARRA significantly raises SNAP benefits by 13.6% across the board, effective in April 2009. This increase is based on the inflation-indexed cost of USDA's Thrifty Food Plan, providing additional monthly benefits for recipient households. The ARRA will increase SNAP benefits by 13.6% across the board, with varying amounts based on household size. This will boost average household benefits by about 20% and also raise nutrition assistance grants for Puerto Rico and American Samoa. States are protected from penalties for mistakes under the new benefit provisions. The new SNAP benefits are estimated to cost $9.9 billion for FY2009-FY2010. The CBO estimates that new SNAP benefits will cost $9.9 billion for FY2009-FY2010, significantly increasing the anticipated $100 billion under pre-ARRA law. Additional spending for Puerto Rico and American Samoa is expected to total $375 million for FY2009-FY2010. The House and Senate proposed different approaches to increasing SNAP benefits, with the Senate suggesting an immediate 85% increase in base Thrifty Food Plan amounts for one month. In FY2010 and FY2011, basic benefits would have remained 12% higher until normal indexing rules caught up. Nutrition assistance grants for Puerto Rico would have also been increased by 12% through FY2011. In FY2009 and FY2010, the Senate initiatives were expected to cost $12.5 billion, significantly more than the House provisions. SNAP eligibility for able-bodied adults without dependents is limited to 3 months out of every 36 months. The ARRA suspended this requirement for those unable to find a job through FY2010. CBO estimates the cost of this suspension at $300 million through FY2010. The new law provides additional federal funding for SNAP administrative costs, totaling $145 million in FY2009 and $150 million in FY2010. This funding is distributed based on state participation levels without requiring state matching funds. Some funds are allocated for federal oversight and evaluation. The WIC program provides special vouchers for food purchases to lower-income pregnant/postpartum women, infants, and children at \"nutritional risk\" and offers nutrition education, medical referral, and breastfeeding initiatives. State agencies implementing WIC have called for support for new management information systems to improve benefits delivery efficiency. The ARRA provides $400 million for a contingency reserve and $100 million for WIC state agencies' management information system expansions/upgrades. The House and Senate included funding for WIC management information systems in system expansions/upgrades. The ARRA provides $100 million for Older Americans Act nutrition programs, with allocations for congregate meal services, home-delivered meal services, and Native American nutrition services. The House bill proposed a total of $200 million for FY2009 and FY2010. The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) has $200 million available for FY2009 and FY2010, administered by the Administration on Aging. It buys food commodities for emergency providers like food banks and soup kitchens. TEFAP also provides grants for distribution and storage costs. Additional $150 million is available through FY2010 for commodity acquisitions and distribution/storage costs. The new law allocates $100 million to states for competitive grants to schools for food service equipment. The House bill lacked a similar amendment, and a Senate provision for enhancing states' commodity distribution systems was omitted. The Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations provides monthly food packages instead of SNAP benefits, with federal support covering commodity costs and administrative expenses. An additional $5 million is available for FDPIR facility improvements under the enacted ARRA. The ARRA allocates an extra $5 million for FDPIR costs related to facility improvements and equipment upgrades. The House bill did not include a similar provision. Child nutrition laws provide federal subsidies for snacks served in after-school programs. Some states receive federal payments for suppers served to lower-income children. The House proposed expanding this rule nationwide at a cost of $50 million initially. The Senate bill and the new law do not include this proposal. About 55% of the estimated new spending is related to this provision. The new law does not have a comparable proposal to the House bill regarding nutrition assistance provisions. Approximately 55% of the estimated new spending on ARRA's nutrition assistance is expected in FY2009 and FY2010, similar to the House bill but lower than the Senate. There may be additional spending beyond FY2010 due to various factors, such as the effects of SNAP benefit boosts and the ABAWD rule suspension. The enacted ARRA authorizes $4.36 billion in supplemental budget authority over two years for various rural development loan and grant programs, which is less than the Senate and House proposals. The total program level is $24.37 billion, with significant outlays expected beyond FY2010. Most documents present cost estimates through FY2019, while the focus here is on spending through FY2010. The enacted ARRA authorizes $24.37 billion in budget authority over two years for rural development programs, with rural broadband and rural water projects receiving the majority of funding. Rural housing also receives a significant portion of the budget. The ARRA allocates $2.5 billion for rural broadband loans and grants administered by the Rural Utilities Service. The ARRA authorizes $6.50 billion in broadband funding for TOP, with half for rural projects. Senate funding to be administered by TOP, while House bill proposes $2.8 billion for RUS. Funding supports broadband loans and grants. Priority for projects in rural areas without sufficient access to high-speed broadband. The ARRA prioritizes projects that offer multiple service providers, reach the most rural residents without broadband, involve borrowers from rural telephone loan programs, and can start quickly. Unlike the Senate bill, no 20% matching amount is required. The House committee projects $5.5 billion for rural broadband development, with an estimated $4.9 billion in loans and grants. It aims to provide new services to 7,600 rural communities, 3.6 million residents and businesses, and create 119,000 jobs. The ARRA allocates funding for expanding public computing capacity, encouraging broadband adoption, and carrying out a broadband mapping project. It also provides funding for the Digital Television converter box program. CBO estimates that rural broadband outlays will range from $300 million to $600 million annually from FY2010 to FY2015. The enacted law provides significant support for rural broadband development, with funding levels 20-30 times higher than previous years. Questions may arise about the capacity of federal agencies to manage the grant and loan process effectively, given the proposed funding increases. USDA's RUS has experience managing telecommunication loans and grants, but the size and speed of the proposed expansion could pose challenges. The 2002 farm bill provision in the Senate bill led to rural broadband stimulus funding being placed in the Department of Commerce. The program requirements were revised after initial loan guarantees were made, and an education program was initiated for potential providers. The program was reauthorized in the 2008 farm bill. The U.S. Department of Commerce's NTIA faces challenges in overseeing the new $4.7 billion program of loans and grants, as the TOP has not been funded since 2004. The ARRA does not include broadband investment tax credits or funding for the rural distance learning and telemedicine program. The ARRA does not fund the rural distance learning and telemedicine program administered by RUS. It authorizes $1.380 billion for USDA water and waste water programs, supporting $3.8 billion in loans and grants for rural water projects. The ARRA authorizes $200 million in supplemental budget authority for rural housing, supporting $11.5 billion of direct and guaranteed loans. $10.5 billion is for Section 502 guaranteed single-family home loans, and $1.0 billion is for Section 502 direct single-family home loans. The House bill proposed $500 million for rural housing, while $18 billion was proposed for loan guarantees and $4 billion for direct loans. The ARRA authorizes $200 million for rural housing, supporting $11.5 billion of direct and guaranteed loans. Section 502 loans help low-income individuals purchase homes in rural areas for various purposes. There was a $2.6 billion backlog of unfunded applications in 2008. The enacted ARRA does not include the House measure for rural housing assistance under the SHOP program. The Community Facilities loan and grant program is administered by USDA's Rural Housing Service. The Rural Housing Service administers the Community Facilities loan and grant program, providing support for essential community facilities in rural areas. The ARRA authorizes $130 million in supplemental budget authority for this program. Despite a $70 million decrease from the proposed House measure, the authorized funding would still support a similar program level. In FY2008, the community facilities account received about $68 million in budget authority. Applications for these facilities exceed the annual appropriations available. The Rural Business-Cooperative Service supports rural business development with $1.2 billion in pending loan and grant applications. The enacted law authorizes $150 million for Business and Industry Guaranteed loans and Rural Business Enterprise Grants, 50% more than the House bill. Private sector loans backed by federal guarantees are crucial for rural businesses in the current tight credit market. The ARRA does not provide funding for biorefinery loans or the Rural Energy for America Program. The Senate bill proposed funding of $200 million for biorefinery loans and $50 million for the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP). REAP provides loans and grants for energy efficiency and renewable energy development for agricultural producers and rural small businesses. Other proposed funding in the bills could also benefit rural areas, including tax reductions, small business tax credits, economic development assistance, and funds for infrastructure improvements. The enacted ARRA contains $744 million to directly assist farmers. The enacted ARRA provides $744 million to assist farmers, including $674 million for crop disaster programs like SURE, $50 million for aquaculture feed price assistance, and $20 million for farm operating loans. The ARRA allows producers who did not enroll in federal crop insurance to participate in SURE for 2008, potentially receiving higher payments. CBO estimates these provisions would cost about $674 million. The 2008 farm bill authorized a $3.8 billion trust fund for agricultural disaster assistance, including the SURE program for crop producers. Congress has provided ad hoc disaster assistance to farmers and ranchers from 1988 to 2007. The ARRA provides $674 million for crop disaster programs like SURE. The ARRA allows crop producers who did not enroll in crop insurance or NAP for 2008 to participate in the SURE program by paying a $100 administrative fee. This fee must be paid within 90 days of the conference agreement enactment and producers must commit to purchasing crop insurance or NAP coverage for the next crop year. The law also adjusts the payment formula to potentially provide higher SURE payments for all producers. The ARRA authorizes a $50 million grant program for aquaculture producers to compensate for high feed prices in 2008. Grants will be prorated by the amount of aquaculture feed used by each state in 2007 and must be distributed within 60 days to eligible recipients. States must report to USDA on how the assistance was provided within 30 days after disbursement. The ARRA authorizes a $50 million grant program for aquaculture producers to compensate for high feed prices in 2008. Recipients must file a report to USDA on how the assistance was provided within 30 days after disbursement. Any aquaculture producer who receives a grant under this provision would be ineligible for disaster assistance under the 2008 farm bill-authorized Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm Raised Fish program. The enacted ARRA includes $20 million in budget authority for the USDA Farm Service Agency to support $173 million in direct farm operating loans, which is 80% less than the Senate-passed bill. The Farm Service Agency (FSA) provides loans to farmers and ranchers who cannot get credit from commercial lenders, acting as a \"lender of last resort.\" Their regular budget for farm loans is around $150 million to support $3.5 billion in loans. The loans supported by the stimulus are focused on direct farm operating loans due to increasing demand, especially for buying seed, fertilizer, and fuel. FSA is anticipating significantly higher demand for loans in FY2009. The Farm Service Agency (FSA) is facing a funding shortage for farm loans in FY2009 due to increased demand, partially alleviated by stimulus funding. The global financial crisis is impacting farmers and lenders, with falling commodity prices and a projected 20% decline in net farm income for 2009. Default rates for farm lenders are rising since mid-2008. The Farm Credit System and agricultural loan delinquency have increased since mid-2008, with nonperforming loans tripling. Agricultural lenders, including the Farm Credit System, are facing challenges accessing capital due to the financial crisis. The Farm Credit System has been impacted by the financial crisis, affecting its ability to sell bonds for loans. Agricultural lenders are expected to tighten credit standards, requiring more documentation and oversight. USDA conservation programs receive $348 million in funding, with a focus on watershed and flood prevention projects. The ARRA allocates $145 million for watershed and flood prevention construction projects, $145 million for floodplain easements, and $50 million for dam rehabilitation. Additionally, $8 million is provided for technical assistance for farm bill programs. State and local governments are not eligible for benefits in the Conservation Reserve Program. The funding for Watershed and Flood Prevention Operations will support projects on private lands. The costs of watershed projects are shared with local sponsors and public agencies. The watershed project costs are shared with local sponsors, states, and/or other public agencies. Regular appropriations for the program reached a high of $200 million in FY2002 and have declined steadily to $30 million in FY2008. Once a locally sponsored project completes required planning and environmental assessments, and signs an agreement with NRCS, it is considered an authorized watershed project and is eligible for funding. Currently there are over 300 unfunded authorized watershed projects totaling $1.28 billion. The $145 million in ARRA will alleviate only a small portion of the unfunded projects, but it will still provide greater funding than recent years' appropriations. The remaining $145 million of the total $290 million for watershed protection would be used to purchase floodplain easements under the authority of the Emergency Watershed Protection (EWP) program. Landowners voluntarily offer to sell NRCS permanent conservation easements for floodplain restoration and enhancement. NRCS will prioritize projects nationwide based on cost-effectiveness for public safety, flood protection, and environmental benefit. The enacted ARRA provides $50 million to NRCS for the Watershed Rehabilitation Program. The ARRA provides $50 million to NRCS for the Watershed Rehabilitation Program, which helps rehabilitate aging dams to prevent threats to downstream communities. The program received $20 million in FY2008 and is authorized for $100 million in FY2009. USDA estimates over 4,300 dams will need rehabilitation by 2015. 28 states requested $42 million for 95 projects in FY2009, including assessments of 102 dams. The funding in ARRA, combined with annual appropriations and mandatory funding, would cover the proposed projects. The proposed projects, including dam assessments, may not be fully funded in FY2009 due to limitations on mandatory program funding. The ARRA allows the use of Commodity Credit Corporation funds for administrative expenses and technical assistance. Conservation programs would benefit from this provision. The ARRA allows the use of Commodity Credit Corporation funds for administrative expenses and technical assistance, benefiting conservation programs by providing $8 million for FY2009-FY2010. The Senate bill aimed to extend this provision to FY2011-FY2019 at an additional cost of $26 million, but it did not pass. Public entities were previously eligible for Conservation Reserve Program payments, but a 2008 farm bill amendment restricted their access to farm commodity subsidies and conservation benefits. The ARRA allocated $250 million for infrastructure projects within USDA, with $200 million designated for facility maintenance and improvements. This includes $176 million for Agricultural Research Service facilities and $24 million for USDA headquarters. The Senate bill had a similar allocation for facility repairs, while the House bill had higher funding levels. The enacted law allocated $176 million for ARS facilities, $33 million less than the House bill, and $24 million for headquarters improvements, $20 million less than the House bill. Additionally, $50 million is designated for modernizing the FSA's IT system, $4 million less than the Senate-passed amount and $195 million less than the House version. These projects aim to improve USDA's services for farmers and require contracts with private companies for repairs and equipment purchases. The enacted ARRA provides $50 million to the Farm Service Agency (FSA) for maintaining and modernizing its information technology systems, with future appropriations needed for further modernization plans. FSA has struggled with an outdated mainframe computer system, impacting its service to farmers. The Farm Service Agency (FSA) has faced challenges with an outdated mainframe computer system, affecting its service to farmers. Computer malfunctions have disrupted enrollment and verification processes at county offices. Despite efforts to secure increased funding for computers, the problems persist. The 2008 farm bill's new requirements are expected to further strain the antiquated system. USDA developed a \"stabilization and modernization\" plan after the 2007 system failures to address these issues. The Farm Service Agency (FSA) developed a stabilization plan to shore up the current computer system and a modernization plan called MIDAS to replace outdated hardware. The stabilization plan required $87 million in additional funding through FY2010, while MIDAS was estimated to cost $305 million over three years. The Bush Administration requested $172 million for FSA computers in FY2009, including funds for stabilization, MIDAS costs, and implementing the 2008 farm bill. The House-passed H.R. 1 allocated $245 million to fund the stabilization plan and MIDAS implementation costs for FY2009-FY2010. The enacted ARRA provided $176 million for critical deferred maintenance projects for the Agricultural Research Service (ARS). The House-passed bill allocated $209 million to fully fund critical deferred maintenance projects identified by ARS, totaling $315 million. The enacted ARRA provided $24 million for construction, repair, and improvement projects at USDA's headquarters in Washington, D.C., focusing on priority maintenance, repair, and modernization investments. Additionally, $22.5 million was allocated for additional funding for USDA. The enacted ARRA provides $22.5 million in additional funding for the USDA Office of Inspector General (OIG) for oversight and audit activities related to the stimulus package spending until FY2013. This represents about a 6% increase for the USDA OIG if divided equally over five fiscal years. The ARRA also temporarily amends the Trade Adjustment Assistance for Farmers (TAAF) program, authorizing funding through December 31, 2010. The Trade Adjustment Assistance for Farmers (TAAF) program aims to help agricultural producers affected by declining commodity prices due to increased imports. Eligible producers must complete training to qualify for financial assistance to improve competitiveness. The enacted ARRA does not provide funding for competitive research grants at USDA. The Senate-passed bill included $50 million for competitive research grants at USDA, specifically for renewable fuels and emerging agricultural production technologies. The House bill did not include this funding. Animal activists were concerned about mistreatment of animals at livestock markets and slaughterhouses, but a provision addressing this issue was deleted by House-Senate conferees. Some food safety advocates support measures to prevent diseased animals from entering the food supply, while most animal producers oppose such bills. The Senate bill aimed to prohibit the use of federal funds for nonambulatory disabled cattle for human food, removing an economic incentive for slaughter. This provision was not included in the House-passed version of the stimulus package. The Senate's version of the stimulus package aimed to ban nonambulatory disabled livestock from entering the food supply, with exceptions for cattle under 500 pounds or less than five months old. USDA's meat inspection regulations define these animals as unable to rise or walk due to various conditions, including BSE prevention."
