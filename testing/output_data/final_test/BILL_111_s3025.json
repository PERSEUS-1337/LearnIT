    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Columbia River Restoration Act of 2010\". The Columbia River is the largest river in the Pacific Northwest and the fourth largest in the US by volume. Its drainage basin covers 259,000 square miles, extending into 7 states and British Columbia, Canada. The river system was historically the largest salmon producer globally, with annual returns peaking at 30 million fish. The Lower Columbia River Estuary, stretching 146 miles from the Bonneville Dam to the Pacific Ocean, faces degradation due to contaminants like PCBs and PAHs in salmon tissue. Legacy pollutants like DDT and PCBs are still found in the river, sediments, and juvenile Chinook salmon, along with pesticides like atrazine and simazine that can impact salmon behavior. Emerging contaminants like hormone disruptors from pharmaceutical and personal care products have been found in river water and juvenile male salmon in the Middle and Upper Columbia River Basin. The Environmental Protection Agency's Columbia River Basin Fish Contaminant Survey detected 92 priority pollutants in fish consumed by the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs, including PCBs, dioxins, furans, arsenic, mercury, and DDE. The Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs, Yakama Nation, Umatilla Indian Reservation, and Nez Perce Tribe consume significantly more fish than the national average. The Hanford Nuclear Reservation poses a contamination risk in the Middle Columbia Basin, with toxic flame retardants found in sediments. Contamination in the Middle and Upper Columbia River Basin directly impacts water and habitat quality. Investments in habitat restoration and toxics reduction in the Middle and Upper Columbia River Basin can benefit fish and wildlife throughout the entire basin. The EPA, along with the Governors of Oregon and Washington, established the Lower Columbia River Estuary Partnership in 1995 to coordinate efforts for the lower river, advance ecosystem science, and achieve environmental results. The Estuary Partnership, part of the National Estuary Program, includes key Federal agencies for management and collaboration. The Columbia River Basin, designated as an \"Estuary of National Significance\" by the EPA in 1995 and a \"Large Aquatic Ecosystem\" in 2006, has a 2-State partnership involving key Federal agencies like the EPA, NOAA, USGS, and Army Corps of Engineers. The partnership focuses on habitat restoration, data compilation, and achieving Federal goals. Despite progress in habitat protection and environmental education, degradation and contaminants in the Columbia River Basin continue to harm fish, wildlife, and humans. The challenges faced by threatened and endangered salmon and steelhead species are exacerbated by degraded river conditions. Various conservation and recovery plans have been implemented to address these issues. The Idaho, and Washington Recovery Plans, along with the \"Biological Opinion for the Federal Columbia River Power System (FCRPS)\" and the \"EPA Columbia Basin State of the River Report for Toxics\" consistently highlight habitat loss and toxic contamination as threats to fish and wildlife in the Columbia River Basin. SEC. 123. COLUMBIA RIVER is added to Title I of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, addressing issues in the Columbia River Basin. The definitions in this section include the 'Action Plan' for toxics reduction in the Columbia River Basin, the 'Comprehensive Plan' for conservation and management in the Estuary Partnership, and the 'Estuary Partnership' itself. The Environmental Protection Agency establishes the Columbia River Program, defining the Lower Columbia River and Estuary as the region from Bonneville Dam to the Pacific Ocean, and the Middle and Upper Columbia River Basin as the region above Bonneville Dam. The Team Leader appointed under subsection (b) leads the program team. The Environmental Protection Agency establishes a Columbia River Program Team in Region 10. The Team Leader appointed must have expertise in the Columbia River Basin to implement projects. The Administrator delegates authority and provides necessary staff. The Team Leader, acting on behalf of the Administrator, carries out duties outlined in the section. The Administrator, through the Team Leader, supports the implementation and coordination of the Action Plan and Comprehensive Plan for the Columbia River Basin. Updates to the plans are made in consultation with relevant stakeholders, and funding and grants are provided. The Administrator supports the implementation of the Action Plan and Comprehensive Plan for the Columbia River Basin by providing funding, grants, and promoting innovative methodologies and technologies. Coordination of federal government functions related to water quality improvements is also emphasized. The Action Plan for the Columbia River Basin includes water quality improvements, toxics reduction, restoration of wetlands, rivers, and estuaries, nearshore and endangered species recovery, and environmental education. Coordination with federal agencies, state agencies, tribal governments, universities, and the Estuary Partnership is essential for research and planning projects. Progress tracking towards the identified goals is also a key aspect. The Action Plan and Comprehensive Plan for the Columbia River Basin involve tracking progress towards goals by implementing projects, programs, and monitoring systems. Coordination and reporting of environmental data are done in line with Estuary Partnership methodologies, including making data available to the public in a timely manner. The Administrator, through the Team Leader, may use various methods to implement duties related to collecting and sharing environmental information on the Lower Columbia River and Estuary. A report summarizing progress in implementing the Action Plan and Comprehensive Plan must be submitted to Congress biennially. The report summarizes progress in implementing the Action Plan and Comprehensive Plan for the Columbia River Basin, including modifications and recommendations for implementation. It also outlines the roles and progress of Federal agencies involved in meeting the goals and objectives. The Administrator, in consultation with the Estuary Partnership, oversees the implementation of the plans. The Team Leader, in consultation with the Estuary Partnership, will carry out projects, programs, and studies to implement the Action Plan and Comprehensive Plan. Priority projects identified by the Estuary Partnership will receive special emphasis. The Administrator is authorized to make grants for implementing the plans. The Administrator, through the Team Leader, will allocate funds for the Estuary Partnership to manage the Comprehensive Plan, prioritize projects in the Columbia River Basin, and coordinate projects in the Middle and Upper Columbia River Basin. Up to 5% of the funds will be used for project management and administration. The Federal share of costs for grants under this section is 75%, with the possibility of an increase as determined by the Administrator. The President must include information on Federal agencies involved in protecting and restoring the Columbia River Basin in the annual budget submission to Congress. The annual budget submission to Congress must include details on protection and restoration projects, programs, and studies for the Columbia River Basin. It should also describe the Federal role in the development and implementation of the Action Plan and the Comprehensive Plan, including specific projects and agencies involved. Authorization of Appropriations: $40,000,000 is authorized for the Administrator annually from 2011 to 2016 to implement the Action Plan and Comprehensive Plan."
