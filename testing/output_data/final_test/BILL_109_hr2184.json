    "content": "The Nursing School Capacity Act of 2005 may be cited as such. Key findings are outlined in the Act. The Nursing School Capacity Act of 2005 identifies the need for a national study to address constraints in graduating enough nurses to meet healthcare needs. The shortage of qualified nurses has impacted the US healthcare system, with varying success in state programs to recruit and retain nurses. Schools of nursing struggle to produce enough graduates, compounded by an aging nursing workforce. In 2004, 125,000 qualified nursing applicants were rejected due to faculty shortage and lack of capacity. A study will be conducted regarding constraints on nursing schools. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will request the Institute of Medicine to conduct a study on constraints faced by nursing schools in admitting and graduating enough registered nurses for patient safety. Recommendations will be developed to address these constraints on a short-term and long-term basis, including trends in nursing school applications. The study will analyze trends in nursing school applications, the number and characteristics of enrolled students, retention rates, and graduates compared to the projected need for registered nurses. It will also examine the demographic characteristics of nurses pursuing graduate education but not faculty positions, along with the reasons for this choice. The study will analyze trends in nursing school applications, enrolled students, retention rates, and graduates compared to the projected need for registered nurses. It will also examine the satisfaction levels of entry-level graduates, nurse managers, and administrators with their educational preparation and performance in the nursing workforce. The workplace structures and characteristics, along with the number of nurses in faculty positions, impact nurses' career paths after graduate education. The use of innovative technologies in nursing education could enhance schools' ability to train qualified nurses. Recommendations may include legislative changes to recruit and retain nurses, and improve education resources. The Secretary will conduct a study to address the nursing shortage by considering perspectives of nurses, physicians, faculty, administrators, health plans, and consumers. Relevant agencies and organizations will be consulted for expertise on the issue. The nursing shortage study will consult various agencies and organizations, including the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, American Academy of Nursing, American Nurses Association, and others. The Secretary will ensure a report is provided within 18 months of the Act's enactment. The Act mandates a study on nursing shortage to be conducted by the Institute or another private entity if declined. A report with findings and recommendations will be submitted to the Secretary and relevant committees. Appropriations are authorized for the study. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. The term \"Institute\" refers to the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences.
