The Congress enacted privacy protections in 1984 to safeguard the personal privacy of American consumers using cable television services, recognizing the threat posed by technology collecting personal information. Cable operators are required to adhere to these rules. The Video Privacy Protection Act prohibits disclosing personal information about video rentals without consent. New technology similar to cable and video services must also protect consumer privacy. Direct broadcast satellite providers like DirecTV and Echostar, along with digital video recording services like Tivo and Replay TV, compete with cable operators by offering similar services and gathering information on consumer viewing habits. Direct broadcast satellite providers and digital video recording services compete with cable operators by offering similar services. Currently, competitors using these technologies are not required to comply with privacy protections that apply only to cable operators. However, it is argued that privacy protections should be consistently applied to all providers, regardless of the technology they use. While recording services have not announced plans to gather personal data from consumers, it is argued that all providers should have comparable privacy protections for American consumers. SEC. 715.
