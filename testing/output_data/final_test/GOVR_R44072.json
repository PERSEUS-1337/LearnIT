    "content": "China has been conducting extensive land reclamation and construction on reefs in the Spratly island chain in the South China Sea since September 2013. This has raised concerns in the United States and Asia. The reclamation work has significantly increased the size of some land features and created new artificial islands. China announced plans to complete reclamation work and focus on building facilities on the newly created islands. The disputed areas under reclamation include Cuarteron Reef, Fiery Cross Reef, Gaven Reef, Hughes Reef, Johnson South Reef, Mischief Reef, and Subi Reef. China's extensive land reclamation and construction on reefs in the Spratly island chain in the South China Sea has raised concerns. At least three reefs are within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone, with China creating over 2,000 acres of land in the past 18 months. China has built harbors, radar towers, an airstrip, and other facilities on the artificial islands, with artillery vehicles also identified. This activity is part of China's assertive actions in the region. China's reclamation activity on artificial islands in the South China Sea is part of its assertive actions to strengthen sovereignty claims. These actions, including patrols, blockades, fishing bans, and infrastructure improvements, have heightened tensions and raised the potential for military conflict in the region. China's reclamation activity in the South China Sea has raised tensions due to its scale, which is larger than that of other claimants in the region. The U.S. and other observers argue that China's actions are inconsistent with the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea. In a speech on May 30, 2015, Secretary of Defense Carter criticized China's actions in the South China Sea, stating that they go against international rules and norms. The United States is concerned about China's land reclamation activities in the region and questions the legality and implications of these actions. Harry Harris, Jr., also raised doubts about China's intentions with its man-made islands. China's extensive reclamation activities in the South China Sea have raised concerns about their legality and implications. The People's Liberation Army (PLA) and other Chinese institutions are gaining new capabilities through this reclamation. The United States is evaluating the impact on its interests, including freedom of navigation and diplomatic efforts to reduce tensions in the region. Despite other countries also reclaiming land features, China's activities are the most extensive. The appropriate responses for the United States are being considered, with consultations from government and outside experts. China's reclamation activities in the South China Sea are raising concerns about their legality. The sovereignty over the disputed features is not settled, making it difficult to judge the legality of the reclamation. Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), reclamation does not allow China to claim broader 200-nautical-mile Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs) around the reclaimed landmasses. China can only claim territorial waters extending 12 nautical miles from the features if they were above water at all times before reclamation began. China's reclamation activities in the South China Sea have raised concerns about their legality. China has not asserted new legal claims based on its artificial island building, confining the work to features it already occupied. This violates the spirit of the 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea and complicates discussions on a potential Code of Conduct. The reclamation includes areas under consideration in an ongoing UNCLOS arbitration case initiated by the Philippines. China's reclamation efforts in the South China Sea could enhance its military capabilities, including the potential use of reclamation sites for A2/AD systems. China's improved dredging capabilities enable it to undertake such work further from its mainland. The Philippines has requested a ruling on the legal status of these features, which could clarify rights in the region. China's reclamation and construction activity in the South China Sea raises questions about its legality, potential rights claims, and impact on navigation rights of other parties. International law, governed by UNCLOS, defines maritime zones and rights of coastal states. China, Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Brunei are UNCLOS parties, with the US abiding by its terms for maritime rights. The US, not a UNCLOS party, asserts it follows most convention terms for claiming maritime rights amidst disputes. The United States takes no position on specific sovereignty questions in maritime disputes but urges parties to resolve them peacefully according to international law. UNCLOS recognizes coastal states' rights to claim territorial sea extending up to 12 nautical miles and establish a contiguous zone for control. The contiguous zone can extend up to 24 nautical miles from the coast, allowing control over customs, fiscal, immigration, and sanitary laws. The Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) grants a coastal state sovereign rights up to 200 nautical miles for exploring and exploiting natural resources. The coastal state also has exclusive rights to construct and regulate artificial islands and installations. UNCLOS recognizes the legal right of every coastal state to control and exploit the continental shelf. UNCLOS grants coastal states rights to control and exploit natural resources on their continental shelf up to 350 miles from the coast. Islands under a state's sovereignty can also extend these maritime zones. Rocks unable to sustain human life are limited to a 12-mile territorial sea. Artificial islands do not establish rights in adjacent waters, and their construction within another state's EEZ raises legal questions. Land reclamation is a contrasting issue. China's land reclamation activities in the South China Sea depend on the delimitation of zones among surrounding states. China claims sovereignty over Taiwan and Itu Aba, the largest natural feature in the Spratlys chain. There is a possibility that China could argue for an EEZ linked to Itu Aba, potentially overlapping with the Philippines' EEZ. Chinese scholars refer to Itu Aba as one of eight Chinese-occupied features in the area, but China has not explicitly claimed an EEZ linked to Itu Aba. China's land reclamation activities in the South China Sea aim to establish a 12-mile territorial waters belt around features that were rocks before reclamation. The complex tidal regime complicates determining sovereignty over features, impacting maritime rights measurement. This is a concern for the Philippines. China's land reclamation in the South China Sea aims to establish territorial waters around features that were rocks before reclamation, impacting maritime rights measurement. The Philippines is concerned about the ambiguity in sovereignty claims and maritime rights, especially regarding the establishment of an EEZ. China's reclamation projects may not be illegal but could implicate its obligations under UNCLOS. China's dredging activities in the South China Sea could violate UNCLOS obligations to protect the marine environment, potentially harming coral reefs and marine life. Legal challenges based on environmental effects may be pursued without contesting maritime boundaries, improving the chances of jurisdiction being found. China's land reclamation efforts in the South China Sea potentially violate the spirit of cooperation in the DOC, making diplomatic efforts to lower tensions more challenging. These efforts could enhance China's military capabilities in the region. China's land reclamation efforts in the South China Sea could improve its military position in the region, allowing for potential combat operations and patrols. The islands in the Spratlys, located south of China's mainland, could serve as refueling and resupply locations for Chinese fishing boats, coast guard cutters, and navy ships. This military enhancement could strengthen China's stance in disputes with rival claimants in the South China Sea. China's land reclamation efforts in the South China Sea could enhance China's military presence in the region by allowing for increased maritime domain awareness through the use of radars, aircraft, and vessels stationed at the reclamation sites. These facilities could support a more frequent and effective presence of fishing boats, coast guard ships, and navy ships, potentially aiding in enforcing China's territorial claims and supporting the administration of an air defense identification zone (ADIZ) if declared. Additionally, the reclamation sites could be used for anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) systems. China's land reclamation efforts in the South China Sea could enhance its military presence by deploying A2/AD systems, radars, electronic equipment, missiles, and aircraft on the reclaimed sites. Chinese navy ships may also be stationed there, projecting China's A2/AD network further into the region. In a conflict, these sites and deployed units would be vulnerable but attacking them would require more time and effort, complicating efforts to counter China's A2/AD network. China's new military bases in the South China Sea could support amphibious operations against nearby islands. Satellite imagery shows these bases feature garrisons, gun systems, radars, helipads, runways, fuel depots, and docks. Enhanced facilities in the Spratlys could help China sustain navy, coast guard, and fishing operations in the region. China's new military bases in the South China Sea, particularly in the Spratlys, could enhance PLA Navy and China Coast Guard operations by providing facilities for resupply, repairs, and crew rotation. This would increase the time these vessels can conduct operations in the area and mitigate logistical challenges for energy exploration by Chinese companies. The new military bases in the South China Sea could help Chinese vessels by providing facilities for resupply, repairs, and crew rotation. This could also assist Chinese companies in energy exploration in the region. The presence of Chinese fishing boats in the area could impact China's ability to enforce its maritime claims. The facilities may be used to enforce territorial claims and exert pressure on vessels from other claimants. China's land reclamation in the South China Sea could enhance its defensive and offensive capabilities, allowing for deeper draft ships at outposts to expand law enforcement and naval presence. Strengthening operational capabilities may deter rivals from challenging territorial claims, but logistical challenges remain. Equipping bases in the Spratlys with radars and surveillance equipment could improve China's intelligence capabilities in the area. China's land reclamation in the South China Sea could enhance its intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities. China may operate maritime patrol and AWACS aircraft from bases in the Spratlys to improve its MDA and ISR. A senior PLA Air Force officer emphasized the need for a base in the South China Sea to support radar systems and intelligence-gathering activities, citing the search for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 as a realization of lacking air force capabilities in the region. Bases in the Spratlys could also enhance China's ability to conduct search and rescue operations. China's land reclamation in the South China Sea could enhance its intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities, including search and rescue operations. China's activities in the Spratlys could support radar systems, intelligence-gathering activities, and potentially the enforcement of an air defense identification zone. China's land reclamation in the South China Sea could lead to the deployment of long-range radars, military and advanced missile systems, and potentially an air defense identification zone (ADIZ). Stationing A2/AD systems in the Spratlys would enhance China's capabilities in the region, with the 3,000-meter runway on Fiery Cross Reef supporting refueling operations for aircraft based on Hainan Island. Reef could support refueling operations for aircraft, extending their ranges in the South China Sea. Analysts do not expect large military units at these bases, but a limited amphibious assault capability could be possible with Chinese troops stationed on the islands. However, these bases would be vulnerable to attack, especially by U.S. forces. Chinese bases in the South China Sea, built on sand foundations and protected by seawalls, could be vulnerable to attack in combat situations involving U.S. forces. These bases may struggle with repairing battle damage and resupplying from the mainland if air and sea lines of communication are cut. Destroying or disabling these bases would be more challenging for Southeast Asian countries compared to the U.S. military. The development of Fiery Cross Reef impacts regional navies' conflict contingency plans in the area. Chinese bases in the South China Sea are vulnerable to attack, but China could still use them effectively in combat situations. They may struggle with repairing damage, but could operate helicopters and STOVL aircraft from the facilities. In a conflict with Southeast Asian countries, China could launch amphibious attacks from these bases. However, resupplying troops in a contested maritime environment would be a major challenge for China. In a conflict against U.S. forces, Chinese bases in the South China Sea would create new challenges for U.S. military planners and increase risks for U.S. forces. The need to attack these sites and units would divert U.S. assets from other missions, potentially requiring modifications to U.S. war plans. China's adversary could seek to \"starve out\" troops that had taken a feature by force in a contested maritime environment. China asserts right to construction projects on its islands in the South China Sea, causing protests from Southeast Asian claimant states. The reclamation activities complicate diplomatic efforts to lower tensions, including ASEAN-China discussions and U.S.-backed proposals. In March 2015, ASEAN Secretary-General expressed concerns about China's island expansion in disputed areas, warning it affects the status quo and could lead to others showing less restraint. The Philippines announced plans to repair facilities in the Spratlys, prompting criticism from China. U.S. officials have called for all parties to exercise restraint in the region. China's reclamation work in the Spratlys began in September 2013, with intentions for military use and international public services. The Chinese government announced the end of reclamation work in June 2015. The Chinese government's response to criticism of their reclamation work in the South China Sea emphasized their right to carry out construction on their own islands and reefs. They stated that their actions do not target or affect anyone and that they will continue to uphold freedom of navigation in the region. China aims to peacefully resolve disputes through dialogue and play a constructive role in maintaining regional peace and stability. Their policy towards the neighborhood is guided by principles of sincerity, amity, mutual benefit, and inclusiveness. China's policy towards the neighborhood is guided by principles of sincerity, amity, mutual benefit, and inclusiveness. The Foreign Ministry spokesperson explained China's goals in the Spratlys as optimizing functions, improving living conditions, safeguarding territorial sovereignty, fulfilling international responsibilities, and satisfying military defense needs. China's policy towards the neighborhood is guided by principles of sincerity, amity, mutual benefit, and inclusiveness. China pledges to provide services such as disaster prevention, marine research, environmental protection, and fisheries services in the South China Sea. They assure that their activities will not harm the ecological environment. Senior Chinese officials have reiterated these intentions in various forums. China's Chief of the People's Liberation Army General Staff defended China's construction of lighthouses on reefs in the South China Sea, stating it is in line with international responsibilities. China plans to complete reclamation work soon and start building facilities to meet functional requirements. This aligns with China's policy of providing public services in the region. China's Chief of the People's Liberation Army General Staff defended China's construction activities in the South China Sea, stating they fall within China's sovereignty and are lawful. China's intentions include meeting civilian demands and fulfilling international obligations. Plans for civil facilities on artificial islands include lighthouses, radio navigation stations, and facilities for environmental observation and disaster prevention. China's construction activities in the South China Sea include plans for civil facilities on artificial islands such as lighthouses, radio navigation stations, and facilities for environmental observation and disaster prevention. China aims to meet civilian demands, fulfill international obligations, and promote international cooperation on maritime scientific research. China has not disclosed plans for military facilities or asserted new legal claims based on its artificial island building. After a U.S. military aircraft flew near the reclaimed features, China objected, citing potential security threats and the risk of miscalculation. The Chinese narratives on reclamation work in the South China Sea emphasize restraint and depict China as catching up to rival claimants who have engaged in construction and exploitation of resources. Despite China's cautious approach and adherence to agreements, neighboring countries have intensified their efforts with the support of external powers. China has intensified efforts in the South China Sea, realizing diplomatic protests are not enough to protect its interests. Chinese officials claim other claimants have illegally occupied features in the Spratly Islands, with Vietnam significantly increasing its presence in the 1990s. Vietnam's presence in the Spratly Islands grew substantially in the 1990s, with an increase in features occupied and soldiers stationed. Other claimants, including Taiwan, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Malaysia, have built airfields on features they control. China and Brunei are the only claimants without operational air bases in the Spratlys. Land reclamation has been ongoing since the 1970s, with Vietnam accused of large-scale reclamation on over 20 maritime features. Vietnam has conducted large-scale reclamation on over 20 maritime features in the Spratly Islands, building various facilities such as harbor basins, airstrips, missile bases, and more. The Philippines has constructed an airport and dock on Thitu Island. Other claimants have drilled 1,380 oil wells in the South China Sea, with China using advanced technology to rapidly develop features in the Spratlys. China has deployed a new dredger called the Tianjing, operated by Tianjin Dredging Co., for these activities. The Tianjing, a self-propelled cutter suction dredger operated by Tianjin Dredging Co., is the third largest in the world and the largest in Asia. It was designed by Shanghai Jiaotong University and Vosta LMG, built between April 2008 and January 2010. With the ability to dredge to a depth of 30 meters and move 4,500 cubic meters of material per hour, it can easily shuttle among the Spratlys reefs in the South China Sea. The Tianjing, a self-propelled cutter suction dredger, spent 193 days moving among five reefs in the Spratly Island group between September 2013 and June 2014. It blasted over 10 million cubic meters of sand and sea water onto the reefs, equivalent to three times the volume of concrete used to build the Hoover Dam. Land reclamation is a common activity worldwide, with many countries expanding their land areas through such projects. The Netherlands and Singapore are examples of countries that have expanded their land area through reclamation projects. Singapore had a legal dispute with Malaysia over a reclamation project in the Straits of Johor. Japan has built some of the largest artificial islands in harbors. China's reclamation activity in the Spratlys is extensive compared to other claimants. Vietnam has reclaimed 200,000 square meters on Spratly landmasses. Taiwan also reclaimed land on Itu Aba Island. The U.S. military used land reclamation to enlarge Johnston Atoll from 46 acres to a larger size. Johnston Atoll, located southwest of Hawaii, underwent significant reclamation work, increasing its size from 46 acres to 596 acres. This work also expanded the area of Sand Island from 10 to 22 acres and created two new islands, North and East, of 25 and 18 acres respectively. The atoll was utilized by the U.S. military until 2004 and is now managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as a National Wildlife Refuge. The larger question at hand is whether the United States has a comprehensive strategy to counter China's incremental land reclamation tactics. China's \"salami slicing\" tactics in gaining control over land features, waters, and air space in the East and South China Seas are a concern. The United States lacks a coordinated strategy to counter these tactics, as highlighted in the CRS Report R42784. Suggestions have been made to implement a stronger strategy in response to China's activities. The United States has expressed strong concerns about China's land reclamation activities in the South China Sea, warning against potential Chinese ADIZ. Officials have stated that such actions would be provocative and destabilizing, leading to changes in military posture. The US is actively assessing the military implications and is committed to taking appropriate action, including flying surveillance flights near reclaimed features. The United States has flown surveillance flights near reclaimed features in the South China Sea, prompting Chinese warnings. Defense Secretary Carter emphasized U.S. commitment to freedom of navigation. The U.S. Navy Seventh Fleet Commander suggested combined air patrols with Japan and ASEAN maritime patrols, with increased security cooperation with Japan and the Philippines. The United States is increasing security cooperation with Japan, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Malaysia to enhance maritime capabilities. This includes providing support to the Vietnamese coast guard and helping the Philippines improve its maritime domain awareness. U.S. actions may be in response to China's military modernization, salami-slicing tactics, or land reclamation efforts in the South China Sea. Additional elements of the U.S. strategy to deter China's land reclamation activities are unclear. The current U.S. strategy to deter China's land reclamation activities is unclear. Without direct military intervention, options for stopping China's actions involve imposing costs. Suggestions include stronger warnings to China and changing the tone of communication, as well as increasing awareness of China's activities in the region. The U.S. strategy to deter China's land reclamation activities includes better publicizing China's actions, opposing land reclamation in disputed waters, strengthening allied countries' maritime capabilities, increasing security cooperation, arms sales to Taiwan, and increasing Navy operations in the region. The Senate Budget Committee has authorized funding for security cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region, including maritime domain awareness activities and training for the US Armed Forces and Coast Guard. This amendment aims to adjust US security strategy in Southeast Asia, with a focus on joint MDA operations. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY2016 authorizes $50 million for South East Asian nations to enhance maritime domain awareness capabilities. Defense Secretary Aston Carter discussed these efforts at the multilateral Shangri-La Dialogue in May 2015. Defense Secretary Aston Carter announced a $425 million initiative to improve maritime capabilities in Southeast Asia at the Shangri-La Dialogue in May 2015. The Philippines UNCLOS case is being considered by the UNCLOS Arbitral Tribunal, with a decision expected in 2016. Energy exploration in the South China Sea may be affected by the regional monsoon season. The calm season for deep-sea exploration typically starts in April or May, but in 2014, it coincided with China moving an oil rig into disputed waters with Vietnam. U.S. officials may address this issue at upcoming diplomatic events like the ASEAN Regional Forum and the East Asia Summit. Congress may monitor China's land reclamation activities, including the construction of infrastructure on reclaimed features. China's activities in the South China Sea include claiming territorial waters and an exclusive economic zone, building island facilities for military and exploration purposes, and stationing military forces and residents. Congress has various options to address these issues, as tensions have escalated in recent years. Congress has played a crucial oversight role in monitoring the Administration's actions in maritime security and diplomacy, especially in response to China's territorial assertions in the region."
