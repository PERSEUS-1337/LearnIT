    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Federal Mandates Relief Act of 1993\" and includes definitions. The Act titled the \"Federal Mandates Relief Act of 1993\" provides definitions for key terms such as Federal agency, Federal mandate, local government, and mandate schedule. The \"Federal Mandates Relief Act of 1993\" requires full Federal funding for State or local government obligations and provides a pay-or-excuse mechanism for compliance with Federal mandates. Mandate schedules must be published as specified in the Act. Each Federal agency with authority to administer a Federal mandate must publish a schedule listing the costs of compliance. The schedule includes the annual and total costs of each mandate, published through notice and comment rulemaking and updated annually by March 1. Schedules listing costs of federal mandates must be published annually by March 1. It is not allowed in Congress to consider bills that establish a statutory mandate schedule without a three-fifths vote in the Senate. SEC. 6. PAYMENTS OF ADDITIONAL COSTS. If costs of complying with a Federal mandate exceed appropriated amounts, State or local governments will be reimbursed for documented additional costs. Payments must be made within 30 days of proof submission. SEC. 7. REFUND OF EXCESSIVE APPROPRIATIONS. Any excess payment received by a State or local government must be refunded to the United States Treasury. SEC. 8. CONGRESSIONAL ESTIMATES. Each bill or joint resolution in the House of Representatives or Senate must have a report estimating costs to State and local governments from any Federal mandate. Estimates include costs per government, total costs per mandate, and total costs for all mandates in the bill for the upcoming fiscal year and the following four years. In the House of Representatives or Senate, any bill or joint resolution must comply with cost estimation requirements for State and local governments for the upcoming fiscal year and the following four years. In the Senate, a waiver or suspension of these requirements requires a three-fifths majority vote. This Act applies to Federal mandates from laws enacted after its enactment."
