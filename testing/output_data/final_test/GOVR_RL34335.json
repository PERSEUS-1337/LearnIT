Pakistan has a troubled history of democracy with power struggles among presidents, prime ministers, and army chiefs. Military regimes have ruled for 34 out of 60 years, lacking effective constitutionalism or parliamentary democracy. The armed forces see themselves as \"saviors of the nation\" and have seized power from civilian-led governments three times. Pakistan has a history of military coups, with three outright seizures of power by generals in 1958, 1977, and 1999. The governance system has been marked by turmoil, with prominent leaders like Zulfikar Ali Bhutto executed, Benazir Bhutto exiled and assassinated, and Nawaz Sharif facing exile and imprisonment. This instability has led to a lack of understanding of democracy among Pakistanis, with nearly two-thirds unable to define the term in a 2004 survey. The year 2007 in Pakistan was marked by political crises, including the assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. The security situation deteriorated with armed rebellions and numerous suicide bomb attacks. The country faced political uncertainty leading up to the parliamentary elections in February 2008. In 2007, Pakistan experienced political uncertainty due to President Musharraf's controversial reelection and subsequent resignation. The country faced a series of crises, including attempts to dismiss the Chief Justice, Supreme Court rulings against Musharraf, and questions about his presidency's legality. The return of former Prime Ministers added to the pressure of upcoming parliamentary elections. Benazir Bhutto's assassination further destabilized Pakistan's political landscape. The removal of Benazir Bhutto in 2008 dealt a blow to Pakistani democratization and U.S. interests. President Musharraf's \"second coup\" in November 2007 suspended the constitution, leading to a crackdown on opposition figures, lawyers, and media outlets. The emergency order was lifted on December 15, but little meaningful change has been observed. On the day before lifting the emergency order in 2007, Musharraf issued decrees and amendments to the Constitution to prevent challenges to his actions. The National Assembly's term ended, and a caretaker Prime Minister was appointed. Analysts criticized the caretaker cabinet for being stacked with Musharraf supporters, raising concerns about credible elections. Efforts to manipulate the election were reported, with the Chief Election Commissioner initially setting the polling date for January 8, 2007. In 2007, 13,500 candidates filed papers to compete for Pakistan's National Assembly and provincial assembly seats. The National Assembly has 342 seats, with reserved seats for women and non-Muslims. Opposition parties faced a dilemma of participating in potentially manipulated elections or boycotting. The Election Commission postponed polls to February 18 after Bhutto's assassination. Despite criticism, opposition parties chose to participate, as Musharraf's political influence declined, posing challenges for his PML-Q party. The ruling Musharraf-allied PML-Q party faces challenges in convincing the electorate for another term. The Muslim League, Pakistan's oldest party, struggled to find a coherent ideology after achieving its primary goal. The Pakistan Muslim League (PML) was established in 1964 as a successor to the Muslim League. The Pakistan Muslim League (PML) was established in 1964 as a successor to the Muslim League. In the 1988 elections, the PML, in coalition with Islamist parties, became a major player. Nawaz Sharif's faction, PML-N, was formed in 1993 and has electoral strength in Punjab province. The party's manifesto emphasizes genuine democracy, criticizes President Musharraf, and calls for U.S. support for Pakistan. Nawaz Sharif, a scion of a wealthy Lahore industrialist family, became Prime Minister in 1990 and later established the PML-Nawaz (PML-N) party. He was ousted in a bloodless coup led by Gen. Musharraf in 1999 and lived in exile in Saudi Arabia following his conviction on criminal charges. Reports indicated collusion between the Sharif family, the Musharraf government, and Saudi Arabia after the coup. After the 1999 coup, Nawaz Sharif was barred from returning to Pakistan for ten years due to an arrangement with the Musharraf government and Saudi Arabia. His nomination papers were rejected in 2007, making him ineligible for elections. Despite his refusal to negotiate with Musharraf, Sharif has become a prominent opposition figure in Punjab province, with strong political influence. He is a conservative with ties to Islamist parties and is a fierce opponent of Musharraf. Shahbaz Sharif, Nawaz's younger brother and president of the PML-N, is a political heavyweight with pending criminal charges. Despite Nawaz's anti-Musharraf stance, there are talks of potential power-sharing with the Musharraf government. In 2002, many politicians loyal to Nawaz Sharif joined a new party. In the flawed 2002 election, former politicians loyal to Nawaz Sharif joined the PML-Q, a centrist-conservative group supported by the military. The party won 118 parliamentary seats, mostly from Punjab, falling short of a majority. The PML-Q claims to promote the vision of Pakistan's founding fathers, emphasizing democracy, diversity, and opposition to terrorism. However, it faced criticism for creating legal obstacles while in power. The \"Chaudhrys of Gujrat,\" led by Chaudhry Shujaat Hussein, united five PML factions in 2004. Shujaat, a Punjabi politician and industrialist, has been a key political ally of President Musharraf and served as a transitional Prime Minister for two months. His father was assassinated in 1981 by a terrorist group allegedly run by Benazir Bhutto. Chaudhry Pervez Elahi, a politician and cousin of Shujaat Hussein, is known for his modernization vision. He was named as a potential threat by Benazir Bhutto and is considered the PML-Q's prime ministerial candidate in 2008. The PPP, a left-leaning party, was founded in 1967 in response to a military dictatorship. Under Z.A. Bhutto's leadership, the party won majority seats in 1970 elections. In 1970, Z.A. Bhutto's PPP won majority seats in West Pakistan's assembly and governed until 1977. Bhutto established a parliamentary system and initiated Pakistan's nuclear program. He was executed in 1979. Benazir Bhutto, his daughter, became PPP leader in 1986, serving as Prime Minister in 1988 and 1993. Benazir spent years in exile after Musharraf's coup. The PPP formed PPP Parliamentarians in 2002 to participate in elections. Benazir was assassinated in 2007. Benazir Bhutto was assassinated in December 2007, shortly after her return to Pakistan. She accused the ruling PML-Q party of colluding with intelligence agencies to postpone elections, calling Musharraf's electoral plans a \"farce.\" Bhutto had negotiations with President Musharraf for a power-sharing arrangement that would have allowed her to return from exile and potentially serve as prime minister again. The Bush Administration supported this arrangement to sustain Musharraf's role and strengthen moderate forces. Some analysts viewed Benazir Bhutto's negotiations with President Musharraf cynically, questioning her motives for personal power and removal of corruption cases. Bhutto claimed she engaged with Musharraf to facilitate a peaceful transition to democracy. Despite deteriorating relations, the United States continued to support a power-sharing agreement between Musharraf and Bhutto to promote constitutional, democratic rule. After Benazir Bhutto's assassination, her husband Asif Zardari was released on bail in 2004 and later joined the PPP leadership with their son Bilawal. Zardari, known for corruption allegations, now leads Pakistan's largest opposition party. Asif Zardari, known for corruption allegations, leads Pakistan's largest opposition party. He demands a United Nations investigation into his wife's murder and may consider joining a national unity government. Amin Fahim heads the PPP Parliamentarians. Aitzaz Ahsan, a prominent lawyer in Pakistan, gained popularity for his efforts to restore the Supreme Court after Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry was removed. He criticized the U.S. government for not addressing Musharraf's crackdown on the judiciary. Ahsan was arrested during the November emergency, and later, 33 U.S. Senators signed a letter to President Musharraf. The Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA) is a coalition of six Islamist parties in Pakistan, with the Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) as its largest constituent. The Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI) is another major Islamist party associated with religious schools that influenced the Afghan Taliban movement. Pakistan's Islamist parties advocate for a central role of Islam and sharia law in governance. Pakistan's religious parties, including the Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA), advocate for Islam and sharia in governance. Despite having significant street power, their electoral success has been limited historically. The MMA served as a nominal opposition in Islamabad from 2002-2007, allowing for controversial constitutional changes and holding provincial power in western provinces. This marginalized non-Islamist groups in Pakistan. The MMA in Pakistan faced internal divisions in 2007, leading to a formal split due to differing views on participating in elections. The JUI faction, led by Fazl-ur-Rehman, may still hold influence in forming government alliances. The party seeks to implement Islamic law through democratic means. The JUI, with Deobandi roots, aims to establish Islamic law in Pakistan through democratic means. It has strong ties to the Taliban and oversees religious schools in western Pakistan. Rehman, a political pragmatist, has held key positions in the Pakistani government. The JUI's electoral strength lies in the western provinces of Pakistan. The Jamaat-i-Islami, led by Qazi Hussein Ahmed, seeks to impose Islamic law in Pakistan through peaceful, democratic means. The party is comprised of urban, middle-class citizens and has been active in political causes like the Pakistan-supported \"jihad\" in Indian Kashmir. Qazi Hussein Ahmed is known for his uncompromising views and opposition to the Musharraf government. The Muttahida Quami Movement (MQM) is a Sindhi regional party formed by descendants of pre-partition, Urdu-speaking immigrants. It originated in the 1980s to protect Muhajirs' rights, facing accusations of terrorism. Despite limited national votes, it holds significant power in Karachi. The party advocates for provincial autonomy, cultural pluralism, and ending the feudal economic system in Sindh. The MQM, a regional party in Sindh, has been a key ally of the Musharraf-friendly PML-Q. In May 2007, MQM cadres were involved in violent clashes in Karachi, resulting in the deaths of at least 40 people, mostly PPP members. MQM leader Altaf Hussein, based in London since 1992, has faced accusations of violent plots but was never convicted. Altaf Hussein, a MQM leader based in London since 1992, has faced accusations of violent plots, including the kidnaping of an army major, but was never convicted. He was an early and vocal sympathizer with the United States following the September 2001 terrorist attacks."
