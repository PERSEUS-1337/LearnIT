    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 51504 of the Health and Safety Code is amended to include a downpayment assistance program for first-time low- and moderate-income home buyers. Assistance may include a deferred-payment, low-interest junior mortgage loan not exceeding 3 percent of the home sale price. The downpayment assistance for a new home in specific development zones is limited to 5% of the purchase price or appraised value. Borrowers must provide certification from the local government agency confirming the property's location within the designated zone. The agency may provide downpayment assistance up to 6% of the home sale price to first-time low-income home buyers in targeted community revitalization areas. The assistance must be documented by a certified nonprofit organization and cannot exceed $6,000,000 in funds from Section 53533. The downpayment assistance provided by the agency is secured by a deed of trust in a junior position to the primary financing. The loan term for the assistance cannot exceed the primary loan term. The amount is due at the end of the term or upon sale/refinancing of the home, with repayments going back to the agency for reallocation. The agency may allow subordination of the downpayment assistance loan to refinancing in cases of borrower hardship to avoid foreclosure, with terms determined by the agency. The amount of assistance is not due upon sale if the first mortgage is insured by FHA. The agency can use up to 5% of funds for program administration. A \"transit-oriented development specific plan area\" is a specific plan centered around a transit station, intended for higher density land use. The agency may use up to $75 million for land acquisition and housing development through short-term loans, with priority given to downpayment assistance programs. Loans made under this section are not subject to certain regulations. The agency will provide downpayment assistance to first-time home buyers for homes in designated infill sites near public transit. They will identify and measure local actions that reduce developer fees or regulatory barriers to housing construction. This may include modifications to local design review requirements. The curr_chunk discusses various factors related to local design review requirements, land use controls, building codes, onsite or offsite improvement requirements, project design, and permit processing. It also outlines a 30-percent reduction in local fees, charges, and other exactions for developers within a local agency's jurisdiction. This reduction includes planning and zoning fees, environmental documentation fees, building permit fees, plan check fees, school fees, school mitigation fees, highway, road, traffic, and transit fees, as well as water, wastewater, sewer, and drainage fees. The curr_chunk discusses various fees that may substitute for local design review requirements, land use controls, building codes, and permit processing. It also includes a provision for reimbursement to local agencies and school districts for costs mandated by the state. The California Homebuyer\u2019s Downpayment Assistance Program is appropriated $10 million from the General Fund for specific purposes outlined in the Health and Safety Code. If the funds are not utilized after 48 months, they will be available for general use by the California Housing Finance Agency for the same program."
