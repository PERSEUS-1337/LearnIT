    "content": "The Architect of the Capitol is appointed by the President with Senate approval for a 10-year term. The process was established by the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 1990, which created a commission to recommend candidates for the position. The Senate Appropriations Committee proposed a revision to have the President nominate the Architect for a 10-year term. The President now nominates the Architect of the Capitol for a 10-year term, subject to Senate approval. This change aligns the appointment process with other officers of similar stature, promoting greater accountability in the performance of duties. Senator Harry Reid emphasized the Architect's institutional status within the legislative branch, clarifying lines of accountability. The Architect of the Capitol now has a fixed 10-year term, similar to the Comptroller General, to enhance accountability. A compromise in 1989 led to the creation of a bicameral congressional advisory commission for the selection process. The Architect of the Capitol now has a fixed 10-year term, similar to the Comptroller General, to enhance accountability. A bicameral congressional advisory commission was created in 1989 for the selection process, which also applies to filling vacancies in the position of Comptroller General. The commission process for the Government Accountability Office (GAO) was established in 1980, requiring a recommendation to the President of at least three individuals. Prior to 1989, the Architect was selected by the President without formal involvement of Congress. Bills related to the qualifications and appointment of the Architect of the Capitol have been periodically introduced since the 1950s, with little action taken until the 1980s. Various proposals have been made, including requiring Senate advice and consent, establishing a commission for recommendations, and making the Architect a congressional appointee. The bills also addressed the term of office. Various bills introduced since the 1950s have addressed the qualifications and appointment of the Architect of the Capitol, including the term of office and procedures for removal. Questions have been raised about Congress's authority to appoint the Architect, considering their nonlegislative functions. The Architect of the Capitol's appointment is a complex issue due to conflicting interpretations of the Appointments Clause. The executive branch has previously determined that the Architect's functions do not require Senate confirmation. The executive branch has concluded that functions involving the management of governmental property are not significant for the Appointments Clause. Bills have been introduced to shift the Architect's appointment responsibility from the President to specified Members of Congress to protect legislative branch prerogatives and ensure accountability. Since 1989, the appointment process for certain government positions has seen minimal changes. In 1995, the commission recommending names to the President expanded to include members of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. A bill introduced during the 109th Congress aimed to establish a uniform appointment process and 10-year term for key positions, with joint appointment by four specified Members of Congress. Since 1989, the appointment process for certain government positions has seen minimal changes. In the 111th Congress, two measures were introduced to shift the Architect appointment process from the President to congressional leaders and committee members. One bill proposed a 12-member congressional appointing panel, while another suggested joint appointment by specified Members of Congress for a 10-year term. In the 111th Congress, H.R. 2843 proposed appointing the Architect jointly by a 14-member panel. The bill was reported by the Committee on House Administration, amended to include 18 Members of Congress, and passed in the House by voice vote. The Senate referred it to the Committee on Rules and Administration, but no further action was taken. The current appointment procedure does not address the removal of the Architect, who presumably serves at the pleasure of the President. The Architect of the Capitol serves at the pleasure of the President. Bills introduced over the last 50 years have addressed removal provisions. The Comptroller General is appointed by the President for a fixed term and can only be removed by impeachment or joint resolution of Congress for specific reasons. The Director of the Congressional Budget Office can be removed by either House by resolution. Alan Hantman was nominated for a 10-year term by President Clinton in 1997 and retired in 2007. Stephen T. Ayers then began serving as the Acting Architect of the Capitol. In 2007, Stephen T. Ayers became the Acting Architect of the Capitol before being confirmed as Architect in 2010. During a hearing in April 2007, Ayers mentioned the selection process for potential candidates to fill the Architect vacancy. The list of potential candidates to fill the Architect vacancy was transmitted to President George W. Bush in summer 2007, but their identities were not publicly released. The appointment process faced complexities, leading to a delay in final selection and confirmation. The Committee on House Administration expressed concerns about the process and considered the need for new legislation. The three-year period following the retirement of the former Architect was also highlighted during a House debate in February 2010. The House debate in February 2010 highlighted issues regarding the selection process and potential vacancies for the Architect of the Capitol position. The appointment of Mr. Ayers in 2010 raised concerns about the commission's operation and the possibility of extended vacancies. The process for selecting a successor and the lack of clarity on when the commission begins its work were also discussed. The statute governing the Architect of the Capitol position lacks guidance on the commission's operations and timeframes for recommendations. Significant delays occurred between the retirements of previous incumbents and the Senate confirmations of their successors. The commission's procedures and criteria for selecting nominees are not public or binding for future selections. Questions about the commission's functioning remain unresolved.

According to a press account, Hantman was the first choice of the Members 'by a substantial margin.' After his term, a list of names was forwarded to President George W. Bush in 2007, but no nomination was made. The 1989 act does not address changes in commission membership during a vacancy. There is a vacancy in the position of Architect of the Capitol, with unresolved questions about the reappointment process. Legislation in the past has proposed that future nominees for the position must be trained architects. The bill introduced in 1968 aimed to change the title of the Architect of the Capitol to \"Superintendent of the Capitol Buildings and Grounds\" due to concerns about the qualifications of the then-Architect. When Architect White retired in 1995, there were discussions about the necessary qualifications for the successor, with the American Institute of Architects preferring a licensed architect with management and restoration experience.
