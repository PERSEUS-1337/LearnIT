    "content": "The Act titled \"Protection and Advocacy for Veterans Act of 2016\" establishes a grant program to improve monitoring of mental health and substance abuse treatment programs within the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs will establish a grant program to improve monitoring of mental health and substance abuse treatment programs. Grants will be awarded to protection and advocacy systems to investigate and monitor care for veterans with mental illness or substance abuse issues at Department medical facilities. Each protection and advocacy system grant must be at least $105,000 per year for demonstration projects. Collaboration grants of $80,000 are awarded to national organizations and veterans service organizations during project years. Each national organization and veterans service organization awarded a joint grant must use the amount to facilitate collaboration for training, technical assistance, data collection, reporting, and analysis. Protection and advocacy systems have specified authorities for demonstration projects. The Secretary will select four protection and advocacy systems for grants based on criteria including monitoring experience, knowledge of veterans with disabilities issues, and low scores in mental health, performance, and access domains. The Secretary will ensure that each protection and advocacy system participating in the grant program submits reports relating to investigations or monitoring. The grant program will run for five years, and the Secretary may terminate demonstration projects if needed. The Secretary may terminate a demonstration project early if there is good cause, awarding grants to a new protection and advocacy system. $500,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2017 to 2021 for the grant program. The term \"protection and advocacy system\" is defined in the section. The term \"State\" refers to various entities within the United States, including territories and possessions. The term \"veterans service organization\" is defined as any organization recognized by the Secretary for representing veterans."
