The Commission has exclusive jurisdiction to determine if charging a person for transportation services at a rate other than the legally filed rate is unreasonable. Factors considered include offering a different rate, reliance on the offered rate, and the carrier's actions. The Commission has exclusive jurisdiction to determine the reasonableness of transportation rates. Factors include timely filing of tariffs, proper execution of contracts, billing and collection of rates, and demands for additional payment. If challenging rates, no additional compensation is required.

Definitions for terms like \"Commission,\" \"household goods,\" and \"household goods freight forwarder\" are provided under section 10102 of the same code. The terms \"nonhousehold goods freight forwarder,\" \"nonhousehold goods motor carrier,\" and \"negotiated rate\" are defined under section 10102 of title 49, United States Code.

Chapter 117 of title 49, United States Code, is amended by adding a new section regarding tariff reconciliation rules for motor common carriers of property. Motor carriers and shippers can resolve overcharge and undercharge claims by mutual consent, subject to Commission review. This resolution does not subject any party to penalties under chapter 119. The motor carrier still has a duty to file and adhere to tariff provisions. The new section in Chapter 117 of title 49, United States Code, establishes rules for tariff reconciliation for motor common carriers of property. Motor carriers are relieved of tariff requirements under certain circumstances outlined in subsection (a). The Commission must establish rules within 90 days of enactment. The new rules for tariff reconciliation for motor common carriers of property are outlined in Section 11712. Customer account codes are addressed in Section 10762, where numerical or alpha codes can be used in tariffs, but customer names must be included for transportation after 90 days. The effective date for these changes is specified in Section 6. Section 6 of the Act states that it will take effect on the date of enactment, with an exception for Section 2 which applies to proceedings before the Interstate Commerce Commission and court actions pending or commenced after the enactment date."
