    "content": "The discussion of Haiti's current social and political situation is overshadowed by the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake. President Pr\u00e9val is leading relief efforts but faces opposition due to delays in elections. Haiti's historical poverty and political repression continue to challenge its fragile stability. Haiti has struggled with weak governance, economic inequality, and social unrest since the end of the Duvalier dictatorship in 1986. Presidents Aristide and Pr\u00e9val have faced challenges in establishing a stable government, with Pr\u00e9val's second administration marred by decisions that weakened his support. The 2010 earthquake exacerbated Haiti's already difficult political situation, highlighting the fragility of the post-dictatorial political system. After four years into his second term, Pr\u00e9val's leadership and strategy to address poverty and unemployment have been criticized for failing to establish a fully functioning government. Delays in Senate elections and constitutional reform have compromised the government's legitimacy, leading to low voter turnout and endemic corruption in the bureaucracy. The Senate runoff elections in Haiti in June 2009 saw low voter turnout and political tensions, with the dominant party of President Pr\u00e9val winning 5 out of 11 seats. The elections were marred by violence and protests, including medical students and society at large demonstrating over issues like the minimum wage. Some constituents questioned Pr\u00e9val's commitment to his populist platform as he pursued a pragmatic governance approach. President Pr\u00e9val's leadership is being tested amidst the aftermath of a disaster in Haiti. Electoral politics have been disrupted, with terms for the National Assembly and Senate expiring. Parliament extended Pr\u00e9val's mandate, causing friction in society and calls for expedited election efforts. Haiti's social structure, with a small middle class and wealthy elite, contributes to its recurring crises. Haiti's political future is uncertain due to the vast wealth gap and lack of power among the impoverished masses. The transition to democracy has been challenging, with entrenched economic and social disparities hindering progress. Research indicates that Haiti is highly vulnerable as a young democracy, with poor economic performance, skewed income distribution, and weak political institutions posing risks to democratic stability. The Pr\u00e9val government is under pressure from these factors. The Pr\u00e9val government in Haiti is facing challenges due to poor economic performance and the aftermath of the earthquake. Security issues, including gang violence, have been a persistent problem. International support is crucial for rebuilding political and economic momentum. The United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) is currently enforcing security, with additional U.S. and U.N. troops involved in relief efforts. Despite concerns about sovereignty, a strong foreign military presence is necessary for the foreseeable future. The Haitian government faces challenges post-earthquake with poor economic performance and security issues. MINUSTAH and U.S. forces are crucial for stability, but doubts remain about the government's ability to improve conditions for the impoverished population. Foreign aid highlights the difficulty of development in Haiti, with the primary economic goal being growth restoration. The post-earthquake challenge involves significant economic reconstruction. Haiti's economic growth trend has been dismal, with annual per capita income growth averaging -0.7% from 1960 to 2000. Despite brief growth in the 1970s, the country experienced a prolonged economic downturn in the 1980s, leading to social and political unrest. This instability ultimately led to the overthrow of the Duvalier dictatorship in 1986 and subsequent political turmoil, including the deposition of President Aristide in 1991. The United States and other countries imposed a trade embargo on Haiti in response to a military coup that deposed the democratically elected government. The embargo, enforced by the OAS and UN, led to a significant decline in output, employment, and income. Per capita income fell by 30% in three years, unemployment peaked at 75%, and the assembly manufacturing industry in Port-au-Prince lost over 80% of its employment. The trade embargo on Haiti led to a significant decline in output, employment, and income. Most assembly plants closed permanently, with only apparel rebounding slightly. The embargo had devastating effects on the agricultural sector's production, leading to increased use of charcoal and ecological damage. Trade was renewed in 1995, but economic growth oscillated due to recession, flooding, and political turmoil. Annual GDP growth averaged only 1.1% for the decade ending 2006, lower than Haiti's population growth rate. Haiti's economic growth has lagged behind Latin America and the Caribbean, averaging slightly over 2.0% per year since 2005. The country faces chronic unemployment, poverty, and emigration pressures, with over 70% of the population living on less than $2 per day. Inequality is extreme, with nearly half of the nation's earnings going to the top 10% of the income distribution. In Haiti, half of the nation's earnings go to the top 10% of the income distribution, while the bottom 10% earns less than 1% of national income. Inflation has caused real wages to fall by half from 2000 to 2008, despite a major adjustment in 2003. The 2009 global recession helped arrest inflation, allowing real interest rates to fall. Employment opportunities are scarce, with 80% of workers in the informal sector. The 2009 debate over increasing the minimum wage led to protests and political turmoil, highlighting the importance of addressing persistent poverty. The Haitian Congress proposed to more than double the minimum wage. Congress proposed to more than double the minimum wage to $5.00 per day, causing disagreement among President Pr\u00e9val's advisors. A compromise was reached with a minimum wage of $5.00 per day for most sectors, except apparel at $3.25. Apparel manufacturers argued that skilled sewers already earned above the new minimum wage. The raise led to reported employment responses in sectors like retail gasoline and private. President Pr\u00e9val established a Presidential Commission on Competitiveness in 2009 to enact a development strategy focused on improving productivity, diversifying the economy, and creating new employment opportunities in key industries. The plan aimed to create 500,000 jobs within three years by targeting agriculture, services, and manufacturing sectors for quick startup or expansion. The plan established by President Pr\u00e9val in 2009 aims to create 500,000 jobs within three years by investing in five growth clusters and support sectors. While ambitious, the plan reflects a comprehensive approach to achieving short-term and long-term development goals, critical for reducing poverty and social unrest in Haiti. Monitoring the plan's progress is essential, as it may raise expectations for addressing problems in the near future, potentially increasing political risk. Haiti's economic recovery program faces challenges due to the global downturn, impacting remittances, exports, and public revenue. Growth projections are modest at 1-2%, highlighting the need to address low productivity growth, especially in the agricultural sector. The government's role in redevelopment planning is crucial for Haiti's emergence from its current economic crisis. Haiti's economic recovery program is hindered by challenges such as low productivity growth in the agricultural sector. Investment in manufacturing is also lacking, posing a threat to long-term growth. Improvements in public administration and private sector gains are essential for progress under the Pr\u00e9val development plan. The reconstruction dilemma lies in whether to rebuild quickly to meet immediate needs or invest more time and money to rebuild to higher standards. Agricultural production accounts for 30% of GDP. Agricultural production in Haiti represents 30% of GDP and employs up to 70% of the workforce, mainly in subsistence farming. Output has been stagnant for decades due to constraints such as limited arable land, soil overuse, poor irrigation, and inadequate infrastructure. The country struggles to meet domestic food needs and relies heavily on food imports. Rising international food prices have exposed Haiti's vulnerability to price shocks, leading to food riots in April 2008. Haiti's economy relies heavily on agriculture, with limited ability to feed itself. The collapse in commodity prices helped alleviate import bills in the short run. Manufacturing, dominated by food processing and apparel assembly, is a major foreign exchange earner. Construction and public works have shown growth, providing employment opportunities for low-skilled workers. The services sector, led by restaurant and hotel industries, grew by nearly 6% in 2007. Tourism is not a major factor in the economy. Haiti's economy heavily relies on agriculture and manufacturing, with limited ability to feed itself. The services sector, led by restaurant and hotel industries, grew by nearly 6% in 2007. Tourism is not a major factor, but core ingredients for a tourist industry are present. Haiti has a historical dependence on foreign commerce and finance, with a trade imbalance equal to 33% of GDP. The country must rely on foreign sources for basic commodities and faces challenges with deteriorating terms of trade. Haiti's trade relationship is dominated by the United States, resulting in a $494 million deficit in 2008. Apparel makes up 75%-80% of exports, with cacao, mangoes, and coffee accounting for the rest. The US is the main export destination, followed by the EU, Thailand, and Canada. The US also leads in imports, followed by Latin America, the EU, and China. Economic growth is crucial to address the trade deficit, currently financed by remittances, foreign aid, and grants. Haiti's trade deficit is mainly financed by remittances, foreign aid, and grants, which are not sustainable solutions. The country's overreliance on one type of product and a single foreign market hinders long-term development. The recent U.S. economic downturn further highlighted the risks associated with this export structure. Haiti's trade dependence is evident in its reliance on U.S. trade preferences for apparel exports, but the country needs to diversify its economy to sustain growth. The rise in food and energy prices over the last decade has exacerbated Haiti's vulnerability as a large net importer of manufactured goods, machinery, transportation equipment, raw materials, energy, and food. In 2008, petroleum accounted for 25%-30% of Haiti's total imports, leading to higher commodity prices affecting purchasing power. The decline in imports of manufactured goods by 37% from 2002 to 2007 reflects the compounding substitution effect. Foreign direct investment (FDI) in Haiti has been historically low, with net FDI inflows fluctuating between $4 million and $160 million before falling to $30 million in 2008. The spike in 2006 was related to construction and tourist industries, but the sustainability of this investment boost is uncertain. The apparel industry is a key sector for attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) to Haiti, supported by the HOPE Act. While agriculture is crucial for the economy, apparel assembly offers promising employment opportunities. Apparel production involves a global chain of production, with capital-intensive stages like fiber and fabric production, and labor-intensive garment assembly. Assembly factories are cheaper to build than textile mills, with production location secondary to vertical integration and global networks. Haiti is a prime candidate for redeveloping the apparel exporting industry due to its abundance of low-skill labor, simple technology requirements, and low labor costs compared to other regions. This allows for quick job growth and advancement opportunities in the industry. The apparel industry in Haiti has faced challenges due to social and political turbulence, including a downturn in production after the 1991 military coup and trade embargo. Despite rebuilding efforts since 1994, the industry has not yet reached its peak employment levels of the 1980s. Haitian apparel operations were effectively closed, leading to a sharp decline in employment. After the original HOPE legislation in 2006, employment more than doubled to 27,000. U.S. import data reflects the trend of Haitian apparel production, which declined due to competition and political uncertainty. After a period of decline due to competition and political uncertainty, Haiti's apparel industry saw growth after 2002 with industry restructuring. However, a new downturn occurred in 2006, possibly due to the end of global textile quotas and the implementation of CAFTA-DR. The industry faced challenges such as lack of industrial space, high capital costs, and competition from more efficient rivals in the region and Asia. Haiti's apparel industry underwent major restructuring after 2000 to improve competitiveness, adopting a leaner, low-cost business model based on high-volume production. The industry can compete at the low end of the U.S. apparel market due to low wages, quality products, and proximity to the United States. Production is mostly limited to simple knits and some woven products. The apparel industry in Haiti has shifted towards producing more complicated woven goods like khaki pants, which now account for 18.6% of apparel exports to the United States. Knits, such as t-shirts and sweatshirts, have decreased to 74.4%. Haiti's top five apparel products make up 90% of U.S. imports, facing competition mainly from Central America, the Dominican Republic, and Southeast Asia. Critics argue that revitalizing Haiti's apparel assembly industry may not have much development potential and is vulnerable to market changes. The apparel industry in Haiti has survived as a niche production strategy despite its lack of development potential and vulnerability to market changes. Supporters argue that it offers a quick response to high unemployment. The industry relies on foreign producers for yarns and fabrics, primarily sourced from the United States, the Dominican Republic, and Asia. Apparel factories in Haiti produce for various international firms like Hanes, Gildan, Wilbes, and Grupo M. Haitian apparel production is concentrated in Port-au-Prince, with factories in two free trade zones near airport and port facilities. Grupo M operates a co-production plant in Ouanaminthe on the northern border with the Dominican Republic, providing management training and infrastructure investment. They plan to hand over full operation to Haitian managers and support the surrounding community with water and electricity. Production of apparel in Haiti is highly competitive due to low labor costs, proximity to the U.S. market, and a niche strategy focused on mass-produced items. Despite productivity challenges, Haiti is favored for price and product quality by apparel buyers. Haiti is ranked favorably for price and product quality in apparel production, but faces challenges such as the need for better training, infrastructure development, and overcoming a poor political stability image. There are concerns about rising costs, particularly in electricity and construction, which could impact apparel firm profitability. Public investment in transport, utilities, and customs facilities is necessary to support the competitiveness of the apparel sector in Haiti. Raising the minimum wage in Haiti can reduce worker production incentives and firms need investment for higher value-added production. Full packaging production requires advanced skills not widely available in Haiti, and investors are hesitant to build fabric mills due to political and social instability. The key to Haiti's apparel production development is moving towards full package operations incrementally, improving managerial and worker skills. USAID is helping Haiti develop these skills through long-term contracts and funding construction training centers. Haiti is recovering from the 2010 earthquake with a humanitarian relief effort. Haiti is responding with a significant humanitarian relief effort following the catastrophic situation caused by the earthquake. The apparel sector is also working to restore production capacity quickly to retain customers and attract future investments. Despite serious damage to some firms, most are operational, with employment rates returning to pre-earthquake levels. Monthly apparel exports have decreased by 43% from February 2009 to February 2010. Apparel exports declined 43% from $58.2 million in February 2009 to $33.1 million in February 2010. Estimates for rebuilding costs have risen to $38 million, with the need for affordable financing being crucial for successful reconstruction. The Haitian apparel industry may require twice as much investment capital if rebuilding at new standards. Construction costs are high due to the need to import materials. Congress modified HOPE Act tariff preferences and rules to enhance U.S. market access for Haitian apparel exports. Trade preferences were first provided in the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act of 1983, but did not cover textile or apparel goods. The Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act of 2000 provided temporary incentives for select U.S. imports of textile and apparel articles from beneficiary countries. Tariff preferences required articles to be made from inputs produced in the U.S. or the region. The HOPE Act, as amended, offers duty-free treatment for U.S. apparel imports from Haiti under rules of origin that allow for more flexible sourcing of materials than those offered to Caribbean countries under the CBTPA. Duty-free treatment is extended to apparel articles if wholly assembled or knit-to-shape in Haiti from materials sourced from any country. The HOPE Act, passed in 2006, allows duty-free treatment for U.S. apparel imports from Haiti with flexible rules of origin. Apparel articles can be sourced from any country, benefiting the Haitian textile and apparel industries. The HOPE Act, also known as HOPE I (CBERA\u2014 P.L. 98-67), provided duty-free treatment for select apparel imports from Haiti made from third-country yarns and fabrics, with eligibility criteria focused on Haiti's progress towards a market economy, rule of law, poverty reduction, and worker rights protection. The act included rules on direct shipment from Haiti, an overall cap on qualified apparel imports, a short supply rule, and preferences for wire harness automotive imports. HOPE I provided duty-free treatment for Haitian apparel imports with new rules of origin favoring U.S. or FTA countries for value-added content. An additional quota was established for woven apparel not meeting the value-added rule. Despite these trade rules, HOPE I faced criticism for its ineffectiveness in 2007. In 2007, HOPE I, a program providing duty-free treatment for Haitian apparel imports, faced criticism for being ineffective. Key criticisms included the program's short duration, high value-added rule, limited scope for woven articles, costly direct shipping requirements, and small overall import cap. U.S. textile producers also objected to the preferences, arguing they displaced textile jobs. The HOPE Act faced criticism for being ineffective due to various reasons such as short duration, high value-added rule, and limited scope for woven articles. U.S. textile producers objected to the preferences, arguing they displaced textile jobs in the United States and the Caribbean with those in Asia. In response, the 110th Congress passed the Hemispheric Opportunity through Partnership Encouragement Act of 2008, known as HOPE II, to address these issues. The HOPE Act was amended by Congress to extend tariff preferences from 3 to 10 years, allow direct shipment of goods from Haiti or the Dominican Republic, and clarify quantitative limitation rules. These changes aimed to improve the effectiveness of the Act and address criticisms regarding job displacement and limited scope for woven articles. The Caribbean Basin Initiative was amended to provide more liberal duty-free treatment for Haitian apparel imports, including an increase in the annual TPL to 70 million SMEs for select woven apparel and a new TPL for knit apparel. A new uncapped \"3-for-1\" earned import allowance was introduced, allowing producers to claim credits for exporting apparel made from qualifying inputs. Qualifying fabrics and components must be wholly formed in the United States. The United States implemented new rules for apparel imports, including a value-added rule, an overall cap on eligible apparel articles, and a duty-free rule for specific items assembled in Haiti. The \"short supply\" rule was expanded to include all fabric and yarns in short supply lists from other U.S. preference arrangements and FTAs. Haiti is eligible for preferential treatment under these rules. Haiti is eligible for preferential treatment under new rules for apparel imports, including a duty-free rule for specific items assembled in Haiti. The President of the United States must certify Haiti's progress in establishing protection for worker rights, including the right of association, prohibition of forced labor, and acceptable working conditions. Haiti is also required to create a Labor Ombudsman's Office and a TAICNAR Program within 16 months. The Labor Ombudsman in Haiti is appointed by the President and oversees functions such as maintaining a registry of apparel producers, coordinating with officials to ensure participation by apparel firms, and managing the TAICNAR program. This program focuses on improving working conditions and labor-management relations in factories, based on the Better Factories Cambodia project. The ILO has developed the Better Work Global Program in partnership with the World Bank to improve labor conditions in countries like Haiti. The TAICNAR program, known as Better Work Haiti, aims to enhance factory labor conditions in exchange for duty-free access to the U.S. apparel market. Compliance with core labor standards and ILO monitoring are required for firms to maintain this access. The TAICNAR program, also known as Better Work Haiti, aims to improve labor conditions in exchange for duty-free access to the U.S. apparel market. The program focuses on assisting in remedying problems and requires compliance with core labor standards and ILO monitoring. Haiti stakeholders agreed to empower the ILO with operational authority to ensure transparency in improving working conditions. HOPE II mandates assessment of registered apparel producers' compliance with labor laws related to core standards and acceptable working conditions. The TAICNAR program, also known as Better Work Haiti, aims to improve labor conditions in exchange for duty-free access to the U.S. apparel market. It focuses on core labor standards, minimum wages, hours of work, and occupational health and safety. The ILO conducts site visits and interviews, provides assessment results, and requires remedial actions. Congress allocated $10 million for the program, with biennial reports on progress. The success of the Better Work approach has been praised, but its impact in Haiti is still being evaluated. The evaluation process for the TAICNAR program in Haiti was interrupted by the 2009 earthquake. The labor code is acceptable but poorly enforced, requiring firms to improve practices. Enhancing Haiti's capacity for inspections and enforcing labor codes is a major challenge. Ambiguity exists in the relationship between the ILO's representative and the Haitian government, raising questions about ultimate authority on labor matters. The Haiti Economic Lift Program (HELP) Act of 2010 was passed by Congress as part of U.S. support for Haiti's post-earthquake economic recovery. There is a debate on the implication of core labor standards in the HOPE II legislation, which are similar to those in the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights to Work. Some question whether a broader application of ILO conventions could be applied in Haiti without specific reference in the statute. In the HELP Act of 2010, Congress made amendments to the HOPE Act to boost Haitian apparel exports to the U.S. Data shows an increase in the use of tariff preferences by Haitian apparel producers, especially after the passage of HOPE II in 2008. Apparel entering under HOPE II grew significantly, with a rise in the use of woven TPL and value-added rule in 2009. In 2009, Haitian apparel exports under the knit TPL increased, but other special import rules were underutilized. Haiti filled only a small percentage of its apparel quota, with lobbying efforts for program extensions and rule changes. The 111th Congress reviewed the HOPE Act trade rules to enhance contributions to Haiti's economy. The HELP Act extends trade preference rules for Haitian apparel through September 30, 2020, providing assurance of enhanced U.S. market access for the next decade. To qualify for duty-free treatment under HOPE II, a percentage of the exported product must be made from inputs and processes from Haiti, the United States, or a country with trade agreements with the U.S. The HELP Act extends trade preference rules for Haitian apparel through September 30, 2020, ensuring enhanced U.S. market access. To qualify for duty-free treatment under HOPE II, a percentage of the exported product must be made from inputs and processes from Haiti, the United States, or a country with trade agreements with the U.S. The thresholds for third-country inputs in apparel were extended to 60% by Congress, allowing more time for Haitian producers to increase value-added production. HOPE II also expanded the woven apparel TPL to 70 million SMEs, providing an attractive incentive for producers. The woven apparel TPL was expanded to 70 million SMEs under the HOPE II Act, attracting producers to invest in Haiti. Exports of woven articles to the United States increased by 79% from 2007 to 2009. Congress allowed the cap to grow to 200 million SMEs, but only after Haitian producers export at least 52 million SMEs. The HOPE II Act expanded the woven apparel TPL to 70 million SMEs in Haiti, with a cap set at 200 million SMEs. Knit exports from Haiti are limited due to t-shirt exclusions, but knit products already make up 80% of apparel exports to the United States. The HELP Act increases the knit TPL to 200 SMEs with exceptions for sensitive products. The woven rule under the HOPE II Act sets a threshold of 85 million SMEs, benefiting factories producing large volumes of t-shirts using US yarn. Some contractors in the Dominican Republic and Haiti export duty-free t-shirts to the US under CBTPA, supporting US yarn manufacturers. However, the rule is criticized for being complex and unused, as apparel made from third country inputs already enter duty-free under TPLs. Certain apparel articles made from third country inputs can enter duty-free under the knit and woven TPLs. Congress reduced the 3-for-1 rule to 2-for-1, allowing for less U.S. fabric and yarn before third-country alternatives can be sourced. Apparel articles wholly assembled or knit-to-shape in Haiti and imported directly into the U.S. may also enter duty-free regardless of the country source of inputs. The HELP Act extended duty-free treatment for automobile wire harnesses for an additional five years. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) must verify imported apparel articles. The HELP Act requires U.S. Customs and Border Protection to verify that apparel articles imported under TPLs are not illegally transshipped into the United States. It also authorizes appropriations to improve Haiti's customs capabilities and support the Haitian apparel industry with generous trade preferences. After the HELP Act was passed to support Haiti's apparel industry with trade preferences, the earthquake in 2010 caused challenges for the industry. Congress responded by amending the HOPE Act to further enhance market access for Haitian exports, focusing on promoting investment and production. The preference rules amended by Congress aim to promote investment, production, and apparel exports while balancing domestic and foreign policy considerations."
