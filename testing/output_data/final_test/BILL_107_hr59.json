The \"Kids Developing Skills for Success in the 21st Century Act\" provides grants to State educational agencies to assist limited English proficient students in rapidly developing English proficiency while keeping up with academic studies. The \"Kids Developing Skills for Success in the 21st Century Act\" provides grants to State educational agencies for individualized tutoring by school staff or bilingual tutors to assist limited English proficient students in developing English proficiency. State educational agencies must submit an application detailing how grant funds will be used and how programs will be coordinated with other entities. The State educational agency will evaluate program performance and give priority to local educational agencies with specific criteria, such as a dramatic increase in limited English proficient students or a record of success in assisting these students. SEC. 3. STATE ALLOCATIONS. State allocations for the program under this Act are based on the proportion of limited English proficiency students in each State's public schools and nonpublic schools, compared to the total number of such students in all participating States. Eligible local educational agencies are those serving these students. Local educational agencies eligible for funding under this Act must have a minimum of 500 students of limited English proficiency or at least 3 percent of the total student population in public or nonpublic schools within the district. The Secretary determines the number of eligible students based on limited English proficiency for funding allocations. The Secretary determines funding allocations for students of limited English proficiency based on data provided by State educational agencies, with a provision for correction if errors are found. No underestimation or overestimation should affect a State's allocation. The Secretary can reallocate funds if necessary. If a State does not use a payment made under this Act for its intended purpose, the Secretary can reallocate the funds to other States that can utilize them. The reallocated amount will be considered part of the State's payment for that year but must be spent by the end of the following fiscal year. SEC. 4. ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS. The Secretary notifies State educational agencies of their annual allocation under the Act by June 1. Local educational agencies must provide assurances to receive assistance, including providing services to limited English proficiency students in nonpublic schools. The Act requires public agencies to provide secular, neutral, and nonideological services, materials, and equipment to students. Funds provided must be controlled by a public agency and used for the purposes outlined in the Act. Services can be provided by public agency employees or through contracts with external entities. The Act mandates public agencies to offer secular services to students, independent of nonpublic schools or religious organizations. Funds must be managed separately from state or local funds. Waivers may be granted if a local educational agency cannot provide services to children in nonpublic schools or fails to do so equitably. The Secretary may waive the requirement for public agencies to provide services to children in nonpublic schools, subject to consultation and judicial review as per the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Authorization of appropriations for this Act is set at $250,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2002 to 2006. Definitions are provided in Section 6. The term \"elementary school\" refers to a nonprofit school providing elementary education. \"Limited English proficiency\" pertains to individuals not born in the US or whose native language is not English.
