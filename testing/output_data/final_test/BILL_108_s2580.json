A new subpart in the Internal Revenue Code offers a nonrefundable credit for holders of qualified technology bonds. The Technology Bond Initiative of 2004 offers a nonrefundable tax credit to taxpayers holding qualified technology bonds. The credit amount is determined by multiplying the credit rate set by the Secretary with the face amount of the bond held on the credit allowance date. The Secretary determines a credit rate for bonds issued in the following month to allow issuance of qualified technology bonds without discount or interest cost. The credit allowed for a taxable year is limited by the regular tax liability and other credits. A qualified technology bond is defined as a bond where 95% or more of the proceeds are used for qualified purposes. Qualified technology bonds are issued with 95% or more of proceeds used for qualified projects, approved by the Secretary of Commerce, and with a maximum term of 15 years. A qualified project includes expanding broadband telecommunications services in a specific area. The curr_chunk discusses the process of designating telecommunications projects as qualified projects in underserved urban or rural areas. The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, designates these projects based on nominations from State or local governments. The curr_chunk discusses the national technology bond limitation for designated telecommunications projects in underserved urban or rural areas. The limitation is $100,000,000 for 2005-2009 and zero thereafter, allocated by the Secretary among qualified projects. The maximum aggregate face amount of bonds issued for qualified projects in a calendar year is limited to the allocation amount. Any excess national technology limitation amount from the previous year can be carried over to the following year. Other definitions for this subpart are also provided. The subpart defines terms like \"bond,\" \"credit allowance date,\" and \"State.\" Gross income includes the credit allowed to the taxpayer, treated as interest income. Special rules apply to partnerships, S corporations, and other pass-thru entities. Entities like partnerships, trusts, S corporations, and other pass-thru entities are subject to rules similar to section 41(g) for the credit allowed under subsection (a). Qualified technology bonds held by regulated investment companies allow the credit to be passed on to shareholders.
