    "content": "This report provides a timeline of events related to the discoveries of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in North America, with 10 confirmed cases so far. BSE is a fatal degenerative disease affecting cattle's nervous system and has been linked to a rare but fatal human form of the disease primarily in the United Kingdom. The timeline focuses on regulatory, legal, and congressional developments relevant to the ongoing policy debate on BSE. The curr_chunk discusses policy developments related to BSE, such as animal identification programs and country of origin labeling. It references other CRS reports for more background on the policy debate. Proposed Safeguards for BSE were discussed by [author name scrubbed] and Sarah A. Lister. When BSE was first identified in 1986, little was known about its character, cause, or containment methods. The United Kingdom has been the hardest-hit by BSE. The United Kingdom has been the hardest-hit region by BSE, with reported cases peaking at over 37,000 in 1992. Cases have been declining since then. Other countries in Europe also reported cases. The US and Canada implemented safeguards to prevent the spread of BSE. The first known case of BSE in North America was in Canada in 1993, believed to have originated from Great Britain. In 2003, the first native-born case of BSE in North America was confirmed in a cow in Alberta, Canada. The United States halted the importation of ruminants and ruminant products from Canada but later reopened the border to boneless beef from cattle under 30 months old. USDA proposed a rule change to formalize and expand imports from Canada, including live cattle under 30 months old. In December 2003, the first reported case of BSE in the US was confirmed in a cow imported from Canada. The USDA took steps to strengthen BSE safeguards and reassure consumers, but most foreign countries closed their borders to US beef. The USDA worked to restore cross-border trade with Canada and Mexico in 2004. In 2004, a cattlemen's group sued USDA to halt further expansion of Canadian beef imports. USDA limited beef imports to types permitted since August 2003. Enhanced BSE surveillance began in June 2004, with three inconclusive cases reported. Markets reacted nervously, questioning USDA's testing program. FDA deliberated on tightening animal feed rules for BSE contamination. In 2004, animal feed rules were tightened to control possible BSE contamination. Some countries, including Canada and Mexico, accepted U.S. beef, while Japan and South Korea remained closed to U.S. beef exports. Canada reported four native-born BSE cases, prompting U.S. officials to confirm the effectiveness of Canadian feed controls. R-CALF USA sued USDA to halt Canadian beef imports, obtaining a temporary injunction. In early March, USA sued USDA to stop Canadian beef and live cattle imports, winning a temporary injunction. An appeals court later reversed the ban, allowing younger Canadian cattle to cross the border. In June 2005, USDA confirmed the second U.S. case of BSE in a native-born cow, after initial inconclusive tests in November 2004. In June 2005, re-tested samples confirmed positive for BSE. Japan delayed border opening until December, leading to frustration in Congress. Efforts to restore beef and cattle trade faced setbacks in 2006, with Japan halting U.S. beef imports in January. Additional concessions were made to regain market access. In late July, Japan finally granted market access for U.S. beef exports, with shipments expected to start in August. Negotiations for shipping beef and cattle to Korea faced challenges in the first half of 2006. Concerns arose in March 2006 with the confirmation of a second U.S.-born cow with BSE. Despite Canada finding four additional BSE-positive cattle, trade with the U.S. continued, but raised concerns about the effectiveness of the ban on feeding mammalian protein to ruminants. Critics urged USDA to reconsider proposed rules. USDA proposed rules for importing older Canadian cattle and ruminant products, while scaling back BSE testing program due to low disease levels in U.S. cattle herd. Efforts were focused on reopening foreign markets for U.S. beef, particularly in Korea and Japan. Policymakers expressed frustration with slow progress in market-opening efforts. Efforts to reopen foreign markets for U.S. beef have faced frustration from industry officials. Bills calling for trade sanctions against Japan have been introduced but may not be acted upon if the market reopens as expected. Concerns remain about BSE and its impact on public health and trade, especially with recent cases in cattle born after stricter feed rules were implemented in 1997. Efforts to reopen foreign markets for U.S. beef have faced frustration from industry officials due to concerns about BSE. Canadian, USDA, and industry officials argue that the North American risk profile is unchanged despite worries. They reassure consumers and foreign buyers that U.S. cattle and beef are safe. Frustrations continue over the time taken to regain entry into Japanese and Korean markets. Efforts to restore beef and cattle trade between the United States and Canada have been successful, with some concerns from U.S. cattlemen about cattle health impacts. Congress is expected to continue oversight, provide funding for BSE-related activities, and consider legislative options to address issues in the industry."
