    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Pentagon 9/11 Memorial Commemorative Coin Act of 2004\". It includes findings related to the commemoration of the 9/11 attacks. The Congress finds that the Pentagon was completed in 1943 during World War II. September 11, 2001, was a tragic day for the United States and the Pentagon, where 184 individuals lost their lives. A memorial is planned to honor the victims, to be built on 1.93 acres near the Pentagon, with a target completion date of late fall 2006. Around $30,000,000 needs to be raised from the private sector for the memorial construction.
