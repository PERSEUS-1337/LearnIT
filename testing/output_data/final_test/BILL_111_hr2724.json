National transportation performance targets are established to assess progress over a 20-year period. The National Transportation Objectives Act of 2009 sets targets to reduce vehicle miles traveled, increase walking, biking, and public transportation usage, decrease carbon dioxide emissions, reduce traffic delays, increase rail and intermodal freight transportation, improve air quality, lower traffic crashes, and enhance transportation infrastructure. The National Transportation Objectives Act of 2009 aims to improve transportation infrastructure, reduce household costs, and increase accessibility to essential destinations for low-income, senior, and disabled populations. The Secretary of Transportation is required to develop baseline levels for performance targets and methods for data collection to assess success. The Secretary must develop data collection systems for each Federal surface transportation program to assess consistency with established policy and performance targets.
