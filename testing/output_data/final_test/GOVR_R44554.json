Wells Fargo was fined $185 million in 2016 for illegal sales practices linked to incentive-based compensation. The Wells Fargo incident raises questions about the effectiveness of the Dodd-Frank incentive-based compensation clawback provision. In 2011, financial regulators proposed implementing Section 956, but faced criticism. In April 2016, a new proposal was issued by the Agencies, outlining incentive compensation regulations. The report provides an overview of the 2016 incentive compensation proposal, discussing key elements and early comments on its impact. Incentive compensation refers to variable pay based on performance metrics. The role of incentive compensation arrangements in the financial crisis of 2007-2009 has been scrutinized by regulators, practitioners, and academics. Some have found little evidence linking compensation structures to financial firms' performance during the crisis. Properly structured incentive compensation, such as bonuses and stock options, can aid in employee recruitment. Incentive compensation, like bonuses and stock options, can motivate employees and align company goals. Studies show that compensation structures were not solely responsible for financial institutions' differential risk-taking and performance during crises. Risk culture across banks played a significant role in their performance. Prior to 2008, high-risk financial institutions paid executives high compensation not as excessive but to account for the additional risk. Evidence on incentive-based compensation's effects on risk-taking is inconclusive due to factors like corporate governance. Poorly structured incentives at financial institutions encouraged risky behavior, contributing to the financial crisis. Sheila Bair, then chair of... During the financial crisis, poorly structured compensation systems at financial institutions incentivized risky behavior, leading to the crisis. Sheila Bair highlighted that formula-driven compensation allowed for high short-term profits to result in generous bonuses, without considering long-term risks. Mortgage brokers and bankers focused on high returns in risky markets, with compensation based on loan volume rather than loan performance. The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission was tasked with investigating the crisis's causes. The majority view from a panel studying the financial crisis in 2011 found that skewed compensation structures along the mortgage securitization chain contributed to the crisis. Non-executive pay incentives influenced bank risk-taking, with competition leading to increased risk-taking for short-term profits. Financial regulators highlighted a connection between compensation structures and risk-taking behavior in banks. Financial regulators noted a link between incentive compensation and financial loss, especially for non-executive personnel like traders, underwriters, and loan officers who increased revenue without considering risks. This led to significant losses at major financial institutions during and after the crisis, highlighting the negative impact of poorly designed bonus structures. Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act aims to reduce risky financial-sector incentive-based compensation arrangements by prohibiting arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks or could lead to financial loss. Financial regulators have observed the negative impact of poorly designed bonus structures on various financial institutions, where revenues for bonuses were immediate but risks were realized later. The financial regulators aim to reduce risky incentive-based compensation arrangements by requiring disclosure of detailed information about the structure of arrangements to prevent excessive compensation or financial loss. In April 2011, a proposal was issued to ban inappropriate risk-encouraging compensation plans at financial firms with over $1 billion in assets, mandating compliance policies and prohibiting risky incentive compensation for executive officers. The proposal aimed to regulate incentive compensation practices at large financial institutions, ensuring a balance between risk and rewards, effective risk management, and robust corporate governance. It required executive officers and key employees to defer at least half of their annual incentive compensation awards for three years. The 2011 proposal aimed to regulate incentive compensation practices at large financial institutions by requiring deferral of at least half of annual incentive awards for three years. It also mandated policies overseen by the board to identify non-executive employees posing potential risks and review their incentive-based compensation. The proposal received around 10,000 responses, with suggestions to strengthen it by increasing the duration or amount of deferred incentive pay. Several financial institutions and industry groups recommended guidelines over rules for implementing Section 956, expressing opposition to the mandatory deferral provision in the 2011 incentive compensation proposal. Despite progress in implementing incentive-based compensation plans, concerns remain about attracting and retaining key employees. The Office of the New York State Controller highlighted changes in Wall Street incentive compensation practices to reduce excessive risk-taking. Firms have adjusted compensation structures by increasing base salaries and deferring a larger portion of bonuses to future years. Clawback provisions allow firms to reclaim earlier incentive compensation. Bonuses remain a significant part of total compensation packages for securities industry employees, with clawback provisions becoming more common. In 2015, the bonus pool for City's securities industry employees reached $28.5 billion, the highest level since the financial crisis. In 2016, new incentive compensation standards were proposed to implement the Dodd-Frank Act. Regulatory challenges were faced in formulating these standards. The 2016 proposal for incentive compensation standards faced challenges due to differences in compensation arrangements between banks and SEC-regulated entities like hedge funds and private equity funds. The re-proposal expanded on the 2011 requirements for senior employees to include a larger group of financial institutions and non-senior executive employees defined as significant risk-takers. The 2016 proposal for incentive compensation standards, overseen by six regulatory agencies, targets financial institutions with assets over $1 billion. The proposal aims to regulate incentive-based compensation to mitigate risks in the financial sector. Public comments on the proposal are open until July 22, 2016, with final approval required from each regulatory agency. FDIC Chairman Martin J. Gruenberg emphasized the importance of this Dodd-Frank rulemaking. The 2016 proposal for incentive compensation standards targets financial institutions with assets over $1 billion. The proposal aims to regulate incentive-based compensation to mitigate risks in the financial sector. CFIs are grouped into three categories based on average total assets, with reporting requirements and deferred compensation increasing as thresholds rise. The 2016 proposed rule includes more detailed disclosure and record-keeping requirements for larger institutions compared to the 2011 proposed rule. The proposed rule categorizes CFIs based on total assets into three levels: Level 1 - $250 billion or more, Level 2 - $50 billion or more and less than $250 billion, and Level 3 - $1 billion or more and less than $50 billion. Incentive-based compensation is defined as any variable rewards for performance, including all forms of direct and indirect payments. Payment forms could include employment contracts, pensions, or benefits arrangements. The financial regulators propose rules categorizing CFIs based on total assets into three levels. Incentive-based compensation includes variable rewards for performance, such as employment contracts, pensions, and benefit arrangements. The regulators recognize that these arrangements are critical tools in managing financial institutions. The regulators propose rules categorizing CFIs based on total assets into three levels to manage incentive-based compensation. Inappropriate risk-taking due to poorly structured compensation can harm financial institutions and the economy. The 2016 proposal aims to prohibit arrangements that could lead to excessive compensation or financial loss. The regulators propose rules to manage incentive-based compensation at CFIs based on total assets. Factors considered include compensation history, financial condition, and comparison with similar institutions. Incentive-based arrangements should not encourage inappropriate risks leading to financial loss. The 2016 proposed rule aims to manage incentive-based compensation at CFIs to prevent financial loss by balancing risk and reward, effective risk management, governance, and performance measures. It also requires the board of directors to oversee and approve compensation arrangements for senior executives. The 2016 proposed rule requires CFIs to approve material exceptions or adjustments to incentive-based compensation policies for senior executive officers and maintain records for at least seven years. Specific disclosure and record-keeping requirements are outlined for Level 1 and Level 2 institutions, including maintaining records for independent audits by federal regulators. The proposed rule requires CFIs to disclose incentive-based compensation arrangements for senior executives and significant risk-takers, including deferral, clawback, downward adjustment, and forfeiture mechanisms. The proposed rules require Level 1 institutions to defer a significant portion of senior executive officers' and significant risk-takers' incentive-based compensation for several years, with a mix of deferred cash and equity-like instruments. Options-based compensation is limited to 15% of total incentive-based compensation. Level 2 institutions have slightly lower deferral requirements for senior executives and significant risk-takers. The proposed rule would require Level 1 and Level 2 CFIs to defer a significant portion of senior executive officers' and significant risk-takers' incentive-based compensation for several years, with a mix of deferred cash and equity-like instruments. Options-based compensation is limited to 15% of total incentive-based compensation. Deferred compensation may vest no faster than on a pro-rata annual basis, and potential forfeiture may apply to unvested incentive-based compensation. The proposed rule requires Level 1 and Level 2 CFIs to defer a significant portion of senior executive officers' and significant risk-takers' incentive-based compensation for several years. Deferred compensation may be subject to downward adjustments for poor financial performance, risk management failures, noncompliance with regulations, or other conduct issues as defined by the CFI. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 was enacted in response to accounting scandals like Enron. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, enacted in response to accounting scandals like Enron, requires CEOs and CFOs to reimburse their employer for bonuses and stock sale profits if financial statements are restated due to misconduct. The Dodd-Frank Act expanded on these provisions, requiring the SEC to adopt rules for the recovery of erroneously awarded incentive-based compensation and disclosure of clawback policies. In July 2015, the SEC proposed rules to implement these requirements. The SEC proposed rules in July 2015 to implement Section 954, outlining a public company's obligations to recover incentive compensation from executive officers in case of accounting restatements. Recovery would be required on a \"no-fault\" basis within a three-year period based on erroneous accounting data. The 2016 rules proposed to implement Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act expand on clawback provisions in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the SEC's 2015 rules. Level 1 and Level 2 CFIs would be required to claw back incentive-based compensation from senior executive officers or significant risk-takers for seven years after vesting if misconduct or employee fraud occurs. The proposed rule requires Level 1 and Level 2 CFIs to adopt protocols for adjusting or forfeiting incentive compensation of senior executives and significant risk-takers in case of poor financial performance, inappropriate risk-taking, risk management failures, non-compliance with standards, or other defined trigger events. The proposed rule for Level 1 and Level 2 CFIs includes behavioral prohibitions for incentive-based compensation programs, risk management framework requirements, and authority for individuals in control functions to influence risk-taking. The proposed rule for Level 1 and Level 2 CFIs includes independent monitoring of incentive-based compensation to ensure appropriate risk-reward balance. A compensation committee composed of directors, not senior executive officers, would assist in overseeing compliance with CFI policies and procedures. The CFI's risk and audit committees must report on the effectiveness of risk measures and adjustments in incentive-based compensation agreements. Management must provide an annual assessment of the incentive-based compensation program to the compensation committee. The committee must also obtain an independent assessment on the program's effectiveness in providing risk-taking incentives consistent with the CFI's risk profile. Public comments on the proposal are accepted until July 22, 2016. The SEC staff observed the potential impact of the incentive-compensation proposal on SEC-regulated entities and the banking sector. The proposal includes a clawback provision for employee incentive compensation awards, with New York City Comptroller Scott M. Stringer supporting the policy change for transparency while Alan Johnson cautioned about potential negative effects on the financial sector. The proposal for incentive compensation practices in the financial sector may lead to adjustments in the structure of arrangements for many employees, according to Shearman & Sterling. The proposal includes deferrals for bonuses and long-term incentives, as well as a clawback provision, which may require changes in how risk-takers are compensated. The proposal for incentive-based arrangements in the financial sector could impact fixed costs and governance structures. Executive recruiting firms predict larger salaries and smaller bonuses for senior officials, dealmakers, and traders at major banks. The top 5% of employees at six large banks could be affected, totaling around 52,000 workers if the proposal is enacted. The proposal for incentive-based arrangements in the financial sector may impact fixed costs and governance structures. It is uncertain how many employees would qualify under the proposal's requirements. Registered broker-dealers and investment advisers would likely fall under the proposal's regulatory scope. The estimated number of affected broker-dealers and investment advisers is provided, with projections for different levels of compliance. In the financial sector, the proposal for incentive-based arrangements could affect fixed costs and governance structures. It is uncertain how many employees would qualify under the requirements. Registered broker-dealers and investment advisers would likely be impacted, with projections for different compliance levels. Level 1 investment advisers, including bank-owned entities, may avoid stricter classification levels by excluding certain assets on their balance sheets. For example, Blackstone Group manages $350 billion in assets but only has $20 billion in proprietary assets, potentially leading to less rigorous regulatory oversight. The regulatory regime proposed could impact Level 1 bank-based CFIs like J.P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America, and others, potentially giving venture capital funds and hedge funds more flexibility in pay practices. This could disadvantage large banks in recruiting and retaining senior executives. Economist Peter Wallison has raised concerns about the proposal's impact on bank loans. Economist Peter Wallison has raised concerns about the impact of a proposed regulatory regime on bank loans, warning that it could lead to a reduction in financial risk-taking and a contraction in available credit. Others question the plausibility of these scenarios and the potential changes at large banks in terms of attracting key personnel and loan volume. The proposed regulatory regime could impact bank loans by reducing financial risk-taking and available credit. Some argue that this may not have a significant effect as bank compensation practices have already been aligning with the proposal's provisions since the financial crisis."
