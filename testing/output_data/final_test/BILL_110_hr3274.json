    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"United States-China Energy Cooperation Act\". The December 2004 National Intelligence Council report highlights global economic growth as a key factor driving energy demand, particularly in China and India. Both the United States and China heavily rely on coal for electricity generation. Carbon capture and sequestration technology shows promise but requires further research and development. The need for integrated projects to demonstrate carbon capture and sequestration feasibility in various countries is highlighted. The US and China are collaborating on the FutureGen project to build the world's first zero-emissions fossil fuel plant. Joint research on carbon capture technology would enhance energy security for both nations. Both countries are also focused on promoting industrial efficiency and conservation. The United States Department of Energy's Industrial Technologies program aims to reduce industrial energy use and stimulate productivity. In China, the government is focusing on improving energy efficiency in large enterprises and plans to retire inefficient power plants and industrial facilities. Capacity building in analytic energy is needed in both China and the United States. Both China and the United States are focusing on analytic energy and climate change policy. The grant program is outlined in Section 3. The grant program outlined in Section 3 of the Act requires eligible entities to submit applications to the Secretary for review and selection. The Secretary determines the grant amount awarded for each fiscal year. Procedures for recoupment related to eligible projects that result in marketable products or processes must be established within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The recoupment requirements for projects resulting in marketable products or processes must be proportional to the Federal share of costs and derived from royalties or licensing fees. The Secretary has the authority to waive or defer some or all of these requirements. The Secretary may waive recoupment requirements for projects based on commercial competitiveness, profitability, and commercial viability. Academic endeavors without commercial value are exempt. The Secretary will implement this section through existing DOE programs. Recipients must submit a report on grant fund usage and project success within 180 days. The Secretary may waive recoupment requirements for projects based on commercial competitiveness, profitability, and commercial viability. Recipients must submit a report on grant fund usage and project success within 180 days, evaluating the level of success of each project funded by the grant. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. An eligible entity under this Act is defined as a joint venture involving Chinese and US private businesses, academic individuals, or government entities, selected by the Secretary to carry out projects promoting cooperation on energy and climate change policies between the two countries. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy and involves programs for joint research, development, or commercialization of carbon capture technology, energy efficiency, and renewable energy sources. The Secretary is authorized to spend up to $20,000,000 annually from 2008 to 2018 for this Act, regardless of other laws restricting foreign assistance."
