    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 147.6 of the Labor Code requires employers to use trained and certified personnel for corrosion prevention work on industrial and infrastructure projects by June 1, 2017. Employees must be trained according to specific standards and obtain certification as a Corrosion Application Specialist. Provisions for corrosion prevention work include requiring employers to have at least three trained and certified employees for every uncertified employee, allowing apprentices in approved programs to perform the work, maintaining compliance records accessible to the public, and implementing the certification requirement by January 1, 2020. The definition of corrosion prevention work includes surface preparation and application of protective coatings to steel and concrete surfaces. An exception is made for work on sheet metal, ventilation systems, plumbing, and precast concrete work performed by skilled journeypersons who have completed an approved apprenticeship program. An exception from the standard applies if the surface to be prepared and coated are smaller than 100 square or 100 linear feet. The standards board has the authority to adopt additional standards for corrosion prevention work. The Chief of the Division of Apprenticeship Standards and the California Apprenticeship Council must annually report to the Legislature and the public on activities, including the number of individuals in apprenticeship programs, percentages of women and minorities, and completion rates. The annual report must include remedial actions for programs struggling with affirmative action goals or low completion rates, disputed apprenticeship agreement issues, program application statistics (approved, denied, under review), disapprovals by the California Apprenticeship Council, and any new standards or regulations proposed or adopted in the previous year. No reimbursement is required by this act pursuant to Section 6 of Article XIII\u2009B of the California Constitution as it only incurs costs for local agencies or school districts related to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes or infractions."
