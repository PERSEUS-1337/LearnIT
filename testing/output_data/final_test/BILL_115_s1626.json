    "content": "The \"Cabin Air Safety Act of 2017\" defines a \"commercial air carrier\" as an air carrier operating under specific regulations. The Act also requires training for responding to smoke or fume incidents on aircraft. The \"Cabin Air Safety Act of 2017\" mandates training for flight attendants, pilots, maintenance technicians, and airport responders on responding to smoke or fume incidents on aircraft, including identifying sources and types of fumes. The \"Cabin Air Safety Act of 2017\" requires training on recognizing and responding to smoke and fumes on aircraft, reporting incidents to the Federal Aviation Administration, and addressing potential health risks related to fumes. The \"Cabin Air Safety Act of 2017\" mandates reporting incidents of smoke or fumes on board aircraft to the Federal Aviation Administration. The \"Cabin Air Safety Act of 2017\" requires the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration to develop a standardized form for reporting incidents of smoke or fumes on board aircraft operated by commercial air carriers within 180 days of the Act's enactment. This includes establishing a reporting system for pilots, flight attendants, and aircraft maintenance technicians to submit reports to the FAA and access a database of reported incidents. The Federal Aviation Administration is required to develop a standardized form for reporting incidents of smoke or fumes on aircraft. The form will include sections for identifying the flight, aircraft type, registration number, individual reporting the incident, details about the smoke or fire, and information about the fumes. The standardized form for reporting incidents of smoke or fumes on aircraft includes details such as the type, source, smell, and visual consistency of the smoke or fumes, location, engine information, phase of flight, symptoms reported, oxygen use, effects on flight operation, and maintenance work conducted post-incident. The Federal Aviation Administration will compile and release incident reports on smoke or fumes in aircraft to the public quarterly, with personally identifiable information redacted. Additionally, a publicly searchable database on incidents will be available on a website. The Federal Aviation Administration will provide incident reports on smoke or fumes in aircraft quarterly, with data disaggregated by various criteria such as air carrier, aircraft type, and cause. SEC. 5. INVESTIGATIONS. The Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration must prescribe regulations for conducting investigations within 180 days of the enactment of the Act. Investigations must gather information from various personnel involved in incidents of smoke or fumes on aircraft. The Federal Aviation Administration conducts investigations on incidents involving commercial air carriers, gathering technical findings on components, identifying the cause of the incident, and involving air carriers and collective bargaining representatives in the process. SEC. 6. BLEED AIR MONITORING EQUIPMENT. The Federal Aviation Administration requires commercial air carriers to install carbon monoxide detectors on bleed air streams in various locations on aircraft to monitor levels during flight and alert crew if limits are exceeded. The Federal Aviation Administration mandates carbon monoxide detectors on aircraft to monitor levels and alert crew if limits are exceeded. Pilots must report alarms activating during flight, and aircraft manuals must include procedures for responding to carbon monoxide detector alarms. The Federal Aviation Administration continues research to develop sensors and techniques for monitoring bleed air quality to prevent fume events. This section does not negate the need for investigations or exposure to fumes if carbon monoxide detectors do not activate on aircraft. Authorization of appropriations is granted to the Federal Aviation Administration for the implementation of this Act. Helicopters are excluded from the provisions of this Act."
