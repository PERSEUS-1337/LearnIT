    "content": "The Securities Act of 1933 was passed to restore confidence in the securities markets after the 1929 stock market crash. It aimed to provide investors with relevant information on securities and prevent fraud in their sale. Companies issuing securities must disclose pertinent information to investors, and potential investors must receive an offering prospectus. The act exempts certain offerings from registration requirements. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 established the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to regulate federal securities laws. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulates federal securities laws, overseeing stock exchanges, mutual funds, investment advisers, and brokerage firms. Congress enacted the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, defining the role of investment advisers and imposing registration and disclosure requirements. SEC regulations aim to ensure investor protection and apply to entities in the securities markets and issuing companies. The SEC's mission is to ensure investor protection, maintain fair markets, and facilitate capital formation. The Dodd-Frank Act introduced new securities regulations after the financial crisis, with some provisions seen as excessive by certain Members of Congress. The JOBS Act of 2012 aimed to provide regulatory relief to boost capital formation, especially among smaller companies, by reducing required investor-based SEC disclosures. However, studies have shown that exempting corporate issuers from certain disclosures may lead to lower asset pricing in the markets. The 114th Congress is considering securities legislation to extend the JOBS Act's focus on providing regulatory relief for corporate issuers, aiming to foster capital formation. SEC Chair Mary Jo White has raised concerns about the potential for information overload from lengthy corporate disclosures. The 114th Congress is considering securities legislation that includes backward-looking regulatory relief proposals and forward-looking legislative proposals to modify the regulatory rulemaking process. One bill, H.R. 3032, offers regulatory relief for the SEC by relieving certain reporting obligations to Congress. Additionally, the legislation aims to ease shareholder threshold requirements for savings and loans. The 114th Congress is considering securities legislation to provide regulatory relief for the SEC and ease shareholder threshold requirements for savings and loans. This includes relief for brokers facilitating small company acquisitions, Emerging Growth Companies (EGCs), and advisers to Small Business Investment Companies (SBICs). Title LXXIV of P.L. 114-94, Title IX of H.R. 37, and H.R. 432 aim to increase securities sales thresholds for compensatory benefit plans at non-public companies. Regulatory relief is provided to smaller companies exempting them from submitting financial disclosures to the SEC through XBRL. H.R. 414 seeks to repeal the requirement for companies to disclose the CEO's compensation ratio to the median worker. The curr_chunk discusses various regulatory changes, including allowing smaller reporting companies to use forward incorporation by reference, streamlining disclosure rules for certain publicly traded companies, and codifying the right to resell privately placed securities. The curr_chunk discusses regulatory changes related to public securities trading markets, including evaluating significant regulations periodically, providing a safe harbor for research reports on ETFs, enhancing access to shelf registration for smaller reporting companies, repealing a reporting requirement on customer records, and providing regulatory relief to certain investment advisers. H.R. 3032, 5424, 4139, 4850, 4852, 5311, and 5421 propose various regulatory changes for investment advisers, emerging growth companies, securities registration exemptions, SEC regulatory proposals, proxy advisory firms, and alternative stock exchanges. Additionally, banks and bank holding companies were previously required to register securities with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933 based on total assets and shareholder count. The SEC registration process allows firms to provide financial and nonfinancial data to investors. Small firms face a greater regulatory burden compared to larger firms, leading to higher costs of capital. Exempting smaller firms from registration requirements aims to find a balance between costs and benefits. Title VI of the JOBS Act increased exemptions for certain firms. The JOBS Act raised the SEC shareholder registration threshold for banks and nonfinancial firms, making it easier for them to increase shareholders and deregister. These changes did not apply to savings and loan holding companies. Proposed legislation aims to extend these thresholds to SLHCs. The JOBS Act raised the SEC shareholder registration threshold for banks and nonfinancial firms, allowing them to increase shareholders and deregister. Proposed legislation aims to extend these thresholds to savings and loan holding companies (SLHCs), requiring registration with the SEC if assets exceed $10 million and 2,000 shareholders of record. Deregistration would require no more than 1,200 shareholders of record. The act has been financially beneficial to banks, with some deregistering from the SEC. The study found that the JOBS Act was financially beneficial to banks, resulting in higher net bank income and lower pretax expenses. It also led to increased assets per bank employee. The study did not estimate the costs to investors of reduced disclosure under the Act. Questions arise about potentially expanding the exemption threshold on SEC registration for thrift holding companies, considering differences in exemption levels for thrifts and savings and loans compared to banks, and the balance of costs and benefits of registration requirements for small banks. M&A brokers, also known as Main Street brokers, act as intermediaries in privately negotiated business transactions for small and mid-sized companies. They are required to register with the SEC and be members of FINRA. Some M&A brokers face high regulatory costs, leading them to pass these expenses onto their small corporate clients. SEC registration costs can exceed $150,000 initially and $75,000 annually. To avoid these costs, some clients turn to unregistered M&A brokers, who are in violation of federal securities laws. The absence of registration for unregistered brokers may jeopardize clients' corporate sales transactions. H.R. 37 and H.R. 686 propose exemptions for M&A brokers from SEC and FINRA registration for transactions involving smaller companies, unless certain criteria are met. Similar legislation in the 113th Congress received support from the M&A industry. The 113th Congress, H.R. 2274, had support from the M&A industry for creating a simplified system for brokers handling ownership transfers of smaller privately held companies. A no-action letter in January 2014 allowed certain M&A brokers to provide business sale services for privately-held companies without registering as broker-dealers with the SEC. Some stakeholders support M&A exemptive relief legislation, while others caution that state regulations still apply. NASAA initially backed H.R. 2274 but withdrew support due to removed investor protection features. The JOBS Act created a new class of public company called an emerging growth company (EGC) to reduce the costs of corporate issuance of publicly traded securities. Critics raised concerns about allowing \"bad actors\" in the industry to continue working with business owners. The bill can be found as Title IV of H.R. 37 and as H.R. 686. The JOBS Act introduced EGCs with regulatory benefits during an IPO \"on-ramp\" period. EGCs can confidentially file registration statements, reduce SEC financial disclosures, and delay certain corporate governance requirements. EGCs dominated IPOs between April 2012 and mid-2014, accounting for 84% of domestic IPOs during that time. EGCs have the option to submit a draft registration statement confidentially for SEC review, allowing for a private discussion with the agency regarding the IPO details. This process provides flexibility for EGCs to withdraw their registration if market conditions are unfavorable. If proceeding with the IPO, the EGC must formally submit the registration statement and prospectus to the SEC at least 21 days before the IPO roadshow. Legislation such as Title LXXI of P.L. 114-94 and H.R. 2064 aim to reduce the time between an EGC's filing and IPO launch. Title VI of H.R. 37, H.R. 2064, and other legislative measures aim to reduce the time between an Emerging Growth Company's (EGC) initial confidential draft registration and IPO roadshows from 21 days to 15 days. They also exempt EGCs from certain historical financial disclosures to the SEC before launching an IPO. Additionally, these measures allow a company that was an EGC when filing a confidential registration statement to still be treated as an EGC for regulatory purposes even after losing EGC status. Reducing the time between an EGC's initial registration and IPO roadshow from 21 days to 15 days has been proposed. Critics argue that compressing the timeline could negatively impact smaller and unanalyzed EGCs. A study found that EGCs typically begin their roadshows 43 days after filing with the SEC, suggesting a reduction to 15 days may not be advisable. Advocates argue that reducing the EGC IPO process window from 21 days to 15 days may not have a significant impact and could lead to cost savings. Critics believe that historical financial information is crucial for comparisons and transparency. Additionally, there is little criticism of treating EGCs that no longer qualify as EGCs from a regulatory perspective. XBRL is a global standard that improves the dissemination and sharing of financial data through tags. XBRL revolutionized the way financial data is shared by using tags to identify components of financial data. SEC required companies to submit financial disclosures in XBRL starting in 2009, gradually extending to all publicly traded firms. XBRL assigns electronic tags to financial statements, making data easily convertible and enhancing transparency. The SEC adopted the XBRL protocol for financial disclosures, allowing for dynamic search and analysis of data. This move aimed to automate regulatory filings, increase speed and accuracy, and reduce costs. However, concerns have arisen about the disproportionate burden on smaller companies. Title VII of H.R. 37 and H.R. 1965 propose a voluntary exemption from XBRL requirements for smaller reporting companies with annual gross revenues under $250 million. Proponents argue that the costs of complying with XBRL outweigh the benefits, and the SEC would need to provide a cost-benefit analysis to Congress within a year of enactment. The overall costs of conforming with the XBRL reporting protocol exceed its benefits, especially for smaller public firms. A survey by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and XBRL US found that 69% of smaller reporting companies paid $10,000 or less annually for fully outsourced XBRL services, while 8% paid over $25,000 annually. No companies reported annual XBRL costs exceeding $50,000. The survey found that companies with higher XBRL-based expenditures had costs derived from exceptional circumstances, such as complexities in financial statements and rush charges for last-minute filing changes. Overall, the study concluded that XBRL is not overly burdensome for small companies and is worth the additional cost. Another study reported that costs for XBRL compliance were declining as companies adopted financial management programs incorporating the XBRL process. Some studies have examined the XBRL user side of the cost/benefit debate. Some surveys and studies have shown that smaller reporting companies on the New York Stock Exchange believe the benefits of XBRL-based attributes are insignificant due to the simplicity of their financial statements. Few investors and analysts use XBRL-tagged SEC data, and those who do are often disappointed with its usability and quality. Critics argue that exempting smaller firms from using XBRL could harm investors by limiting access to important financial data. The head of the SEC's Office of the Investor Advocate argues that XBRL regulatory relief legislation could hinder SEC's efforts to modernize disclosure. Small business investment companies (SBICs) funded by the Small Business Administration aim to provide venture capital to small businesses. SBICs provide private equity capital and long-term loan funds to small businesses, with managers acting as general partners and investment advisers. Limited partners, including institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals, supply the majority of the private funding. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the exemption for SBIC advisers from registering with the SEC as investment advisers, affecting entities falling under the category of private funds. The Dodd-Frank Act replaced the broad exemption for advisers of private funds with narrower registration exemptions, including for advisers of SBICs and venture capital funds. Advisers managing both SBICs and venture capital funds must now register with the SEC, with significant costs involved. The Act also introduced mid-sized advisers managing between $25 million and $100 million, who are subject to state registration. Advisers to private funds must register with the SEC if they control $150 million or more in assets under management. The legislative provisions aim to exempt SBIC advisers from SEC registration requirements if they advise venture capital funds, allowing them to use their expertise to build SBICs. This exemption would also exclude SBIC assets from AUM calculations and waive state and local registration requirements for advisers to SBICs. The SBA operates oversight for SBICs and exempting SBIC advisers from registration is seen as costly and duplicative. NASAA expressed concerns about preemption of state and federal registration for SBIC advisers, recommending states be given authority to register them. SEC's mission includes investor protection. The SEC ensures investor protection by requiring public companies to disclose financial and other information through Form 10-K and Regulation S-K. Form 10-K includes corporate history, structure, financial performance, and Regulation S-K dictates non-financial disclosure requirements for various corporate documents under federal securities laws. The SEC aims to streamline and simplify disclosure documents for securities issuers to make them more cost-effective and accessible to investors. Proposed legislation would allow issuers to provide a summary page for Form 10-K disclosures and direct the SEC to revise Regulation S-K to reduce burdensome requirements. The SEC is looking to simplify Regulation S-K by reducing burdensome requirements and eliminating outdated provisions. Proposed legislation would allow issuers to include an executive summary in their Form 10-K disclosures to make information more accessible to investors. The SEC is seeking to simplify Regulation S-K by reducing burdensome requirements and eliminating outdated provisions. Proposed legislation aims to allow issuers to include an executive summary in their Form 10-K disclosures for easier investor access. The JOBS Act mandated the SEC to update Regulation S-K requirements to modernize the registration process, with recommendations made in December 2013. Additional legislation such as Title LXXII of P.L. 114-94, Title IX of H.R. 37, and H.R. 1525 also call for significant modernization of SEC disclosure requirements. The SEC is urged to modernize Regulation S-K within 180 days of enactment, with proponents arguing for swift action. However, some view the timeline as unrealistic due to the SEC's backlog of work, including implementing Dodd-Frank and JOBS Act rules. SEC Chair Mary Jo White has directed staff to provide recommendations for updating disclosure rules based on the Regulation S-K report. The SEC's Rule 701 exempts non-public companies from registering securities when offering them to employees and consultants under certain conditions. Total sales in a 12-month period must not exceed $1 million or 15% of the issuer's total assets. The SEC's Rule 701 exempts non-public companies from registering securities when offering them to employees and consultants under certain conditions. The current $5 million cap on sales to corporate personnel triggers additional disclosure requirements, including risk factors and financial statements. Proposed legislation aims to increase this cap to $10 million to encourage more companies to provide equity to their employees. The proposed legislation aims to increase the cap on sales to corporate personnel from $5 million to $10 million to encourage more companies to provide equity to their employees. Supporters argue that it would align the figure with current inflation and not affect retail investors. Detractors fear it would allow large corporate issuers to deny employee investors corporate disclosures and lead to over-concentration of retirement accounts in employer stock. The proposed legislation aims to increase the cap on sales to corporate personnel to $10 million to encourage more companies to provide equity to their employees. Detractors fear it could lead to over-concentration of retirement accounts in employer stock. ETFs offer a diversified alternative for investors, with sales growing significantly over the years. H.R. 2356 would provide legal safe harbor for broker-dealers to publish research reports on ETFs. The bill aims to bolster ETF research due to their increasing presence in investor portfolios. Critics argue it could shield companies from antifraud claims and limit SEC enforcement. The legislation is part of the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996. The bill H.R. 2354 aims to require the SEC to conduct retrospective reviews of regulations every 5 years after adoption and every 10 years thereafter. This is to identify outdated or unnecessary regulations imposed on insured depository institutions. The bill H.R. 2354 aims to require the SEC to conduct retrospective reviews of regulations every 5 years after adoption and every 10 years thereafter. This is to identify outdated or unnecessary regulations imposed on insured depository institutions. SIFMA supports the legislation, advocating for periodic examination of significant rules and regulations by the SEC. Critics argue that the bill is unnecessary as the SEC already conducts such reviews. Critics argue that the bill H.R. 2354 is unnecessary as the SEC already conducts retrospective regulatory reviews voluntarily. They also criticize the legislation for imposing additional administrative burdens on the SEC, which is already overburdened and inadequately funded. Fees are used to recoup costs incurred by the government, including the SEC, for supervising and regulating securities markets and professionals. H.R. 1975 would authorize the SEC to offset future fees by the amount of excess fee payments made by regulated entities. Proponents argue that fee overpayments are often due to human error or system failures. The bill aims to provide a mechanism for the SEC to refund or credit regulated entities for overpayments. The SEC is waiting for guidance on refunding overages under Section 31 fees. Form S-1 is required for private companies to issue securities and become public. Some SEC filings allow incorporation by reference. Incorporation by reference allows companies to reduce text in filings by referring to previously filed documents with the SEC. Smaller reporting companies may use this for Form S-1 registration statements, as recommended by the SEC's 2012 Government-Business Forum on Small Business Capital Formation. The report highlighted support for policy changes regarding disclosure obligations for smaller reporting companies, with the SEC's EDGAR database and Internet access making it feasible. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Columbia law professor John Coffee Jr. also expressed support, citing efficiency benefits for smaller issuers. Form S-3, or shelf registration, is a simplified SEC securities registration form that could be utilized under the proposed legislation. Form S-3, also known as a shelf offering, is a simplified SEC registration form that can be used by companies meeting specific SEC guidelines. Companies can file Form S-3 in advance of an IPO to issue securities when market conditions are favorable. Companies registering via Form S-3 must have been filing with the SEC for at least a year and have a float of at least $75 million. Smaller reporting companies can also use Form S-3 if they meet certain criteria. H.R. 2357 proposes allowing companies to register primary securities offerings exceeding one-third of their common equity value held by non-affiliates. H.R. 2357 proposes allowing smaller reporting companies not traded on a national securities exchange to register primary security offerings via Form S-3 for up to one-third of their public floats. Proponents argue this would enhance opportunities for smaller companies to secure securities-based funding. Critics warn that this expansion would represent a significant departure from long-standing policies. The proposed legislation to allow smaller companies to use Form S-3 registration for primary security offerings is a major shift from long-standing SEC policies. Critics are concerned that less reputable companies could exploit this to make large offerings without public notice. Currently, investors can resell securities issued in private placements after a certain period, but their ability to do so in the private market is limited. The proposed legislation aims to codify the ability of holders of restricted securities to resell them in private markets, similar to the current practice under Section 4(a)(1\u00bd) of the Securities Act of 1933. This would provide a federal exemption for the resale of securities acquired in private sales from the corporate issuer. The proposed legislation aims to allow holders of restricted securities to resell them in private markets, potentially creating a more robust secondary market. Critics argue that the bill lacks important investor protections present in private placements under Rule 506 and Rule 144A, potentially exposing less sophisticated buyers to risk. The Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978 established procedures for government requests of customers' financial records from banks. Federal agencies must notify individuals and provide an opportunity to object before disclosure. The SEC gained access to customer records without prior notice in 1980 under certain conditions. The Right to Financial Privacy Act of 1978 established procedures for government requests of customers' financial records from banks. The SEC gained access to customer records without prior notice in 1980. In 1995, Congress repealed the congressional reporting mandate under the RFPA, but the SEC was exempt. H.R. 3032 aims to repeal the requirement for the SEC to report annually to Congress on seeking customer records from financial institutions. The legislation received unanimous approval at the House Financial Service Committee's markup on July 29, 2015. The SEC was required to disclose the ratio between CEO and median employee compensation under the Dodd-Frank Act. The agency released proposals in 2013 and adopted a rule in 2015. The rule mandates public companies to include all employees in the disclosure, with some exceptions. The SEC rule requires public companies to disclose the pay ratio between CEO and median employee compensation, including all employees with some exceptions. Companies must disclose the pay ratio in registration statements, proxy statements, and annual reports, and choose a reasonable methodology for identifying the median employee's compensation. Non-U.S. employees can be excluded from the pay ratio formula if foreign data privacy laws or regulations prohibit their inclusion. Supporters of Section 953(b) argue that disclosing pay ratio data would provide valuable information to investors, allowing them to assess workforce morale and employee productivity. They believe that publicizing CEO-worker pay disparity will pressure corporate boards to be more conservative with CEO pay packages, which are often seen as excessive. Additionally, advocates claim that this data will better inform investors in their decision-making process. Advocates argue that disclosing pay ratio data under Section 951 of the Dodd-Frank Act would better inform investors in their exercise of say-on-pay rights. Critics claim the provision is politically motivated and would not provide valuable information to investors due to the variety of corporate structures and business models. Critics argue that the costs of implementing the pay ratio provision lack justification, with compliance costs ranging from $15,000 to $2 million annually for large corporations. Corporate surveys found even higher estimates, with aggregate initial compliance costs ranging from $187 million to $711 million. The SEC acknowledged these estimates but noted they may be too high due to flexibility in calculating employee data. The SEC's final rule on the pay ratio provision highlighted the flexibility in calculating employee pay median, cautioning against unwarranted conclusions in comparing compensation practices. The agency also noted the inability to quantify the benefits of the provision as directed by Congress. The SEC's final rule on the pay ratio provision emphasized the flexibility in calculating employee pay median and highlighted the inability to quantify the benefits as directed by Congress. One study from Singapore found that disclosing higher-than-industry pay ratios affected perceived CEO pay fairness and employee satisfaction but did not impact investor judgments. The study investigated CEO-worker pay ratios in the banking sector and found a relationship between high ratios and shareholder dissent over executive pay levels. The authors argued that disclosing ratios could help control excessive CEO pay. However, the research also found that low CEO-worker pay ratios in the banking sector were associated with increased shareholder dissent. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce criticized the SEC's pay ratio rule as a favor to union lobbyists, while Senator Robert Menendez supported the CEO-to-Worker Pay Ratio for fairness and transparency. The CEO-to-Worker Pay Ratio provision in Dodd-Frank Act is being challenged by H.R. 414, which aims to repeal it. The House Financial Services Committee voted 32-25 to report the bill. Supporters argue that the provision could reduce corporate jobs for political gain, while critics believe repealing it would worsen national income inequality. Legal challenges to the pay ratio disclosure mandate are also possible. Internal controls are policies to ensure financial reporting accuracy. Section 404(b) is a controversial part of this issue. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires outside auditors to attest to a company's internal controls for financial reporting. Small corporations are disproportionately affected by the costs of implementing this provision. The Dodd-Frank Act exempted public companies with a public float of less than $75 million from this requirement. The JOBS Act of 2012 created Emerging Growth Companies (EGCs) to stimulate IPOs by providing regulatory relief. EGCs lack certain investor protections, leading to increased IPO activity but a slowdown in 2015. The IPO market is influenced by various factors, including macroeconomic conditions and investor confidence. EGCs can benefit from regulatory relief, such as the Section 404(b) exemption, which allows them to maintain their status for up to five years. H.R. 4139 proposes extending this exemption for 10 years after the initial IPO, as long as certain criteria are met. Proponents argue that this legislation would be beneficial, with BIO supporting the bill. Proponents of the legislation, including BIO, argue that the bill would provide cost savings, especially beneficial for emerging research-based entities without substantial revenues. They believe that compliance burdens like SOX's Section 404(b) divert funds from research and development. However, a Government Accountability Office report suggests that auditor attestation requirements positively impact investor confidence in corporate financial reporting. The study by Bedard and Graham on investor confidence in corporate financial reporting found that outside auditors detected 75% of internal control deficiencies in small public companies. Corporate managers tended to classify deficiencies as less severe, which auditors often disagreed with. The study highlighted the importance of auditor involvement in detecting control deficiencies. H.R. 4850 proposes three new exemptions from SEC registration requirements for limited securities offerings, including an exemption from state securities regulation for sales to purchasers with a pre-existing relationship with the issuer's officers or directors. The exemptions apply to offerings with 35 or fewer purchasers and total sales not exceeding $500,000 in a 12-month period. The House Financial Services Committee is focused on balancing rules with the need to provide small business entrepreneurs with more options to access capital. H.R. 4850 aims to remove burdens, reduce costs, and support smart regulation for economic growth. Representative Maxine Waters raised concerns about the bill's investor protections and potential loopholes in reselling securities. The House Financial Services Committee is considering H.R. 4850, which aims to provide small business entrepreneurs with more capital access options. Representative Maxine Waters raised concerns about potential loopholes in securities reselling, criticized by the North American Securities Association for creating broad federal exemptions that could lead to financial scams. Companies can raise capital through public and private offerings, but public offerings require SEC registration and disclosure. Private placements under Regulation D (Reg D) of the Securities Act of 1933 allow exemptions from registration requirements for small and emerging companies. In 2014, 33,429 Reg D offerings raised about $1.3 trillion. The SEC lifted the ban on general solicitation and advertising for private placements under Rule 506 of Reg D in 2013. Additional requirements may be imposed on issuers using the Reg D exemption. The SEC has imposed additional requirements on issuers using the Reg D exemption, including filing Form D within specific timeframes, disqualifying non-compliant issuers for one year, requiring cautionary statements in solicitation materials, and extending Rule 156 under the Securities Act of 1933. The SEC proposed new rules to address concerns with market practices in Rule 506 offerings, focusing on preventing fraudulent or misleading sales literature by SEC-registered investment companies. H.R. 4852 aims to prevent the SEC from implementing these proposals, requiring revisions to Reg D rules to prohibit their application on new Form D filings and general solicitations. Critics of the SEC proposals, including former SEC commissioner Paul Atkins, support H.R. 4852 to reverse regulatory uncertainty for companies using general solicitation privileges under Rule 506. Institutional investors hold securities from numerous public companies in their portfolios, leading to challenges in understanding various issues. Many institutional investors face challenges understanding issues related to multiple public company board member elections and shareholder proposals at corporate annual meetings. They often rely on proxy advisory firms like Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass-Lewis to conduct research, provide voting recommendations, and cast votes on their behalf. The proxy advisory firm industry is dominated by two firms, ISS and Glass-Lewis. Criticisms include opaque criteria for voting recommendations, analysis mistakes, and potential conflicts of interest. SEC issued guidance in 2014 to enhance accountability. The SEC issued guidance in 2014 on proxy voting responsibilities and exemptions for advisory firms. The guidance emphasizes fiduciary obligations and the focus on improving shareholder value. Despite this, advisory firms still face criticism for perceived lack of accountability. H.R. 5311 aims to enhance advisory-firm accountability and transparency by requiring proxy advisory firms to register with the SEC, disclose conflicts of interest, and file descriptions of their proxy voting policies. H.R. 5311 aims to enhance advisory-firm accountability and transparency by requiring SEC-registered advisory firms to appoint compliance officers, hire ombudsmen for complaints, and prohibit unfair practices. Corporate subjects would have limited rights of private action against firms in federal court. Representative Sean Duffy believes the bill will foster accountability. Representative Sean Duffy sponsored bill H.R. 5311 to improve accountability, transparency, and competition in the proxy advisory firm industry. The legislation includes conflict of interest disclosure requirements and allows companies to review and comment on advisory firm voting recommendations. The bill aims to give all stakeholders input into the proxy voting process. The Council of Institutional Investors criticized a proposed bill that would impact advisory firm client voting recommendations, claiming it would weaken corporate governance and fiduciary obligations. They argued that the bill was based on false premises, including the idea that advisory firms control proxy voting results. The Council of Institutional Investors criticized a proposed bill for potentially weakening corporate governance and fiduciary obligations based on false premises, including the control of proxy voting results by advisory firms. Securities listed on certain exchanges are exempt from state-based securities regulation, known as blue sky regulation, creating potential cost deterrents for issuers not listed on those exchanges. H.R. 5421, passed by the House, aims to amend Section 18 of the act to exempt SEC-registered securities listed on national securities exchanges from blue sky regulation. The bill addresses concerns about constraints on exchange innovation and competition caused by current law. The North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) criticized H.R. 5421 for potentially undermining the distinction between alternative trading marketplaces and major national exchanges, which could harm investors. The criticism of H.R. 5421 from minority members on the House Financial Services Committee is that the bill would remove the current framework without providing an alternative, potentially leading to confusion and a race-to-the-bottom among exchanges. The Investment Advisers Act of 1940, amended by Dodd-Frank, requires private funds with over $150 million in assets to register with the SEC. H.R. 5424 aims to update and streamline certain parts of the Advisers Act. The House Financial Services Committee marked up H.R. 5424, a bill providing regulatory relief to certain investment advisers managing private funds. The bill would amend federal securities laws, including the Investment Advisers Act, to allow testimonials, streamline disclosure requirements for private fund advisers, and provide regulatory relief for the assignment of advisory contracts. The bill, H.R. 5424, aims to provide regulatory relief for investment advisers managing private funds by amending federal securities laws. It includes allowing testimonials, streamlining disclosure requirements, and providing relief for the assignment of advisory contracts. Additionally, the bill would change regulatory requirements for investment advisers not structured as partnerships and direct the SEC to no longer subject certain private funds to unannounced annual examinations. The group of SEC-registered investment adviser firms praised H.R. 5424 as needed reform to address dated parts of the Investment Advisers Act. Minority committee members criticized the bill for undoing parts of the Dodd-Frank Act and creating a \"Madoff loophole\" by exempting funds from annual audit requirements. Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act requires public companies to disclose the ratio between CEO and median employee compensation. The SEC adopted a rule on August 5, 2015, implementing this provision, including exemptions for funds owned by individuals with tangential relationships to the adviser. The SEC adopted a rule to implement the pay ratio provision, requiring companies to include all employees in the pay ratio calculation, disclose it in registration statements, proxy statements, and annual reports, choose a reasonable methodology for identifying the median employee, and may exclude certain individuals like independent contractors. The SEC's rule on the pay ratio provision requires companies to include all employees in the calculation, disclose it in various reports, and choose a methodology for identifying the median employee. Companies can exclude non-U.S. employees if data privacy laws prohibit disclosure. Certain small companies and investment firms are exempt. Supporters believe the data will help investors assess workforce morale and CEO pay disparity. Senator Robert Menendez sponsors the provision to pressure corporate boards to be more restrained in CEO pay packages. Some argue that CEO pay packages are often unjustifiably large, while others believe they are generally justifiable. The pay ratio provision under the Dodd-Frank Act has been criticized by companies and groups, who claim it is politically motivated and does not provide valuable information to investors due to the variety of corporate structures and sizes. Critics argue that the costs of implementing the pay ratio provision lack justification, with compliance costs ranging from $15,000 to $2 million annually for large corporations. Corporate surveys estimate even higher costs, with aggregate initial compliance cost estimates ranging from $187 million to $711 million. The SEC found these cost estimates to be reasonable in its final rule. The SEC found the cost estimates for implementing the pay ratio provision to be reasonable in its final rule. The agency also highlighted the potential limitations of using the pay ratio for inter-corporate and single company comparisons, cautioning against drawing unwarranted conclusions. Additionally, the SEC stated that the benefits of the pay ratio provision could not be quantified due to the lack of explicit goals in the statutory language. The SEC highlighted the potential limitations of using the pay ratio for comparisons and stated that the benefits of the provision could not be quantified due to the lack of explicit goals in the statutory language. An experimental study from Singapore found that disclosing higher-than-industry pay ratios decreased perceived CEO pay fairness and employee satisfaction. The study found that CEO-worker pay ratios in the banking sector influenced shareholder dissent on executive pay levels. Higher ratios led to more voting dissent, suggesting that disclosing ratios could help control excessive CEO pay. Conversely, lower ratios were associated with less dissent. The study found a positive relationship between low bank CEO-worker pay ratios and increased shareholder dissent on executive pay levels. The SEC's adoption of the pay ratio rule was criticized by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, while Senator Robert Menendez supported the move. The CEO-to-Worker Pay Ratio rule is seen as a step towards fairness and transparency. H.R. 414 aims to repeal this provision in the Dodd-Frank Act, with supporters arguing it could reduce corporate jobs and critics warning it may worsen income inequality. Legal challenges to the pay ratio disclosure mandate are also possible. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires public companies to have internal controls for financial reporting. Section 404(b) mandates outside auditors to attest to senior managers' assertions about these controls. Small corporations face challenges due to the costs of compliance. The Dodd-Frank Act exempts some public companies from this provision based on their public float. The JOBS Act of 2012 created an exemption from Section 404(b) for public companies with a public float of less than $75 million, aiming to stimulate IPOs. This led to the creation of Emerging Growth Companies (EGCs) with regulatory relief but without certain investor protections. Studies show that IPO activity has fluctuated since the EGC regime went into effect in 2010. The IPO market in the first half of 2015 saw a surge in activity, with the strongest year in the past decade. The JOBS Act accelerated some IPO plans, but market conditions, equity stability, and investor confidence also play a significant role. EGCs benefit from regulatory relief, including a Section 404(b) exemption for up to five years based on specific criteria. H.R. 4139 proposes extending this exemption for 10 years post-IPO under certain conditions. The legislation proposed in H.R. 4139 aims to extend the exemption for emerging companies from auditor attestation requirements post-IPO, allowing cost savings for research-based entities. BIO supports the bill, emphasizing the importance of resource efficiency for companies without substantial revenues. However, a GAO report presents a different perspective on the benefits of auditor attestation. The empirical research suggests that compliance with auditor attestation positively impacts investor confidence in financial reporting quality. A study by Bedard and Graham found that outside auditors detected 75% of internal control deficiencies in small public companies, often overriding less severe classifications by corporate managers. H.R. 4850 proposes exemptions from SEC registration for limited securities offerings based on pre-existing relationships with company officers or directors, limited number of investors, and total valuation criteria. The House Financial Services Committee press release highlighted the benefits of H.R. 4850, which aims to provide small business entrepreneurs with more options to access capital. Representative Maxine Waters raised concerns about the bill's investor protections and the need for the exemption it provides. The House Financial Services Committee press release praised H.R. 4850 for expanding capital access for small businesses. Representative Maxine Waters criticized the bill for lacking investor protections and potential loopholes for financial scams. The North American Securities Association also raised concerns about the broad federal exemption allowing public solicitation without financial requirements. Private placements under Regulation D (Reg D) of the Securities Act of 1933 allow small and emerging companies to conduct limited securities offerings without registering with the SEC. In 2014, 33,429 Reg D offerings raised about $1.3 trillion. The SEC lifted the ban on general solicitation and advertising for private placements under Rule 506 of Reg D in 2013 as part of the JOBS Act. The SEC proposed additional requirements for issuers using the Reg D exemption, including filing Form D within specific timeframes, disqualifying non-compliant issuers for one year, and including cautionary statements in general solicitation materials for Rule 506 offerings. The SEC proposed new requirements for issuers using the Reg D exemption, including filing Form D within specific timeframes, disqualifying non-compliant issuers for one year, and adding cautionary statements in general solicitation materials for Rule 506 offerings. H.R. 4852 aims to prevent the SEC from implementing these proposals, requiring the agency to revise its rules under Reg D to prohibit certain actions. H.R. 4852 aims to prevent the SEC from implementing new requirements for issuers using the Reg D exemption, including filing Form D within specific timeframes, disqualifying non-compliant issuers, and adding cautionary statements in general solicitation materials for Rule 506 offerings. Critics of the proposals have praised H.R. 4852, with former SEC commissioner Paul Atkins stating that it would help reverse the current \"regulatory uncertainty\" restraining companies from using their new general solicitation privileges under Rule 506. Institutional investors, like investment adviser firms, mutual funds, and pension funds, hold securities from many public companies. Understanding issues related to board member elections and shareholder proposals at annual meetings can be complex and costly for them. To assist, they often rely on proxy advisory firms to research corporate issues, provide voting recommendations, and cast votes during shareholder voting opportunities. The domestic advisory firm industry is dominated by two firms, ISS and Glass-Lewis, who provide voting recommendations to investor clients. Criticisms include opaque criteria, analysis mistakes, and potential conflicts of interest. ISS also offers paid consulting services to public companies, raising concerns about impartiality. In 2014, the SEC issued guidance to enhance proxy advisory firm accountability, emphasizing fiduciary obligations and shareholder value in proxy-voting advice. Despite this, advisory firms still faced criticism for perceived lack of accountability. H.R. 5311 is a legislative attempt to improve advisory-firm accountability and transparency by requiring proxy advisory firms to register with the SEC and disclose information about their procedures, methodologies, conflicts of interest, and clients. The bill H.R. 5311 aims to enhance accountability and transparency of advisory firms by requiring SEC registration and disclosure of policies. It mandates firms to file proxy voting descriptions, allows public companies to review recommendations, appoints compliance officers and ombudsmen, and prohibits unfair practices. Corporate subjects can take limited private action against advisory firms. The bill H.R. 5311 aims to improve accountability and transparency in advisory firms by requiring SEC registration and disclosure of policies. It allows public companies to review recommendations, appoint compliance officers, and prohibits unfair practices. Stakeholders would have input into the proxy voting process, and conflict of interest disclosure requirements would address advisory firm conflicts. The Council of Institutional Investors criticized bill H.R. 5311, claiming it would weaken corporate governance and fiduciary obligations of proxy advisors to investors. They argued that the bill's premises were false. The Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan praised a section of the bill allowing companies to review and comment on advisory firm recommendations. The Council of Institutional Investors criticized bill H.R. 5311, stating it was based on false premises regarding proxy advisors' influence on voting results. Securities listed on major exchanges are exempt from state-based regulation. H.R. 5421, passed by the House, aims to amend Section 18 of the act to exempt SEC-registered securities listed on national securities exchanges from blue sky regulation. This bill addresses the issue of comparing innovative listing standards with outdated ones from 1996. The report argued that current law tilts the SEC towards constraining exchange innovation and competition, which H.R. 5421 aims to remedy. The NASAA criticized the legislation, stating that it would undercut the distinction between alternative trading marketplaces and major national exchanges by eliminating references to the national exchanges in Section 18. The report criticized H.R. 5421 for potentially harming investors by blurring the distinction between alternative trading marketplaces and major national exchanges. Minority members on the House Financial Services Committee also raised concerns that the bill could lead to a race-to-the-bottom among exchanges. Additionally, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 requires private funds with over $150 million in assets to register with the SEC. H.R. 5424, marked up by the House Financial Services Committee, aims to provide regulatory relief to certain investment advisers managing private funds. The bill would amend federal securities laws, including the Investment Advisers Act, to repeal a rule prohibiting investment advisers from using testimonials and references to past recommendations for sophisticated clients. The bill, H.R. 5424, aims to provide regulatory relief to investment advisers managing private funds by amending federal securities laws. It includes provisions for pooled vehicles with multiple disclosure documents, regulatory relief for advisory contract assignments, and directing the SEC to no longer subject certain private funds to unannounced annual examinations. The Investment Adviser Association praised H.R. 5424 as needed reform to address outdated parts of the Investment Advisers Act that burden small businesses without benefiting investors. Minority committee members criticized the bill for undoing parts of the Dodd-Frank Act related to SEC-registered investment advisers to private funds. The minority committee members criticized H.R. 5424 for creating a loophole that exempts certain private funds from annual audits if they have a tangential relationship with the adviser."
