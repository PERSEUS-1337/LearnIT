    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia Diagnosis and Treatment Act of 2015\". The Congress finds that hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a vascular genetic bleeding disorder with artery-vein malformations (AVMs) that can lead to catastrophic consequences, including sudden death. Early detection and treatment can prevent premature deaths and long-term health complications. HHT results in blood vessels lacking capillaries, leading to spontaneous hemorrhage or stroke. Approximately 30 percent of individuals with HHT have artery-vein malformations in the lung, leading to increased morbidity and mortality rates. 1 in 5,000 Americans have HHT, with 90 percent of affected families at risk for preventable medical incidents like stroke. Early detection and treatment can prevent complications such as hemorrhage, stroke, and brain abscess. HHT is a significant health condition with serious consequences that can be identified early with suitable tests and treated in established centers. Timely management of HHT cases is crucial for saving lives, preventing disability, and reducing healthcare costs. A genetic testing model for HHT diagnosis has been found to save $9.9 million by targeting screening to individuals with the gene defect, allowing for early intervention in treatable cases. Without a new program for early detection, screening, and treatment, 14,000 individuals with HHT are at risk. Without early detection, screening, and treatment, 14,000 children and adults with HHT face premature death and disability. The Act aims to establish a federally funded program for early diagnosis and treatment of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia to reduce suffering, prevent premature death, disability, and lower healthcare costs. It includes the creation of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention section 317U for HHT. The Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will conduct surveillance, investigations, develop guidelines, create a standardized survey, and establish an HHT resource center in collaboration with a voluntary health organization. The Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will collaborate with medical organizations to improve education on HHT. This will be done through public awareness programs and funding for HHT Treatment Centers of Excellence. The HHT Treatment Centers of Excellence aim to collect data on HHT prevalence and stroke incidence, improve patient access to information and treatment, provide data to the Paul Coverdell National Acute Stroke Registry for analysis, and develop programs to increase HHT diagnosis. The HHT Treatment Centers of Excellence aim to increase HHT diagnosis and treatment rates by partnering with designated centers, creating a database of patient information, and including other medical providers. Academic health centers must meet specific criteria to be designated as an HHT Treatment Center of Excellence. The HHT Treatment Centers of Excellence provide medical experts for evaluation, treatment, and education for individuals with known or suspected HHT. They also have administrative staff to coordinate patient care efficiently. SEC. 5. ADDITIONAL HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES ACTIVITIES. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will award grants for an analysis of Medicare data to estimate preventable costs of healthcare for individuals with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), including medical services and treatments, as well as disability expenditures associated with preventable medical events. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will award grants for an analysis of Medicare data to estimate preventable costs of healthcare for individuals with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Recommendations will be made for an enhanced data collection protocol to determine total costs more precisely. The National Institutes of Health will amend the Public Health Service Act to include a section on hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). The Secretary will establish an HHT initiative to improve early detection, screening, and treatment of HHT, focusing on research and increasing awareness. Consultation with NIH and CDC directors is required. The Secretary will establish the HHT Coordinating Committee within 60 days of enacting the section, in consultation with the NIH Director. The Committee will consist of 12 experts in HHT or AVM, including representatives from HHT Treatment Centers of Excellence and experts in vascular, molecular, or basic science. The HHT Coordinating Committee will consist of 12 experts in HHT or AVM, including representatives from HHT Treatment Centers of Excellence and experts in vascular, molecular, or basic science. The Secretary may appoint 4 interim members with expertise in vascular, molecular, or basic science. The Chair of the Committee will be designated by the Secretary from among its members. The HHT Coordinating Committee will publish the names of the Chair and members on the Department of Health and Human Services website. Members serve 3-year terms and can be reappointed. Vacancies are filled by the Secretary. The Committee is responsible for developing and coordinating research plans for HHT. The HHT Coordinating Committee works with national research institutes like the National Institutes of Health to conduct evaluations and make recommendations to the Secretary. The HHT Coordinating Committee provides recommendations to prioritize and award NIH research grants for HHT research, including expanding understanding of HHT, training programs, and genetic testing research. The HHT Coordinating Committee, established under subsection (b), is defined as the Committee in this section. HHT refers to hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Authorization of appropriations for carrying out specific sections of the Public Health Service Act, including $5,000,000 for fiscal years 2016 through 2020. $1,000,000 allocated for an HHT resource center. Department of Health and Human Services to receive reduced funding for salaries and expenses compared to fiscal year 2015."
