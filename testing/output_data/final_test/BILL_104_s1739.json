The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to reduce tax rates on gasoline, diesel fuel, aviation fuel, and fuel used on inland waterways by 4.3 cents per gallon during the applicable period. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to reduce tax rates on gasoline, diesel fuel, aviation fuel, and fuel used on inland waterways by 4.3 cents per gallon during the applicable period. This reduction applies to various types of fuel, including compressed natural gas, and certain methanol or ethanol fuels. Additionally, certain refund rules specify a reduction of 4.3 cents per gallon for fuel on which tax is imposed during the applicable period. The amendment reduces tax rates on various fuels by 4.3 cents per gallon during the applicable period. The amendment takes effect on the date of the enactment of the Act. SEC. 3. FLOOR STOCK REFUNDS. Before the tax repeal date, if tax has been imposed on any liquid under section 4081 or 4091 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the liquid is held by a dealer for sale without being used, the taxpayer can claim a credit or refund for the excess tax paid. Claims must be filed within 6 months after the tax repeal date. On the tax repeal date, a taxpayer can claim a credit or refund for excess tax paid on liquid held by a dealer before that date. The dealer must request the refund within 3 months after the repeal date, and the taxpayer must repay the dealer or obtain consent for the refund. No credit or refund is allowed for liquid held in retail stocks. Definitions for \"dealer\" and \"held by a dealer\" are as per section 6412 of the Internal Revenue Code. The term \"dealer\" includes a producer, and the \"tax repeal date\" is the 7th day after the enactment of this Act. Rules similar to section 6412 of the Internal Revenue Code apply for this section. SEC. 4. FLOOR STOCKS TAX. Imposition of Tax: A floor stocks tax of 4.3 cents per gallon is imposed on liquids held on January 1, 1997, on which tax was previously imposed. Liability for Tax: Persons holding such liquids are liable for the tax, to be paid by June 30, 1997. Definitions: A liquid is considered \"held by a person\" if title has passed to that person. The tax imposed on gasoline, diesel fuel, and aviation fuel does not apply if held for exempt uses or in a vehicle tank. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of the Treasury. No tax is imposed on gasoline or diesel fuel held in the tank of a motor vehicle or motorboat. An exception applies for certain amounts of fuel held by individuals on January 1, 1997, with specific gallon limits. Submission of required information to the Secretary is necessary for this exception. For tax purposes, fuel exempt from tax is not considered for calculation. Controlled groups are treated as one person, following specific criteria outlined in the tax code. For floor stock taxes imposed on fuel, regulations allow for substitution of the phrase \"at least 80 percent\" in certain cases. Similar principles apply to groups of non-corporate entities under common control. Other laws and penalties applicable to gasoline, diesel fuel, and aviation fuel taxes also apply to floor stock taxes, as long as they are not inconsistent with the provisions outlined. The floor stock taxes imposed on fuel are subject to the same regulations as section 4081 or 4091 taxes. SEC. 5. Benefits of tax repeal should be passed on to consumers. The sense of Congress is that consumers should immediately benefit from the repeal of the transportation motor fuels excise tax increase, and producers should reduce fuel prices accordingly. The Comptroller General will conduct a study on this matter. The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct a study on the repeal of the 4.3-cent fuel tax increase imposed in 1993 to determine if the repeal has been passed on to consumers. A report on the study's results is due by January 31, 1997 to the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee. Authorization of appropriations for expenses of administration of the Department of Energy is amended for fiscal years 1997 through 2002. $104,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 1997 and 1998, $100,000,000 for 1999, and $90,000,000 for 2000, 2001, and 2002. Additionally, there is a section on spectrum auctions. The Federal Communications Commission must make additional spectrum available for auction by March 31, 1998, for bands of frequencies below 3 gigahertz, totaling at least 25 megahertz in aggregate, with individual bands spanning at least 12.5 megahertz. The Federal Communications Commission must make more spectrum available for auction by March 31, 1998, for frequencies below 3 gigahertz, totaling at least 25 megahertz in aggregate. The Commission must not assign frequencies designated by regulation, identified by the Secretary of Commerce, or reserved for Federal Government use. Criteria for reassignment must be followed when making frequencies available for competitive bidding. The Federal Communications Commission must promote efficient spectrum use, consider costs to incumbent licensees, prioritize public safety radio services, comply with international agreements on spectrum allocations, and account for costs to satellite service providers from multiple global auctions.
