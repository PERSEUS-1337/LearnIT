    "content": "The Early Federal Pell Grant Commitment Demonstration Program is added to the Higher Education Act of 1965. The Secretary is authorized to carry out an Early Federal Pell Grant Commitment Demonstration Program, awarding grants to State educational agencies for administrative expenses and Federal Pell Grants to participating students. Grants are awarded from appropriated funds for this purpose. State educational agencies receive grants to cover administrative expenses for a demonstration program where 8th-grade students eligible for free or reduced-price meals receive early Federal Pell Grants. Each of the 4 participating agencies receives equal funding. The projects must meet specific requirements set by the Secretary. The demonstration project will be available to 2 cohorts of 8th-grade students starting in the academic years 2007-2008 and 2008-2009. Each cohort will consist of up to 10,000 students qualifying for free or reduced-price meals. The State educational agency will ensure student data collection from local educational agencies. The demonstration project ensures student data from local educational agencies serving participating students and a comparable group of non-participating students are available for evaluation. Each participating student receives a commitment for a Federal Pell Grant if they apply for financial aid during their senior year of high school. The demonstration project requires State educational agencies to select local educational agencies to participate. Participating students receive a Federal Pell Grant with an expected family contribution of zero. State educational agencies must submit an application to the Secretary to participate in the demonstration project, including a targeted information campaign plan. Eligible local educational agencies must serve at least 50% of students eligible for free or reduced-price meals. The State educational agencies must submit an application to the Secretary for the demonstration project, including a plan and description of the student population. Selection considerations include the number and quality of applications received and the Department's capacity for oversight. The Department will oversee State educational agencies' participation in the demonstration program, focusing on financial responsibility, administrative capability, and commitment to directing resources to students in need. States must also demonstrate the ability to run an effective information campaign. The State educational agency will oversee the selection of local educational agencies for a demonstration project, considering the number and quality of applications, capacity for oversight, and ensuring diversity in student participation. The demonstration project will assess a local educational agency's financial responsibility, administrative capability, commitment to focusing resources on students in need, ability to run an effective information campaign, and ensure student participation. The demonstration project aims to involve a diverse group of students in terms of ethnicity and gender. The evaluation of the program will be conducted independently by an organization outside the Department, with a grant or contract awarded on a competitive basis to determine the impact on encouraging individuals to pursue higher education. The demonstration program aims to improve access to higher education by identifying barriers, assessing cost-effectiveness, and determining reasons for receiving or not receiving Federal Pell Grants. It also aims to measure intermediate outcomes such as college-prep curriculum participation, college applications, and standardized test taking. The evaluation of the demonstration program includes assessing participation in standardized tests like the PSAT, SAT, or ACT, tracking pursuit of associate's or bachelor's degrees, comparing program findings with non-participants, and identifying impacts on eligible students' parents. Findings will be widely disseminated to the public. Each State educational agency receiving a grant under this section must develop a targeted information campaign for the demonstration program. The plan should include outreach to students and families at the beginning and end of each academic year. The State educational agency must provide outreach and information to students and families in the demonstration program regarding estimated higher education costs for each academic year, disaggregated by type of institution. The curr_chunk discusses the breakdown of costs for different types of colleges, including public and private 2-year and 4-year institutions, as well as details about Federal Pell Grants such as the maximum amount, application process, and eligibility criteria. The curr_chunk provides information on the application process for a Federal Pell Grant, State-specific college savings programs, State-based merit aid, State-based financial aid, and Federal financial aid available to students. This information is to be provided to 2 cohorts of students annually for the duration of their participation in the demonstration program. The demonstration program involves 2 cohorts of 8th-grade students starting in different academic years. Each State educational agency must reserve $200,000 per cohort annually for targeted information campaigns. Authorization of appropriations is set at $1,300,000 for fiscal year 2008. For fiscal years 2009 to 2013, varying amounts of funding are allocated for specific subsections, with a total of $21.4 million authorized for fiscal year 2013. For fiscal years 2013 and 2014, $14.6 million and $13.8 million respectively are allocated for Federal Pell Grants."
