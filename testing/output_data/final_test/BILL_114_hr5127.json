    "content": "The Act titled \"Curb Opioid Misuse By Advancing Technology Act of 2016\" aims to provide extended exclusivity for certain drug products to protect public health. The Curb Opioid Misuse By Advancing Technology Act of 2016 provides extended exclusivity for approved drug applications, allowing for a 12-month extension if documentation is provided to the Secretary. The Curb Opioid Misuse By Advancing Technology Act of 2016 grants extended exclusivity for approved drug applications based on new clinical abuse potential studies and labeling that characterizes abuse-deterrent properties. Amendments to Section 505(j)(5) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act include provisions for abbreviated new drug applications. If an application is approved after the Curb Opioid Misuse By Advancing Technology Act of 2016, the 180-day period is extended by 60 days if the first applicant provides documentation showing the drug is approved based on new clinical abuse potential studies and labeling. The Curb Opioid Misuse By Advancing Technology Act of 2016 extends the 3-year period for an additional 12 months for approved applications or supplements if they provide necessary documentation. The Secretary must adopt final regulations within 2 years of the Act's enactment, requiring documentation for drug approval based on new clinical abuse potential studies and labeling the abuse-deterrent properties of the drug product. The Secretary must adopt final regulations within 2 years of the Act's enactment to carry out the amendments made by this section, with restrictions on promulgating regulations only as described. The Secretary may issue interim guidance for eligibility claims before final regulations are promulgated, and shall award extensions as specified prior to regulations. Prior to the promulgation of regulations under this subsection, new clinical investigations include studies on abuse potential of drug products in human subjects. Conditions of approval and changes approved in supplements are defined in the Act. The approval of a drug product with abuse-deterrent properties is subject to a 4-year extension before it can be effective, as outlined in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The approval of a drug product with abuse-deterrent properties requires new clinical studies and specific labeling. The terms \"conditions of approval\" and \"change approved in the supplement\" include abuse-deterrent properties for drug products, extending the approval process under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Any extension under subsection (j) of section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act must be submitted within 4 years of approval. This extension is in addition to any other extensions for the drug under different sections of the Act."
