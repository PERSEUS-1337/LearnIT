    "content": "Some Members of Congress are concerned about the cost of redeveloping closed military properties on local communities. Senator Olympia Snowe introduced the \"Defense Communities Assistance Act of 2009\" to help communities near military installations recover from closures or accommodate troop influxes. Representative Chellie Pingree introduced a similar bill called the \"Defense Communities Redevelopment Act of 2009.\" Representative Sam Farr introduced H.R. 2295 as a companion bill to S. 590, allowing the Secretary of Defense to convey real property for military purposes. The bill has been referred to the Committees on Armed Services in both the Senate and House. The Secretary of Defense can use conveyance authority for military property declared excess to defense needs, with fair market value exchange requirements. Advance notice and Congressional notification are mandatory, with an annual report on the authority's use. Section 3 of S. 590 / H.R. 2295 would reinstate this authority. The Secretary of Defense has conveyance authority for excess military property, with fair market value exchange requirements and mandatory Congressional notification. Section 3 of S. 590 / H.R. 2295 would reinstate this authority permanently, allowing property transfer at any military installation without limitation on duration. Additionally, certain municipal services can be contracted out under pilot programs authorized by amendments to relevant statutes. The pilot program allows for contracting out municipal services such as refuse collection, library services, and utilities at military installations. The program is limited to three installations per military service within the United States and contracts must end by September 30, 2012. Proposed legislation would permanently authorize military department secretaries to enter into contracts with local governments for these services under certain conditions. The proposed amendment would allow military department secretaries to enter into contracts with local governments for municipal services, as long as the contract is under five years, represents the least cost to the federal government, and does not increase costs. The authority to make these determinations cannot be delegated below the Deputy Assistant Secretary level. The Secretary must notify the Committee on Armed Services 14 days before the contract takes effect. This amendment references the original pilot program for contracted municipal services established in 2005. The Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2005 established a pilot program for contracted municipal services, initially limited to the Secretary of the Army. An amendment in 2008 expanded the program to all military departments, allowing up to three contracts each, with a termination date of September 30, 2012. The proposed legislation would extend the termination date to September 30, 2020. Additionally, the Secretary of Defense is required to establish a Defense Environmental Restoration Program to address environmental contamination on military installations, with the authority to reimburse other entities for cleanup expenses. The program allows reimbursement for cleanup expenses at military installations by various eligible entities, including federal agencies, state/local agencies, Indian tribes, nonprofit organizations, and owners of \"covenant\" property. This refers to former military property with a cleanup responsibility covenant. Contaminated federal property must be cleaned before transfer, with potential additional cleanup post-transfer if needed. The program allows reimbursement for cleanup expenses at military installations by various eligible entities, including federal agencies, state/local agencies, Indian tribes, nonprofit organizations, and owners of \"covenant\" property. A covenant stating the continuing responsibility of the United States for additional cleanup may be included in the deed of surplus federal property transferred out of federal ownership if hazardous substances were stored, released, or disposed of on the property. The Secretary may enter into agreements with property owners to reimburse cleanup costs if necessary post-transfer. The Department of Defense has cooperative agreements with states, DC, and territories for reimbursement of cleanup expenses at federal facilities. States can participate in cleanup planning but cannot be reimbursed for enforcement costs against the Department of Defense. The proposed legislation would allow the Secretary to enter into agreements for reimbursement of expenses related to processing federal property transfers, in addition to cleanup expenses. The Secretary has discretion in entering into these agreements, which are not mandatory. The Memorandum of Agreement Program would apply to agreements with states and entities eligible for reimbursement of processing expenses related to federal property transfers. The section does not define what activities qualify for reimbursement, giving the Secretary discretion to determine eligible expenses. Recipients of federal property may incur legal or administrative expenses in addition to the property cost. The Section 120(h)(3)(C) of CERCLA allows transfer of federal property before cleanup is complete with certain conditions, including assurances for cleanup and protective land use. The governor's concurrence is required for transferring federal property, which could result in states incurring administrative expenses. The proposed language aims to prevent the Secretary from imposing conditions on funding through a reimbursement agreement. This requirement would apply to any reimbursement agreement, including expenses related to cleanup and property transfers. On September 8, 2005, the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission submitted recommendations to the President. The Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission submitted recommendations to President George W. Bush to fundamentally alter military forces' stationing and functions at various locations in the US. President Bush approved the recommendations, and the Secretary of Defense is implementing them by September 15, 2011. Amendments to the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 expand indemnification for property recipients on closed military installations and require the no-cost conveyance of surplus military property under specific conditions. The Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 expands indemnification for property recipients on closed military installations, protecting them from claims related to contamination caused by past military activities. This provision relieves recipients from additional cleanup responsibilities after property transfer but does not address the United States' responsibility for personal injury or property damage resulting from contamination. The Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 provides indemnification for property recipients on closed military installations, protecting them from claims related to contamination caused by past military activities. Section 330 of P.L. 102-484 indemnifies recipients of BRAC property from personal injury or property damage resulting from contamination. The proposed amendment to Section 330 would also indemnify recipients from environmental remediation of contamination. The Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 indemnifies recipients of surplus federal property from responsibility for cleanup of contamination caused by past military activities. The proposed amendment would also protect new owners from compliance costs with cleanup orders. Section 2905 of the DBCRA specifies how the Secretary of Defense implements recommendations of the BRAC Commission for disposing of excess property. The Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 allows the Secretary of Defense to dispose of excess property through various methods. Section 2905(b)(4) permits the transfer of property to a redevelopment authority for job generation. The Economic Development Conveyance (EDC) requires fair market value consideration for property transfers approved after January 1, 2005. The Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 allows the Secretary of Defense to transfer excess property to a redevelopment authority for job generation. The Economic Development Conveyance (EDC) requires fair market value consideration for property transfers approved after January 1, 2005. The statute permits the Secretary to transfer the property at no cost if the recipient agrees to utilize proceeds from the sale or lease of any portion of the property to support economic development related to the installation. The proposed legislation under S. 590 / H.R. 1959 / H.R. 2295 would remove the fair market value requirement for transferring excess property to a redevelopment authority. The Secretary of Defense would no longer have discretion to grant a no-cost Economic Development Conveyance (EDC) and must transfer the property to the Local Redevelopment Authority (LRA) at no cost, subject to certain requirements. The Secretary is required to implement regulations within 60 days of enactment to ensure surplus property is transferred without consideration for economic development purposes. The proposed legislation aims to remove the fair market value requirement for transferring excess property to a redevelopment authority. It would require the Secretary of Defense to transfer the property to the Local Redevelopment Authority at no cost, subject to certain conditions. The impact of this change on property transfers from the 2005 BRAC round is uncertain, and the legislation's potential effects may extend beyond the current round. Members of Congress may need to consider implications such as allowing LRAs to modify redevelopment plans to include a no-cost EDC. As Congress considers bills regarding DOD property exchanges and outsourcing base support functions, questions arise about the legislation's effectiveness in assisting communities affected by base resizing or closure. The risks and benefits of authorizing military departments to outsource base support services to local governments instead of using DOD employees or private contractors need to be weighed. Additionally, broadening the Secretary of Defense's ability to reimburse agencies for military site cleanup activities is under scrutiny. The Defense's ability to reimburse agencies for military site cleanup activities, including expenses for property conveyance processing, is being questioned. Extending indemnification to cover removal of statutory and regulatory cleanup requirements would increase federal costs but reduce the burden on states or localities. Current law requires fair market value for surplus BRAC property, but the Secretary can waive this for Economic Development Conveyances. The Secretary can waive fair market value requirements for surplus BRAC property under certain circumstances, potentially leading to loss of revenue that would need to be replaced by appropriated funds. The proposed changes raise questions about the cost to the federal Treasury versus the benefits to federal agencies, local governments, and private enterprise."
