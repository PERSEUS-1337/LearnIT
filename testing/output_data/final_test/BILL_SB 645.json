    "title": "SB 645",
    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The After School Education and Safety Program in California serves students in kindergarten through 9th grade at public schools, offering before and after school components. Programs can operate at one or multiple schoolsites with only one application needed for establishment. Each program component includes two elements. The After School Education and Safety Program in California provides educational and literacy tutoring in various subjects, as well as enrichment activities like fine arts and physical fitness. Snacks offered must meet nutrition standards. Applicants for the After School Education and Safety Program in California must ensure meals meet USDA nutrition standards. Eligible applicants include educational agencies, nonprofits partnered with educational agencies, and must fulfill requirements such as documenting partner commitments. The After School Education and Safety Program in California requires approved applications from school districts or charter school governing bodies, with shared responsibility among partners for program quality. The designated public agency acts as the fiscal agent, following fiscal reporting standards. Applicants must incorporate program elements, provide information for evaluation, and adhere to USDA nutrition standards for meals. Applicants for the After School Education and Safety Program in California must certify program evaluations based on specific requirements and provide information on pupil attendance. Grantees are required to review program plans every three years, including setting new program goals and assessing program content. The After School Education and Safety Program in California requires grantees to certify program evaluations, set outcome measures for the next three years, and maintain program documentation for five years. Any changes to program goals or outcome measures must be reported to the department. The department will monitor this review as part of its onsite monitoring process. Section 8482.8 of the Education Code is amended to allow for services to be provided at another schoolsite if there is a significant barrier to pupil participation in the before or after school program. The applicant must describe plans for safe transportation, communication among teachers, staff, and parents, and coordination of educational components with regular school programs. A significant barrier to pupil participation in the before or after school program means either fewer than 20 pupils participating or extreme transportation constraints. In addition to the flexibility provided by previous sections, a program grantee affected by natural disasters or dangers can transfer funds to other program sites to meet attendance targets. If the grantee is unable to operate the entire program, they may request payment equal to the funding they would have received. The state board may approve unforeseen events for program grantees to use certain authorities. The cost of operating a program may exceed the grant amount, allowing for a program to suspend operation for up to five schooldays in a fiscal year. If a grant adjustment is not made, the department can approve an exemption for the program grantee. Cost savings resulting from program suspension must be used by the entity providing direct services to pupils. This subdivision is effective until July 1, 2017, unless extended or deleted by a later statute. Section 8483 of the Education Code is amended. Section 8483 of the Education Code is amended to require after school programs to operate a minimum of 15 hours per week, ending at 6 p.m. on regular schooldays. Programs may request exceptions for early release policies based on community needs. The Legislature intends for students to participate in the full program day. After school programs for middle school and junior high pupils may have flexible attendance schedules and operate during summer, intersession, or vacation periods for a minimum of three hours per day. Priority enrollment is given to daily attendees. Before school programs must operate for at least one and a half hours per regular schoolday and establish policies for late arrivals. The Legislature intends for attending pupils to participate in the full day of the program, with exceptions for late arrivals. Pupils attending less than half of the daily program hours will not be counted for attendance purposes. Before school programs for middle school and junior high pupils may have flexible attendance schedules, with priority given to daily attendees. The administrators of a before school program can operate during summer, intersession, or vacation periods for a minimum of two hours per day. Every program component must offer a breakfast meal. This act aligns with the After School Education and Safety Program Act of 2002."
