    "content": "The \"Energy Efficient Government Technology Act\" is cited as the short title. It amends the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 by adding a section on energy-efficient and energy-saving information technologies. The Energy Efficient Government Technology Act defines key terms and requires federal agencies to develop an implementation strategy for using energy-efficient information technologies. The Energy Efficient Government Technology Act requires Federal agencies to consider advanced metering infrastructure, energy-efficient data center strategies, advanced power management tools, building information modeling, secure telework tools, and mechanisms for realizing energy cost savings. Performance goals for evaluating agency efforts must be established within 180 days of enactment. The Energy Efficient Government Technology Act mandates Federal agencies to improve energy-efficient and energy-saving information technology. The Chief Information Officers Council will recommend best practices, including energy savings performance contracting and utility energy services contracting. Each agency must report their efforts under this Act, and OMB will include this in government efficiency reports and scorecards. The Energy Efficient Government Technology Act requires Federal agencies to enhance energy-efficient IT. The Chief Information Officers Council will suggest best practices, such as energy savings performance contracting. Agencies must report their efforts, which will be included in OMB government efficiency reports and scorecards. The Energy Efficient Government Technology Act requires Federal agencies to enhance energy-efficient IT, including energy-efficient and energy-saving information technologies. Additionally, there is a specific focus on energy efficient data centers. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is amended to involve stakeholders in producing relevant and useful information in collaboration with the information technology industry. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 is amended to involve stakeholders in the development, operation, and functionality of data centers, IT equipment, and software. Stakeholders include hardware manufacturers, data center operators, and facility managers. Input is obtained from Department of Energy National Laboratories, universities, research institutions, and industry associations. Procedures and standards development processes are followed to promote energy efficiency for data centers and IT. The Secretary and Administrator assess the adequacy of measurements and specifications. The Secretary and Administrator assess the adequacy of specifications, measurements, best practices, and benchmarks for energy efficiency programs. A study will be conducted to update the Report to Congress on Server and Data Center Energy Efficiency, comparing estimates from 2007 to new data from 2008-2015. The curr_chunk discusses the impact of information technologies like virtualization and cloud computing, as well as the combination of cloud platforms, mobile devices, social media, and big data on data center energy usage. It also evaluates water usage in data centers and provides recommendations for reductions, along with updated projections and best practices through fiscal year 2020. Additionally, it mentions the Data Center Energy Practitioner Program for certifying energy practitioners to evaluate energy usage and efficiency opportunities. The curr_chunk discusses the establishment of an open data initiative for Federal data center energy usage data to encourage innovation and optimization. It also mentions the participation in international specifications and metrics by the Secretary in collaboration with key stakeholders. The Secretary will collaborate with key stakeholders to harmonize global specifications and metrics for data center energy and water efficiency. They will also develop an efficiency metric to measure the energy efficiency of data centers while ensuring the protection of proprietary information. Passed the House of Representatives on March 14, 2016. Attest: KAREN L. HAAS, Clerk."
