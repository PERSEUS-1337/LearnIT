    "content": "Under a renewable energy portfolio standard (RPS), retail electricity suppliers must meet a minimum requirement of electricity from renewable sources or purchase tradable credits. This requirement is often set as a percentage share of retail electricity sales, using tradable credits to increase flexibility and reduce compliance costs. States began implementing RPS programs in the late 1990s to promote renewable energy in power production, even in states without a restructured electric utility industry. The number of states with a Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) has steadily increased, with 23 states and the District of Columbia having an RPS in place by June 2007, covering about 40% of the national electric load. State RPS targets range from 2% to 25%, with most falling between 10% to 20% and scheduled to be reached between 2010 and 2025. Eligible renewable resources include wind, solar, geothermal, biomass, and various forms of water-based power. Credit trading is allowed in at least 19 of the 23 states with an RPS. Most states have Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) with targets ranging from 2% to 25%. Credit trading is allowed in 19 states. Non-compliance penalties vary. Regional differences in resource availability exist. Some states include energy efficiency measures in RPS provisions. Targets increase gradually over several years to create predictability. The annual target rise and peak value of Renewable Portfolio Standards drive new development and economies of scale. The graduated schedule allows for competition among eligible resources and stability for long-term contracts. Tradable credits lower costs and facilitate compliance by representing the attributes of renewable energy generation. Credits are financial products representing renewable energy attributes that can be sold with electricity or separately. Retail suppliers must acquire credits to meet Renewable Portfolio Standards, which can be done by building renewable facilities, buying bundled power with credits, or purchasing credits in a trading market. Suppliers have flexibility in choosing renewable energy types, prices, and contract terms. Retail suppliers have flexibility in meeting Renewable Portfolio Standards by entering long-term credit contracts, purchasing on the spot market, or buying additional credits from the state regulatory agency for alternative compliance. States may require penalties for failing to meet credit targets, but spreading requirements over time can increase market flexibility. Credit trading systems often include a reconciliation period for buying and selling credits, with options for credit banking to reduce risk and promote economies of scale. \"Deficit banking allows retailers to defer credit shortages to future years. Legislative proposals for a federal RPS have been introduced in multiple Congresses, with varying RPS targets proposed. Senate and House actions have included proposals for RPS targets of 15% and 20%, respectively.\" The proposal aims to add an RPS title to the bill, establishing a renewable energy production requirement for retail electric utilities. The RPS would start at 3.75% in 2010 and increase to 15% by 2020, including resources like wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass. Hydroelectric and municipal solid waste facilities would not be eligible to meet the standard. Retail suppliers could also purchase power to supplement direct generation. The RPS proposal allows retail suppliers to purchase power from other sources, tradable credits, and government credits at an inflation-adjusted rate of 1.9 cents/kwh. Power generated on Native American lands receives double credit, while onsite distributed generation under one megawatt gets triple credit. Excess tradable credits can be carried forward for up to two years. A credit deficit incurs a penalty of 2.0 cents/kwh or 200% of the average market value. States can have stronger RPS requirements, and funds from compliance and penalty payments go towards state grants. Funds from alternative compliance and penalty payments will support renewable energy production in states with low capacity. A proposed amendment to establish a Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) for retail electric utilities was withdrawn during a House Energy and Commerce Committee markup. The RPS would set a minimum electricity production requirement from renewable resources, starting at 2.75% in 2010 and increasing annually to 15% in 2020. Retail suppliers can use energy efficiency measures up to 25% of the standard, increasing to 4% of the total by 2020. Eligible renewable energy resources include wind, solar, geothermal, biomass, and more. Hydroelectric facilities cannot meet the standard but can be excluded from the sales base. Suppliers can purchase power, tradable credits, and government credits. Native American land power gets double credit, and onsite generation gets triple credit. Excess tradable credits can be carried forward. The proposed system allows for the banking of excess tradable credits for up to four years and borrowing of credits for up to three years. A credit deficit incurs a penalty capped at 4.5 cents/kwh or 300% of the average market value. The governor can request up to 25% of a retail supplier's requirement to be met with federal energy efficiency credits. Eligible electricity savings include customer facility savings, distribution system losses reductions, combined heat and power system output, and recycled energy savings from commercial and industrial systems. The proposed system allows for banking and borrowing of tradable credits, with penalties for credit deficits. Eligible electricity savings include customer facility savings, distribution system losses reductions, combined heat and power system output, and recycled energy savings from commercial and industrial systems. S.Amdt. 1537 and H.Amdt. 748 have similarities but differ in exemption criteria, energy efficiency inclusion, sunset date, credit cost cap, and evaluation provision. Both proposals have state grant provisions. The Senate floor debate over S.Amdt. 1537 to H.R. 6 proposed a 15% national RPS requirement. Opponents argued that regional differences in renewable energy resources could make a federal RPS unfair. The Southeastern Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners highlighted the lack of abundant traditional renewable energy resources in some states. The Senate debated a 15% national RPS requirement, with opponents concerned about regional differences in renewable energy resources. The Southeast lacks abundant traditional renewable energy sources, making a federal RPS potentially unfair. Implementing a nationwide RPS mandate could lead to higher electricity prices for consumers without a guarantee of increased renewable generation. This could result in a significant wealth transfer from electric consumers in states. A national RPS mandate could lead to a wealth transfer from states with fewer renewable resources to those with more abundant ones. Proponents argue that a system of tradable credits would allow states with less resources to comply at a lower cost. Funds collected from alternative compliance payments would be used to provide grants to states with limited renewable energy capacity. The proposal has support from environmental groups, utility companies, and corporations like BP. The Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration (EIA) study supports the 15% RPS proposed in S.Amdt. 1537, showing significant growth in biomass generation by 2030, particularly in the South region. The report indicates that the South has substantial biomass potential and would not heavily rely on purchases of allowances from other regions or the federal allowance window. The EIA study supports the 15% RPS proposed in S.Amdt. 1537, showing significant growth in biomass generation by 2030, particularly in the South region. The net requirement for the core region of the South was below the national average. The 15% RPS would slightly raise retail electricity prices but cause retail natural gas prices to fall slightly over the 2005 to 2030 period. EIA noted projected impacts on electricity price impacts. The report highlighted the sensitivity of potential electricity price impacts to the projected baseline generation fuel mix. A higher share of natural gas would make a 15% RPS more economically favorable, while opponents raised concerns about indirect costs for transmission, especially for wind turbines located far from population centers. EEI emphasized the need for costly new high-voltage transmission lines and potential delays in implementation. The growth of renewable generation faces delays due to transmission infrastructure issues. Analysts doubt the ability to meet a 15% RPS by 2020. Efforts are being made to address transmission constraints, such as establishing competitive renewable energy zones in Texas. Biomass power development in the South may face fewer transmission issues. Biomass power development in the South may face fewer transmission issues compared to wind farm locations in the Midwest. Opponents of RPS proposed an alternative measure called the \"Clean Portfolio Standard\" to include energy efficiency measures and other energy production facilities, starting at 5% in 2010 and increasing to 20% by 2020. Eligible resources would expand beyond renewables to include energy efficiency, fuel cells, new nuclear power plants, and new coal power plants. The RPS proponents argued against the CPS proposal, stating that it would not stimulate market development of renewable energy equipment. They contended that the CPS would mainly incentivize conventional nuclear and fossil energy with carbon capture, eliminating the need for additional power from renewables. S.Amdt. 1538 was tabled by a vote of 56 to 39, while an RPS amendment (H.Amdt. 748) was added to H.R. 3221, setting a 15% target for 2020. The bill passed the House by a vote of 241 to 172. The RPS amendment in H.Amdt. 748 set a 15% target for 2020, allowing up to 4 percentage points to be met with energy efficiency measures. Opponents, including the National Association of Manufacturers and the Edison Electric Institute, argued that the RPS could create hardship for states with low renewable resources, impose burdens on electricity transmission and reliability, and raise electricity prices for consumers. They advocated for a long-term extension of federal tax credits for renewables as a more effective form of support. Opponents of the RPS proposal criticized the lack of support for nuclear power and potential negative impacts on coal facilities. They argued against exemptions for certain entities like electric cooperatives and questioned the readiness of biomass power technologies. However, supporters, such as the American Wind Energy Association and the Union of Concerned Scientists, emphasized the need for a national RPS to maximize the benefits of renewable energy. The EIA found that the federal renewable energy electricity production tax credit had a significant impact on wind energy growth when combined with state RPS programs. Supporters of the RPS argued that all states have enough renewable energy resources and that the RPS had been adjusted to include energy efficiency measures. They also mentioned a study showing that RPS would lower natural gas and electricity prices. The House floor debate on the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) included discussions on the exclusion of municipal utilities and the readiness of biomass power technologies. Proponents acknowledged the need to expand biomass resources definition. A report by the DOE Energy Information Administration found that the RPS provision slightly increases electricity prices by 2030 but reduces natural gas usage and prices. The report analyzed two cases regarding the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) impact on natural gas prices and electricity generation. It found that RPS tends to reduce natural gas usage and prices, with residential expenditures remaining relatively flat until 2030. The results showed a slight reduction in energy expenditures in one RPS case modeled. The EIA's analysis of the RPS proposal in H.R. 3221 highlighted potential interactions with other policy changes. Informal negotiations between the House and Senate over energy bills stalled due to disagreements on the RPS provision. The White House threatened to veto the bill if it included an RPS. DOE Secretary Bodman warned against including a renewable portfolio standard in the negotiated bill, threatening a potential veto."
