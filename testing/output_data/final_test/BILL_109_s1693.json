    "content": "Section 1 introduces a new section in the Internal Revenue Code allowing for temporary expensing of equipment used in the refining of liquid fuels. A taxpayer can elect to treat the cost of qualified refinery property as an expense, allowing for a deduction in the year the refinery is placed in service. The election must be made on the tax return and is irrevocable without the Secretary's consent. Qualified refinery property refers to any refinery or part of a refinery. Qualified refinery property refers to any refinery or portion of a refinery that meets specific criteria related to construction, use commencement, and being placed in service within certain timeframes. Qualified refinery property must meet the requirements of subsection (d) and all applicable environmental laws when placed in service. A special rule applies for sale-leasebacks, where property sold and leased back within 3 months of being placed in service is treated as originally placed in service on the date of the leaseback. The requirements for qualified refinery property include increasing refinery capacity by 5% or more, processing qualified fuels at a certain rate, or replacing damaged portions due to Hurricane Katrina. Waivers under the Clean Air Act do not affect these requirements. The taxpayer may elect to allocate a deduction to cooperative owners who are organizations under subchapter T. The allocation is based on the person's ownership interest in the taxpayer. No deduction is allowed for qualified refinery property that was destroyed by Hurricane Katrina. The subsection (a) outlines the primary purposes of qualified refinery property, including use as a topping plant, asphalt plant, lube oil facility, crude or product terminal, or blending facility. It also mentions that no deduction is allowed unless the taxpayer files a report with the Secretary. Conforming amendments are made to sections 1245(a) and 263(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended to allow deductions for expenditures under section 179E. Amendments are made to sections 312(k)(3)(B) and the table of sections for part VI of subchapter B of chapter 1 to include deductions under section 179E. The amendments under section 179E allow deductions for certain refineries. The effective date for these amendments applies to properties placed in service after the enactment of the Act."
