    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Federal Aviation Administration Fair Labor Management Act of 2007\". Impasse procedures are outlined in the Act. The Federal Aviation Administration Fair Labor Management Act of 2007 amends mediation and impasse procedures in title 49 of the United States Code. If mediation by the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service does not lead to an agreement, impasse procedures under subsection (j) shall apply. If mediation by the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service does not resolve a negotiation impasse, the parties must request the Federal Service Impasses Panel to intervene within 60 days. The Panel will investigate and take actions to resolve the impasse using its authorities under title 5. When mediation fails to resolve a negotiation impasse, the Federal Service Impasses Panel must be requested to intervene within 60 days. The Panel considers various factors, including wages, hours, and conditions of employment compared to similar employees, to help resolve the impasse. The Federal Service Impasses Panel considers factors such as overall compensation, including wages, benefits, and the Administration's financial ability to pay when resolving negotiation impasses. The Federal Service Impasses Panel considers factors such as budgets for salaries, operations, and maintenance, changes in consumer prices, employment peculiarities, and collective agreements when resolving negotiation impasses. The Federal Service Impasses Panel considers proposals for salary, insurance, retirement benefits, medical benefits, paid time off, public interests, service provision, compensation of other employee groups, and air traffic control modernization efforts when resolving negotiation impasses. The Federal Service Impasses Panel considers various factors, including compensation, benefits, and other employment conditions, when resolving negotiation impasses. The amendment made by this Act applies to changes negotiated or in impasse on or after May 31, 2007."
