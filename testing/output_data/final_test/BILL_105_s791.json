    "content": "The curr_chunk is a section titled \"TREATMENT OF CERTAIN AMOUNTS RECEIVED BY A COOPERATIVE TELEPHONE COMPANY.\" The curr_chunk discusses the treatment of income received by a cooperative telephone company from nonmember companies for communication services. 50 percent of this income is considered as collected from members to cover cooperative expenses. The curr_chunk amends certain billing and collection service fees for cooperative telephone companies, specifying services performed for nonmember companies. The amendments apply to amounts received after December 31, 1996, with no inference on unrelated business income treatment. The curr_chunk clarifies that the amendments made do not indicate the treatment of billing and collection service fees for exempt organizations under the Internal Revenue Code. Additionally, it addresses the treatment of certain investment income of mutual or cooperative telephone companies. The curr_chunk discusses the investment income of mutual or cooperative telephone companies for determining unrelated business taxable income under section 501(c)(12) of the Internal Revenue Code. It specifies that certain income, excluding reserve income, should not exceed 35 percent of the company's total income. The curr_chunk explains that reserve income derived from an unrelated trade or business of mutual or cooperative telephone companies should not exceed 15 percent of the company's total income. Deductions directly connected with the reserve income are allowed. Reserve income is defined as income that would otherwise be taxable. The curr_chunk states that certain income derived from assets set aside for telephone system facilities is excluded from taxation, with amendments effective after December 31, 1996."
