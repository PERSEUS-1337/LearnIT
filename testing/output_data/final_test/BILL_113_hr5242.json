    "content": "The Act titled \"Stop Child Summer Hunger Act of 2014\" establishes the Summer Electronic Benefits Transfer for Children Program. The Summer Electronic Benefits Transfer for Children Program, established by the Stop Child Summer Hunger Act of 2014, includes definitions for eligible households and summer EBT cards. Eligible households have children who qualify for free or reduced-price lunches or breakfasts. Summer EBT cards are electronic benefit transfer cards issued to eligible households. The Secretary will provide summer EBT cards to eligible households to reduce food insecurity and improve children's nutrition. These cards can only be used to purchase food from approved retail stores. The Summer EBT program provides cards to eligible households to reduce food insecurity and improve children's nutrition. Each card issued is for $150 in food assistance per child per summer, issued at the end of the regular school year. The amount is adjusted annually based on changes in reimbursement rates for school meals. The Summer EBT program provides $150 in food assistance per child per summer at the end of the regular school year, funded by the Treasury Secretary without further appropriation. Regulations must be in place by October. The Secretary must issue regulations by October 1, 2015, for the Summer EBT program. Children enrolled in the free or reduced-price lunch or breakfast programs will be eligible for the program without further application. The program under the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 requires local educational agencies to distribute information to families of children enrolled in schools participating in authorized programs. The Secretary provides agency information on the program authorized under this paragraph, including eligibility rules and application process for children in eligible households. Additionally, assistance is given to households receiving summer EBT cards to make healthy food choices and maximize resources. The Secretary allows alternative timing for issuing summer electronic benefit cards in parts of a State without a typical summer break, as long as it doesn't impact Federal costs. The Secretary considers State's ability to issue benefits under an alternative schedule when developing regulations. SEC. 3. DEFER DEDUCTION OF INTEREST EXPENSE RELATED TO DEFERRED INCOME. Section 163 of the Internal Revenue Code is amended to defer the deduction for interest expense related to deferred income. The amount of foreign-related interest expense allowed as a deduction for any taxable year is limited to a certain percentage of the sum of the taxpayer's foreign-related interest expense and deferred foreign-related interest expense. The amendment to Section 163 of the Internal Revenue Code defers the deduction for foreign-related interest expense. The deduction is limited to a percentage of the taxpayer's foreign-related interest expense and deferred foreign-related interest expense. If the limitation exceeds the taxpayer's foreign-related interest expense, a deduction is allowed for the lesser amount. The amendment to Section 163 of the Internal Revenue Code defers the deduction for foreign-related interest expense, limited to a percentage of the taxpayer's foreign-related interest expense and deferred foreign-related interest expense. The deferred foreign-related interest expense is the excess of the aggregate foreign-related interest expense. The amendment to Section 163 of the Internal Revenue Code defers the deduction for foreign-related interest expense, limited to a percentage of the taxpayer's foreign-related interest expense. The excess of the aggregate foreign-related interest expense for prior taxable years is considered for allocation and apportioning interest expense. The text chunk discusses the calculation of the ratio of dividends received by a domestic corporation from certain corporations to the aggregate amount of post-1986 undistributed earnings. The term 'aggregate amount of post-1986 undistributed earnings' refers to a domestic corporation's pro rata share of post-1986 undistributed earnings of section 902 corporations for the purpose of determining the current inclusion ratio. The current inclusion ratio for affiliated groups is determined as if they were a single corporation, and the subsection is applied separately to different income categories as specified in section 904(d)(1). The Secretary may issue regulations regarding this. The Secretary may issue regulations or guidance for the proper application of subsection rules, including changes in ownership, treatment of certain corporations as affiliated group members, handling deficits in earnings and profits of a section 902 corporation, and making appropriate adjustments. The amendments made by this section shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2014, for adjustments to stock value in section 902 corporations and foreign-related interest expenses."
