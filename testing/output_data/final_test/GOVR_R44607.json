    "content": "The Clean Energy Incentive Program (CEIP) was established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a voluntary complement to the Clean Power Plan (CPP) to promote early reductions of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The CPP aims to reduce CO2 emissions from existing fossil-fuel-fired electric power plants, which accounted for 30% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2014. The CEIP supports renewable energy and energy efficiency activities through incentives to help achieve the CPP's emission reduction goals. The CPP has sparked controversy and received over 4.2 million public comments since its proposal in 2014. After EPA proposed the CPP in 2014, it received over 4.2 million public comments. Members of Congress tried to hinder the CPP's implementation, with a resolution of disapproval passed by the Senate and House in 2015, vetoed by President Obama. The House passed H.R. 5538 in 2016, aiming to prohibit EPA from finalizing the CEIP proposed rule. Various state and industry parties sought an immediate stay of the CPP final rule from the Supreme Court in January 2016. The Supreme Court issued a stay of the CPP final rule until legal challenges are resolved. The CEIP proposed rule aims to encourage states to support energy efficiency and renewable energy projects before CPP compliance obligations in 2022. EPA established the framework for the CEIP in its 2015 CPP final rule and published a proposed rule for the CEIP in June 2016. The CPP compliance obligations are set to begin in 2022. States must submit plans to EPA outlining how they will meet state-specific targets, either through emission rate or mass-based targets. The CEIP will award emission credits for energy efficiency and solar projects in low-income communities, as well as renewable energy projects in participating states. The proposed rule expands the scope of projects eligible for credits compared to the 2015 CEIP. The EPA is expanding the scope of renewable energy projects eligible for credits in low-income communities to include wind, solar, geothermal, and hydropower. States can define \"low-income community\" and choose the scope, ensuring projects benefit these communities. Eligible energy efficiency projects must start operation on or after September 6, 2018. The EPA is expanding the scope of renewable energy projects eligible for credits in low-income communities to include wind, solar, geothermal, and hydropower. Eligible renewable energy projects, including solar power projects in low-income communities, would receive credits for every two MWh of renewable energy generation in 2020 and 2021. Projects in low-income communities would receive double credits for solar power or energy efficiency projects. The credits take the form of emission rate credits or allowances, depending on the state plan. In a CO2-constrained regime, emission allowances have monetary value and can be sold to comply with state-specific emission reduction requirements. For example, in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, prices have ranged from $2 to $7.50 per ton. EPA requires state plans to maintain the stringency of emission targets with credits/allowances issued for the Clean Energy Incentive Program (CEIP). States can allocate CEIP allowances from their CPP emission allowance budget or apply adjustment factors for rate-based approaches. EPA proposes states apply adjustment factor to credits issued in CPP's first compliance period to account for CEIP credits. EPA would match up to 300 million emission allowances nationally during CEIP program life, half for renewable energy projects and half for energy efficiency/solar projects in low-income communities. States with greater reduction requirements would have access to a greater share of EPA credits. In its proposed rule, EPA seeks comments on the intersection of the CEIP and tax credits for renewable energy. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 extended and modified tax credits for specific renewable energy technologies. Concerns have been raised about the CEIP rewarding projects that would have been eligible for tax credits. Some groups have raised concerns about the CEIP rewarding projects that would have been constructed anyway, especially in the context of extended tax incentives. EPA is seeking comments on designing a mechanism in the CEIP to address this issue. Parties filed petitions challenging the CPP final rule in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit starting on October 23, 2015. By the December 22, 2015 deadline, over a hundred parties, including 27 states, filed petitions challenging the CPP. The Supreme Court issued an order on February 9, 2016, staying the legal effect of the rule during litigation. The EPA cannot enforce the CPP during the stay, which delays state deadlines. The agency is working on the CEIP and other measures to complement the CPP. Questions have been raised about EPA's legal authority to proceed with the CEIP while the CPP is stayed. The EPA's development of derivative rules and guidance raises questions about compliance with the Court's stay order and the agency's legal authority to proceed. While some argue that the EPA is enjoined from any CPP-related activities, the agency believes the stay only affects the legal enforceability of the CPP, allowing them to continue non-obligatory CPP-related work. A stay pending appeal temporarily suspends the authority to act, halting or postponing judicial proceedings. It overlaps with an injunction in preventing actions before legality is determined. Nken v. Holder is cited by both EPA and opponents of the CPP to support their positions on EPA's permitted actions during the stay. EPA argues that they are not enjoined from working with state partners to reduce CO2 emissions. The coalition of 27 states and state agencies, petitioners in the CPP litigation, requests an extension for the comment deadline on the CEIP proposed rule, citing Nken to argue that states cannot be compelled to take action related to the Power Plan during the stay. They claim that not commenting on the CEIP proposed rule would forfeit their right to raise objections immediately upon judicial review. The coalition argues that granting an extension would be consistent with past regulatory practices. The coalition of 27 states and state agencies, petitioners in the CPP litigation, requests an extension for the comment deadline on the CEIP proposed rule. They argue that states cannot be compelled to take action related to the Power Plan during the stay and claim that not commenting would forfeit their right to raise objections immediately upon judicial review. EPA extended the comment period by 60 days until November 1, 2016, allowing for tribal consultation on the proposed CEIP rule. EPA believes it has sufficient authority to move forward with rulemakings related to the stayed CPP. EPA is moving forward with rulemakings related to the stayed Clean Power Plan (CPP), specifically focusing on the design details of the Clean Energy Incentive Program (CEIP) component. Despite legal challenges, EPA argues it has the authority to continue working with state partners to reduce CO2 emissions from affected power plants. EPA points to past instances where it revised provisions of stayed regulations, such as the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR). EPA finalized two rules related to the stayed Clean Power Plan (CPP) and the Clean Energy Incentive Program (CEIP) despite legal challenges. The rules do not impose binding requirements unless states voluntarily adopt them. The CEIP does not have mandatory requirements for states and power plants during or after the stay. The CEIP is only mandatory if part of the federal plan imposed by EPA for states not submitting an approvable implementation plan. Judicial opinions on agency activities during a stay are limited. EPA's authority for the CPP and CEIP is under CAA Section 111(d). EPA utilized CAA Section 111(d) as the authority for issuing the CPP and CEIP. The agency also cited CAA Sections 102 and 103 to support its actions related to the CEIP, emphasizing the importance of coordinating with states and local governments for CO2 pollution prevention. These additional authorities are typically used to back regulatory mandates and programs, ensuring uniform implementation and enforcement of CAA regulations. EPA has the authority under CAA Section 102 to encourage cooperative activities with states and local governments for air pollution prevention. Section 103 allows EPA to develop voluntary pollution control programs like the CEIP. EPA can conduct research, provide financial assistance, and support air pollution control agencies. The EPA has the authority to encourage cooperative activities with states and local governments for air pollution prevention, develop voluntary pollution control programs like the CEIP, conduct research, provide financial assistance, and support air pollution control agencies. Section 103(g) requires EPA to conduct a basic engineering research and technology program to develop nonregulatory strategies and technologies for air pollution prevention, including improvements for reducing carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel power plants. This program does not impose air pollution control requirements on any person. The EPA has the authority to develop nonregulatory programs like the CEIP to reduce CO2 emissions. The Energy Star program, established in 1992, is a voluntary labeling program to encourage energy-efficient products. Manufacturers are not required to participate. EPA will accept comments on the CEIP proposed rule until November 2, 2016. The EPA may proceed with other CPP-related rulemakings or guidance during the stay, including finalizing model emission trading rules and federal plan."
