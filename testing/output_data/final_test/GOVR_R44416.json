    "content": "Broadband technologies, including fiber, cable modem, and wireless, are crucial for telecommunications services like voice, video, and data. Deployment has been led by the private sector in the US since the late 1990s, but rural, low-income, and tribal communities still lack access compared to urban areas. Tribal communities are particularly underserved according to the FCC. According to Census data, about 28.3% of Native Americans live in poverty, with tribal communities lacking basic infrastructure like water and telecommunications. High poverty rates, low income levels, and remote locations contribute to poor broadband access in tribal areas. The FCC's Office of Native Affairs and Policy highlights the unique challenges facing Tribal Nations in bridging the digital divide, including deployment, adoption, affordability, and lack of investment and credit access. The lack of investment dollars, access to credit, and start-up financing are barriers to deploying communications services in tribal areas. Challenges include rugged terrain, lack of road connectivity, and difficulty obtaining rights-of-way across Tribal lands. Affordability is impacted by high poverty levels, limiting access to credit and financing. Improved broadband and digital connectivity could help revitalize tribal communities, as identified in the FCC's 2010 National Broadband Plan. The 2010 National Broadband Plan highlighted broadband as essential for economic growth, job creation, and global competitiveness. The lack of robust communication services hinders Tribal Nations' efforts in various areas. Data on tribal broadband was scarce until recently, with efforts by the FCC and Department of Commerce to collect and compile data. According to December 2017 FCC data, 32% of Americans on tribal lands lacked broadband, an improvement from previous years. Tables show broadband availability in tribal lands, with rural Alaskan villages and tribal lands in the lower 48 states most lacking. Adoption rates for tribal lands and the US are compared from 2013-2017. The GAO September 2018 report found that FCC's tribal broadband data overstates access on tribal lands due to reliance on provider-reported data. The report also highlighted that Native Americans have lower internet usage rates compared to other races and ethnicities. GAO recommended that the FCC improve data collection methods for more accurate broadband data. The FCC's tribal broadband data overstates access on tribal lands due to reliance on provider-reported data. Native Americans have lower internet usage rates compared to other races. GAO recommended improving data collection methods for accurate broadband data, including targeted data collection and obtaining feedback from tribal stakeholders and providers. Federal funding for tribal broadband is not precisely accounted for, with most programs open to tribal entities but lacking dedicated funding streams for them. Federal funding for tribal broadband varies based on the number and quality of tribal-related applications received. Some programs do not track funding to tribal areas, making it challenging to determine an accurate overall amount. The FCC and Rural Utilities Service are primary sources of funding for deploying broadband infrastructure in tribal lands. Few partnerships exist for tribal broadband projects. The September 2018 GAO report found that minimal federal funds were allocated to tribal entities for broadband deployment from 2010 to 2017. Only a small percentage of FCC and RUS funding went directly to tribes and tribally owned providers, totaling $235 million out of $34.6 billion. The FCC's Universal Service Fund supports telecommunications services for all Americans through various programs. The FCC supports four programs: High Cost/Connect America Fund (CAF), Schools and Libraries Program (E-Rate), Rural Health Care Program/Health Connect Fund, and Low Income Program (Lifeline and Link-up). GAO identified CAF, E-Rate, and Rural Health as subsidizing broadband for tribal lands. FCC modernized the Lifeline Program for broadband on March 31, 2016. FCC's Office of Native Affairs and Policy announced a renewed Native Nations Communications Task Force on February 8, 2018 to address tribal communication issues. The FCC announced appointments to the Native Nations Communications Task Force on October 24, 2018. The Task Force aims to address tribal communication issues and ensure Tribal concerns are considered in broadband-related proceedings. The High Cost Fund Program, transitioning into the Connect America Fund, provides subsidies to providers serving rural areas, including tribal lands. The 2016 GAO report highlighted that $20 billion in subsidies were distributed between 2010 and 2014, with portions going to tribal land providers, though the exact amount was unspecified. Between 2010 and 2017, nine tribally owned providers received $218.1 million in high cost support funding. Only 11 tribes have providers designated as eligible telecommunications carriers (ETCs) to receive USF support. The FCC established a Tribal Mobility Fund as part of the Connect America Fund, with Phase I including $50 million to extend wireless infrastructure into tribal lands. On February 28, 2014, the FCC completed the Tribal Mobility Fund Phase I auction, awarding approximately $50 million in one-time support to five wireless providers. $16.6 million has been disbursed since July 2014. The GAO reported that one tribally owned provider received $3.3 million in support under Phase I, while no tribal providers received funding. Phase II of the Mobility Fund will provide $453 million annually for 10 years, with an estimated $34 million allocated for deploying wireless mobile broadband on tribal lands. Additionally, on March 27, 2018, the FCC adopted a Report and Order to increase operating cost recovery for carriers serving Tribal lands from the universal service fund. The FCC adopted a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to incorporate a Tribal Broadband Factor into the CAF model, providing additional funding to carriers serving Tribal lands for voice and broadband services. The E-rate Program offers discounts for telecommunications services to schools and libraries, with a significant portion supporting tribal institutions. The Lifeline Program subsidizes providers serving low-income households, reducing monthly costs. The Lifeline Program subsidizes telecommunications service for low-income households, transitioning towards subsidizing broadband service. Eligible nontribal households receive a $9.25 per month subsidy, while tribal households can receive $34.25 per month plus a one-time initiation discount of up to $100 for Link-Up support. The FCC limited enhanced Tribal Lifeline support to $25 monthly for facilities-based providers in rural areas, eliminating support in urban areas. The Rural Health Care Support Mechanism also provides discounts. The Rural Health Care Support Mechanism offers discounts for broadband connectivity to rural care providers. The Healthcare Connect Fund provided $52 million in 2014, with some funds allocated to tribal lands. The Rural Utilities Service has invested $6.1 billion since 2010 in loans and grants for broadband deployment in rural areas, including $512 million for projects serving Tribal Lands. The Rural Utilities Service offers broadband programs for rural areas, including grants for Tribal Lands and organizations. The Community Connect Program provides funding for broadband in unserved rural areas, with tribes eligible to apply. The ReConnect Program, established in 2018, offers a broadband loan and grant pilot program. Between 2010 and 2017, four tribal entities received $13.5 million in funding. Between 2010 and 2017, four tribal entities received $13.5 million in Community Connect grants, making up 11% of total recipients. The GAO found that meeting application requirements was a barrier for tribes to receive grants, with specific regulatory hurdles such as network design, financial sustainability, and matching funds. GAO recommended assessing and addressing regulatory barriers hindering tribes from obtaining RUS federal grant funds for broadband deployment on tribal lands. DLT grants provide initial capital for equipment like video conferencing and computers for rural telemedicine and distance learning. Federally recognized tribes can apply. The Rural Broadband Access Loan Program offers loans for broadband construction in rural areas. Indian tribes can apply. The Telecommunications Infrastructure Loan Program provides loans for telephone and broadband services in rural areas. Authorized in 1949. The Rural Utilities Service (RUS) program, authorized in 1949, provides loans and loan guarantees for rural telephone service and broadband. Since 1995, broadband service is also required for funded networks. Federally recognized tribes are eligible for these loans. The 2008 Farm Bill directed USDA to improve loan programs for underserved trust areas, with low-interest rates, extended repayment terms, and priority for projects in these areas. The Final Rule, released on June 13, 2012, applies to the Rural Broadband Access Loan and Loan Guarantee Program and the Telecommunications Infrastructure Loan and Loan Guarantee Program. Recent examples of Telecommunications Infrastructure loans include Mescalero Apache Telecommunications ($5.4 million in FY2015) and Sacred Wind Communications ($13.8 million in FY2016). The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 allocated $600 million to RUS for a new broadband loan and grant pilot program for rural areas lacking sufficient access to broadband. The ReConnect Program, launched by RUS in December 2018, aims to provide funding for projects in rural areas lacking sufficient broadband access. The program requires that at least 90% of households served have access to a minimum speed of 10 Mbps downstream and 1 Mbps upstream. Mobile and satellite services are not considered in determining broadband access. Approximately $560 million has been allocated for the program. The FOA for the ReConnect Program has $560 million for funding opportunities, with additional budget authority for loans or grants. Entities eligible for awards include Indian tribes, states, local governments, non-profit entities, for-profit corporations, and cooperative organizations. A certification is required from tribal officials for projects on tribal land. The ReConnect Program offers funding for construction on tribal land. Certification is required for eligibility. Priority points are awarded for projects serving tribal lands. Funding categories include 100% loans up to $200 million with a maximum request of $50 million at a fixed 2% interest rate. Eligible areas must lack sufficient broadband access, with a minimum speed requirement of 25 Mbps/3 Mbps for every premise. The ReConnect Program offers funding for construction on tribal land with a minimum speed requirement of 25 Mbps/3 Mbps for every premise. Applications are accepted on a rolling basis through June 28, 2019, with a 50% loan/50% grant combination of up to $200 million available. Eligible areas are where 90% of households lack sufficient broadband access. Applicants must propose to build a network capable of providing service to every premise in the funded area. The ReConnect Program offers funding for construction in eligible areas where 100% of households lack sufficient broadband access. Applicants must propose to build a network capable of providing service to every premise at a minimum speed of 25 Mbps/3 Mbps. Applications are accepted on a rolling basis through April 29, 2019. The program is part of the Broadband provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which allocated $6.9 billion for broadband grants, loans, and combinations. In 2009 and 2010, NTIA and RUS awarded funding for broadband infrastructure projects, with most projects now completed. No new funding is available. Some ARRA broadband awards were made to tribal entities or providers serving tribal lands. Out of $2.9 billion awarded for BIP, $179.2 million was for projects serving Tribal Lands, Tribal Organizations, American Indians, and Alaska Natives. Six tribal authorities received BTOP grants, benefiting at least 65 tribal communities. The Rural Utilities Service identified funding barriers for tribes in broadband deployment partnerships. While no partnerships leveraged funding from current federal grant programs, seven partnerships were funded by BIP or BTOP. NTIA's Guide to Federal Funding of Broadband Projects lists other federal funding programs specific to tribal broadband, including programs from the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Office of Native American Programs. The Indian Housing Block Grant (IHBG) provides funds for housing rehabilitation, land acquisition, community facilities, infrastructure construction, and economic development activities benefiting low- and moderate-income individuals. Eligible activities include housing development, assistance, services, crime prevention, safety, and model activities. The Tribal Housing Activities Loan Guarantee Program (Title VI) assists IHBG recipients in financing affordable housing activities. Another funding source for Native Americans is the Native American and Native Hawaiian Library Services. The Native American and Native Hawaiian Library Services Grant programs offer funding for tribal broadband projects. The Economic Development Administration also provides funding for broadband development, as seen in the example of the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation receiving a grant for a fiber optics network. BroadbandUSA at the NTIA offers technical assistance to communities, including tribal entities. BroadbandUSA at the NTIA provides technical assistance to communities, including tribal entities, for broadband initiatives. The Trump Administration's infrastructure plan includes funding streams for rural broadband projects. The Administration's infrastructure plan includes funding for federal credit programs addressing infrastructure and expanding Public Activity Bonds. Congress will determine the implementation of the proposal. An amendment to S. 2644 aimed to measure universal service support impact on tribal lands, but the bill was not enacted by the 114th Congress. In April 2016, the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs held an oversight hearing on the GAO report regarding high-speed internet access programs on tribal lands. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 allocated $600 million to RUS for a broadband loan and grant pilot program, with eligibility for projects in rural tribal areas. Section 508 of Division P required the FCC to evaluate broadband coverage in Indian country and address unserved areas. Introduced legislation related to tribal broadband includes H.R. 800 (Huffman), known as the New Deal Rural Broadband Act of 2017, which proposed a Tribal Broadband Assistance Program. This program aimed to provide grants, loans, or loan guarantees for broadband infrastructure on tribal lands, technical expertise development, and improving broadband adoption. The bill allocated $25 million annually from 2017 to 2022 for these purposes. H.R. 1581 (Ruiz) and H.R. 3268 (Aderholt) address access to telecommunications and information services in Indian country and tribal communities. H.R. 3268 funds Community Connect grants and broadband loans, emphasizing the need for broadband service in tribal communities. The Committee urges the Secretary to report on challenges faced by Indian Tribal Organizations in accessing broadband service and provide a plan for assistance through the Community Connect program. H.R. 4506 (Torres) and H.R. 5007 (Ruiz) propose studies and reports on federal programs and broadband coverage in Indian country. H.R. 5172 and H.R. 5961 aim to assist Indian tribes in expanding broadband systems. H.R. 5961 includes funding for Community Connect grants and broadband loans to address challenges faced by tribal communities in accessing broadband services. The Indian Community Economic Enhancement Act of 2017 and the Tribal Connect Act of 2017 aim to improve broadband access for Indian tribes by assessing federal programs and enhancing support from the Schools and Libraries Universal Service Support program. With federal assistance, tribal areas can bridge the digital divide in broadband access. The government is exploring various policies to support broadband deployment on tribal lands, including funding, coordination with tribes, spectrum policies, addressing permitting issues, and rights-of-way policies. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai announced initiatives in this regard on January 31, 2017. The FCC Chairman announced the formation of a Broadband Deployment Advisory Committee to accelerate broadband deployment by reducing regulatory barriers. Debate surrounds federal funding for tribal broadband and the need for increased financial support. The 2010 National Broadband Plan recommended establishing a Tribal Broadband Fund, but no legislation has been passed yet. The largest source of federal funding for telecommunications services is the FCC's Universal Service Fund programs, which are transitioning towards a broadband-centric focus. The issue for tribal broadband is how this transition will impact funding to tribal lands and address the low levels of broadband deployment and adoption. In the 116th Congress, additional funding for tribal broadband will depend on the trajectory of overall federal funding for broadband."
