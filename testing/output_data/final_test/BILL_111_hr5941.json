The operator must be independent of entities involved in residential mortgages and be a small business. All costs of the clearinghouse must be covered by the operator. The clearinghouse operator can assess and collect fees to cover the establishment and operation costs. Fees must not exceed the total costs plus a market rate of return determined by the Secretary. The Secretary may guarantee repayment of a loan to the clearinghouse operator to cover establishment and operation costs, with necessary appropriations authorized. The clearinghouse must collect and maintain information for each credit extension application, including applicant details, property addresses, and the entity receiving the application. The clearinghouse system collects information on credit extension applications, including applicant details, property type, lien status, loan purpose, lender names, and entity submitting the application. The clearinghouse system collects information on credit extension applications, including applicant details, property type, lien status, loan purpose, lender names, transaction dates, and other information required by the Secretary for fraud prevention and detection. The information collected is the property of the Secretary and access is limited as prescribed by regulations. The Secretary will also require disclosures to applicants by originators accepting credit applications. Each originator accepting credit applications must provide written disclosure to applicants at the time of application, informing them about the clearinghouse's purpose, information collection process, access limitations, and usage of the information. Access to clearinghouse information is restricted to individuals or entities accepting credit applications. Access to clearinghouse information is limited to individuals or entities accepting credit applications, with specific access granted based on the type of involvement with the credit application process. The Secretary and regulatory agencies can access data from the clearinghouse to investigate fraudulent or illegal activities.

Definitions for the section include the term \"application\" as any writing prepared or received by an originator, submitted for credit consideration for a single-family residence, and identifying the applicant and security property. \"Credit\" and \"extension of credit\" refer to providing time for payment under contractual terms, including various financial transactions. The Secretary, through FinCEN, will issue regulations for contracts, home equity lines of credit, and home equity conversion transactions related to single-family residences. The originator, defined as an entity receiving credit applications, is involved in this process. Effective date for these provisions will be determined by the Secretary. The provisions of this section, effective from January 1, 2011, amend section 310 of title 31, United States Code to include new responsibilities for the Secretary under the Anti-Redlining and Anti-Mortgage Fraud Act of 2010."
