    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Reducing Americans' Vulnerability to Ecstasy Act of 2002\" or the \"RAVE Act\". Congress finds that many young people are introduced to drug culture at rave parties, which can vary in size and location. The trafficking and use of club drugs are prevalent in the rave culture, despite efforts by promoters to portray events as safe and alcohol-free. Despite efforts to portray raves as safe, promotional flyers with slang terms for Ecstasy or pictures of Ecstasy pills send a conflicting message to teenagers, promoting drug use. Rave promoters exploit American youth by facilitating drug use, knowing that Ecstasy causes users to become thirsty. Rave promoters profit from drug use at parties by selling overpriced water and items like glow sticks, oils, inhalers, and pacifiers to enhance drug effects. Ecstasy is the most popular club drug at raves, leading to many teenagers being treated for overdoses and health issues in emergency rooms. Ecstasy use has increased significantly in emergency visits, with mentions growing by 1,040 percent between 1994 and 1999. The drug damages neurons in the brain containing serotonin, leading to long-term brain damage even years after use. An Ecstasy overdose can result in increased heart rate, hypertension, renal failure, visual hallucinations, overheating of the body, and potentially fatal outcomes like heart attacks, strokes, and seizures.
