    "content": "Since the United States resumed \"normal trade relations\" with Vietnam in 2001, controversies have arisen over clothing imports from Vietnam. Issues include dumping, illegal transshipments, WTO violations, and market disruption due to changing trade policies. The import monitoring program and volatility in import data have also contributed to regulatory uncertainty. Multiple shifts in U.S. trade policy with Vietnam have impacted clothing imports since 2001. The U.S. has had trade agreements with Vietnam regarding clothing imports, including tariff reductions, quantity quotas, and subsidy program terminations. Vietnam gained permanent NTR status in 2006. Controversies arose over Vietnamese clothing exports, with the DOC implementing an import monitoring program in 2007. The DOC implemented an import monitoring program on the day Vietnam joined the WTO in 2007 to collect data on specific clothing categories imported from Vietnam. The program aimed to determine if anti-dumping investigations were necessary due to alleged illegal subsidies by the Vietnamese government. The Vietnamese government is accused of illegally subsidizing its clothing industry and dumping products in the United States. A monitoring program aims to gather data for potential anti-dumping actions. Critics argue the program violates WTO agreements and harms Vietnam's exports. The DOC plans biannual evaluations of the monitored imports. The DOC plans biannual evaluations of the monitored imports, which include shirts, sweaters, swimwear, trousers, and underwear. The categories covered by the monitoring program may change based on input received or changes in the trade. Trade statistics for the first half of 2007 showed significant increases in U.S. imports of sweaters, shirts, and trousers from Vietnam. The DOC program reported a 28.1% and 25.8% increase in monitored imports during the first half of 2007 compared to 2006. However, swimwear imports from Vietnam remained unchanged, while underwear imports declined by over 20%. Evaluating the growth in clothing imports from Vietnam using year-on-year data may be misleading due to quotas set in previous years and seasonal trade patterns. The DOC concluded its first review of Vietnamese clothing imports on October 26, 2007, stating there was insufficient evidence to initiate an anti-dumping investigation. Unit prices had increased for many items, and comparisons with imports from other nations did not show a negative impact from the monitoring program on Vietnam's clothing exports to the United States. The Department of Commerce (DOC) completed its second review of Vietnamese clothing imports on May 6, 2008, finding insufficient evidence to start an anti-dumping investigation. Despite no evidence of dumping, the DOC will continue monitoring apparel imports from Vietnam until the end of the Administration. There were no clothing imports from Vietnam for 208 out of nearly 500 Harmonized Tariff System (HTS) lines covered by the monitoring program. The DOC concluded that data did not support an antidumping investigation on Vietnamese clothing imports. A third review was scheduled for September 2008, keeping the monitoring program an ongoing concern for U.S. stakeholders. The Administration decided not to take any actions such as initiating an investigation or negotiating a new textile agreement. After terminating a trade embargo in 1994, the US and Vietnam had slow trade growth due to Vietnam's lack of normal trade relations status. Vietnam needed legislation or a bilateral agreement for NTR status, leading to ongoing monitoring of clothing imports. Vietnam's exports to the United States faced higher tariff rates without NTR status, leading to a significant increase in U.S. imports from Vietnam after a bilateral trade agreement was reached in 2000. President Clinton waived the Jackson-Vanik amendment to grant Vietnam temporary NTR status. The U.S. Congress and Vietnam's National Assembly passed enabling legislation to extend temporary \"normal trade relations\" (NTR) status to Vietnam on December 10, 2001. Vietnam's exports to the United States increased significantly, with the clothing industry being a major beneficiary. However, the impact of the temporary NTR status was limited due to its impermanent nature, requiring annual reconfirmation by the President and Congress having the authority to override it. The authority of Congress to override the President's reconfirmation of Vietnam's temporary NTR status via a joint resolution was highlighted. The theoretical risks of Vietnam losing NTR status created barriers to trade in the international clothing market, affecting both retailers and investors. Congressional debate over the bilateral trade agreement with Vietnam was ongoing during this period. During the congressional debate over the bilateral trade agreement with Vietnam, Members of Congress urged President Bush to negotiate a separate bilateral textile agreement with Vietnam. Concerns were raised about the potential damage to U.S. clothing and textile companies and workers due to the lack of quotas on Vietnam's clothing exports to the United States. Negotiations for a separate bilateral textile agreement began soon after. Negotiations for a separate bilateral textile agreement with Vietnam began after the bilateral trade agreement went into effect. On April 25, 2003, the two nations agreed to quantity quotas on 38 categories of clothing imports from Vietnam, effective from May 1, 2003, until December 31, 2004. The agreement included annual quantity increases for wool and other products unless terminated or renegotiated by December 1. Both nations pledged to combat circumvention of U.S. import quotas, with Vietnam also lowering tariffs on U.S. clothing and textiles exports to 7%. The bilateral textile agreement between the United States and Vietnam led to a decrease in tariffs on U.S. clothing and textiles exports to Vietnam. Despite a rapid increase in total exports to the United States, the growth in clothing exports slowed down. U.S. imports from Vietnam rose steadily, while clothing imports from Vietnam also increased, but the share of clothing in Vietnam's total exports to the United States declined. Import quotas on Vietnamese clothing changed the composition of Vietnam's clothing exports to the United States. Vietnam's clothing exports to the United States were affected by import quotas, with 78.1% of exports subject to quotas. The value of clothing exports subject to quotas increased by 17.8% over three years, while those not subject to quotas grew by 104.5%. Despite the quotas, Vietnamese clothing exports subject to quotas still contributed 67.2% of total bilateral clothing exports to the United States. The actual cap on imports from Vietnam only partially explains the decrease in growth of clothing exports. During the four years of import restrictions on Vietnamese clothing, U.S. imports only fully utilized the quota in 2003. Importers may shift sourcing to avoid exceeding the cap, diverting trade to other nations. Congressional interest in U.S. clothing imports from Vietnam resurfaced during WTO accession negotiations. During Vietnam's WTO accession negotiations, U.S. textile manufacturers pushed for import quotas on Vietnamese clothing products, similar to China's agreement. However, these provisions were not included. The agreement required Vietnam to end non-WTO compliant subsidy programs for its clothing industry. An enforcement mechanism allowed the U.S. or other WTO members to impose import quotas if Vietnam did not comply within the first 12 months. Vietnam's non-WTO compliant subsidies were not terminated. Congressional approval was needed to grant Vietnam permanent NTR status due to its WTO membership. Opposition to this extension focused on human rights abuses, discrimination against foreign-owned companies, and inadequate intellectual property rights protection. Senators objected to the lack of safeguard measures in the WTO agreement to protect the U.S. clothing and textile industry from a potential surge in imports from Vietnam. They placed a \"hold\" on the bill in the Senate. Senators Dole and Graham expressed concerns about Vietnam's WTO accession terms and the U.S.-Vietnam bilateral agreement, specifically regarding the potential impact on the U.S. textile industry. They highlighted Vietnam's ability to lower prices through state-sponsored systems and emphasized the need for mechanisms to defend against unfair competition. USTR Schwab and U.S. Commerce Secretary pledged to monitor Vietnamese clothing imports for dumping upon WTO accession. If evidence of dumping is found and domestic industry cooperates, anti-dumping investigations will be initiated. Senators Dole and Graham lifted hold on Vietnam's NTR legislation. The House of Representatives passed H.R. 6406 granting Vietnam permanent NTR status, which was signed into law by President Bush on December 20, 2006. This allowed the United States to formally extend permanent NTR status to Vietnam before it became the 150th member of the WTO. This marked a new phase of free trade relations between the two countries, including the discontinuation of quantity restrictions on clothing imports from Vietnam. The United States discontinued quantity restrictions on clothing imports from Vietnam and made clothing imports permanently eligible for lower NTR tariff rates. Vietnam pledged to end non-WTO compliant subsidies to its clothing and textile industries to avoid import quotas. The U.S. proposed a monitoring program to oversee clothing imports from Vietnam. The proposed monitoring program for clothing imports from Vietnam would begin upon Vietnam's accession to the WTO and expire at the end of the current administration. The program aims to collect data on specific clothing categories such as trousers, shirts, underwear, swimwear, and sweaters. Comments on the program were to be submitted by December 27, 2006, with a public hearing scheduled for April 24, 2007 in Washington, DC. The Import Administration announced a revised monitoring program for clothing imports from Vietnam, focusing on specific textile and apparel categories of greatest significance. The program may change based on trade trends, input from interested parties, and the Department of Commerce's understanding of the industry structure. The Department announced a monitoring program for clothing imports from Vietnam, with biannual evaluations to determine anti-dumping investigation initiation. Some members of Congress questioned the program's legality and economic merits. Several Representatives expressed concerns about the disruption in trade caused by the import monitoring program for clothing imports from Vietnam. They questioned the program's legitimacy, economic benefits, and potential violations of World Trade Organization agreements. The Representatives suggested limiting the scope of the monitoring program to specific apparel products produced in a commercially viable manner in the United States. Senators Feinstein and Smith have raised concerns about monitoring programs for imports from Vietnam, requesting transparency and justification for the programs from the Department of Commerce. They emphasized the need for the programs to align with statutory requirements and international obligations. Senator Smith raised concerns about a monitoring program for imports from Vietnam, suggesting it undergo the usual rulemaking process. Opposition to the program came from various segments of the U.S. business community, expressing disappointment and stating it could harm business opportunities in Vietnam. During the Bush Administration, there were criticisms from U.S. companies, Members of Congress, and the Vietnamese government regarding a monitoring program for Vietnamese imports. The Import Administration received mostly negative public comments about the program, with concerns raised about its statutory authority, international obligations, and lack of support from the U.S. clothing manufacturing industry. The U.S. Association of Importers of Textiles and Apparel urged the Department of Commerce to drop the program due to lack of industry support. The monitoring program for Vietnamese imports faced criticism during the Bush Administration, with concerns raised about its lack of support from U.S. apparel manufacturers. Wilbur L. Ross, Jr. questioned the program's purpose, noting the lack of competitive American clothing producers. Stephanie Lester highlighted that most products purchased from Vietnam by RILA members could not be supplied domestically. Gary Ross of the USA-ITA expressed concerns about the program's potential negative impact on U.S. companies sourcing clothing from Vietnam. The monitoring program for Vietnamese imports has led USA-ITA member companies to reconsider Vietnam as a sourcing option, with importers and retailers planning for worst-case scenarios. NRF members have decided to limit their exposure to Vietnam due to the program's unpredictability and risk to their sourcing operations. The NRF members are considering limiting their orders from Vietnam in response to the monitoring program, which may lead to cancelled orders moving to other Asian countries. U.S. businesses are critical of the program's biannual review mechanism, citing market uncertainty and potential burdens on apparel importers. Several critics raised concerns about the vague methodology used in the monitoring program, stating that the data collected was not clear on how it could evaluate dumping allegations. They argued that the import categories being monitored were too broad for anti-dumping investigations and that U.S. manufacturing data was not easily comparable. Critics called for the Import Administration to clarify and make their methodology more transparent before implementing the program. The Import Administration received joint submissions from two Korean trade associations, KITA and KAIA, criticizing the proposed monitoring program. While most comments were negative, some supported it due to concerns about a surge in Vietnamese clothing imports harming U.S. manufacturers and the dominance of state-owned manufacturers in Vietnam. The National Council of Textile Organizations (NCTO) and the American Manufacturing Trade Action Coalition (AMTAC) expressed concerns about the surge in Vietnamese clothing imports to the U.S. due to state-owned manufacturers and alleged subsidies. They emphasized the need for a monitoring program to address these issues promptly. Vietnam's clothing exports to the U.S. have increased significantly since gaining access to the market in 2001. The dominance of state-owned factories in Vietnam's clothing industry is seen as a factor contributing to this growth. AMTAC highlights Vinatex as the 10th largest garment producer globally, emphasizing the need for a monitoring program to address concerns about subsidies and state-owned manufacturers. Supporters of the monitoring program claim that state-owned factories in Vietnam receive significant subsidies from the government, allowing them to export clothing below fair market value. These subsidies include preferential interest rates, wage controls, export subsidies, and direct investments by the Vietnamese government. The issue raised by supporters of the monitoring program in Vietnam's clothing industry is the ease of shifting production between different apparel products due to the labor-intensive and semi-skilled nature of manufacturing. The NCTO emphasizes that sewing operators can produce a variety of garments from a single machine, highlighting the need for the monitoring program to cover a wide range of apparel. The Vietnamese government and clothing manufacturers responded critically to a proposed monitoring program, citing concerns about potential violations of U.S. WTO obligations and negative impacts on legitimate trade. The Vietnam Textile and Apparel Association challenged perceptions of the industry as state-owned and heavily subsidized. The Vietnamese government and clothing manufacturers criticized the Commerce Department's anti-dumping investigations on Vietnamese clothing exports, citing violations of WTO obligations and negative impacts on legitimate trade. The Trade Ministry's letter emphasized the program's inconsistency with GATT 1994 and the Bilateral Agreement between Vietnam and the United States. It highlighted concerns about the program causing worries and instability for U.S. importers. The Vietnamese government and clothing manufacturers criticized the Commerce Department's anti-dumping investigations on Vietnamese clothing exports, citing violations of WTO obligations and negative impacts on legitimate trade. The Trade Ministry protested the 'Monitoring Program on Textile and Apparel Import from Vietnam,' stating it creates worries and instability for U.S. importers and disrupts production planning for Vietnam textile and apparel manufacturers. The program was deemed discriminatory and a violation of WTO principles. The Vietnamese government and clothing manufacturers criticized the Commerce Department's anti-dumping investigations on Vietnamese clothing exports, citing violations of WTO obligations. The monitoring program was accused of nullifying benefits of WTO membership and reducing legitimate trade, impacting jobs in Vietnam. VITAS challenged assertions that Vietnam's textile industry is state-owned and heavily subsidized, stating that only 50 out of over 2,000 enterprises are state-owned. The letter from VITAS contested claims about state-owned enterprises dominating Vietnam's clothing exports to the US, stating that only 25 state-owned enterprises exported to the US in 2005. VITAS also mentioned that all state-owned clothing and textile enterprises in Vietnam will be privatized by 2008. They disputed allegations of heavy subsidization, stating that Vietnam has fulfilled its WTO obligations to terminate prohibited subsidies. The U.S. Department of Commerce implemented a monitoring program on January 19, 2007, targeting Vietnam's clothing and textile industry for prohibited subsidies. Specific product categories included trousers for men, women, and children made from cotton, wool, and man-made fibers. VITAS argued that the existing WTO mechanism should be used to address any subsidy claims instead of a special monitoring program. The U.S. Department of Commerce implemented a monitoring program on January 19, 2007, targeting Vietnam's clothing and textile industry for prohibited subsidies. Specific product categories included trousers, shirts, underwear, swimwear, and sweaters made from cotton, wool, man-made fibers, and silk or vegetable fibers. VITAS argued that the existing WTO mechanism should be used to address any subsidy claims instead of a special monitoring program. The U.S. Department of Commerce implemented a monitoring program on January 19, 2007, targeting Vietnam's clothing and textile industry for prohibited subsidies. Specific product categories included trousers, shirts, underwear, swimwear, and sweaters made from various fibers. The Import Administration of the Department of Commerce is responsible for administering the program, with data being released to the public by the Office of Textiles and Apparel. Monthly data on quantity, unit value, and total value is available on the OTEXA website. Biannual reviews of import data are planned at the 10-digit HTS code level. The U.S. Department of Commerce conducted biannual reviews of import data at the 10-digit HTS level for clothing imports from Vietnam. The first two reviews in 2007 and 2008 found insufficient evidence to initiate an anti-dumping investigation. Despite this, the DOC continued to monitor imports and planned a third review in September 2008. The U.S. Department of Commerce found insufficient evidence to start an antidumping investigation for selected clothing categories imported from Vietnam. Assistant Secretary Spooner stated that after a thorough analysis, they did not find evidence of dumping. The DOC will continue to monitor apparel imports from Vietnam until the end of the Administration. The details of the review were not released, but it was mentioned that many of the 169 monitored HTS lines with imports from Vietnam had rising unit values. The U.S. Department of Commerce found no evidence of dumping in selected clothing categories imported from Vietnam. The DOC will continue to monitor apparel imports from Vietnam. Many of the monitored HTS lines with imports from Vietnam had rising unit values. DOC compared unit values and import levels for Vietnam to other clothing suppliers for the United States. The comparison did not include Canada, China, Hong Kong, and Mexico. The DOC will continue to monitor trade in these categories in the next review starting in March 2008. The U.S. Department of Commerce found no evidence of dumping in clothing categories imported from Vietnam. The monitoring program will continue to cover shirts, sweaters, swimwear, trousers, and underwear. VITAS Chairman Le Quoc An expressed a desire to either end or narrow the monitoring program. The National Retail Federation (NRF) expressed satisfaction with the U.S. Department of Commerce's decision to not launch antidumping investigations against Vietnamese-made apparel. NRF stated that there was no rationale for the textile monitoring program and no reason to continue it. U.S. senators and representatives did not issue statements after the DOC's review results were announced. The DOC announced the results of its second review of the Vietnamese import monitoring program, stating there is insufficient evidence for an antidumping investigation. The monitoring program will continue to prevent apparel dumping in the U.S. market. Prices of Vietnamese apparel were found to be in line with or exceed other major suppliers. The DOC announced the results of its second review of the Vietnamese import monitoring program, stating there is insufficient evidence for an antidumping investigation. The selected clothing items were compared to data for various countries, with no imports of Vietnamese clothing for nearly 500 items being monitored. Vietnam's response to the announcement was muted, with no official comments from Vietnamese officials. Analysis by the American Chamber of Commerce showed Vietnam had the most rapid growth rate in 2007 among the top five clothing exporters to the United States. Adam Sitkoff of AmCham Vietnam in Hanoi stated that Vietnam's competitiveness in manufacturing various products contributes to export growth to the U.S. VITAS requested the termination of the monitoring program, with little response from the U.S. clothing and textile industry. The debate on the program's impact on Vietnamese clothing exports to the U.S. continues. According to Just-Style.com, the monitoring program has been successful in controlling apparel shipments between the U.S. and Vietnam. However, fears of anti-dumping investigations have affected sourcing from Vietnam, leading to reluctance from U.S. importers and retailers. Despite the program, Vietnam's clothing exports to the U.S. grew by 36% in 2007, raising questions about its effectiveness. Sharp differences of opinion exist regarding Vietnam's clothing industry structure. Vietnam's clothing industry is a mix of state-owned enterprises, small privately-owned companies, and foreign-owned manufacturers. The Vietnam National Textile and Garment Group (Vinatex) oversees operations in this complex ownership structure. The Vietnam National Textile and Garment Group (Vinatex) manages state-owned, joint stock, and joint venture enterprises in the clothing industry. The Vietnamese government has been transitioning to a market-oriented economy since 1986, allowing private clothing manufacturers to compete with state-owned companies. Through \"equitization,\" the government is divesting some state-owned clothing companies, and foreign investment in clothing companies is also permitted. Vietnam's clothing industry allows direct foreign investment in clothing companies, with various ownership arrangements. A national survey in 1998 showed 68,429 clothing manufacturing establishments, mostly household-owned. Policy changes since then have clarified ownership distinctions and allowed foreign equity participation. The Vietnamese government is in the process of divesting full ownership of clothing manufacturers to transform state-owned enterprises into joint shareholding companies by 2010. However, this \"equitization\" does not guarantee freedom from government intervention, subsidies, or political influence unless there is a change in managerial behavior. The clothing production in Vietnam is divided between state-owned enterprises, domestic private sector, and foreign-invested companies. The shift in ownership structure is moving towards foreign-invested companies due to equitization and increased competition. The ownership structure of Vietnam's clothing industry is shifting towards foreign-invested companies. Vinatex, a state-owned corporation, is undergoing transformation with plans for equitization and increased authority over clothing manufacturers' profits. Vinatex, a state-owned corporation in Vietnam, is undergoing equitization to become a profit-oriented holding company by 2008. The restructuring will not reduce the government's capital holding but will issue new shares to private investors for new capital. Vinatex now collects profits from joint stock companies and joint ventures, focusing on textile and garment production, distribution, and exports. Vinatex, a state-owned corporation in Vietnam, is undergoing equitization to become a profit-oriented holding company by 2008. It plans to set up joint ventures with domestic and foreign investors, expand domestic and overseas markets, improve technological applications, and provide technical training for workers and management in the clothing and textile industry. The equitization of Vinatex will transform the structure of Vietnam's clothing industry, with a shift towards private ownership and the emergence of a holding company holding shares in major clothing companies. The Vietnamese government's ownership in major clothing companies and a commercial bank raises concerns about the extent of state control in the clothing industry. Vietnam could subsidize its clothing industry through direct ways like financing investments and offering incentives, or indirectly by providing below-market loans and lowering tariffs on imported materials. Vietnam's clothing industry faces concerns over past and ongoing subsidies, with the United States pushing for compliance with WTO regulations. The Vietnamese government's involvement in major clothing companies and a commercial bank also raises worries about state control in the industry. The Vietnamese government released Decision 55 in 2001, investing $2.2 billion in textile projects until 2005. This included support for cotton cultivation and infrastructure development. Decision 55 was revoked in 2006 as part of Vietnam's WTO agreement to end subsidies for the textile industry. The United States misunderstood Decision 55, which did not allow for direct government financing of projects in Vietnam's clothing industry. Government assistance was limited to small loans, and after Decision 55 was revoked, Vinatex was tasked with raising funds independently. Despite facing challenges without subsidies, Vietnamese textile companies are willing to stand on their own. Vinatex is in talks with investors to open a commercial joint-stock bank to support Vietnam's clothing and textile industries. The proposed bank's initial capital is 1 trillion dong. Vinatex has applied for a license to establish the Industrial Development Bank and is awaiting approval. One form of subsidization in Vietnam's clothing industry is the payment of below market wages to workers. One form of subsidization in Vietnam's clothing industry is the payment of below market wages to clothing workers, allowing companies to increase profits and compete globally. Studies show that clothing workers in Vietnam earn less than other manufacturing workers, but this practice is common due to global competition. The global clothing industry in 2008 saw rising labor costs due to the weakening U.S. dollar. Vietnam's hourly wage rates were lower than China and Central America but higher than Bangladesh, Cambodia, and Pakistan. High inflation in Vietnam led to worker strikes over low wages and increased costs of labor and raw materials. The State Bank of Vietnam struggled to address inflation and the weakening dollar. The weakening U.S. dollar has impacted Vietnamese manufacturers' profit margins due to most export contracts being in dollars. Rising labor and raw material costs are also affecting profits. Devaluing the Vietnamese dong may help exporters but worsen domestic inflation, while revaluing it could reduce inflation but harm exporters. The dong depreciated by over 3% against the dollar in the first half of 2008. Vietnam's clothing industry participates in the global market driven by large retailers and branded manufacturers. Marketers and branded manufacturers are key players in decentralized production networks, as analyzed by Gereffi and others. Buyer-driven commodity chains involve competitive, decentralized manufacturing across multiple countries. Retailers, marketers, and branded manufacturers control clothing manufacturers and suppliers through product design and brand names, leading to most profits flowing to them. This analysis focuses on the production flow of clothing from raw materials to retail sale, with major retailers controlling design and marketing. Wholesalers and exporters typically contract with retailers. Vietnam's clothing industry is part of a production chain involving retailers, sourcing companies, and manufacturers. The market segment focuses on competitive types of clothing like women's and cotton clothing, with a triangular manufacturing model involving retailers, sourcing companies, and manufacturers. The retailer contracts a sourcing company to procure clothing with detailed specifications, which is then subcontracted to trusted manufacturers. Clothing items are produced and shipped directly to retailers, who pay the sourcing company, which in turn pays the manufacturers. Manufacturers may progress from a \"cut-make-trim\" arrangement to an \"original equipment manufacturing\" setup. In the clothing manufacturing industry, manufacturers may advance from a \"cut-make-trim\" arrangement to an \"original equipment manufacturing\" (OEM) setup, where they are provided with product designs by the sourcing company or major retailer. They may also engage in \"original brand-name manufacturing\" by designing clothes to be sold under their own brand or a major retailer's brand. Competition for subcontracts is fierce, leading manufacturers to lower prices and increase production speed to secure contracts. State-owned and foreign-invested companies in Vietnam are seen as better equipped to compete in this industry. The Vietnamese government aims to improve the clothing industry's profitability by following the example of successful Asian countries like Hong Kong, South Korea, and Taiwan, which diversified their manufacturing and moved into clothing design and brand development. State-owned and foreign-invested companies in Vietnam are considered more competitive in securing manufacturing contracts due to their size and access to capital. Vietnam's focus has shifted to down chain development in the clothing industry. The country's clothing exports have grown significantly over the past decade, with a notable increase in the U.S. market. Vietnam's textile and clothing exports have increased over five-fold in the last decade, reaching $1.5 billion in 1997. In 2007, Vietnam's textile and clothing exports were valued at $7.78 billion, accounting for 16.1% of total exports. The shift in export markets occurred after the U.S. granted Vietnam normal trade relations status in 2001, leading to a significant increase in clothing exports to the U.S. After receiving NTR status in 2001, Vietnam's clothing exports to the United States surged to nearly $1 billion in 2002, surpassing exports to Japan and the EU-27. The U.S. became Vietnam's largest clothing export market in 2002, with over half of Vietnam's clothing exports sent there in 2003. Exports to Japan and the EU-27 declined but rebounded in 2004. Growth in clothing exports to the U.S. was hindered by U.S. quotas, but Vietnam's share continued to increase. In 2004, Vietnam's clothing exports to the United States continued to increase, with nearly $6 out of every $10 going to the U.S. In 2005, exports to the U.S. increased by $147 million, while exports to Japan and the EU-27 increased by a combined total of $247 million. This led to a small decline in the U.S. share of Vietnam's clothing exports in 2005, with a slight rise for Japan and the EU-27. The shift away from the U.S. towards Japan and the EU-27 continued in 2006 and 2007. The Vietnamese government encouraged clothing companies to export to Japan due to concerns about protective measures by the U.S. The Vietnamese government has encouraged clothing companies to export to Japan and the EU-27 due to the weakening U.S. dollar and slowdown in the U.S. economy. Despite changes in U.S. trade policy towards Vietnam, there has been steady growth in Vietnam's clothing exports to the United States, leading to a rise in Vietnam's overall market share. However, Vietnam remains a modest supplier of U.S. clothing imports, with its portion of import supply below 10% in most market segments. The recent growth in U.S. clothing imports from Vietnam is small compared to overall imports, with China being a major supplier. In 2006, the U.S. imported $73.4 billion of clothing, with $19.9 billion from China, $5.4 billion from Mexico, and $3.2 billion from Vietnam. Vietnam's share of U.S. clothing imports rose from 0.1% in 2001 to 5.7% in 2007, while China's share increased from 11.0% to 31.7% over the same period. In 2001, Vietnam was not among the top 25 clothing suppliers to the United States. After normal trade relations were established, Vietnam became the 20th largest source of U.S. clothing imports in 2002. Its ranking fluctuated over the years, reaching 3rd place in 2007 behind China and Mexico. Vietnam's share of U.S. clothing imports increased to 4.3% by 2007. In 2001, Vietnam was not a top clothing supplier to the US. After establishing normal trade relations, Vietnam became the 20th largest source of US clothing imports in 2002. Its ranking fluctuated, reaching 3rd place in 2007. Vietnam rarely provides more than 10% of total imports in select clothing categories. Vietnam's market share in US clothing imports is generally below 3%, with exceptions in men's and boys' knitted shirts and sweaters. Main competitors are China and other Asian nations, not DR-CAFTA nations. Guatemala, Honduras, and Mexico are the only American nations among the top five suppliers in some submarkets. The rise in clothing imports from Vietnam may be displacing clothing manufactured in the United States, as shown by recent trends in the U.S. clothing industry. However, there are doubts about a direct causal link between the increase in imports from Vietnam and the decline in U.S. clothing production. The decline in U.S. clothing production predates the end of the U.S. trade embargo on Vietnam, indicating other factors may be involved. The decline in U.S. production between 2000 and 2004 is much larger than the increase in clothing imports from Vietnam during the same period, suggesting other factors may be responsible. Both U.S. clothing production and clothing imports from Vietnam rose in 2005, contradicting the expected relationship if imports from Vietnam were causing the decline in U.S. production. It is challenging to demonstrate reliable trends due to the relatively short period since Vietnam has been allowed to export clothing to the United States. The Department of Commerce's monitoring program on Vietnamese clothing imports lacks clarity and resolution. Congress may choose to take no action as the DOC has the flexibility to amend the categories of monitored imports. The Department of Commerce is monitoring trade flows for clothing imports from Vietnam and has not found enough evidence to start an anti-dumping investigation. If Congress decides to take action, they could examine the legal basis for the monitoring program and the DOC's authority to establish it. Congress may review the monitoring program for Vietnam's clothing imports to ensure compliance with WTO agreements and investigate Vietnam's use of subsidies in its textile industry. Investigation into Vietnam's labor market to determine if wages are being suppressed below fair market values. Congress could pass legislation to counteract unfair trade practices by Vietnam in clothing exports to the US, potentially making it easier to initiate anti-dumping investigations. Congress may also consider claims that the monitoring program has harmed trade and investments in Vietnam. DOC review examined trade data for evidence of self-initiated antidumping measures. The DOC reviewed trade data to determine if there was enough evidence for an antidumping investigation against Vietnam. Congress could also investigate the monitoring program's effectiveness in identifying potential dumping. Criteria for proving dumping include below-market prices and significant market share, with the DOC reporting rising unit prices for clothing imports from Vietnam. Experts suggest that a supplier must provide more than 4% of the overall supply to cause harm sufficient for dumping claims. Vietnam's clothing exports do not meet the market threshold for dumping claims. Congress may conduct its own study on the monitoring program data to assess evidence of dumping. One criticism is the seasonal nature of the global clothing market, which could be addressed by evaluating trade data over a full year."
