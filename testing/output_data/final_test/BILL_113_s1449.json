    "content": "The curr_chunk is about the taxation of United States cruise industry income of nonresident aliens and foreign corporations. The curr_chunk discusses the treatment of United States cruise industry income as effectively connected to a trade or business within the country for tax purposes. The curr_chunk defines \"United States cruise industry income\" as income related to covered passenger cruises, including passenger carriage and onboard/offboard activities. It also introduces the concept of a \"covered passenger cruise\" for tax purposes. A \"passenger cruise\" refers to a voyage on a commercial cruise ship that lasts for one or more nights and involves passengers boarding or disembarking in the United States. Exceptions include voyages on government-owned vessels or those exclusively on inland waterways. A \"passenger cruise vessel\" is defined as a passenger vessel with accommodations for at least 250 passengers, traveling between ports in the United States without stopping at a foreign port. The term \"passenger cruise vessel\" excludes certain types of vessels such as ferries, recreational vessels, sailing school vessels, small passenger vessels, and offshore supply vessels. Definitions in this section align with those in chapter 21 of title 46, United States Code. A conforming amendment expands the scope of subparagraphs in the relevant section of the Code. The Internal Revenue Code is amended to exclude United States cruise industry income from certain tax exemptions for nonresident aliens and foreign corporations. The Internal Revenue Code is amended to exclude United States cruise industry income from tax exemptions under income tax treaties. This applies to income from voyages made after the enactment of the Act."
