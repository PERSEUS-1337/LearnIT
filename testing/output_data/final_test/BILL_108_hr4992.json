    "content": "The Act titled \"Ensuring Access to Emergency Rooms Act of 2004\" asserts Congress's authority to regulate commerce and provide for the general welfare. It also protects against legal liability for emergency services provided to uninsured individuals. Section 224(g) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 233(g)) is amended to include provisions for entities described in subparagraph (B) to be considered under paragraph (4) with certain exceptions. Entities described in subparagraph (B) can be considered under paragraph (4) of the Public Health Service Act, with exceptions for certain individuals like officers, board members, employees, or contractors providing services to uninsured individuals or post-stabilization services. Entities described in subparagraph (B) under the Public Health Service Act can be considered, with exceptions for certain individuals. This paragraph applies only to causes of action from acts or omissions after January 1, 2003, and does not apply to a physician or physician group described in subparagraph (B)(ii) making an application. Entities described in subparagraph (B) under the Public Health Service Act will have separate estimates and funds established for them, distinct from entities in paragraph (4). The Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary, will make these separate estimates under subsection (k)(1), and the Secretary will establish separate funds under subsection (k)(2) for these groups of entities. Appropriations for entities in subparagraph (B) will be separate from amounts authorized by subsection (k)(2). Entities described in subparagraph (B) under the Public Health Service Act may exceed $10,000,000 in funds for a fiscal year, and subsection (m) does not apply to them. These entities include hospitals, emergency departments, physicians, and physician groups affiliated with these facilities. Entities described in subparagraph (B) under the Public Health Service Act may exceed $10,000,000 in funds for a fiscal year. Uninsured individuals are defined as those without coverage under specific health plans or insurance. For uninsured individuals treated by certain entities under the Public Health Service Act, post-stabilization services are defined as services related to the treated condition provided after stabilization to maintain or improve the individual's condition. The provision in this section does not authorize the Secretary to make payments to entities unless budget authority is provided in advance by appropriation Acts. The total amount of payments for a fiscal year is limited to the amount appropriated in advance, and steps will be taken to ensure payments do not exceed the appropriated amount."
