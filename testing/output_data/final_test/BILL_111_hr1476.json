    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Open Fuel Standard Act of 2009\" or the \"OFS Act.\" The purpose of the Act is to establish findings and purposes. The Act, known as the \"Open Fuel Standard Act of 2009\" or the \"OFS Act,\" establishes findings regarding the strategic importance of oil in the transportation sector. It highlights the potential for fuel competition and consumer choice to reduce oil's monopoly and strip it of its strategic status. The current closed fuel market has allowed a cartel of petroleum exporting countries to inflate fuel prices. Alcohol fuels like ethanol and methanol could provide additional fuel supplies in the US and other friendly countries, potentially reducing dependence on petroleum exporting countries. Alcohol fuels can reduce dependence on petroleum resources for vehicle fuels in the United States by utilizing flexible fuel vehicles capable of operating on conventional gasoline or alcohol fuels. The development of a distribution system for alcohol fuels is crucial once a significant portion of vehicles in the US can use them. The United States has a substantial number of vehicles capable of using alcohol fuels, which could create a large market to advance technology and production. There is a national security interest in developing alcohol fuels technology quickly, and new cars should allow for fuel competition. An open fuel standard would help protect the environment. Implementing an open fuel standard would safeguard the US economy from oil price fluctuations and various threats like global instability, terrorism, and natural disasters. SEC. 3. OPEN FUEL STANDARD FOR TRANSPORTATION. Chapter 329 of title 49, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following: \"SEC. 32920. OPEN FUEL STANDARD FOR TRANSPORTATION. The section defines terms like E85, flexible fuel automobile, fuel choice-enabling automobile, and light-duty automobile. The term 'light-duty automobile manufacturer's annual covered inventory' refers to the number of internal combustion engine-powered light-duty automobiles manufactured or imported for sale in the US. 'M85' is a fuel mixture containing 85% methanol and 15% gasoline. Light-duty automobile manufacturers must have at least 50% fuel choice-enabling automobiles in their annual inventory from 2012 to 2014. In 2012, 2013, and 2014, light-duty automobile manufacturers must have at least 50% fuel choice-enabling automobiles in their annual inventory. In 2015 and subsequent years, this requirement increases to not less than 80%. Manufacturers can request exemptions by submitting applications to the Secretary for evaluation. The Secretary can temporarily exempt a light-duty automobile from production volume requirements if unavoidable events hinder the manufacturer from meeting the fuel choice-enabling automobile quota. This includes disruptions in component supply or installation. The Secretary may consolidate applications from multiple manufacturers if they are similar. Any exemption granted shall require the manufacturer to recall exempted automobiles for component installation within an approved timeframe. The Secretary of Transportation will publish notices in the Federal Register regarding applications from manufacturers, decisions on temporary exemptions, and the reasons for granting or denying exemptions. Regulations to implement this section must be promulgated within one year of the Act's enactment."
