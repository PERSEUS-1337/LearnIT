    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Higher-Risk Impaired Driver Act\" and includes findings related to impaired driving. The Congress finds that alcohol-related traffic deaths accounted for 42 percent of total motor vehicle fatalities in 2002, with a rising trend since 1999. Repeat offenders make up one-third of all drivers arrested for driving under the influence, and 58 percent of alcohol-related traffic fatalities in 2001 involved drivers with a BAC of .15 percent and above. First-time offenders with high BAC levels are most likely to commit another drunk driving offense. The federal government should focus on targeting these repeat offenders and high BAC level individuals to reduce the risk of alcohol-impaired driving fatalities. SEC. 3. INCREASED PENALTIES. Increased penalties for higher risk drivers for driving while intoxicated or driving under the influence are defined in this section. Blood alcohol concentration, driving while intoxicated, driving under the influence, and license suspension are key terms outlined in the amendment to Chapter I of title 23, United States Code. The term 'license suspension' refers to the suspension of all driving privileges. A 'motor vehicle' is a vehicle driven by mechanical power primarily for public highways, excluding rail line or commercial vehicles. A 'higher-risk impaired driver law' in a State mandates a minimum penalty of a 1-year driver's license suspension, including a 90-day complete driving ban. Prior to obtaining a probational hardship or work permit license, individuals with a suspended license may need to install an alcohol ignition interlock device on their vehicle, have the vehicle impounded or immobilized for at least 90 days, and undergo a substance abuse assessment by a certified official. Individuals convicted of impaired driving may face imprisonment, electronic monitoring, or assignment to a specialty facility. They could also be fined at least $1,000, with the funds used for prevention and enforcement programs. Individuals convicted of impaired driving may face various consequences, including court-mandated restitution to crash victims, probation for at least 2 years, mandatory attendance at a substance abuse treatment program for 12 months, and participation in a victim impact panel if available. Individuals convicted of impaired driving may face consequences such as mandatory attendance at a substance abuse treatment program for 12 months and participation in a victim impact panel if available. This applies to repeat offenders, those with high blood alcohol concentration, or driving while suspended due to a DUI conviction. The term 'special DUI/DWI facility' refers to a facility for impaired driving offenders to receive treatment and continue with work or school. A 'victim impact panel' consists of impaired driving victims who aim to deter recidivism through changing attitudes and behaviors. In fiscal years 2008, 2009, and 2010, the Secretary will withhold a percentage of funds for Federal-aid highways from states that have not enacted or enforced higher-risk impaired driver laws. In fiscal years 2008, 2009, and 2010, the Secretary will withhold a percentage of funds for Federal-aid highways from states that have not enacted or enforced higher-risk impaired driver laws. Starting in fiscal year 2011, the Secretary will withhold 6 percent of funds if the state does not have the law, and 8 percent if the law is not enforced."
