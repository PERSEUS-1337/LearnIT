    "content": "Alien legalization, also known as \"amnesty,\" and provisions for certain aliens to adjust to legal permanent resident (LPR) status are contentious issues in U.S. immigration policy. Questions arise about eligibility for visas for unauthorized aliens in the U.S. and the inclusion of a mechanism for guest workers to become LPRs. Various options for foreign nationals in the U.S. to become LPRs would require special legislation from Congress. In the 109th Congress, immigration law overhauls were passed but no comprehensive reform package was agreed upon. The Senate-passed bill (S. 2611) aimed to grant legal permanent residence to certain unauthorized aliens and guest workers. In the 110th Congress, a bipartisan compromise bill was introduced to allow unauthorized aliens in the United States to become legal permanent residents by meeting certain conditions, paying penalty fees, and fulfilling requirements. President Barack Obama and Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano supported comprehensive immigration reform with increased enforcement and a pathway to legal residence for unauthorized residents. Immigrant admissions and adjustments to LPR status are subject to numerical limits and preference categories based on family relationships, skills, and humanitarian concerns. When Congress codified immigration laws in 1952, priority for admission was based on family relationships, skills, and humanitarian concerns. In FY2008, 58% of LPRs adjusted status within the US, contributing to the growth of permanent legal immigration. The number of LPRs arriving from abroad has remained around 400,000 annually for the past 30 years, while the total number of LPRs is now around one million annually. Each year, millions of foreign nationals come to the US on nonimmigrant visas. Hundreds of thousands overstay or enter illegally, leading to an estimated 11.9 million unauthorized aliens in 2008. Options exist for unauthorized aliens to become LPRs without leaving, but most require Congressional action. Adjusting status under current law or seeking asylum are possible routes to LPR status. Unauthorized aliens in the US may be granted asylum or become LPRs through cancellation of removal. Even those on temporary visas can adjust to LPR status based on family relationships or job skills under INA \u00a7245. The provision was expanded in 1994 with \u00a7245(i) allowing illegal aliens to adjust status by paying a penalty fee. Since 1952, at least 16 Acts of Congress have allowed certain aliens in the US with temporary legal status to adjust to legal permanent residence. These laws often focus on humanitarian cases, such as aliens paroled into the US or those from specific countries with temporary protected status. Special provisions for adjusting status involved nonimmigrants, including alien physicians, retired employees of international organizations, and nurses meeting specific criteria. In 1929, Congress enacted a law allowing certain aliens to register for LPR status. The INA in 1952 included a registry provision for lost files, evolving into a way for unauthorized aliens to legalize their status. The IRCA of 1986 enabled millions of illegal aliens to become LPRs. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 allowed millions of illegal aliens in the United States to become Legal Permanent Residents (LPRs) through two temporary legalization programs. The \"pre-1982\" program granted legal status to eligible aliens who had been residing unlawfully in the US since before January 1, 1982, while the \"special agricultural worker\" (SAW) program provided legal status to eligible aliens who had worked in seasonal agriculture in the US. Approximately 2.7 million aliens in the United States qualified for legal status under the pre-1982 and SAW programs. The Attorney General has discretionary authority to grant relief from deportation and adjustment of status to certain illegal aliens with deep roots in the US and good moral character. This relief, formerly known as suspension of deportation, is now called cancellation of removal. The Illegal Immigrant Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) of 1996 changed the terminology from suspension of deportation to cancellation of removal. The new law established stricter standards for obtaining relief, including a higher threshold of \"exceptional and extremely unusual hardship\" and a longer physical presence requirement of 10 years. Additionally, limits were set on the number of people who could receive cancellation of removal. The Illegal Immigrant Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 changed the terminology to cancellation of removal and set limits on the number of people eligible for this relief - 4,000 per fiscal year."
