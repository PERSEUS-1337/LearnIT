    "content": "One successful technique in generative models involves decomposing a complex generation task into simpler tasks, such as generating an image at low resolution and refining it to high resolution. A novel strategy explored here is generating latent variables describing observed variables subsets, then mapping these to the observed space. This approach allows for decoupled training of generative models, with theoretical and experimental support for its benefits. Learning useful intermediate representations hierarchically has been key in deep learning success. In unsupervised learning, generative models aim to capture salient features of data using low-dimensional latent variables. Recent research suggests that hierarchical latent variable models may not effectively utilize the hierarchy, potentially due to weak priors. Parameterizing conditional distributions with deep neural networks can enhance model performance. When parameterizing conditional distributions with deep neural networks, there is a risk of local optima where all factors of variation are not optimally explained by the lowest-level latent variable. Batch normalization in deep neural networks has successfully disentangled learning dynamics at each layer, similar to having independent objective functions. The resolution-based hierarchy in images captures some factors of variation but may not apply well to other types of data like language or video, highlighting the need for unsupervised methods. Our proposed Locally Disentangled Factors (LDF) approach aims to learn hierarchical latent variables with decoupled level-wise training objectives, reducing memory consumption for training generative models on large objects like videos and text. It utilizes a graphical model based on spatial locality for credit assignment and is applicable to variable-length objects. The Locally Disentangled Factors (LDF) approach aims to learn hierarchical latent variables with decoupled level-wise training objectives, reducing memory consumption for training generative models on large objects like videos and text. It utilizes a graphical model based on spatial locality for credit assignment and is applicable to variable-length objects. The approach introduces a spatial structure to the hierarchy, assigning lowest-level latent variables to model small regions of the image, with subsequent levels modeling local groups of latent variables below them. This hierarchical modeling indirectly captures the entire image through topmost latent variables. Our approach utilizes the ALI framework to match the generative and inference processes in a Bayesian network. A discriminator is used to learn whether samples are from the generative or inference process, aiming for convergence to the same distribution. The LDF approach is a hierarchical variant of Adversarially Learned Inference, aiming to find the saddle-point where the discriminator cannot differentiate between consecutive random variables. This results in minimizing the Jensen-Shannon Divergence, with the goal of making the generative and inference distributions similar. Local connectivity and disentanglement in latent variables are introduced to further enhance the model. Local connectivity and disentanglement in latent variables are introduced to enhance the LDF approach, with independence assumptions in conditional distributions of the generative process. The random variable z i is assumed to be a d-dimensional vector, and the local connectivity independent assumption is defined. The model considers hierarchies with two levels, where the bottom level is a single image and the top level is the... The training procedure involves learning disentangled latent factors at each node in a hierarchy with more than two levels. The goal is to reconstruct observed variables using Adversarially Trained Inference and a stochastic decoder, aiming for identical reconstructions. This is achieved through reconstruction penalties or an ALI objective. The training procedure involves using locally disentangled factors to make training easier. A video dataset is considered where shape and movement are modeled separately in the disentangled latent space. The approach includes the normal ALI objective and \"shortcut reconstructions\" for stability. In hierarchical models, individual factors are easier to learn, allowing for the marginal distribution of video frames to be learned with only data on individual frames. Dependencies between factors can be described with a few parameters, requiring only a handful of joint samples to learn them. This is demonstrated in experiments, showing the benefits of hierarchical modeling. In hierarchical models, individual factors are easier to learn, allowing for the marginal distribution of video frames to be learned with only data on individual frames. Dependencies between factors can be described with a few parameters, requiring only a handful of joint samples to learn them. The hierarchical model splits variables into blocks, enabling the covariance matrix to be learned using fewer samples. Cross-covariances can be modeled approximately, reducing the number of samples needed to learn parameters. The hierarchy approach in generative models involves generating at low resolution first and then at higher resolutions while conditioning on the lower resolution. It simplifies training by assigning different stages in generation to different factors of variation. In contrast to LDF, the resolution hierarchies approach fixes the content of higher levels as the downsampled version of the original image. The hierarchy approach in generative models involves generating at low resolution first and then at higher resolutions while conditioning on the lower resolution. In contrast, BID7 introduced the idea of improving the scalability of training deep networks by decoupling the computations for making an update to the parameters of each layer. Locally Disentangled Factors and Synthetic Gradients both allow for decoupled updating in deep networks. Locally Disentangled Factors rely on statistical properties of the data, assuming local regions can be described by disentangled latent factors. Synthetic Gradients achieve decoupling by predicting full gradients with synthetic gradient modules. Karaletsos (2016) proposed training and inference in graphical models using local discriminators. Zhao et al. (2017) critiques hierarchical latent variable models, arguing that multiple layers have limited value in sampling from the joint distribution. The critique by Zhao et al. (2017) challenges the usefulness of hierarchical variational autoencoders in learning latent variables from higher levels. They suggest that making the sampling process potentially non-ergodic can impact the effectiveness of the model. The sampling process between 256x256 and 512x512 resolution images of a face may not significantly change the identity of the face, indicating the value of a deep hierarchical model. Despite potential non-ergodic sampling, similar models have been successful. The experiments aim to show that LDF can learn data dependencies effectively, even with localized training. We successfully demonstrate dividing images and videos into distinct latent factors for generation. Our approach is evaluated on the CIFAR dataset for image generation and the Pacman video dataset for video generation. The lower level latent segments are divided into a 2x2 grid for images and 5 adjacent frames for videos. The models share parameters across all positions, and the video patches are randomly selected from Pacman game screens. The Pacman dataset was chosen for its simplicity and predictable motion. The LDF model uses convolutional neural networks for each frame and fully-connected MLPs for higher level models. Experiments show that using LDF simplifies training compared to a simple GAN model. The study introduced Locally Disentangled Factors (LDF) as a new approach for training generative models. It was demonstrated that LDF trains faster than a joint training baseline and is more successful when only a few full samples are available. LDF can successfully generate joint distributions over complicated objects. The study introduced Locally Disentangled Factors (LDF) as a new approach for training generative models, showing that it trains faster and is more successful with limited data. LDF can generate joint distributions over complex objects, allowing for decoupled training and improved learning from small data amounts. This method requires a more general prior but leaves the decision of local factors to the practitioner, suggesting a need for methods with similar benefits but fewer data assumptions."
