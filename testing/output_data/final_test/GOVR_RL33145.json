    "content": "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services defines different types of influenza: seasonal flu, avian flu, and pandemic flu. Seasonal flu is common and has a vaccine available. Avian flu is deadly to birds and can be transmitted to humans, with no human vaccine available. Pandemic flu is a global outbreak of serious illness with little natural immunity. In 1997, a new strain of avian flu caused human deaths in Hong Kong. The avian flu, known as H5N1, first transmitted from poultry to humans in Hong Kong, resulting in multiple human deaths. Despite efforts to contain the virus, it re-emerged in 2003 and has since spread to over 50 countries in Asia, Europe, and Africa. The virus has infected over 270 people and caused more than 160 deaths. There is concern that if the virus develops the ability to transmit efficiently between humans, a global influenza pandemic could occur. The high lethality of the H5N1 strain is reminiscent of the deadly 1918 Spanish flu pandemic. The 1918 Spanish flu pandemic killed up to 2% of the world's population and was a significant cause of mortality in U.S. military personnel during World War I. The World Health Organization warns that a similar influenza pandemic could result in unprecedented illness and death. Health authorities believe that rapid detection and local control efforts can help slow the progress of future influenza pandemics. Countries affected by avian flu must track the virus in birds and quickly detect and investigate suspected human cases to better manage the situation. Developed nations face policy challenges regarding the allocation of scarce health resources during a pandemic. The WHO and the United States have released pandemic preparedness plans. States must prepare pandemic plans to receive federal bioterrorism preparedness grants. The government has created a public website for disseminating information on pandemic preparedness. The Administration has established a public website for sharing information on pandemic flu preparedness. Planning emphasizes the involvement of sectors beyond healthcare. Secretary of HHS, Michael Leavitt, stresses the need for a coordinated response involving various sectors in case of a pandemic. Non-health essential services could be affected by high absenteeism during a severe pandemic. The limited availability of vaccines and drugs for a potential flu pandemic in the U.S. could require law enforcement protection for distribution. The private healthcare system and state-based public health system pose challenges for coordinating a response. The National Response Plan (NRP) developed by the Department of Homeland Security may not be sufficient for a pandemic flu outbreak due to its unique nature. This report explores the unpredictability of influenza pandemics, challenges in traditional disaster response mechanisms, and the potential impact of a pandemic caused by the H5N1 avian flu strain. The report discusses the possible impacts of another pandemic caused by the H5N1 avian flu strain, WHO and U.S. preparedness plans, and policy issues in pandemic influenza preparedness and response. It focuses on U.S. domestic public health preparedness and response planning, and the projected impacts of an influenza pandemic on Americans. The report will be updated to reflect changing circumstances. A pandemic is an epidemic of human disease occurring over a wide area, affecting a large number of people. Influenza is not the only pathogen that can cause pandemics, with examples like the Black Death and HIV/AIDS. The spread of influenza, a highly contagious virus that causes respiratory disease in humans, is often referred to as a pandemic. It can be transmitted through direct contact, airborne exposure, and can persist on surfaces. The virus is infectious before symptoms appear, enhancing its spread. Influenza viruses have a genome composed of eight segments of RNA and can undergo changes through mutation and reassortment. Influenza viruses, including Influenza A and B, undergo changes through mutation and reassortment of gene segments. The surface antigens hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) play a role in virulence. The avian flu strain H5N1 is a concern, with new strains circulating globally within months of emergence. Each year, the virus undergoes antigenic drift, causing illness in healthy individuals. The influenza virus, constantly changing, can cause severe illness and death during a pandemic when a novel strain emerges with sustained person-to-person transmission. WHO identifies key characteristics of a pandemic, including the need for a new vaccine each year for full immunity. During an influenza pandemic, a novel strain emerges with sustained person-to-person transmission. WHO outlines phases of a pandemic, from interpandemic to pandemic alert periods. The current global status is at \"Pandemic Alert Level 3,\" with limited human-to-human transmission of a new virus causing illness. In the 20th century, there were three influenza pandemics. In the 20th century, there were three influenza pandemics, including the 1918 Spanish Flu that killed over 50 million people worldwide. The 1957 Asian Flu and the 1968 Hong Kong Flu also had significant death tolls. The global public health community is concerned about similarities between past pandemics and the current H5N1 avian flu situation. The 1976 Swine Flu Scare (H1N1) in the United States resulted in 33,800 deaths, primarily affecting those over 65. A vaccination campaign was launched, but the virus did not spread widely. The vaccine was linked to a rare neurological condition that affected over 500 people and killed 32, damaging public health officials' credibility. The 1977 Russian Flu Scare (H1N1) involved a virus strain that had been circulating before 1957, causing severe illness in those without prior immunity. In 1997, H5N1 Avian Flu emerged in Hong Kong and was initially controlled by mass culling of poultry. However, the virus re-emerged in 2003 and has since spread to three continents. Global efforts to contain the virus are ongoing. Additionally, an H9N2 flu strain caused human illness in Hong Kong in 1999, and continues to circulate in birds. The National Institutes of Health awarded a contract in 2004 to produce a vaccine against this strain in case it develops the ability for human-to-human transmission. WHO has been monitoring human H5N1 cases, with 274 reported as of February 19, 2007. As of February 19, 2007, WHO reported 274 human H5N1 cases, with 167 fatalities in 11 countries. The outbreaks caused by H5N1 are concerning due to severe illness and high fatality rates. The unique situation in Asia with widespread bird outbreaks has increased the risk of a pandemic. The presence of H5N1 in animal reservoirs poses a continued risk for human exposure and infection. Control of current outbreaks in poultry may take months or years. Detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza in wild birds adds complexity. The world may remain on the verge of a pandemic. Preparedness planning is crucial now to mitigate consequences. The H5N1 strain is virulent in both human and avian hosts, prompting an over-reaction of the inflammatory response in some human victims. The H5N1 strain of avian flu is virulent in both human and avian hosts, causing severe lung damage in some human victims. Scientists have sequenced genes from the 1918 pandemic strain, finding similarities in their properties. There is concern that H5N1 could become a pandemic strain, posing a serious threat to public health. Experts are concerned about the potential for the H5N1 strain of avian flu to become a pandemic, as it may retain its virulence while becoming more transmissible. Other novel flu strains with pandemic potential have also been identified in recent years, such as the H7N7 and H7N3 strains which caused human illness in the Netherlands and Canada. WHO has issued alerts for these strains. The poultry infected two people, leading to a pandemic alert from WHO for the Canadian outbreak. A government worker involved in culling poultry during a 2002 H7N2 avian flu outbreak in Virginia showed antibodies to the strain, indicating possible infection. This highlights the potential for direct bird-to-human transmission of avian flu viruses. The CDC has reported outbreaks of various avian flu strains in North American poultry flocks in 2003 and 2004, emphasizing the need for protection measures. HHS estimates 209,000 U.S. deaths from a moderate pandemic in its flu plan. In its pandemic flu plan, HHS estimates that about 209,000 U.S. deaths could result from a moderate pandemic, while 1.9 million deaths could result from a severe pandemic. Trust for America's Health published a report estimating deaths and hospitalizations in the United States based on different pandemic scenarios, with death estimates ranging from 180,000 to over 1 million. The report also includes state-by-state health impact estimates. Predicted hospitalization rates provide insight into the potential burden on the U.S. healthcare system. The U.S. healthcare system faces uncertainty with estimated hospitalizations ranging from 865,000 to 9.9 million in the final pandemic plan. TFAH projects hospitalizations from almost 800,000 to over 4.7 million, citing 965,256 staffed hospital beds in 2003. These impacts would occur over a short time frame, with advances in medical care like antibiotics for bacterial pneumonia and respiratory care. However, experts warn that the H5N1 avian flu virus can cause severe lung damage. The H5N1 avian flu virus can cause severe lung damage, potentially overwhelming healthcare systems during a pandemic. The economic impact in the United States could range from $71.3 to $166.5 billion, with the majority attributed to loss of life. Developing countries may struggle to provide specialized care, and disruptions in commerce could further exacerbate the situation. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) assessed the macroeconomic effects of mild and severe flu pandemics, estimating a 4-1/4 percent GDP reduction in a severe scenario similar to a U.S. recession. The World Bank and IMF projected potential economic impacts of a pandemic, with the U.S. impact at $100 to $200 billion and global impact at around $800 billion. The global economic and financial impacts of a severe pandemic are expected to be significant, but economic activity is likely to recover quickly once the pandemic subsides. Various studies have shown a wide range of effects on GDP due to pandemics like SARS in 2003, with losses attributed to consumer and investor behavior rather than medical costs. Government actions can either amplify or mitigate the economic impacts of a pandemic. The United States has engaged in pandemic flu planning activities for several decades, with heightened activity in recent years in response to the threat posed by H5N1 avian flu. In addition to response efforts in the public health and medical sectors, a serious pandemic would trigger the National Response Plan (NRP), developed by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as a blueprint for the coordination of federal agencies during an emergency. The NRP is an all-hazards plan for emergencies. The United States has engaged in pandemic flu planning activities for several decades, with heightened activity in recent years in response to the threat posed by H5N1 avian flu. The National Response Plan (NRP) is an all-hazards plan for emergencies, including hurricanes, wildfires, and terrorist attacks. The WHO released a revised pandemic preparedness plan in 2005, outlining goals and actions for WHO and individual nations during each pandemic phase. The WHO pandemic plan outlines recommended actions for individual nations during each pandemic phase, including planning, prevention, health system response, and communications. It includes immediate actions for all countries in Phase 6 (Pandemic Phase), with specific actions for affected, unaffected, and post-pandemic countries. The plan also includes recommendations for nonpharmaceutical public health interventions like isolation and quarantine, emphasizing voluntary measures over compulsory ones. The annex highlights the need to avoid stigmatization of individuals affected by pandemic influenza and its control measures. In November 2005, a central federal website was launched by the Administration, containing pandemic preparedness and response information. The White House Homeland Security Council released the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza in the same year. The House Homeland Security Council released the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza, outlining three goals and three pillars of implementation activities: Preparedness and Communication, Surveillance and Detection, and Response and Containment. The strategy aims to limit the spread of a pandemic, mitigate disease and sustain infrastructure. The National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza outlines goals and implementation activities for preparedness, surveillance, and response. It includes actions for international efforts, transportation, borders, and protecting human health to limit the spread and mitigate illness during a possible pandemic. The White House released a six-month status report in December 2006, stating that 92% of all actions due within six months of release of the Implementation Plan in May 2006 had been completed. In August 2004, HHS released the Draft Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Plan, outlining steps for preparing and responding to a pandemic, including surveillance, vaccine development, antiviral drug use, and communications. The Draft Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Plan, released by HHS in August 2004, was criticized for being vague and delegating critical activities to states. It was superseded by the HHS Pandemic Influenza Plan in November 2005, which included a Strategic Plan, Public Health Guidance for State and Local Partners, and detailed operational plans for HHS agencies involved in pandemic response. The final plan outlined key planning assumptions, HHS agency roles, and the coordination of pandemic response activities by the HHS Secretary and Assistant Secretary for Public Health Emergency Preparedness. The final HHS Pandemic Plan addressed gaps in the draft plan, including priority groups for vaccines and antiviral drugs. Critics noted the lack of surge capacity in healthcare facilities and the need for alternate care sites. The DOD also released pandemic preparation guidance shortly after the HHS draft plan. The DOD guidance for pandemic influenza preparation and response planning emphasizes the high mortality suffered by U.S. troops during World War I due to the 1918 pandemic. It mentions the need for the military to secure its own supplies of vaccine and antiviral drugs, with priority given to forward-deployed troops. Individual control measures like isolation are deemed of limited utility. The guidance emphasizes larger-scale adjustments to slow disease transmission, mentions coalition forces from other nations, and the availability of countermeasures like vaccines and antiviral drugs. The VA released a pandemic flu plan in 2006, noting their supply of Tamiflu. All states were required to submit pandemic flu preparedness plans to HHS by July 2005 for public health preparedness funding. The HHS Pandemic Plan includes state plans available on a federal website, with updates ongoing. The Department of Homeland Security released a guide for critical infrastructure and key resources. Global corporations have adopted pandemic flu plans to varying degrees, with many having a plan in place according to a survey by the Conference Board. The Conference Board survey found that 94% of companies have not discussed pandemic preparedness with government officials, leading to a lack of coordination with the public sector. Limited availability of vaccines and antiviral drugs at the onset of a pandemic is a significant concern. Limited global surge capacity for production of vaccines and antiviral drugs during a pandemic challenges the inevitability of a global wave of disease. Scientific advances may allow for early detection and containment of localized infection clusters, potentially slowing the progression of a pandemic. While a vaccine may not be available for everyone, having enough for essential personnel could soften the impact. The WHO, along with other agencies, is working on building pandemic intelligence and response capacity in countries affected by H5N1 avian flu. The U.S. government is also involved in global pandemic response planning through various partnerships. A serious flu pandemic would impact various sectors of society, not just public health, highlighting the importance of federal efforts in preparedness. The federal government is actively preparing for a potential flu pandemic, with a focus on global response activities. The WHO monitors the spread of novel flu viruses and will announce changes in pandemic threat status. A comprehensive long-term preparedness strategy has been launched, with over 300 tasks in the Implementation Plan. Some tasks are expected to be completed within three months, while others, like establishing domestic capacity for pandemic vaccine production, may take years. The WHO urges countries to plan for a pandemic as a multi-sector threat, with federal relationships traditionally operating sector-by-sector. The White House Homeland Security Council now coordinates federal preparedness activities, with HHS Secretary Michael Leavitt hosting pandemic planning summits in all 50 states. The CDC required state plans for pandemic preparedness, but many focus only on health sector readiness. There is a need for state plans to include the possible role of the National Guard during a pandemic. The National Response Plan (NRP) by DHS could be activated to coordinate federal agency activities in a significant influenza pandemic. During a pandemic, the National Response Plan (NRP) may be activated to coordinate federal agency activities. The Secretary of Homeland Security leads the overall federal response, while the Secretary of HHS leads ESF-8 for Public Health and Medical Services. Other federal departments may also be involved in sustaining infrastructure affected by absenteeism or supply chain disruptions. The National Strategy designates lead federal departments for various aspects of a pandemic response. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is responsible for coordinating the preparedness of critical infrastructures during a pandemic. Congress allocated $350 million for states to conduct pandemic flu exercises to test response procedures such as quarantine, surge capacity, diagnostics, and communication. The United States conducts pandemic flu exercises to test response procedures such as control of community gatherings, medical surge capacity, and mass vaccination. States have the primary authority in public health preparedness and response, with support from HHS, including funding, training, and technical assistance. The Secretary of HHS can declare a public health emergency, expanding federal authorities. In an influenza pandemic, response measures like quarantine and vaccine administration restrictions would be handled by state authorities. The NRP could guide a coordinated federal response to health sector disruptions and other affected sectors. The Secretary of Homeland Security may declare a pandemic an Incident of National Significance, triggering the NRP. During an influenza pandemic, states may need federal assistance to maintain essential services. This assistance is typically triggered by presidential emergency declarations under the Stafford Act, providing funds and supplies to affected households and aiding in infrastructure rebuilding. While a virus may not directly damage infrastructure, sectors like water treatment facilities could be affected by absenteeism or supply chain disruptions. During a pandemic, sectors reliant on continuous computer support may face disruptions due to absenteeism. It is uncertain if major disaster assistance under the Stafford Act could be provided in response to a pandemic. Presidential emergency declarations have been made in the past for infectious disease threats, but the authority to declare a major disaster in response to a flu pandemic is unclear. FEMA has previously considered biological disasters ineligible for major disaster assistance. The Administration believes the President's authority under the Stafford Act could be used for an influenza pandemic. The CDC coordinates surveillance for seasonal flu, including monitoring for pandemic flu. Challenges in detecting novel flu viruses include vague symptoms and difficulty in distinguishing specific strains. The CDC's domestic flu surveillance system includes labs, healthcare providers, death records, and reports from health departments. CDC coordinates surveillance for seasonal flu, including monitoring for pandemic flu in states, territories, New York City, and the District of Columbia. Information is gathered and analyzed weekly during the winter flu season. Recommendations have been issued for investigating possible human cases of avian or pandemic flu in individuals with recent travel history to affected regions. Investigations from 2003 to 2006 showed no evidence of H5N1 virus infections. Rapid point-of-care tests for healthcare are not available at this time. CDC recommends using commercial flu screening tests for initial patient evaluation as there is no rapid point-of-care test available for H5N1 flu. Commercial screening tests may not distinguish H5N1 flu from other strains, so positive results should be followed up with tests at public health labs. Public health labs in all 50 states can test for H5N1 influenza, but there may be delays in shipping samples and obtaining results. The Implementation Plan calls for the development of rapid diagnostic tests for specific flu strains. The CDC awarded contracts to four companies in 2006 for rapid diagnostic tests for specific flu strains. Isolation and quarantine are used to prevent the spread of communicable diseases, with isolation typically occurring in healthcare settings for those who are infected, while quarantine is for those who have been exposed but are not ill. Quarantine authority in the US is generally based on state law, with the federal government responsible for preventing the spread of diseases from foreign countries. The federal government has the authority to impose quarantine on incoming travelers suspected of being infected with certain communicable diseases listed by the President. The CDC's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine carries out federal quarantine activities, including dealing with pandemic influenza. President Bush suggested the use of the military to enforce quarantine measures in 2005. President Bush suggested using the military to enforce quarantines during a flu pandemic, sparking questions about the effectiveness of quarantine for controlling influenza. The CDC is prepared to implement quarantines for incoming travelers to prevent the spread of pandemic flu. The CDC is ready to implement quarantines for incoming travelers and strategies for school closures and social distancing measures to slow disease spread. The Plan emphasizes the need for continued study of the potential impacts of different approaches, including geographic quarantine. CDC released a planning guide for the graded use of non-pharmaceutical interventions in February 2007. The guide for graded use of NPI matches strategies to pandemic severity, recommending voluntary actions over compulsory measures. DOD activated NORTHCOM after 9/11 to provide military assistance in emergencies, but federal troops have rarely been used for domestic quarantines. An influenza pandemic can disrupt the healthcare system by deferring medical procedures, diverting patients, imposing quarantines, and leading to resource hoarding. Factors like rapid spread, limited isolation capacity, and impact on healthcare workforce further complicate the situation. The healthcare system may face challenges during a flu pandemic due to limited resources, including vaccines and antiviral drugs. The surge in demand for healthcare consumables like gloves and masks could strain the system. The WHO recommends prioritizing vaccination and antiviral drugs for key groups before a pandemic occurs. The HHS Secretary and CDC committees met in July 2005 to prioritize vaccine and antiviral drugs for the U.S. civilian population during a pandemic. Recommendations were made for healthcare workers with direct patient contact and those at highest risk of serious complications from flu to receive top priority. Tiers could be redefined based on epidemiologic findings during a pandemic. During the 1918 pandemic, healthy young people were at increased risk of death when infected. More than 60% of the U.S. population, including most children, would not fall into priority groups. Public health practice prioritizes the most vulnerable to severe flu complications. The HHS proposal sparked debate on resource allocation strategies during a pandemic. The HHS proposal for pandemic resource allocation strategies has sparked debate due to conflicting goals of equity and disease transmission. Recommendations for vaccine priorities may change, with HHS seeking input on prioritization considerations. The Implementation Plan requires priority recommendations for access to influenza vaccines to align with pandemic response goals. The HHS established a working group to recommend priority groups for pandemic response goals and national security. They sought input on vaccine priorities, including fairness and equity in determining priority groupings. The deadline for responses was extended to February 5, 2007. Vaccination is crucial for influenza prevention, but vaccines need to be matched to specific strains for effective protection. Flu vaccines need to be matched to specific strains for effective protection. Current production in chicken eggs is time-consuming with a six-month lead time. Efforts are being made to increase production speed, capacity, and develop universal vaccines. Emergency funding was requested for pandemic preparedness in 2005. The US government allocated $3.8 billion in December 2005 and an additional $2.3 billion in June 2006 to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for flu vaccine-related activities. The funding aimed to establish and maintain stockpiles of pre-pandemic vaccines and expand domestic manufacturing capacity. In 2005, global capacity for flu vaccine production was limited, with only one US-based manufacturer. In 2006, worldwide flu vaccine production capacity expanded to 400 million doses. Increasing capacity for pandemic vaccine production may require converting to single-strain production, with two doses possibly needed for protection. High doses of viral antigen were needed for immunity in initial trials of an H5N1 prototype vaccine. To boost domestic vaccine production capacity, HHS issued a solicitation in 2006 to retrofit existing manufacturing facilities for emergency production of pandemic vaccine. In February 2007, HHS planned to issue a request for proposals to build new domestic manufacturing plants for influenza vaccines using cell-based technologies. Research efforts include cell-based production, recombinant vaccines, and antigen-sparing approaches to enhance immunity. NIH supports research for a universal vaccine against diverse flu strains to eliminate the need for annual vaccination. In early February 2007, Indonesia halted providing WHO with H5N1 avian flu samples due to concerns about vaccine access. An agreement was later reached for Indonesia to resume sample sharing once guaranteed affordable vaccines. This incident highlights potential international tensions during a pandemic. The FDA considers pandemic flu vaccines produced using current processes as a strain change, allowing for streamlined approval. Clinical trials for human vaccines should establish efficacy before a pandemic. The HHS final plan notes that pandemic vaccines may be used swiftly if needed. During a pandemic, unlicensed vaccines could be used under FDA's Investigational New Drug provisions or Emergency Use Authorization, allowing for their use in emergencies when alternatives are not available. The Project BioShield Act of 2004 permits the use of unapproved drugs and vaccines during a declared public health emergency. Scientists use reverse genetics to modify flu viruses for mass production of vaccines. This process removes unwanted genes and substitutes others, making it more efficient and reliable. Medimmune, Inc. holds a patent for reverse genetics but has waived compensation for the production of prototype pandemic flu vaccines and clinical trials. MedImmune, Inc. has granted free access to its intellectual property for developing pandemic influenza vaccines to government organizations and companies. They have also offered licenses to manufacturers for commercial sale under reasonable terms. The federal government in the United States can use patented processes with appropriate compensation, while other countries may require specific agreements for vaccine production. The Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act was passed by Congress in December 2006 to address the shortage of seasonal flu vaccine in the United States. It authorizes the Secretary of HHS to track the distribution of federally purchased flu vaccine during a pandemic and improve communication between public health officials and manufacturers. The Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act authorizes the Secretary of HHS to track vaccine distribution and improve communication between public health officials and manufacturers. Vaccine distribution information submitted shall remain confidential and governments are interested in drugs to treat or prevent serious illness from flu. Antibiotics are not effective in treating flu, but antiviral drugs like adamantanes and neuraminidase inhibitors have been developed. Drugs developed to treat flu include adamantanes and neuraminidase inhibitors (NIs). H5N1 flu strain is resistant to adamantanes, so focus is on NIs like oseltamivir (Tamiflu\u00ae) and zanamivir (Relenza\u00ae). NIs can be used for treatment or prevention, with implications for stockpiling and viral resistance. WHO recommends countries stockpile NIs for pandemic preparedness. The Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche, Inc. has signed agreements with external contractors in 10 countries to manufacture Tamiflu for pandemic preparedness. Countries have stockpiled enough Tamiflu to treat a significant portion of their populations. The federal government aims to stockpile antiviral medications to treat 75 million people, with states expected to procure 31 million treatment courses. In October 2006, state health officials reported challenges in funding antiviral drugs for pandemic preparedness. Priority groups for treatment include those with severe flu illness, high-risk individuals, healthcare workers, and responders. Farmers in China were using amantadine to treat poultry flocks. In China, farmers were using the flu antiviral drug amantadine to prevent avian flu in poultry flocks, leading to resistance in the H5N1 strain. Health officials denounced this practice. The FDA prohibited the extra-label use of human anti-influenza drugs in poultry to prevent drug resistance and preserve their effectiveness for treating humans during an influenza pandemic. The effectiveness of antiviral drugs for treating or preventing influenza infections in humans is cautioned against by public health officials due to limited availability and potential drug resistance. It is uncertain if drugs like Tamiflu would improve survival rates during a potential H5N1 pandemic. Governments can stockpile antiviral drugs as a measure to protect citizens in the absence of widespread vaccination availability. Certain vaccines are covered under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), which provides compensation for adverse effects from vaccines through an excise tax on vaccine sales. The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program provides a no-fault alternative to the tort system for resolving personal injury claims resulting from adverse reactions to selected childhood vaccines. Congress added the trivalent flu vaccine to the Vaccine Injury Table, limiting liability for covered vaccines. The Pandemic Influenza Act of 2006 limits liability for countermeasures during public health emergencies, eliminating liability for the United States and others involved in distributing or administering the countermeasure, except in cases of willful misconduct. HHS Secretary Leavitt declared a public health emergency in 2007 for avian influenza, triggering liability protections for pandemic countermeasure influenza A (H5N1). The Pandemic Influenza Act of 2006 provides liability protections for pandemic countermeasure influenza A (H5N1) vaccine during public health emergencies. The act established the \"Covered Countermeasure Process Fund\" to compensate eligible individuals for serious injuries or death caused by the vaccine. HHS was tasked with developing protocols for implementing the act's liability protections and compensation mechanism. In 2003, Congress debated waiving liability for the smallpox vaccination program to protect those involved in delivering the vaccine and compensating those who suffered adverse events. The 1976 swine flu vaccination campaign is often seen as a failure. The 1976 National Swine Flu Immunization Program vaccinated over 40 million civilians but was suspended due to cases of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. The virus never caused a pandemic, and the federal government paid out $93 million to those injured by the vaccine. Analysts noted delays in indemnifying manufacturers threatened vaccine availability. Delays in indemnifying manufacturers affected the availability of swine flu vaccine in 1976 and compromised participation in the smallpox vaccine campaign in 2003. A successful emergency vaccination campaign hinges on resolving policy concerns promptly. The Select Agent program, established in the late 1990s, tracks certain bacteria and viruses for potential use as biological weapons. Following the 2001 anthrax attacks, the program was expanded, with an interagency group deciding which pathogens to include. Registration, background checks, and adherence to guidelines are required for individuals and facilities working with listed organisms. The Select Agent program tracks certain bacteria and viruses for potential use as biological weapons, including highly pathogenic strains of avian influenza like H5N1. Influenza viruses, including the 1918 pandemic flu virus, have been added to the list of Select Agents. CDC Director Julie Gerberding acknowledges the potential threat of influenza viruses being used as biological weapons. Influenza has characteristics of an excellent threat agent due to its easy transmissibility, production, and modification. Dr. Gerberding notes the virus's natural gene shuffling behavior, likening it to a \"very effective terrorist.\" While a human pandemic from H5N1 avian flu would likely be natural, intentional manipulation is possible. The FBI would monitor closely and take action if deliberate human involvement is suspected during a pandemic. The CDC will take action if deliberate human intervention is suspected in the spread of a pandemic."
