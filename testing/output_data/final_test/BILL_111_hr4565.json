The \"Rural Jobs Tax Credit Act of 2010\" introduces a credit for eligible employers based on wage increases from the previous year. Eligible employers are those conducting business in areas with populations under 50,000. The \"Rural Jobs Tax Credit Act of 2010\" provides a credit to eligible employers in areas with populations under 50,000 based on wage increases from the previous year. Eligible employers in urban areas with populations over 50,000 or adjacent to such areas can receive quarterly advance payments of the credit. The \"Rural Jobs Tax Credit Act of 2010\" provides a credit to eligible employers in areas with populations under 50,000 based on wage increases from the previous year. Eligible employers in urban areas with populations over 50,000 or adjacent to such areas can receive quarterly advance payments of the credit. Payments for calendar quarters ending within a taxable year will increase the tax imposed for that year. No claims allowed for any calendar quarter. The subsection specifies the deadline for filing claims for a tax credit, with interest payable if the claim is not processed within a certain timeframe. The total wages must increase to qualify for the credit in any taxable year. The section discusses the conditions for qualifying for a tax credit based on wages, including provisions for inflation-adjusted wages and a percentage increase requirement. The section outlines the inflation percentages for determining inflation-adjusted wages in 2009 and 2010. It defines \"wages\" as the amount not exceeding the median household income in the US for the previous year, except for railway labor remuneration. The term 'wages' subject to tax is defined as compensation not exceeding the median household income in the US for the previous year. Special rules apply for acquisitions of trade or business portions after December 31, 2008. After an acquisition, wages paid by the predecessor for the acquired trade or business are added to the amount of wages paid by the employer. Special rules apply for employer dispositions of trade or business portions after December 31, 2008. If an individual transitions from self-employment to being an employee of the same trade or business in the following calendar year, the amount of wages deemed paid by the employer before the transition is reduced by the wages attributable to the trade or business. This applies for calendar years after the transition occurred in 2009 or 2010. If an individual transitions from self-employment to being an employee of the same trade or business in the following calendar year, the employer's aggregate wages for 2009 or 2010 will be increased by an amount equal to the net earnings not exceeding the median household income in the United States for the respective year. Certain rules regarding remuneration and treatment of successor employers and employees will also apply. The text discusses tax credits for employers with multiple taxable years in 2010 or 2011, treating tax-exempt employers as taxpayers, and denying double benefits. Conforming amendments are also made to related sections of the tax code. The table of sections for tax credits is amended to include a new item after section 36A. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2009. The Secretary of the Treasury will inform businesses about the availability of section 36B of the Internal Revenue Code."
