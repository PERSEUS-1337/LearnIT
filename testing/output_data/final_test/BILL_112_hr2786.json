    "content": "The \"Holocaust Survivors Assistance Act of 2011\" aims to provide preference for services to older individuals who are Holocaust survivors, designate a responsible individual within the Administration on Aging, and create a grant program to enhance transportation services for this group. The Congress acknowledges the significant impact of the Holocaust, with millions of Jews and others murdered by the Nazis. There are approximately 127,000 Holocaust survivors in the US, many of whom are aging and in need of additional support. Providers are facing increased demand for services without additional funding. Most survivors are over 75 years old, with many in their 80s and 90s. More than half of Holocaust survivors who emigrated to the US from the former Soviet Union after 1965 are below the poverty threshold, facing mental and physical scars from the Holocaust. Institutionalized care can retraumatize survivors due to triggering memories. Approximately two-thirds of Holocaust survivors live alone, which is a risk factor for institutionalization. Low-income survivors rely heavily on social service programs for personal care, meals, transportation, counseling, and mental health support. The term 'Holocaust survivor' is defined as an individual who lived in a country under Nazi regime, occupation, or control between 1933 and 1945, was persecuted based on various factors, and was a member of a group persecuted by the Nazis.
