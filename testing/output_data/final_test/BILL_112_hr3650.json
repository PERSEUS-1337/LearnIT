    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Federal Zero Tolerance of Child Sexual Abuse Act of 2011\". The Congress finds that children are vulnerable to sexual abuse, with 1 out of 3 girls and 1 out of 5 boys becoming victims by age 18. Most abuse is committed by trusted family members or friends, making it difficult to identify victims due to lack of physical signs. Children who have been abused may not exhibit behavioral changes when the abuse is reported. Most sexually abused children do not disclose their abuse, with a majority of victims being juveniles. Failing to protect a child from abuse can be fatal, with more than 5 children dying every day as a result. Girls are sexually abused more frequently than boys, but boys are more likely to die or be seriously injured from abuse. Child sexual abuse is often unreported, with up to 80,000 cases a year. Victims may develop low self-esteem and psychological disorders. A cycle of abuse can continue, with 30% of abused children becoming abusers themselves. SEC. 3. NO FEDERAL FUNDS FOR VIOLATION OF ZERO TOLERANCE REQUIREMENTS. Zero Tolerance for Failure To Report Sexual Abuse of a Minor - Federal funds will be withheld from a covered entity if they violate this section or related regulations, determined by the severity of the violation. The Attorney General can reduce or terminate penalties for non-compliance with regulations if a covered entity enforces necessary policies. Federal student financial aid at higher education institutions is exempt from penalties. The Attorney General, in consultation with other departments, must create regulations within 6 months of the Act's enactment to ensure reporting of sexual abuse of minors by employees of covered entities. Effective date for this subsection is one year after regulations are promulgated. The regulations require covered entities to report any sexual abuse of minors to law enforcement, provide training to employees on reporting incidents, and offer reimbursement for treatment to minor victims of sexual abuse. The regulations mandate covered entities to report sexual abuse of minors, provide training on reporting incidents, offer reimbursement for treatment to victims, allow for a hearing if in violation, and prohibit discrimination against employees reporting abuse. In this section, definitions include \"covered entity\" as an institution of higher education or a non-profit organization serving minors, \"minor\" as an individual under 18, \"officer\" in relation to higher education, and \"sexual abuse\" as defined. The term \"sexual abuse\" is defined in section 111 of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act. Section 106(b)(2)(B)(i) of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act is amended to include individuals employed in positions involving direct contact with children for mandatory reporting by state employees."
