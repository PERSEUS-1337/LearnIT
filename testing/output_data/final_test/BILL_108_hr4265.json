    "content": "CHARITABLE DONATIONS LIABILITY REFORM FOR IN-KIND CORPORATE CONTRIBUTIONS. Definitions for this section include terms like \"aircraft,\" \"business entity,\" \"equipment,\" \"facility,\" and \"gross negligence.\" The term \"intentional misconduct\" refers to conduct that is knowingly harmful to another person's health or well-being. The term \"motor vehicle\" is defined as provided in section 30102(6) of title 49, United States Code. The term \"nonprofit organization\" includes organizations exempt from tax under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code or those operated primarily for charitable, civic, educational, religious, welfare, or public benefit purposes. The term \"State\" encompasses various regions under the jurisdiction of the United States. A business entity donating equipment to a nonprofit organization is not liable for any resulting injury or death, except in cases of intentional misconduct. Business entities providing facilities to nonprofit organizations are not liable for injuries or deaths occurring on their premises during the nonprofit's use, as long as the use is outside the business entity's scope and the injury occurs during the nonprofit's use. Business entities are not liable for injuries or deaths resulting from the operation of motor vehicles or aircraft, as long as the use is authorized by a nonprofit organization. This applies to civil liability under Federal and State law, regardless of whether the nonprofit organization pays for the facility's use. Business entities are not liable for injuries or deaths from the operation of aircraft or motor vehicles loaned to a nonprofit organization for non-business use, as long as the use is authorized by the business entity. This exemption applies to civil liability under Federal and State law. Exceptions to the liability exemption for business entities include injuries or deaths resulting from gross negligence or intentional misconduct. This section preempts state laws inconsistent with it, but does not preempt laws providing additional protection for business entities in certain circumstances. The section does not supersede any Federal or State health or safety law. A State can choose not to apply this section to civil actions in State court if it enacts a statute declaring such election. This section applies to injuries occurring after the enactment of the Act."
