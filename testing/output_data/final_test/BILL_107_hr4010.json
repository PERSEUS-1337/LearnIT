    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Terrorist Admission Prevention Act of 2002\". The Congress finds that US border security agencies are overwhelmed with visits, current systems are inadequate, and the USA PATRIOT Act provisions will enhance border security to identify individuals entering and exiting the country. Most 9/11 terrorists entered with approved visas without being identified by immigration authorities. Terrorist organizations in various countries pose a threat to the United States, with individuals on the FBI's most wanted list connected to attacks on the US. Mohamed Atta, an Egyptian organizer of the 9/11 attacks, was able to enter and exit the US multiple times despite being on the terrorist watch list. Nearly half of the 9/11 hijackers were Saudi citizens who entered the US on approved visas. Most suspects in the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing were also Saudi citizens. Yemen is designated as a terrorist haven, with operatives responsible for the 1999 USS Cole attack. SEC. 3. TEMPORARY MORATORIUM ON THE ISSUANCE OF CERTAIN ALIEN IMMIGRANT AND NONIMMIGRANT VISAS. During the moratorium period, no immigrant or nonimmigrant visas can be issued to individuals from specific countries listed in the provision. During the moratorium period, visas are restricted for individuals from certain countries, including Somalia, United Arab Emirates, Yemen, and any country designated as a state sponsor of terrorism. The term \"state sponsor of terrorism\" refers to countries determined by the Secretary of State to have supported international terrorism. Diplomatic visas are exempt from this restriction. Multiple citizenship is subject to the visa limitations. During the moratorium period, aliens from certain countries are ineligible for visa waivers under the Visa Waiver Program, regardless of their citizenship status. The moratorium period begins 5 days after the enactment date. The moratorium period starts 5 days after the Act's enactment and ends 30 days after certification by the Attorney General. The certification includes full implementation of certain sections of Public Law 107-56 and the requirement for biometric data on visas. The Attorney General can grant exceptions to the moratorium. The Attorney General may waive limitations for admitting aliens in the national interest or family unity, if refusal would cause extreme hardship to a US citizen or lawful resident. Waiver authority can be delegated to the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization Service. The Attorney General may waive limitations on admitting aliens for national interest or family unity, with a maximum of 100 aliens per country per fiscal year under subsection (a)(2). SEC. 4 amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to expand the definition of terrorist activities for deportation purposes. The amendment applies retroactively to all actions taken by aliens before or after the enactment of the Act. SEC. 5 requires an inquiry regarding the country of birth at the point of entry. SEC. 5 requires border officials to ask individuals entering the US about their country of birth. Nonimmigrant visas must also indicate the alien's country of birth. SEC. 6 eliminates waiver authority for machine-readable passports. SEC. 7 mandates a study by the General Accounting Office. The General Accounting Office must submit biannual reports to Congress evaluating reforms in the Immigration and Naturalization Service, preventing terrorists from entering the US, monitoring alien travel, cooperation among law enforcement agencies, and background checks for visa-seeking aliens. The curr_chunk discusses the background check process for aliens seeking visas and measures to safeguard US borders and improve visa checks. It also evaluates the effectiveness of border security in the United States. SEC. 8 prohibits aliens from certain countries from receiving relief under section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. SEC. 9 requires additional information from registered aliens. Section 265 of the Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to require registered aliens to annually notify the Attorney General of specific information, with penalties increased to $500 for non-compliance."
