    "content": "Real wages at different percentiles of the wage distribution varied over the 1979-2018 period, with the 10th percentile growing by 1.6%, the 50th percentile by 6.1%, and the 90th percentile by 37.6%. Wage differentials between the 10th and 50th percentile remained stable after 1990 until the 2009 recession, indicating a stabilization of inequality in the bottom half of the wage distribution, primarily for male workers. Female workers saw a more modest growth in differentials in the bottom half, mainly in the early 1980s. In the early 1980s, wage differentials between educational levels were significant. College graduates dominated the top quintile, while those with less than a high school diploma earned the lowest wages. In 2016, median weekly earnings varied: $504 for less than high school, $1,156 for bachelor's, $1,380 for master's, $1,745 for professional, and $1,664 for doctoral degrees. The wage premium for a college degree rose from 134% in 1979 to 168% in 2016, and for an advanced degree from 154% to 213%. The wage premium for a college degree rose steeply until about 2000, then continued to rise slightly after 2000. The share of workers with a college degree increased from 23% to 40% between 1979 and 2016, indicating a rise in demand for skilled workers. Real wages for men with a high school diploma or less declined significantly from 1979 to 1999, while women with a high school diploma experienced small, positive growth. Labor compensation as a share of income has been falling since 2001, from 64.3% to 58% in 2015. The share of employee wages fell from 46.8% to 42.8% of gross domestic income (GDI) while fringe benefits rose as a share of employee compensation. The fall in the labor share of income occurred primarily after 2000, leading to increased income inequality. From 1979 to 2017, the income share of the bottom quintile fell from 5.3% to 3.5%, while the share of the top quintile rose from 41.9% to 50.1%. Labor compensation differentials increased more than wage differentials from the late 1970s to the mid-1990s. The decline in the labor compensation share may be attributed to the growth of entrepreneurial income at the top of the income distribution, partly due to tax incentives favoring pass-through businesses. One study analyzed the national distribution of income from 1946 to 2014, showing a shift in income growth rates. From 1946 to 1980, overall income grew at 2%, with the bottom 50% and top 10% growing at 2% and 1.7% respectively. From 1980 to 2014, overall growth decreased to 1.4%, with the bottom 50% seeing no growth and the top 10% growing at 2.4%. The share of income for the bottom 50% declined from 20% in 1979 to 12% today. The share of income of the bottom 50% declined from 20% in 1979 to 12% today. This study focuses on individual incomes rather than family units and shows a similar pattern to other measures. Lower-income workers experienced a decline in wages relative to the median in the 1980s, while median wage earners saw a decline compared to top wage earners. Since 2000, the labor share of income has also declined, resulting in income stagnation among less-skilled workers. Factors contributing to the lack of wage growth at the bottom of the distribution are discussed. Factors contributing to the lack of wage growth at the bottom of the distribution include technology, globalization, wage-setting institutions, immigration, and reduced labor mobility. The decline in the labor income share has also contributed to inequality. Many economists attribute the lack of wage growth to technology and international trade, which have led to a rising demand for skills and a slowdown in the growth of new college graduates. Technological advancements have historically improved living standards but have also caused disruptions, particularly for less-skilled workers who fail to benefit from these advances. Recent technological advances have led to a decline in well-paid factory jobs, with machinery replacing workers. This shift has resulted in a decrease in steel industry employment despite constant shipments. The surge in wage inequality in the 1980s was attributed to a rise in demand for skilled workers, possibly accelerated by the computer revolution. The surge in wage inequality in the 1980s was linked to the computer revolution, showing a correlation between positive wage changes and computer use by workers. Studies indicated that more-skilled workers were in demand due to new technology, leading to a diffusion of computer-based processes that could replace routine jobs, particularly in clerical and production roles. Wage dispersion within industries pointed to technology as the main driver of increased demand for skilled workers. The surge in wage inequality in the 1980s was linked to the computer revolution, showing a correlation between positive wage changes and computer use by workers. More-skilled workers were in demand due to new technology, leading to a diffusion of computer-based processes that could replace routine jobs. Increased demand for skilled workers was driven by technology, with differential wages across workers producing different products pointing to a trade-driven effect. The slowdown in the growth of workers with college degrees was partly attributed to the end of the growth in college attendance induced by the Vietnam War and the decline in the college wage premium prior to the 1980s. The decline in college attendance after the Vietnam War led to a less-educated workforce in the 1980s. Wage changes in the 1980s were influenced by technology and automation, affecting low-skilled workers more than high-skilled workers. In the 1990s, information technology impacted moderately educated workers but not the lowest-skilled workers. Employment in both low-skilled and high-skilled occupations grew relative to middle-skilled occupations, attributed to technological advancements in information and communication. Technological advancements in information and communication have led to the substitution of machines for routine tasks, impacting wage differences. Evidence suggests that technology is a more significant driver of changes in wages compared to trade. Prominent labor economists, such as Lawrence Katz and David Autor, emphasize the importance of automation over globalization in affecting the workforce. Technological advancements favor more-skilled workers with the increased use of industrial robots and computerization of jobs. New technology and algorithms are making computers substitutes for tasks, impacting the labor share of income. The reasons for this decline are unsettled, with nonwage income being a significant source. Most top income is nonwage income, primarily from private business profit, driven by labor input from entrepreneurs. Economists agree that international trade benefits the overall economy, with estimated output increase of 2% to 8% of GDP. Trade involves substitution of production types, with no expected impact on income distribution. The impact of trade on income distribution is modest compared to technology. Increased wage differentials within sectors suggest a technology-based cause over trade. Inequality has risen in both advanced and developing countries, contradicting the idea that trade would make developing countries more equal. Studies have shown that the impact of trade on income distribution is small compared to technological changes. The rise in inequality in both advanced and developing countries contradicts the belief that trade would make developing countries more equal. China's entry into the World Trade Organization led to a decline in manufacturing jobs and increased unemployment in areas competing with imports. The studies highlight the adjustment costs of a significant trade change on trade-impacted sectors, particularly affecting lower-wage workers. China's import growth is seen as a shock, with one study showing a loss of 2 million jobs in the US from 1999 to 2011. Despite this, the impact on wages stagnation at the lower end of the distribution over the past 40 years is not solely attributed to the China trade increase. The China trade increase did not solely cause wage stagnation at the lower end of the distribution over the past 40 years. Bilateral trade balances cannot infer overall economic effects, as imports can lead to output increases in other sectors. Globalization may have boosted incomes for high-income individuals and high-tech multinational firms. The decline in the labor share of income is not solely attributed to traditional arguments like labor-intensive imports. Instead, it may be linked to the growth of successful multinational firms, leading to increased capital income rather than labor income. Current empirical evidence suggests that technology, rather than trade, is a more significant factor in relative wage stagnation at the lower end of the income distribution. The decline in the labor share of income is not solely due to labor-intensive imports but may be linked to successful multinational firms increasing capital income over labor income. Technology, education, and trade are seen as causes of wage stagnation at the lower end of the income distribution. Factors like the minimum wage, union membership, and wage-setting norms have also contributed to income and wage inequality. The federal minimum wage, currently $7.25 per hour, is not adjusted for inflation, leading to fluctuations in its real value over time. The minimum wage has fluctuated since 1989, declining from 1997 to 2006 before increasing again. Early studies linked the decline in the minimum wage in the 1980s to a decrease in relative wages at the bottom of the distribution. However, recent studies suggest that the growth in inequality is primarily due to skill-based technological changes rather than the minimum wage. A study extending data through 2012 found minimal effects of state minimum wages on male inequality, with a more significant impact on women. Union membership in the private sector declined significantly from 1973 to 2018, potentially contributing to rising wage inequality. The decline in union membership in the private sector from 1973 to 2018 potentially contributed to increasing wage inequality, with studies showing minimal effects of unions on male inequality and a more significant impact on women. Studies suggest that the effect of unions on wages was limited, especially for men, and may have contributed to increased inequality in the upper half of the wage distribution but reduced inequality in the bottom half. The decline in union membership from 1973 to 2018 potentially increased wage inequality, with studies showing unions had a significant impact on women's wages. The decline in unions was responsible for a portion of the wage inequality decrease for both men and women from 1979 to 2007, suggesting union effects may be larger than projected. It is challenging to separate the effects of unions from other factors like technological change on wage inequality. The decline in union membership from 1973 to 2018 potentially increased wage inequality, with studies showing unions had a significant impact on women's wages. The union wage premium has fallen in the private sector due to technological change and foreign competition. Right-to-work laws in 27 states affect union density and bargaining strength. Studies on right-to-work (RTW) laws suggest they may reduce union membership and bargaining strength, with minimal impact on wages. Most studies find small effects on wages, with a negligible effect on rising inequality. The majority of RTW laws were adopted before the increase in wage inequality. The decline in large firm wage premium, which accounted for 20% of wage inequality from 1989 to 2014, is attributed to the fading of internal labor markets in large firms. The decline of internal labor markets (ILMs) in large firms aimed to reduce discrimination and favoritism by setting wages for specific jobs rather than individual workers. ILMs compressed wages horizontally and vertically, promoting internal pay equity and loyalty among workers. However, the decline in ILMs is evident through reduced returns to tenure, increased external hiring, lower tenure rates, decreased firm-sponsored training, and a shift towards pay-for-performance. Large firms have increased outsourcing to other firms and individuals for tasks, impacting wage distribution. Pay-for-performance has led to lower wages for some and higher wages for others. Factors such as declining unionization and a shift in the perception of firms as social institutions have contributed to changes in wages. The large firm wage premium and decline in union wage effects are partly due to economic changes like increased competition through technology. The slow growth in wages of less-skilled individuals can be attributed to fundamental economic changes, globalization, and technology. Immigration also plays a role, with immigrants increasing labor supply but also demand for goods and services. The effect of immigration on wages is complex and varies based on factors like skills and cost savings for firms. Studies compare wage changes in locations with more immigrants to those with less to understand the impact on wage structure. The impact of immigration on wages is small, with effects mostly on native-born workers who have not completed high school. Studies show a less than 1% wage effect due to immigration, with little evidence of an effect on employment levels for native-born workers. Skilled immigrants can have a positive wage effect on some groups, and overall immigration has a positive effect on long-term economic growth. Controlling for immigrants' choice of location or occupation is a challenge in immigration studies. The Mariel boatlift in 1980 brought a large number of unskilled Cuban immigrants to Miami, increasing the labor force by 7%. Despite this influx, no significant impact was found on wages or employment for non-Hispanic workers with a high school education or less. This event serves as a relevant natural experiment due to the controlled nature of immigrants' choices and the significant surge in immigration relative to the labor force size. The share of foreign-born workforce has been increasing, from 6.7% in 1980 to 17.0% in 2016. Immigrants are concentrated in both upper and lower skill levels, making a small contribution to inequality. Decrease in labor force mobility and job changes may also contribute to lower wages. Labor mobility has declined, affecting worker job changes and interstate mobility. Factors include an aging workforce, industry diversification, and increasing employer concentration. Reduced mobility impacts wages and the power of employers. Noncompete and no-poaching contracts limit job mobility, especially in high-paying jobs. State attorneys general have taken action against these practices in fast-food chains. Occupational licensing also hinders labor mobility, particularly for educated workers. Barriers to job mobility include high housing prices due to land-use regulation, limited geographic mobility, lack of portability of public benefits, and defined benefit pensions in the public sector. Homeowners benefit from subsidies that make housing more expensive for relocating workers, but the 2017 tax revision has reduced these tax subsidies significantly. The 2017 tax revision (P.L. 115-97) has reduced tax subsidies significantly by limiting deductions and increasing the standard deduction, scheduled to expire after 2025. Policy options for addressing wage stagnation include direct taxes, transfers, wage subsidies, and minimum wage increases to reduce inequality and boost lower- and middle-income individuals' incomes. The discussion includes proposals to increase pretax wages through wage subsidies and minimum wage increases, as well as policies for greater equality like education programs and relocation assistance. These proposals may involve costs in lost revenues and regulatory changes that could impact labor income and market efficiency. The report focuses on pretax income, but government tax and transfer programs also shape posttax and post-transfer income. In 2016, tax and means-tested transfers increased income for the bottom quintile by 70% and the second quintile by 6%. The third, fourth, and fifth quintiles saw their income decrease due to net tax payments. These transfers helped the bottom 20% receive a larger share of total income, with some benefits going to those on public assistance. Increasing the income share of low-wage workers could be achieved by reducing taxation, increasing direct transfers, and expanding refundable tax credits. Lower-income workers may benefit from programs providing general transfers or specific benefits, such as subsidies for food, housing, health insurance, and health care. Considerations for addressing increased inequality include tying transfers to wages or making them general. Proposals for a universal basic income could provide a grant to everyone to establish a minimum income floor. However, concerns about cost and work disincentives exist, as seen in past experiments with negative income tax. Another approach is to expand the earned income tax credit. An alternative approach to addressing increased inequality is to expand the earned income tax credit (EITC), which provides a credit for a percentage of wages up to a maximum and is phased out based on income. The EITC is particularly beneficial for families with children, with varying credit percentages and maximum amounts based on the number of children. Childless workers aged 25-64 can also receive the credit, with proposals to increase it in the past. The Economic Mobility Act of 2019 aims to expand the earned income tax credit (EITC) for childless workers by doubling the credit rate to 15.3%, increasing the maximum credit to $1,464, and raising the income level for phaseout. Other proposals in the 116th Congress include the LIFT the Middle Class Act and the Rise Credit. Cory Booker introduced the Cost-of-Living Refund Act of 2019, along with bills to expand the earned income credit and child credit. The expanded EITC for childless workers in H.R. 3300 would cost an average of $9.7 billion a year. Various EITC proposals have costs ranging from $0.5 billion to $21.6 billion per year. The LIFT the Middle Class Act proposes cash transfers of up to $6,000 for married couples and half for singles, costing close to $300 billion a year. One proposal suggests replacing the current EITC with a credit for 100% of the first $10,000 of earnings, funded by an 11% value-added tax. The proposal suggests replacing the current EITC with a credit for 100% of the first $10,000 of earnings, funded by an 11% value-added tax. Employer wage subsidies as an alternative to the EITC have not been widely adopted, with the current general subsidy being the work opportunity tax credit (WOTC) for hiring individuals from certain targeted groups. Studies show a low participation rate in the WOTC program, but it has led to higher wages for eligible employees and increased employment opportunities for long-term welfare recipients and disabled veterans. Employer wage subsidies have been limited to specific programs with low participation rates. General wage subsidies could be more effective as they are not geographically targeted and have shown mixed evidence of effectiveness in past recessions. Employer subsidies differ from employee credits and may incentivize hiring employees who would not be hired without the subsidy. Employer subsidies are limited to specific programs and may not significantly impact wage inequality. There is a preference for employee-side credits like the EITC over general employer wage credits. Increasing the minimum wage would boost after-tax earnings but spread costs to consumers through higher prices. A higher minimum wage can lead to higher prices and reduced business income, potentially causing unemployment. The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) can provide income based on family need, but may not benefit childless workers. Raising the minimum wage to $15 could result in reduced employment, according to a 2019 CBO study. The CBO's estimates for the impact of raising the minimum wage to $15 show a reduction in employment by 1.3 million workers. Families below the poverty level would see income increases of $7.7 billion, while higher-income families would experience income reductions due to increased price levels. The CBO's findings suggest that only a small number of workers would be unemployed, especially for smaller wage increases. Some studies show conflicting evidence on the minimum wage's impact on employment, with potential reductions in jobs or hours. States and localities have been increasing minimum wages, with 13 states and the District of Columbia raising them in 2019. This could lead to reduced earnings for some at the bottom of the income distribution, despite increasing earnings for those who remain employed. In 2020, 14 states increased their minimum wages due to legislative actions or ballot initiatives, while 7 states raised levels based on the cost of living. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and Senator Bernie Sanders have proposed plans for a federal job guarantee with specified wages. Senator Cory Booker has suggested a pilot program in high-need communities. The National Investment Employment Corps plan aims to provide universal job coverage for all adult Americans with a minimum annual wage of $24,600 for full-time work. The proponents of a federal job guarantee program argue that it would set a minimum wage floor in the labor market and provide jobs addressing community needs. The Marshall Plan for America would target non-college degree holders with a $15 hourly wage. The estimated cost of these plans ranges from $450 billion to $670 billion per year. Challenges include fluctuating workforce size and funding concerns. The guaranteed job workforce in a federal job guarantee program may face challenges in matching workers with tasks due to fluctuating workforce size. Allocation of work and output would be determined by fiat, potentially leading to misallocation of resources. Issues may arise in establishing jobs to meet local community needs, especially in sparsely populated rural areas. Background checks and proper job placement may be necessary to ensure suitability for certain positions. Wage insurance policies were proposed during the slowing of the economy in 2001 to relieve worker anxiety, counter the drop in earnings, and encourage rapid reemployment. This policy idea was mostly dormant until President Obama proposed wage insurance in his final term. President Obama proposed wage insurance in 2016 for those making less than $50,000, replacing half of lost wages up to $10,000 for up to two years. Canada had a more generous temporary wage insurance pilot program, and some states offered wage bonuses for reemployment. Concerns include eligibility and targeting to avoid incentivizing poor job searches. There is a potential benefit of employers not being aware of the supplement. The government plays a significant role in providing formal education through public schooling and subsidized state colleges and universities. Pell grants, student loans, and tax credits are available, but may not fully benefit lower-income individuals. Wage insurance could help workers adjust to new employment after job loss due to technological change or other factors. Pell grants are available for certificates and occupational degrees, but not for short-term training. Pell Grants are authorized at $22.5 billion, and tax credits cost $19.1 billion. The Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006 supports career technical education with slightly over $1 billion. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act provides employment and training for low-income job seekers. Workforce development programs include state formula grant programs of $3.3 billion, Jobs Corps at $2.0 billion, and national programs at $0.3 billion. Adult education and literacy receive $0.7 billion, and rehabilitation for individuals with disabilities has $3.7 billion available. Proposals to increase skill acquisition and support lifetime training include expanding higher education grant programs, making tax credits refundable, and providing free education at community colleges or public universities. Improving the effectiveness of community colleges is crucial to reduce dropout rates and facilitate credit transfers to four-year institutions. Expanding WIOA programs is another option, as evidence shows success in improving labor outcomes for adult programs. The Jobs Corp and WIOA programs have shown some success in improving labor outcomes, particularly for youths. However, the Trade Adjustment Assistance program has been relatively ineffective. Despite the small size of spending on these programs in the United States, there are suggestions for making WIOA more effective, such as sector-based training, input from both labor and management, and funding for workforce intermediaries. Apprenticeships are also proposed as an alternative for those not interested in college. Apprenticeships could be funded through grants or tax credits for employers, providing an incentive for participation in qualified programs. The LEAP Act proposed credits for employers in apprenticeship programs, with grants targeting high-growth industries. President Trump has proposed an expanded apprenticeship program with more industry involvement, but some argue it may weaken apprenticeships. Other options include tax subsidies, matching funds for training accounts, and penalty-free withdrawals from retirement accounts. S. 379 and S. 275 would allow tax-free distributions from education savings plans for training expenses. Work schedule uncertainty is a barrier to training. Senator Warren's legislation aimed to address work schedule uncertainty as a barrier to training, potentially caused by the decline in union membership. Unions can impact income inequality and create economic distortions by setting wages differently from market norms. Despite this, unions have been shown to increase wages for blue-collar workers, suggesting that proposals to strengthen unions could be beneficial. Proposals to strengthen unions include increasing penalties for labor law violations, prohibiting replacement workers in strikes, establishing mandatory arbitration, eliminating right-to-work laws, and allowing public-sector employees to organize. Evidence suggests that right-to-work laws weaken unions and lower wages. Another suggestion is for unions to organize multiemployer regional or local unions instead of company-wide unions due to the challenges posed by dispersed large employers. The decline in labor mobility is a concern due to dispersed large employers. Proposed solutions include scrutinizing mergers, banning noncompete and no-poaching agreements, and enforcing antitrust laws. Senators Booker and Warren aim to outlaw no-poaching clauses in franchise agreements. Other measures to promote mobility include reducing tax subsidies for homeownership and addressing restrictive zoning laws. Enforcement against restrictive zoning harming minorities; revising antitrust law for occupational licensing organizations; harmonizing federal transfer eligibility rules; providing tax subsidy for moving; cash subsidies for zoning and occupational license relaxation; penalties for localities restricting housing construction. Arguments for policies discouraging labor mobility and benefits of land-use restrictions for local residents. Employers argue for noncompete clauses to protect trade secrets and training investments. Geographically targeted subsidies in the income tax code aim to help workers in distressed areas but have not been effective in creating jobs due to their small size and focus on investment rather than employment. Geographically targeted subsidies in the income tax code have not effectively created jobs in high-unemployment areas. Possible policies include wage subsidies, training funds, and government infrastructure investment. Senator Cory Booker has proposed a guaranteed jobs program for these areas. Some suggest tax subsidies to stimulate overall economic growth, but there are concerns with this approach. Tax subsidies to investment often involve issues that suggest more targeted proposals. Past 40 years show some groups left behind with economic growth from technological advancement. Formulating policies to stimulate growth using common approaches like lowering tax rates may not be successful. Evidence suggests tax cuts may not be effective as supply responses are inelastic and can add to the deficit, crowding out private investment. Slow wage growth and decline in labor income share contribute to growing income inequality. Technological advancement is the main cause of wage stagnation for lower-wage workers, while globalization and the decline in wage-setting institutions also play a role in income inequality. Immigration changes and a decline in labor mobility have minimal effects. Transfer programs like the earned income credit are successful in targeting low-income wage earners. Universal basic income programs targeted at low-income wage earners may require raising taxes on higher-income individuals. Limited evidence suggests potential costs if not phased out, with past evidence showing negative effects on work effort. Minimum wage increases have shown the ability to transfer income with minimal impact on unemployment. Other policies like employer wage subsidies and worker training programs have had mixed results. Untried proposals like a federal job guarantee could cost billions annually. A federal job guarantee could cost several hundred billion dollars a year and pose challenges in administration. Limited proposals targeting lower-income individuals have had small effects, while tax cuts to stimulate economic growth have not effectively addressed slow wage growth for low-wage workers."
