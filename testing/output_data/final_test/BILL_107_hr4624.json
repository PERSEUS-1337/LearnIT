    "content": "The \"Nuclear Threat Reduction Act of 2002\" is the short title of this Act. It states the policy and findings related to nuclear threats. The United States aims to cooperate with Russia to prevent the diversion of weapons of mass destruction and expertise necessary for building them. Congress finds it crucial to reduce nuclear warheads and materials in both countries and supports programs to prevent proliferation. The President should have the authority to implement threat reduction programs effectively. The United States aims to work with Russia to prevent weapons of mass destruction proliferation by creating a comprehensive inventory of nuclear materials. There should be a clear plan for reducing nuclear arsenals, and a continued moratorium on nuclear tests, with Congress being informed if testing resumes. Prior to the resumption of testing, Congress was given the opportunity to express its views on this critical issue. TITLE I--COOPERATIVE THREAT REDUCTION WAIVER AUTHORITY\n\nSEC. 101. COOPERATIVE THREAT REDUCTION WAIVER AUTHORITY.\n\nSection 1203 of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Act of 1993 is amended to allow the President to waive certain restrictions if it is deemed important for national security interests.\n\nTITLE II--DATA EXCHANGE WITH RUSSIA RELATING TO WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION\n\nSEC. 201. STATEMENT OF POLICY. SEC. 201. STATEMENT OF POLICY. The United States aims to cooperatively establish inventories and exchanges of weapons-grade nuclear materials, tritium, and warheads with Russia, prioritizing tactical nuclear warheads. Subsection d. of section 144 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 is amended to include tritium in the definition of fissile material, specify that atomic weapons include tactical weapons and warheads, and require the exchange of information on tritium as part of a reciprocal agreement. SEC. 203. ANNUAL REPORT. The President must submit an annual report to Congress on the progress of implementing section 201 in both unclassified and classified formats. This requirement ends once the comprehensive inventory is completed and information is exchanged between the US and Russian governments. TITLE III--EXPANDED NON-PROLIFERATION FUNDING. SEC. 301. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. In fiscal year 2003, $600 million is authorized for Department of Defense, with $180 million for chemical weapons destruction in Russia. $1.4 billion is authorized for Department of Energy, including funds for defense nuclear nonproliferation activities. For international nuclear safety, $25,000,000 is authorized. $520,000,000 is authorized for weapons activities, campaigns, and high energy density physics, with $50,000,000 for experimental support technologies. $300,000,000 is authorized for the Department of State. TITLE IV--MATTERS RELATING TO THE NUCLEAR POSTURE REVIEW\n\nCongress supports the President's objective, as stated in the Nuclear Posture Review dated January 2002, for maintaining 1,700 to 2,200 operationally deployed nuclear warheads by fiscal year 2012. An annual report on the number and posture of nuclear weapons is required. The Secretary of Energy must submit an annual report to Congress on the number and posture of US nuclear warheads, including those operationally deployed, in the responsive force, in the reserve force (active and inactive), and scheduled for dismantling. Additionally, a report on options to achieve the President's objective of 1,700 to 2,200 operationally deployed nuclear warheads by fiscal year 2012 is required. The Secretary of Energy is required to submit a report to Congress on options for maintaining 1,700 to 2,200 operationally deployed nuclear warheads by fiscal year 2012. The report must assess the effects on cost, environmental compliance, dismantlement workforce, relations with Russia, and other relevant matters. Additionally, there is a moratorium on underground testing of nuclear weapons. The moratorium on underground testing of nuclear weapons by the United States will continue through fiscal year 2003. Before conducting such a test, the President must notify Congress with details including the test date, certification of national security necessity, and expected international reactions. Additionally, the Secretary of Energy must report on test readiness by March 1, 2003. The Secretary of Energy must report to Congress on options for reducing the time needed to conduct an underground nuclear weapon test. This includes findings from a 2002 study, feasibility of reducing time to less than 24-36 months, technical challenges, and costs from 2003 to 2012."
