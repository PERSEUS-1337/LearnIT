This program aims to discourage children from making dangerous journeys to join relatives in the United States by offering them the opportunity to be considered for refugee status at home. Refugee processing involves the U.S. government processing prospective refugees from their countries of origin for admission to the United States. Refugees are defined as foreign nationals who have experienced persecution based on various factors. They can legally live and work in the U.S. and may apply for lawful permanent resident status after one year. Typically, refugees are referred to the U.S. program by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The U.S. program for refugee processing involves defining refugees as individuals unable or unwilling to return to their country due to persecution. The process includes referral by the UNHCR and potential admission to the United States. The U.S. refugee admissions process involves defining refugees as individuals facing persecution based on various factors. The Department of State oversees overseas processing, utilizing Resettlement Support Centers for assistance. The U.S. refugee admissions process involves RSC staff conducting pre-screening interviews and preparing cases for submission to USCIS for adjudication. USCIS officers in the Refugee Corps determine refugee status based on well-founded fear of persecution on protected grounds. The United States has utilized in-country refugee processing on an individual basis to address specific refugee populations and situations. In 2002, the Department of State decided against establishing an in-country processing program for Haitians due to concerns about attracting ineligible applicants. This measure is considered extraordinary and involves considerations of foreign policy, diplomacy, and security. In annual presidential determinations on refugee admissions, certain groups at risk of persecution or torture may be considered for refugee admission to the United States within their countries of origin. Since the late 1980s, presidential determinations have specified eligible groups for in-country processing, including persons in Cuba, the (former) Soviet Union, and Vietnam. The in-country processing list has also included \"In exceptional circumstances, persons\" since the presidential determination for FY2005. In FY2014 and FY2015, in-country processing programs included designated groups like Jews, Evangelical Christians, and participants in religious activities in certain countries. This also applied to human rights activists, persecuted religious minorities, and former political prisoners in Cuba, as well as individuals employed by the U.S. government in Iraq. In FY2015, the Obama Administration established a new in-country processing program for minors in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras with a parent lawfully present in the United States. This program allows a parent to request a refugee resettlement interview for their unmarried child in these countries. In-country processing in Central American countries aims to reduce unlawful migration to the US by reuniting vulnerable children with parents residing in the US. The program's details and the number of minors eligible for refugee admission are unspecified. In-country processing is part of the US refugee admissions system's processing priorities, with Priority 2 focusing on groups of special humanitarian concern, defined by nationality, ethnicity, or other characteristics. In-country refugee processing programs are established for Priority 2 groups based on nationality, ethnicity, or other characteristics. The program for Iraqis associated with the United States originated from the 2008 Refugee Crisis in Iraq Act, allowing processing in Iraq or other countries for admission to the US as refugees. Congress also designated an in-country processing group for Jews or Evangelical individuals in certain former Soviet Union states or Estonia, Latvia, or Lithuania. The Lautenberg Amendment, enacted in 1989, established special rules for refugee determinations for certain Soviet nationals, Jews, Evangelical Christians, and participants in religious activities in Ukraine. In 2004, the Specter Amendment added Iranian nationals, specifically religious minorities, to the Lautenberg rules for refugee determinations. The Lautenberg Amendment, enacted in 1989, established special rules for refugee determinations for certain Soviet nationals, Jews, Evangelical Christians, and participants in religious activities in Ukraine. In 2004, the Specter Amendment added Iranian nationals, specifically religious minorities, to the Lautenberg rules for refugee determinations. These Iranian cases are processed in Austria and Turkey. Prospective refugees must establish a well-founded fear of persecution on protected grounds individually. The general adjudicatory standard applies to refugee cases processed inside or outside countries of origin, except for cases falling within a Lautenberg Amendment category. Applicants under the Lautenberg standard must establish membership in a protected category, assert a fear of persecution on protected grounds, and provide a credible basis for concern about the possibility of persecution. In-country refugee processing by the U.S. government is authorized under the INA for specific cases. The State Department considers factors like effectiveness and alternatives when implementing such programs. In-country processing programs are typically aimed at specific groups within a country and may require applicants to have a connection to the United States, such as a lawfully present parent. However, due to limitations and the existence of sufficient alternatives, out-of-country processing remains the norm."
