The \"REACH OUT Act of 2018\" authorizes grants to educate outlier opioid prescribers on best practices, non-opioid pain management, and reducing opioid prescriptions. Eligible entities can apply for grants through technical assistance. Each eligible entity must submit an application to the Secretary to receive a grant, contract, or cooperative agreement. The Secretary will prioritize establishing technical assistance resources in each State when awarding grants. Eligible entities are organizations with experience providing technical assistance to healthcare professionals on a State or regional basis. The term \"outlier prescriber of opioids\" refers to a prescriber identified by the Secretary of Health and Human Services based on provided prescriber information. The Social Security Act allows for monitoring prescribers who exceed opioid thresholds, with funding of $75 for implementation. Prescribers include licensed health care professionals like nurse practitioners and physician assistants. $75 million from the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund is allocated for implementing monitoring of prescribers who exceed opioid thresholds under the Social Security Act.
