    "content": "The \"Patent Term Restoration Act of 1997\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. This Act addresses patent terms. The \"Patent Term Restoration Act of 1997\" addresses patent terms by amending section 154 of title 35, United States Code to extend the patent term to either 17 years from the grant date or 20 years from the filing date in the United States, whichever is later. The \"Patent Term Restoration Act of 1997\" amends section 154 of title 35, United States Code to extend the patent term to the term provided in subsection (a). Section 534(b) of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act is amended by striking paragraph (3). SEC. 3. DEFINITION OF SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES TO PROTECT THE CONFIDENTIALITY STATUS OF APPLICATIONS. Section 122 of title 35, United States Code, is amended to allow the Commissioner to publish certain data from patent applications filed in foreign countries. This publication can only occur after the data has been made public in the foreign country. If an application filed after the enactment date meets specific criteria, the Commissioner will notify the applicant of the determination. If an applicant receives a determination notice, they can petition the Commissioner within 30 days to review the decision. The Commissioner will not publish the application until the review is completed. If no petition is submitted, the application may be published no earlier than 90 days after the notice. If a continuing application is filed more than 6 months after the initial filing, certain conditions apply. The Commissioner will notify the applicant after the initial filing of an application. The applicant can demonstrate the purpose of a continuing application was not to delay publication. If the demonstration is accepted, the application will not be published. If not, the application will be published. The Commissioner will ensure publications are handled accordingly. The Commissioner will ensure that publications do not lead to third-party oppositions that delay patent issuance."
