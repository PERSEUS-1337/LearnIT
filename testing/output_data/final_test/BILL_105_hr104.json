    "content": "The \"National Park Enhancement and Revitalization Act\" aims to address the funding challenges faced by the National Park Service for operations, maintenance, and rehabilitation. It recognizes that private ownership or use of National Park System lands could generate funds while preserving their values. The National Park Service Organic Act is amended to allow the Secretary of the Interior to dispose of lands within National Park System units preserving American history, with public input and equal value consideration for the disposal. The Secretary of the Interior can dispose of lands within National Park System units to protect aesthetic, cultural, or historic values, with terms to preserve public interest. Disposals over $150,000 must be reported, and efforts must be made to offer the original owners an opportunity to reacquire the land. The Secretary of the Interior may lease lands within National Park System units for private uses that align with the area's designated purposes. Acquiring parties must cover survey and appraisal costs, and disposals exceeding $150,000 require reporting to specific congressional committees. The Secretary of the Interior may lease lands within National Park System units for private uses that align with the area's designated purposes. The Secretary shall provide the original owner or heirs an opportunity to lease the land, with leases being noncompetitively negotiated if the owner or heirs are identified, and competitively offered if not. Leases must specify acceptable uses and terms, and revenues received by the United States must at least recover the costs of establishing and administering the lease. The Secretary of the Interior can lease lands in National Park System units for compatible private uses. Revenues from land sales or leases, minus costs, go into a special fund for unit operations. The Secretary can acquire easements or interests in lands for the National Park System if they provide public benefits exceeding costs. The Secretary of the Interior can acquire easements or interests in lands for the National Park System if the cost is less than a fee simple purchase of the land, including monitoring and enforcement costs. The Government Accounting Office (GAO) will conduct a study on easements and other land acquisitions for the National Park System to evaluate their effectiveness, costs, compliance, and public benefits."
