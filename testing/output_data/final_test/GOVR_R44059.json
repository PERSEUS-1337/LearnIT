    "content": "Most of the funding for HUD comes from annual appropriations, primarily for rental assistance programs like Public Housing and Section 8. Block grant programs like HOME and CDBG help finance housing and community development activities for low- and moderate-income families. HUD receives funding primarily through annual appropriations for rental assistance programs like Public Housing and Section 8. Block grant programs such as HOME and CDBG support housing and community development for low- and moderate-income families. Additionally, specialized grant programs assist homeless individuals, including those with HIV/AIDS. The Federal Housing Administration insures mortgages for home buyers with low down payments and developers of affordable rental buildings. Surplus FHA funds have been used to offset HUD's budget costs. Total net enacted appropriations for HUD over the past five years are detailed in Table 1. The FY2015 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act (P.L. 113-235) was signed by the President on December 16, 2014, providing $45.4 billion in gross discretionary appropriations for HUD programs. Prior to this, the government had been funded through three continuing resolutions (CRs) with the first CR (P.L. 113-164) providing funding from October 1, 2014, through December 11, 2014, at FY2014 levels. In FY2015, HUD received approximately $35.6 billion in net budget authority, which was higher than in FY2014. This increase was due to a decline in offsetting receipts from the FHA loan insurance program. The FY2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act provided $46.98 billion in gross appropriations for HUD programs. The FY2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act provided $46.98 billion in gross appropriations for HUD, including $38.3 billion in net budget authority. This reflects an increase over FY2015, but less than the President's request. $19.6 billion was allocated for tenant-based rental assistance, enough to fully fund all vouchers currently in use. The FY2016 Consolidated Appropriations Act allocated $950 million for the HOME program, an increase over FY2015 levels. The bill also included provisions for the Moving to Work Demonstration participants and had floor consideration in November 2015. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported its version of the FY2016 THUD appropriations bill, proposing $46.2 billion in gross appropriations for HUD, including a 93% cut in funding for HOME relative to FY2015. Additionally, it includes a $100 million decrease in CDBG funding compared to FY2015 but a $100 million increase over the President's requested funding level. The House approved a $100 million increase in funding for HUD, covering renewing subsidies in Section 8 accounts and project-based rental assistance. Funding was also proposed for new vouchers for homeless youth and veterans. Amendments were made to increase funding for HOPWA and Housing for the Elderly, while redirecting fair housing funding. The House Appropriations Committee proposed $46.4 billion in gross appropriations for HUD in the FY2016 THUD appropriations bill, which is $1 billion more than FY2015 but $3 billion less than requested by the President. There was a 15% cut in funding for HOME relative to FY2015, with a provision to supplement that amount by diverting any funding for the Housing Trust Fund to the HOME program. In the FY2016 budget proposal for HUD, there were funding cuts for Choice Neighborhoods and the Public Housing Capital Fund, while funding increases were allocated for Section 8 tenant-based and project-based rental assistance accounts. The budget also rejected new incremental vouchers requested by the President and legislative reforms, stating that authorizing committees should address such changes. President Obama's budget request included $49.3 billion in gross appropriations for HUD. In the FY2016 budget proposal for HUD, there were funding cuts for Choice Neighborhoods and the Public Housing Capital Fund, while funding increases were allocated for Section 8 tenant-based and project-based rental assistance accounts. The budget also rejected new incremental vouchers requested by the President and legislative reforms, stating that authorizing committees should address such changes. President Obama's budget request included $49.3 billion in gross appropriations for HUD, with $40.6 billion in net budget authority. Increases in funding for most HUD programs, including funding for 67,000 new incremental Section 8 Housing Choice vouchers, were proposed. A 7% funding cut for CDBG was also included, with a proposal to revisit the way funding is distributed to communities. Several legislative reform proposals affecting the rental assistance programs, including changes to the way that income is calculated and recertified, were outlined. More than three-quarters of appropriations for HUD supports three programs: Section 8 tenant-based rental assistance, Section 8 project-based rental assistance, and the Public Housing program. The tenant-based rental assistance (TBRA) account funds the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher program, the largest account in HUD's budget, serving over 2 million low-income households. It covers annual renewal of vouchers and administrative costs for Public Housing Authorities. Funding comes from current-year and advance appropriations. Arguably, the most contentious issue in the tenant-based rental assistance account is the cost of renewing existing vouchers. All 2 million vouchers currently in use require annual funding for families to continue receiving assistance. The President's budget request includes an estimate for renewing all vouchers, but actual costs depend on changes in the number of vouchers issued by Public Housing Authorities. The cost of renewing existing vouchers is influenced by factors such as changes in family incomes, rental markets, and PHA policies. The President's budget estimated renewal needs at $18.3 billion for FY2016, while the House bill proposed $18.15 billion. Congress and the President may have different estimates on funding needed for voucher renewals. The Senate committee bill proposed $17.98 billion for voucher renewals, reflecting reduced costs. The final FY2016 appropriations law provided $17.68 billion for renewals, less than requested. PHAs earn fees based on leased vouchers, with Congress not fully funding all fees earned. The appropriations provided by Congress have not fully funded all fees earned by Public Housing Authorities (PHAs), resulting in reduced fees. The proration level for FY2015 was 74%, while the President's budget for FY2016 requested over $2 billion for administrative fees, an increase of almost half a billion dollars. The requested level was not sufficient to fully fund PHAs' fee eligibility but would result in a higher proration level of 90%. The House bill proposed level funding for administrative fees, likely leading to a proration level equal to or less than FY2015. The Senate committee bill proposed $1.62 billion for administrative fees, $90 million above the FY2015 funding level but $400 million less than the requested level. The final FY2016 appropriations law provides $1.65 billion for new vouchers, including 67,000 incremental vouchers requested by the President to address funding cuts since FY2013. HUD proposed allocating 37,000 based on relative need and 30,000 for special populations. The President requested $178 million for new vouchers for families, veterans, and Native Americans experiencing homelessness, as well as victims of domestic violence. Additionally, $20 million was requested for families and youth in the child welfare system through the Family Unification Program (FUP). The House bill did not propose funding for new incremental vouchers, while the Senate committee bill proposed $20 million for new FUP vouchers and $75 million for new VASH vouchers. The final FY2016 law includes $60 million for VASH and no funding for FUP or other new incremental vouchers. The Section 8 project-based rental assistance (PBRA) account provides funding to administer and renew existing project-based Section 8 rental assistance contracts between HUD and private multifamily property owners. The Section 8 project-based rental assistance (PBRA) program has been active since the early 1980s, with contracts funded for 20- to 40-year periods. Once contracts expire, new annual appropriations are needed for renewal. The President's budget requested $10.5 billion for project-based contract renewals and $215 million for contract administrators. The total amount requested for the PBRA account was $10.76 billion, over $1 billion above the previous year's funding. The total amount requested for the PBRA account in FY2016 was $10.76 billion, over $1 billion higher than the previous year's funding level. This increase was partly due to estimated renewal cost increases and partly because FY2015 funding needs were lower than usual due to one-time savings from an accounting change. The President's budget stated that the requested amount would fully fund all contracts for a 12-month period. The House bill proposed $10.65 billion for the PBRA account, with $10.5 billion for renewals and $150 million for contract administrators. The Senate committee bill also addressed cost savings in contract administrator contracts. The Senate committee bill proposed $10.83 billion for the PBRA account, including $10.6 billion for renewal and amendment needs and $215 million for contract administrators. The final FY2016 appropriations law provides $10.4 billion for renewals and amendment needs as well as $215 million for contract administrators. The Public Housing program provides publicly owned and subsidized rental units for very low-income families, created in 1937, it is the federal government's oldest housing assistance program for poor families. Public Housing receives federal funding under two primary accounts, making it the third-highest funded program in HUD's budget. The operating fund helps fill the gap between tenants' rent and maintenance costs, while the capital fund supports capital projects and modernization. Choice Neighborhoods is an Obama Administration initiative to revitalize distressed public and assisted housing. Choice Neighborhoods is an initiative that provides competitive grants to revitalize distressed public and assisted housing properties and their surrounding communities. It expands eligibility beyond public housing to include other HUD-assisted properties. Operating fund dollars are allocated to PHAs based on a formula estimating maintenance costs. The House proposed $160 million less than the requested amount for the operating fund in FY2016. The FY2016 appropriations law adopts the Senate committee bill's proposed funding level of $4.5 billion for the Operating Fund, which is lower than the President's request but higher than the House bill. The President requested a $50 million increase for capital fund formula grants, representing 53% of the annual capital accrual needs in public housing. The House bill would have cut capital fund formula grants by $150 million compared to FY2015, $200 million less than the President's request. The final FY2016 appropriations law provides $1.9 billion for Choice Neighborhoods, an increase over FY2015. The President's budget requested $250 million, while the final amount allocated was $125 million. The Community Development Fund (CDF) supports various community development activities, including the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG). The Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program is a federal initiative that provides financial assistance for neighborhood revitalization, housing rehabilitation, and economic development activities in various communities. Grants are allocated to entitlement communities, states, and insular areas to address local housing and economic development needs as determined by officials. The Obama Administration's FY2016 budget proposed $2.880 billion for CDBG formula grants, including $2.800 billion for entitlement communities, states, and insular areas, and $80 million for competitive grants to Indian tribes and Alaskan Native villages. This proposal would have reduced funding by $200 million compared to FY2015. The CDBG formula components for FY2016 included $2.011 billion for 1,194 entitlement communities, $862 million for state-administered programs, and $7 million for insular areas. The Obama Administration's FY2016 budget proposed $2.880 billion for CDBG formula grants, including $2.800 billion for entitlement communities, states, and insular areas, and $80 million for competitive grants to Indian tribes and Alaskan Native villages. This was a reduction of $200 million compared to FY2015. The Administration planned to propose revisions and reforms to the program, focusing on grantee eligibility, program cycles, grantee accountability, and issues in the state CDBG program. No formal proposal was submitted during FY2016 appropriations consideration. The Administration's grant reforms for FY2016 appropriations aimed to reduce small grantees, streamline program cycles, target funding to areas of need, and increase CDBG funds for colonias near the Mexico border. The Administration proposed an Upward Mobility Initiative (UMI) to combine funding from four existing block grants for economically distressed areas near the Mexico border. The UMI aimed to support strategies for improving economic mobility, children's outcomes, and community opportunities. The Loan Guarantee program (Section 108) allows states and entitlement communities to borrow up to five times their annual CDBG allocation for economic development and housing projects. The FY2016 budget proposed a loan commitment ceiling of $300 million, $200 million less than FY2015. A fee of 2.42% of the loan principal was established in FY2015. The House bill recommended $3.060 billion in FY2016 for activities funded under the CDF account, including $3.0 billion for CDBG formula grants awarded to states, entitlement communities, and insular areas. This is the same amount appropriated in FY2015 for formula grants and $200 million (7%) more than requested by the Administration. The bill recommended an appropriation of $60 million for Indian tribes, which was $20 million less than requested by the Administration. The bill also proposed a provision that would prohibit HUD from using any funding provided to terminate the designation of a community as an entitlement community. The bill proposed changes in eligibility for CDBG entitlement communities to protect their status and recommended a fee-based structure for Section 108 loan guarantees with a ceiling of $300 million. The committee also suggested rescinding all. The Senate committee bill recommended $2.900 billion in FY2016 for activities funded under the CDF account, with the total amount appropriated exclusively for CDBG formula grants to entitlement communities, states, and insular areas. This was $100 million less than the amount appropriated in FY2015 for formula grants and $100 million (3.6%) more than requested by the Obama Administration. The bill also proposed transferring appropriations authority for CDBG funds awarded to Indian tribes from the CDF account to the Indian Housing Block Grant (IHBG) account, with $60 million appropriated for ICDBG funded activities. The Senate bill proposed restrictions on transferring CDBG funds, awarding funds to for-profit entities, and terminating entitlement community designations. It also supported converting Section 108 loan guarantees to a fee-based structure with a $300 million ceiling. The final FY2016 appropriations law allocated $3.060 billion for CDBG activities, with $60 million for ICDBG activities and $3 billion for CDBG formula allocations. The law prohibits transferring CDBG funds between communities and limits planning and administrative expenses to 20% of the grantee's allocation. The FY2016 appropriations law allocated $3.060 billion for CDBG activities, with provisions for loan guarantees and disaster relief funding. The act also includes measures for economic development projects, compliance for low and moderate-income families, and funding for distressed areas affected by disasters in 2015. The HOME Investment Partnerships Program is a block grant providing formula funding for affordable housing activities benefiting low-income households. States and local jurisdictions must submit a disaster recovery plan for HUD approval before using funds. The President's budget requested $1.06 billion for HOME in FY2016, an increase from the previous year's $900 million. The House bill proposed $767 million for the HOME program, with $10 million allocated for the Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program. The Senate committee bill proposed a significant decrease to $66 million for the HOME program, with no provisions for the Housing Trust Fund. The Senate committee bill did not include provisions for the Housing Trust Fund but continued to fund SHOP. The final FY2016 appropriations law provided $950 million for HOME, $50 million more than the previous year. The Federal Housing Administration insures private mortgage lenders against losses on certain mortgages, making mortgage credit more widely available. FHA insurance programs are administered through two program accounts in the HUD budget. The HUD budget includes two program accounts: the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMI Fund) for single-family home loans and FHA-insured reverse mortgages, and the General Insurance/Special Risk Insurance Fund (GI/SRI Fund) for mortgages on multifamily buildings and healthcare facilities. FHA insurance programs aim to make mortgage credit more widely available. The costs of federal loan guarantees are reflected in the budget as the net present value of expected future cash flows. If estimated cash inflows exceed outflows, the program has a negative credit subsidy, resulting in offsetting receipts that can offset other costs in the HUD budget. The MMI Fund historically has a negative credit subsidy, with offsetting receipts being a significant source of offsets in the budget. For FY2016, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that FHA-insured loans will generate $7.8 billion in offsetting receipts, a $1 billion decrease from FY2015. This reduction in receipts means less funding is available to offset HUD budget costs, requiring a corresponding decrease in gross appropriations to maintain net budget authority levels. The MMI Fund's historically negative credit subsidy has never required an appropriation. The MMI Fund has never required an appropriation due to its negative credit subsidy. FHA receives annual appropriations for salaries and administrative expenses. The final FY2016 appropriations law provided $130 million for administrative contract expenses. Annual appropriations acts authorize FHA to insure a certain dollar volume of loans, with the House and Senate proposing to authorize up to $400 billion in loans under the MMI Fund. In FY2016, up to $400 billion in loans were authorized under the MMI Fund, and up to $30 billion under the GI/SRI Fund, matching the President's budget request and FY2015 levels. The final appropriations law provided this commitment authority. The President's budget and congressional appropriations bills include provisions that impact HUD programs, with new initiatives proposed in the General Provisions sections. The President's FY2016 budget request included new legislative proposals in the General Provisions. The General Provisions in the Congressional Budget Justifications included proposals for various changes in housing programs, such as allowing PHAs to transfer funds between accounts and extending fund availability. Other changes included administrative adjustments to the SHOP program, revisions to the HOME program, modifications to housing counseling grants, and updates to the health and medical expense deduction for adjusted gross income calculations. Additionally, new energy and water conservation demonstrations were authorized for certain multifamily properties and public housing. The curr_chunk discusses various proposals related to public housing, including creating a new authority for updating use agreements, allowing private nonprofit organizations to administer rental assistance, charging lenders an administrative support fee, expanding the Moving to Work demonstration, authorizing triennial income recertification, and allowing transfer of Section 811 Housing for Persons with Disabilities assistance. The curr_chunk discusses proposals for FHA reforms, including exemptions for certain loans, inclusion in Ginnie Mae securities, and new authority for HUD. The House bill rejected the President's new legislative proposals and included a provision to prohibit HUD from requiring funding recipients to meet energy efficiency standards beyond state and local codes. The Senate committee bill proposed various new legislative proposals, including an expansion of the MTW program, lease termination provisions in the HOME program, increased fungibility between capital and operating funds in public housing, triennial income recertification, an expansion of the RAD demonstration, and an extension of time limits on vouchers for youth aging out of foster care. The final FY2016 appropriations law includes an MTW expansion of 100 agencies, changes to HOME lease termination provisions, and new provisions such as modifications to FHA standards and matching requirements for homeless assistance grantees. Additionally, the FAST Act included provisions for triennial income recertification as requested in the President's budget. The President's requested provisions include triennial income recertification for fixed-income families, a multifamily energy conservation pilot program, and allowing nonprofits to administer certain homeless assistance funding. HUD appropriations are part of the Transportation, HUD, and Related Agencies appropriations bill each year, which complies with limits set by the annual budget resolution influenced by the Budget Control Act. Understanding these policies and procedures is important when considering HUD appropriations levels. The annual budget resolution provides a framework for Congress to consider legislation affecting spending and revenue. The budget resolution sets spending and revenue levels, including allocations to House and Senate committees. These allocations are enforceable by a point of order. Subcommittee allocations are divided among 12 subcommittees responsible for appropriations bills. While they do not determine specific funding amounts, they establish parameters for funding decisions. The FY2016 budget resolution was approved by the House and Senate in April and May 2015. The FY2016 budget resolution, approved in May 2015, set a base discretionary spending limit of $1.017 trillion, an increase from FY2015. The current Section 302(b) allocation for THUD is $55.269 billion in the House and $55.646 billion in the Senate, both higher than FY2015. However, actual increases are smaller due to declines in offsets from FHA and rescissions of contract authority from the Department of Transportation. The Budget Control Act of 2011 aimed to reduce the debt limit. The Budget Control Act of 2011 aimed to reduce the budget deficit through spending limits and reductions. It imposed statutory limits on discretionary spending from FY2012 to FY2021, with separate limits for defense and nondefense spending. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction was tasked to develop a deficit reduction plan by January 15, 2012, leading to sequestration of nonexempt discretionary spending in FY2013. The Budget Control Act of 2011 set limits on discretionary spending from FY2012 to FY2021, with separate limits for defense and nondefense. Amendments have altered the reductions scheduled under the BCA, with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 lessening reductions for FY2016 and FY2017. Sequestration will occur if discretionary funding exceeds the limits. Mandatory funding reductions through sequestration were initially set through FY2021 but have been extended to FY2024."
