    "content": "In the early 20th century, John Moody introduced selling rating manuals to bond investors, known as \"subscriber-pays.\" By the 1970s, credit rating agencies shifted to an \"issuer-pays\" model, where bond issuers pay for ratings. Reasons for this change include concerns about copying, issuer demand for ratings, and market upheaval after the Penn-Central Railroad bankruptcy. The rise of asset-backed securitization in the 1970s led to a shift in credit rating agencies' payment models. While some small CRAs still use the subscriber-pays model, larger agencies now rely on issuer payments for ratings. This change was influenced by concerns about data integrity, issuer demand for ratings, and market instability following the Penn-Central Railroad bankruptcy. The SEC designated NRSROs in 1975 to determine capital charges on debt securities under the net capital rule. Broker-dealers deduct percentages of market value (haircuts) based on the securities' ratings. Higher-rated securities receive reduced haircuts due to their presumed liquidity and price stability. The SEC designated NRSROs in 1975 to determine capital charges on debt securities under the net capital rule. Initially, S&P, Moody's, and Fitch were recognized as NRSROs, with four more added by 2000. NRSRO-reviewed credit ratings became crucial in global and national regulations, including Rule 2a-7 and FIRREA, which restricted savings and loans from buying bonds with below investment grade ratings. Loans could no longer purchase bonds with NRSRO-issued below investment grade ratings. Over 100 state level statutes reference credit ratings from NRSROs. Basel II allows banks to use ratings from approved CRAs like Moody's, S&P, and Fitch. The SEC never defined NRSROs, leading to limited growth in the pool of agencies. This helped entrench the dominance of the three major CRAs. The collapse of Enron and WorldCom, despite having their ratings reconfirmed by major CRAs, led to regulatory changes. Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in 2002, requiring the SEC to issue a report on the NRSRO determination process. In 2003, the SEC released a report and concept release for CRA reform, including the possibility of abandoning ratings for regulatory purposes. In 2005, H.R. 2990, the Credit Rating Agency Duopoly, was introduced. The Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of 2006 (P.L. 109-291) was passed to regulate CRAs, citing their national importance and the need for legislation. It was signed into law on September 29, 2006, after being passed by the Senate and House. The Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of 2006 was passed to regulate CRAs, citing the need for legislation due to the dominance of Moody's and Standard & Poor's in the market. The SEC requires statutory authority to oversee the credit rating industry. The act adds new definitions to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including \"nationally recognized statistical rating organization.\" To be recognized as a nationally recognized statistical rating organization by the SEC, a credit rating agency must have been in business for at least three consecutive years prior to applying. The agency must issue credit ratings certified by qualified institutional buyers for various types of entities. Detailed information, such as credit rating performance statistics and rating methodologies, must be submitted to the SEC as part of the application process. The SEC requires detailed information from credit rating agencies applying for recognition, including their rating methodologies, policies to prevent misuse of information, organizational structure, code of ethics, conflicts of interest, and a list of top clients. The SEC follows a specific procedure to determine recognition as a nationally recognized statistical rating organization. The Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of 2006 prohibits misrepresentation of designation by the United States. It mandates policies to manage conflicts of interest for recognized statistical rating organizations. This legislation aligns with federal securities laws' emphasis on full disclosure for informed investment decisions. The Agency Reform Act of 2006 requires credit agencies seeking NRSRO status to disclose significant information to the SEC. Moody's, S&P, and Fitch were registered as NRSROs in 2007. Currently, there are 10 NRSROs, including two in Japan, one in Canada, and A.M. Best specializing in insurance. The SEC did not grant any new NRSRO designations in 2009. The SEC's Annual Report on Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations for the year ended June 25, 2009, revealed that there are still only 10 agencies registered as NRSROs. Seven operate under the issuer-pays model, while three operate under the subscriber-pays model. S&P, Moody's, and Fitch issue the majority of credit ratings, with S&P, Moody's, and Fitch responsible for the majority of ratings for asset-backed securities. The SEC's report on NRSROs revealed that only 10 agencies are registered, with S&P, Moody's, and Fitch dominating credit ratings for asset-backed securities. The impact of NRSRO registration on credit rating demand is unclear due to the program's newness and reduced debt issuance post-credit crisis. CRAs played a crucial role in structuring RMBS and CDOs by evaluating default probabilities and loan correlations. Moody's structured-finance unit dominated the rating of structured securities backed by mortgages, accounting for a significant portion of the firm's revenues. By 2007, the company was rating about 94% of mortgage-related and other structured-finance CDOs issued that year. Many believe that the three dominant CRAs failed in their rating processes regarding the likelihood of a decline in housing prices. In 2006, the subprime mortgage sector collapsed, contributing to the financial crisis. Credit rating agencies often gave top ratings to structured securities during the housing boom, only to downgrade them later. The SEC noted in June 2008 that these downgrades eroded investor confidence in RMBS and CDO credit ratings, leading to a broader credit market dislocation. The complexity of assessing risk in structured finance products and the lack of commonly accepted methods for measuring risk have caused investors to leave the market, impacting the liquidity of AAA instruments. NRSROs that rated subprime RMBS and CDOs have faced criticism for potential bias in their issuer-pays business model, leading to \"ratings shopping\" and a competitive race to the bottom among agencies. The existence of statutes and regulations requiring specific NRSRO ratings is said to reinforce an industry oligopoly with little competition. Flawed models were used for rating structured finance products, lacking reliability in turbulent economic scenarios. The three CRAs may have failed to correctly calculate house loan defaults due to wrong weights on falling house prices. They struggled to handle the high volume of structured finance business and faced challenges from fraud and lax mortgage underwriting. Insufficient regulation also contributed to the integrity issues in the rating process for securities. The financial and credit crisis led to new rating agency regulations due to inadequate previous regulations. Concerns arise from conflicts of interest in CRAs providing advice on structuring securities they rate, as well as charging issuers for pre-rating assessments and risk-management consulting. Credit rating agencies (CRAs) face concerns about conflicts of interest in their commercial relationships with issuers, potentially compromising their ability to provide unbiased ratings. The limited liability protection under the First Amendment for CRAs publishing creditworthiness ratings is also questioned. The case Lowe v. Securities and Exchange Commission discussed the First Amendment protections for publications containing factual information about financial transactions and market trends. It highlighted that personalized communications pose risks of fraud, deception, or overreaching, but publications sold in an open market are not subject to the same concerns. The content of the publications and their audience determine their protected status under the exclusion drafted by Congress. The publications' content and audience determine their protected status under the exclusion, as long as they remain impersonal and do not develop fiduciary relationships. Recent cases suggest that there may be First Amendment protection for negligence in credit rating reports. The courts have generally shielded credit rating agencies from liability for negligent ratings, citing First Amendment protection. While not automatically protected, some courts have granted special protections to rating agencies as publishers or journalists. The Supreme Court has ruled that publishers are not automatically protected for general law violations, but in this case, the court found First Amendment protection for the credit rating agency's report. The court found that credit rating reports on Enron were protected by the First Amendment, as they were related to the creditworthiness of a public corporation. The Supreme Court noted in dicta that expression of opinion about marketable securities should also be protected under the First Amendment. Credit rating agencies provide essential services for the capital markets, but they may be held liable for issuing opinions with actual malice. Responses to their perceived failings regarding mortgage-backed securities have included a study by the SEC in July 2008, which examined S&P, Moody's, and Fitch. The SEC's 10-month examination of S&P, Moody's, and Fitch found that the credit rating agencies became overwhelmed by the increase in volume and sophistication of structured securities, leading to shortcuts in due diligence. Instances were found where analysts were exposed to CRAs' business interests with issuers, and adjustments to ratings criteria were considered to be more competitive. The CRAs also failed to adequately disclose modifications to their ratings criteria. The largest CRAs have acknowledged shortcomings in rating structured securities, with S&P being cited as an example. The top credit rating agencies (CRAs) have admitted to failures in rating structured securities, particularly in subprime mortgage-backed securities between 2005 and 2007. S&P, Moody's, and Fitch have acknowledged shortcomings in their analytics and models, leading to volatile and inaccurate ratings. In response, the CRAs have implemented internal reforms to address these issues. The top credit rating agencies have implemented internal reforms in response to failures in rating structured securities, including improving due diligence processes, analytical methodologies, and transparency in credit ratings. Additionally, they have established measures to enhance investors' understanding of credit ratings and manage conflicts of interest. In 2008, a settlement was reached with S&P, Moody's, and Fitch by New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, with provisions for a fee-for-service structure. The credit rating agencies will establish a fee-for-service structure to be compensated regardless of being selected to rate an RMBS. This change aims to prevent investment banks from receiving free previews of assessments and enable investors to determine the best rating agency. Each agency will set criteria for reviewing mortgage lenders and disclose information on securitizations for initial review. The Attorney General has mandated credit rating agencies to develop criteria for due diligence information on residential mortgage-backed securities. They will conduct annual reviews to ensure independence and require representations from investment banks on underlying loans. The New York Attorney General mandated reforms for credit rating agencies to increase independence and transparency in rating residential mortgage-backed securities. However, economist Lawrence White criticized the reforms as cosmetic, stating that investors are still compelled to follow the agencies' ratings. The SEC began adopting NRSRO reforms in December 2008. In 2008, the SEC started adopting NRSRO reforms to address concerns about the integrity of rating structured finance products, especially mortgage-related securities. The reforms aim to increase transparency in rating methodologies, strengthen disclosure of ratings performance, prohibit conflicts of interest practices, and enhance recordkeeping and reporting requirements for NRSROs. These reforms subject NRSROs to additional disclosure obligations. The SEC adopted reforms in 2008 to address concerns about the integrity of rating structured finance products. The key reforms prohibit NRSROs from issuing or maintaining credit ratings if there are conflicts of interest, such as making recommendations to the entity being rated or negotiating fees for the rating. The SEC adopted reforms in 2008 to address conflicts of interest in rating structured finance products. The \"no-advice rule\" prohibits NRSROs from making structural recommendations to securities arrangers and then rating the resulting securities. The SEC requires NRSROs to provide rating change statistics for each asset class of credit ratings, disclose default statistics, and enhance disclosure in three areas. The SEC requires NRSROs to provide enhanced disclosure in three areas: verification of assets, assessments of originators, and surveillance processes. Restrictions are placed on individuals involved in determining credit ratings, fee discussions, and gift acceptance. The SEC requires NRSROs to disclose information on credit ratings, including restrictions on gifts and entertainment from obligors or issuers. NRSROs must publicly share a sample of issuer-paid credit ratings, keep records of rating actions, and explain any discrepancies between quantitative models and final ratings for structured finance products. The SEC requires NRSROs to disclose credit rating information, including complaints about credit analyst performance and ratings history. SEC rules adopted most 2008 reform proposals but not those distinguishing ratings for structured finance products or reducing reliance on NRSRO ratings. In February 2009, SEC Commissioner Kathleen Casey urged the removal of regulatory reliance on NRSRO ratings due to unintended consequences and the need for investors to conduct adequate due diligence. The SEC's reforms do not address the issuer-pays business model, which many believe is a fundamental factor behind the failings of credit rating agencies. On September 17, 2009, the SEC adopted rules to enhance transparency and competition in the industry, including providing more information on ratings histories and allowing competing agencies to offer unsolicited ratings for structured finance products. Public comment was reopened to consider proposals to eliminate references to NRSRO credit ratings from certain regulations. The SEC proposed amendments to strengthen NRSRO compliance by requiring annual reports and disclosing revenue-related conflicts. European banks faced financial losses during the global housing boom due to high ratings from CRAs. EU officials criticized rating agencies for underestimating risks and failing to lower ratings in worsening market conditions. In response, the EU parliament adopted CRA reforms in April 2009. The EU parliament adopted CRA reforms in April 2009 to address concerns about rating agencies. The reforms included placing the Committee of European Securities Regulators (CESR) in charge of registering CRAs, creating a database of historical performance information, and holding CRAs liable for their rating opinions. Starting in 2010, a new pan-European authority will take over these responsibilities. CRAs could face EU sanctions for professional misconduct, potentially losing their licenses to rate debt in EU nations. The EU parliament adopted reforms in April 2009 to address concerns about rating agencies. The reforms require CRAs to have independent directors on their boards, issue annual transparency reports, disclose models and methodologies, and avoid conflicts of interest. CRAs must also rotate analysts and distinguish ratings of complex securities. Credit rating agencies (CRAs) in the EU will need to use distinctive symbols to differentiate ratings of complex securities. Non-EU CRAs like S&P and Moody's must comply with new rules within two years, including demonstrating quality information for rating debt and revealing rating models and assumptions. They will also need EU branches to endorse ratings from their parent firms. European Commission President Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso praised the reforms for providing investors with necessary information and impartiality for prudent investment decisions. S&P's president also supported the oversight, predicting it would work alongside market scrutiny to enhance credit rating integrity. The EU's new oversight of credit rating agencies, along with ongoing market scrutiny, aims to increase transparency and accountability in ratings. However, concerns remain about the issuer-pays structure. Existing CRAs must comply with EU regulations by September 7, 2010. The SEC also addressed public policy concerns regarding CRAs, with Chairman Mary Schapiro noting the need for improved performance, especially in mortgage-backed securities. The mortgage-backed securities market, particularly those backed by subprime loans, has caused a crisis in investor confidence. The focus is on aligning rating agencies' interests with investors and improving transparency to restore trust. The question is whether different business models for rating agencies can better manage conflicts of interest and prioritize investors as the ultimate customer. The goal is to provide users with all necessary information to make informed decisions and rebuild investor confidence. The panelists discussed potential regulatory improvements for rating agencies, including the issuance of multiple ratings for securities and increasing competition in the rating agency space. They emphasized the need for more accountability, transparency, and a stronger investor voice to enhance the reliability of ratings. Former SEC commissioner Joseph Grundfest highlighted the importance of these changes. Former SEC commissioner Joseph Grundfest and Richard Baker, former chairman of the House Financial Services Capital Markets Subcommittee, highlighted the systemic risk posed by credit rating agencies due to their concentration of information. All rating agencies agreed that certain complex products, like collateralized debt obligations, should not have been rated. CEO of Realpoint LLC, Robert Dobilas, suggested that issuers should provide information to all rating agencies to prevent \"ratings shopping.\" Moody's Chairman Raymond McDaniel emphasized the need for structured securities information to be provided to institutional investors to reduce reliance on ratings. Frank Partnoy and Lawrence White proposed independent oversight to decrease investor dependence on credit ratings and eliminate regulatory references to ratings and NRSROs. The SEC was advised to eliminate references to credit ratings and NRSROs, shifting the burden to issuers to validate financial product safety. Suggestions were made to abolish the NRSRO designation to promote rating agency competition, with differing views on the matter. The SEC was advised to consider easing the process for CRAs to obtain the NRSRO designation to promote rating agency competition. Panelists had differing views on removing NRSRO references, with concerns raised about potential market uncertainty and the impact on companies and customers. Egan-Jones Ratings' president argued that increased competition among CRAs was not the solution, advocating instead for the removal of the investor-paid model's conflict of interest. In contrast, representatives from S&P, Moody's, and Fitch highlighted the differing objectives of issuers and investors in the rating process. The Obama Administration issued draft legislation in 2009 to increase transparency and oversight of credit rating agencies. Smaller subscriber-pays CRAs warned that making ratings public could conflict with their business model and increase legal liability. The legislation would prohibit rating agencies from providing consulting services to companies they rate and require disclosure of conflicts of interest. The draft legislation proposed by the Obama Administration in 2009 aims to enhance transparency and oversight of credit rating agencies. It includes requirements for rating agencies to disclose fees paid by issuers, review ratings for conflicts of interest, designate a compliance officer, and mandate issuers to disclose all preliminary ratings received from different agencies. The draft legislation proposed in 2009 aims to enhance transparency and oversight of credit rating agencies by requiring different symbols for structured products, clear reports for each rating, a dedicated SEC office for supervision, mandatory NRSRO registration, and collaboration with the SEC and President's Working Group on Financial Markets to remove references to ratings from regulations. Senator Christopher Dodd expressed concerns during a Senate hearing on rating agencies. Senator Christopher Dodd expressed disappointment that the Obama Administration's draft legislation did not require rating agencies to perform due diligence. Michael Barr from the Treasury Department argued against government involvement in dictating rating agencies' methodologies. Congress has raised concerns about the failures of credit rating agencies in structured finance, with legislative efforts such as H.R. 4173 being passed in the House. H.R. 4173, passed in the House on December 11, 2009, and revised in the Senate as the Restoring American Financial Stability Act of 2010. The bill includes provisions for rating agency reform, replacing the term ''nationally recognized statistical rating'' with ''nationally registered statistical.'' The Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 were revised to replace the term ''nationally recognized statistical rating'' with ''nationally registered statistical rating.'' This change aimed to clarify that NRSRO status does not imply government approval. Chairman Paul Kanjorski expressed concerns about potential contract defaults and conflicts with laws and regulations. Chairman Frank is looking to address the use of \"nationally recognized\" language in statutes and regulations, aiming to remove references to \"not investment grade\" or ratings in federal statutes such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, Investment Company Act of 1940, and National Bank Act. The proposed changes aim to remove specific references to credit ratings in federal statutes and regulations, replacing them with standards of creditworthiness determined by the regulatory agencies. This is in line with arguments that reliance on ratings from dominant agencies has led to overreliance. Critics suggest the provisions may be far-reaching, but have not generated much discussion. Advocates believe there are alternative market-based substitutes to credit ratings. The statutory references suggest viable market-based substitutes to CRA ratings, such as credit spreads and credit default swaps. Concerns include short-term volatility, susceptibility to rumors, and limited availability for illiquid securities. Proposed changes would allow individuals to sue rating agencies more easily for securities law violations. All CRAs would need to register as NRSROs with the SEC, with exemptions available for non-issuer pays agencies. The SEC would be authorized to provide exemptions and issue rules prohibiting conflicts of interest related to NRSROs' credit ratings. This includes compensation, board composition, and disclosure requirements for third-party due diligence. Each NRSRO must maintain a publicly accessible record of default history on their website. The SEC would require NRSROs to disclose their credit rating procedures, establish internal controls, disclose potential shortcomings of ratings, and work towards removing references to credit ratings in federal statutes. The House Financial Services Committee is proposing new regulations for NRSROs, including the development of a creditworthiness standard, disclosure of rating assumptions, use of distinct symbols for different products, supervision of employees, and designation of a compliance officer to manage conflicts of interest. The proposed regulations for NRSROs include the requirement for a compliance officer to manage conflicts of interest, conducting a one-year look-back on ratings involving employees who go to work for issuers, reporting former employees to the SEC, structuring payments for accurate surveillance of ratings, and disclosing credit rating details. The Senate Banking Committee marked up bill, RAFSA, includes provisions such as establishing an SEC office for NRSRO oversight, requiring internal controls for credit rating processes, clarifying the ability to sue rating agencies, and defining symbols used by NRSROs. The RAFSA bill includes provisions for NRSROs to define credit rating symbols, disclose assumptions and limits, reveal third-party due diligence, face SEC fines for lacking resources, and separate ratings from sales activities. The proposed regulations for NRSROs include rules for employee qualifications, disclosure of rating performance, restrictions on compliance officers, and a study by the General Accountability Office on laws related to NRSRO ratings. The curr_chunk discusses the limitations of H.R. 4173 and RAFSA in addressing conflicts of interest in the issuer-pays business model of rating agencies. Joseph A. Grundfest criticizes the reforms as superficial, likening them to temporary fixes that will not bring lasting benefits. The curr_chunk highlights concerns about conflicts of interest in the issuer-pays model of rating agencies, with Congressman Paul E. Kanjorski aiming to remove this conflict. Senator Jack Reed emphasizes the need to prevent future issues rather than focusing on punishment for past actions. The curr_chunk discusses proposed legislation aimed at reforming credit rating agencies, including directing the SEC to audit NRSROs and review their rating procedures. Other bills seek to ensure NRSRO compliance with internal controls and governance procedures. The proposed legislation aims to reform credit rating agencies by requiring NRSROs to designate compliance officers, disclose information on ratings, explore alternative compensation methods, and implement a look-back provision to address conflicts of interest. H.R. 1181 (Ackerman) and H.R. 1445 (McHenry) propose reforms for credit rating agencies, including establishing processes for asset-backed instruments to be eligible for NRSRO ratings and requiring additional disclosures for structured securities ratings. Investors would be able to take legal action against rating firms for failing to review key information. H.R. 2253 (Delahunt) would establish a commission to investigate the role of NRSROs in the financial crisis, including data veracity and fraud detection capabilities."
