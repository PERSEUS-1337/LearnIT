These missiles are affordable and widely available, with a target detection range of about 6 miles and an engagement range of about 4 miles. They have been used in military conflicts and by terrorist organizations. Seventeen countries, including the United States, produce man-portable air defense systems. Shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles, also known as MANPADS, have a target detection range of about 6 miles and an engagement range of about 4 miles. Aircraft flying at 20,000 feet or higher are considered relatively safe from SAM engagement. Infrared shoulder-fired missiles home in on a heat source on an aircraft, typically the engine exhaust plume, using passive guidance to disable the aircraft. These missiles are difficult to detect by targeted aircraft employing countermeasure systems. Shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles, like the U.S. Redeye, Soviet SA-7, and Chinese HN-5, are known as \"tailchase weapons\" targeting high-performance aircraft after passing the firing position. First-generation IR missiles are unreliable due to interference from background sources like the sun. Second-generation IR missiles, such as the U.S. Stinger, Soviet SA-14, and Chinese FN-6, use improved coolants for better engagement and countermeasures against decoy flares. Third and fourth-generation shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles, like the French Mistral, Russian SA-18, and U.S. Stinger Block 2, incorporate advanced sensor systems for target recognition and engagement at greater ranges. These missiles can reject decoy flares and utilize focal plane array guidance systems. Command line-of-sight missiles do not target specific aspects of aircraft but rely on visual acquisition by the operator or gunner. Command line-of-sight (CLOS) missiles require operators to visually acquire targets using optical sights and radio controls to guide the missile. They are less affected by aircraft countermeasures but demand highly skilled operators. However, they are considered less suitable for terrorist use compared to infrared (IR) \"fire and forget\" missiles. CLOS missiles like the British Javelin and Starburst use advanced technology such as solid state television cameras and laser data links for guidance. Laser beam riding shoulder-fired SAMs, like Sweden's RBS-70 and Britain's Starstreak, are resistant to countermeasures and can engage aircraft from all angles with precise targeting. Future beam riding SAMs may only require the operator to designate the target once, making them resistant to jamming after launch. These missiles are considered menacing in the hands of terrorists due to their resistance to countermeasures. Approximately 20 countries have manufactured MANPADS, with over 1 million systems produced worldwide. Unclassified estimates on the global inventory of shoulder-fired SAMs vary widely. Estimates of shoulder-fired SAMs in terrorist hands vary widely, ranging from 5,000 to 150,000 of various missile types. Non-state actors obtain missiles through theft, black market, organized crime, arms dealers, and transfers from states. Verification of non-state actors possessing SAMs usually occurs after an attack when launcher or missile fragments are recovered. Tracking proliferation to non-state actors is challenging due to disparities in accountability, inventory control, and reporting procedures among nations. Most experts believe that the majority of shoulder-fired SAMs in terrorist hands are IR guided SA-7 derivatives, with examples like 5,592 captured in Afghanistan and 4,000 to 5,000 possibly in Iraq. These missiles are obtained through various means such as theft, black market, and transfers from states. Tracking their proliferation to non-state actors is challenging due to disparities in accountability and reporting procedures among nations. Insurgent forces in Africa possess a large quantity of shoulder-fired SAMs from Cold War sponsorships and civil wars. Between 25 and 30 non-state groups are estimated to have these missiles. Recent U.S. military encounters in Iraq and Afghanistan provide operational insights. In Iraq and Afghanistan, shoulder-fired SAMs have targeted U.S. military aircraft, despite having missile defenses. The attacks on a C-17 Globemaster III and a C-5 Galaxy in 2003 and 2004 respectively raised concerns about the effectiveness of the defensive systems. An Air Force official suggested that sensor placement, aircraft altitude, and maneuvering may have played a role in the system's failure. The official speculated that sensor placement, aircraft altitude, and maneuvering affected the systems' functionality. Nine military helicopters were shot down or crashed in Iraq from hostile ground fire, resulting in 39 service member deaths. RPGs and shoulder-fired SAMs were used in the attacks, with Iraqis studying helicopter flight patterns to engage effectively. U.S. military cargo aircraft in Afghanistan and Iraq face ground fire from shoulder-fired SAMs, anti-aircraft artillery, and small arms. The U.S. military faces daily attacks in Afghanistan and Iraq from shoulder-fired SAMs, anti-aircraft artillery, and small arms. Analysts believe that aircraft defenses have improved, resulting in fewer successful attacks. Over the past 26 years, 35 civilian aircraft have been attacked by shoulder-fired missiles, with 24 shot down and over 500 deaths. At least 35 civilian aircraft have been attacked by shoulder-fired missiles, resulting in 24 being shot down and over 500 deaths. However, a report suggests that only about a dozen civil-registered airplanes have been shot down, with some operating as military transports. The actual number of civilian encounters with shoulder-fired missiles may be underestimated due to various reasons such as attributing aircraft shootings to other causes or failed attempts going undetected or unreported. There is uncertainty surrounding incidents of civilian aircraft being attacked by shoulder-fired missiles, with discrepancies in reports about the weapons used and the purpose of the flights. This leads to challenges in determining which incidents should be included in the tally of such encounters. Based on available reports, an estimated 24 out of 36 civilian aircraft have been catastrophically lost to shoulder-fired missiles. These incidents, mostly in conflict zones, are not typically politically motivated. While historical examples do not shed light on current political motivations, they do show potential outcomes of such attacks. The odds of surviving such an attack are low based on past statistics. Based on reports, 24 out of 36 civilian aircraft were destroyed by shoulder-fired missiles in the past 26 years, with a survival rate estimated at 33%. Incidents involved various aircraft types, including small planes and large jet airliners. Only six incidents of large turbojet airliners being attacked by shoulder-fired missiles were found in research. In the past 26 years, 24 civilian aircraft were destroyed by shoulder-fired missiles, with a survival rate of 33%. Only six incidents of large turbojet airliners being attacked by shoulder-fired missiles were found, with varying outcomes. The crash of a TAAG Angolan Airlines Boeing 737 in 1983 was initially attributed to a technical problem, but rebels claimed to have shot it down with a missile. Another attack on a Boeing 737 in 1984 resulted in a total loss of the aircraft during an emergency landing, but no fatalities occurred. Investigation failed to find conclusive evidence of missile or gunfire damage in both incidents. In 1984, an Ariana Afghan Airlines DC-10 was damaged by a suspected bomb detonation or shoulder-fired missile attack. Another incident in 1998 involved a Congo Airlines Boeing 727 being shot down by a missile. In Kindu, Democratic Republic of Congo, an aircraft was shot down by a missile, killing all 41 persons on board. Tutsi rebels admitted to the shooting, mistaking the airplane for carrying military supplies. This incident highlighted the threat of shoulder-fired missiles in aviation security. The Mombasa attack was a politically motivated terrorist act believed to be linked to Al Qaeda, raising concerns over aviation security post-9/11. A DHL cargo plane was hit by a missile in Baghdad, damaging the left wing and hydraulic lines, but the crew managed to safely return to the airport. The Airbus A300-B4 aircraft experienced extensive engine damage from ingesting sand and debris after departing the runway on landing. While no casualties occurred, the plane was deemed a total loss. Various options, including aircraft modifications and pilot training enhancements, are being considered to address the threat of surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) to airliners. Military aircraft have countermeasures against SAMs, but commercial airlines generally do not due to cost and complexity concerns. The cost and challenges of integrating countermeasures on airliners are a concern, including acquisition costs, life cycle costs, and environmental constraints. Estimates for installing IR countermeasures on commercial aircraft range from $1 million to $3 million per aircraft. The number of passenger jet aircraft in service in 2006 is projected to be 6,839, with varying estimates for equipping them with IR countermeasures. Installing IR countermeasures on passenger jets can increase operating costs due to added weight and drag, impacting fuel consumption. The logistics of equipping the fleet and potential indirect costs are also challenges. A study by the RAND Corporation estimated an $11 billion initial cost with $2.1 billion annually to maintain IR countermeasures on a fleet of 6,800 passenger jets. Military aircraft have used flares to confuse IR-guided SAMs effectively. The military uses flares and IR countermeasures to confuse IR-guided missiles. Flares can be ineffective against newer models, while IRCMs are only effective against older missiles. New directed IRCMs focus IR energy directly on incoming missiles. Directed Infrared Countermeasure Systems (DIRCMs) are more effective than IRCMs in defending against modern shoulder-fired SAMs by focusing IR energy directly on the incoming missile. However, DIRCMs are not yet practical for commercial airlines due to factors like weight, size, cost, and reliability. Military aircraft use flares and IRCMs preemptively, but environmental concerns make flares difficult for commercial airlines. DIRCMs cannot be used preemptively and rely on missile approach and warning systems (MAWS) to detect launched missiles. MAWS performance is crucial for protecting aircraft against IR-guided SAMs, and DIRCM reliability is a key factor in determining cost. Maintaining the cost effectiveness of Directed Infrared Countermeasure Systems (DIRCMs) for commercial use is crucial, with the need for a significant improvement in system reliability. \"Camouflaging\" commercial aircraft by reducing their optical and IR reflectivity can deter terrorists from using shoulder-fired missiles. Shielding or ducting the engine exhaust can reduce the IR signature of large aircraft engines by up to 80%, but may impact engine performance and aerodynamic drag. Integrating these measures into existing aircraft may also pose challenges with aircraft weight. DOD has conducted studies on IR-signature reduction and is developing IR camouflage paint for aircraft. The Navy is studying IR paint on the V-22 Osprey. IR paint may be lighter than conventional paint and offers few complications for airline application. Infrared signature reduction techniques are worth examining for commercial use. IR signature reduction techniques are being considered to reduce an aircraft's vulnerability to IR-guided weapons and mitigate the IR missile threat. Congress added $1.3 million for electronic warfare development to pursue infrared signature reduction for terrorist missile threats. This funding aims to help equip airliners with missile countermeasures and strengthen defense capabilities. The FAA's Commercial Aircraft Hardening Program focuses on studying how hardened aircraft can withstand internal bomb blasts. The survivability of passenger jets following missile strikes is largely unknown, but efforts are being made to test the vulnerability of large turbofan engines to shoulder-fired missiles. Developing hardened aircraft structures may be challenging due to IR guidance systems targeting hot engine exhaust. Some experts believe isolating critical systems and improving fire suppression could prevent catastrophic failures from missile strikes on aircraft. Retrofitting existing jets with damage-tolerant structures is likely infeasible and costly, requiring extensive research and testing. Retrofitting jets with damage-tolerant structures after a missile strike may be costly and time-consuming. Pilot simulator training for engine failures could also prepare them for handling missile attacks. Evasive maneuvers training could be beneficial in such scenarios. Evasive maneuvers training for flight crews to evade shoulder-fired SAM attacks is not effective due to lack of missile detection and warning systems, limited maneuverability of large transport airplanes, and risks of loss of control or structural failure. Other special procedures to reduce heat signature and vulnerability to missile strikes may be considered. Mitigation techniques to reduce vulnerability to missile strikes include minimizing heat sources, engine power settings, and altering air traffic procedures to make flight patterns less predictable. The effectiveness and safety risks of these techniques need careful assessment before implementation. Military aircraft with high engine power are vulnerable to terrorist attacks up to 30 miles from the airport. Spiral descents can help mitigate the threat of SAM attacks on airliners approaching domestic airports, but widespread use would require airspace restructuring and pose safety concerns. Spiral descents can reduce the risk of missile attacks on approaching airliners, but may pose safety concerns and discomfort for passengers. Military aircraft use steep climb outs to minimize vulnerability on departure, but this technique is not practical for civilian jet airliners due to limited application. The maximum climb rate for jet airliners may still leave them vulnerable to shoulder-fired missiles, with a distance of 20 miles or more before reaching safety. Steep climb angles pose risks to aircraft safety and passenger comfort. Varying approach and departure patterns could make it harder for terrorists to target aircraft with missiles, increasing the chances of detection. Aviation radio frequencies are not protected, making implementation of this technique challenging. The challenge in implementing this technique is that aviation radio frequencies are not protected, allowing terrorists to gather intelligence on changing flight patterns. Flight tracking data available in near real time from Internet sources could also be exploited by terrorists. Despite these risks, varying air traffic patterns could make overflights of specific locations less predictable, although this may disrupt normal air traffic flow and increase delays. Maximizing the use of over water approach and departure procedures, along with restricting access, could be effective at airports with low to moderate traffic. Increased use of nighttime flights and minimizing aircraft lighting as a mitigation option for air traffic procedures is not considered viable due to safety concerns and opposition from airlines and passengers. The last line of protection against midair collisions is the flight crew's ability to see and avoid other aircraft. One expedient measure to mitigate the risk of shoulder-fired SAMs to airliners is to enhance security, surveillance, and patrols near airports. However, the challenge lies in the extended approach and departure corridors where aircraft are vulnerable. Airport and airspace managers can use threat assessments to identify high-risk areas beyond airport perimeters. Security measures can be focused on high threat areas beyond airport perimeters where aircraft are vulnerable to attack. Collaboration with local law enforcement is essential for effective patrolling. Public education and neighborhood watch programs can also help mitigate the threat of terrorist activities. The Air Force's \"Eagle Eye Program\" trains civilians and servicemembers to recognize potential terrorist activity. Aerial patrols using sensor technology like FLIR can enhance surveillance efforts. Aerial patrols with sensor technology like FLIR can detect terrorists near flight paths, impacting flight schedules. Ground-based warning systems with sensor grids could cue missile countermeasures. Ground-based missile defenses could include dispensing flares near airports. Ground-based interceptors like vehicle-mounted SAMs or directed energy weapons have been suggested as options for missile defense near airports. Cost, reliability, probability of intercept, and potential side-effects would need to be considered when evaluating these systems. Industry is exploring the potential deployment of microwave-based countermeasures to jam terrorist missiles. Costs, side-effects, and unintended consequences must be assessed. Intelligence and law enforcement efforts are also crucial in preventing terrorists from acquiring shoulder-fired SAMs. Congress may consider improving missile non-proliferation efforts and sharing intelligence with airport security to respond to specific threats. The legal transfer of shoulder-fired SAMs is not governed by an international treaty, but the Wassenaar Arrangement adopted guidelines in December 2003. Recent actions by the Administration may renew emphasis on nonproliferation efforts. President Bush secured commitments from 21 Asian and Pacific Rim APEC members to adopt strict controls on MANPADs, including stockpile security and bans on transfers to non-state end users. The G-8 countries have also emphasized reducing MANPADs proliferation, implementing measures to prevent terrorist acquisition. The G-8 countries agreed on an action plan in 2004 to address terrorist acquisition of MANPADS, focusing on collection, secure stockpile management, export controls, regulation, and banning transfers to non-state end-users. They also discussed the feasibility of developing new MANPADS with specific features to prevent unauthorized use and encouraged action in the International Civil Aviation Organization on MANPADS security. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has proposed guidelines for member countries to control MANPADS proliferation. The U.S. State Department is working on destroying excess shoulder-fired SAMs and developing security measures to prevent them from falling into the hands of terrorists. Promising agreements have been made in this regard. The United States, Russia, and NATO partners have made agreements to destroy obsolete MANPADS and reduce stockpiles. Other countries like Ukraine, Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Cambodia, Nicaragua, and Liberia have also pledged to destroy excess MANPADS. These agreements have led to a reduction in MANPADS, with 17,000 destroyed worldwide as of September 20, 2005. The Bush Administration used economic and diplomatic pressure to ensure countries implemented pledges to destroy shoulder-fired SAMs. Informal actions include seizing SAMs during combat operations, while formal actions involve offering rewards for turning over SAMs in Iraq and Afghanistan. Over 300 missiles were turned over in Iraq, with rewards totaling over $100,000. Other formal options include infiltrating black markets. The Bush Administration used economic and diplomatic pressure to ensure countries implemented pledges to destroy shoulder-fired SAMs. Informal actions include seizing SAMs during combat operations, while formal options could involve infiltrating black markets, organized crime, or terrorist groups to seize or destroy missiles. Incorporating specific characteristics in new shoulder-fired missiles could make it harder for terrorists to use them, such as Permissive Action Links (PALs) to \"tamper-proof\" the missiles. Congress is exploring PALs for Stinger missiles. Congress is interested in exploring PALs for Stinger missiles, but Army resistance is evident. Concerns include potential complications and cost increase. Legislation has been proposed to address the threat MANPADS pose to civil aircraft. Representative Steve Israel and Senator Barbara Boxer introduced relevant legislation during the 108th Congress. In the 108th Congress, legislation was introduced by Representative Steve Israel and Senator Barbara Boxer (H.R. 580, S. 311) to require airliners to be equipped with missile defense systems. The Department of Homeland Security was directed to develop a program plan for these systems, which was subsequently funded and is progressing. The National Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 directed the President to pursue international treaties to limit the proliferation of Man-portable Air Defense Systems. The 108th Congress introduced legislation to require airliners to have missile defense systems. The National Intelligence Reform Act of 2004 directed the President to pursue treaties to limit the proliferation of Man-portable Air Defense Systems worldwide. The act also required reports on diplomatic efforts and briefings on non-proliferation status. Additionally, the FAA was tasked with certifying airworthiness for missile defense systems on commercial aircraft, and the DHS was required to assess aircraft vulnerability to MANPADS attacks and develop security plans. Several bills introduced during the 108th Congress aimed to address the threat of shoulder-fired missiles to commercial aviation. These bills called for diplomatic efforts to limit the availability and transfer of MANPADS, as well as the destruction of excess stocks worldwide. They also proposed agreements with foreign countries to regulate MANPADS exports and prohibit retransfer without consent. Section 2241 of the State Department Authorization Bill mirrored these provisions. The Authorization Bill (S. 2144) allocated $10 million for counter-MANPADS programs in FY2006. The bill included funding for a MANPADS Defense Program to develop a ground-based sensor grid for missile launch detection. The program aims to utilize cost-effective technologies suitable for urban environments. Defense authorization and appropriations conferees matched the administration's funding request. DHS submitted a plan to Congress on May 22, 2003, specifying a two-year timeframe for developing an anti-missile device on a single aircraft type. The plan includes a parallel FAA certification effort to deploy the system on commercial aircraft within two years. Estimated costs include $2 million in FY2003 for administrative costs, $60 million in FY2004 for system development, and up to $60 million in FY2005 for system completion and FAA certification. The Department of Homeland Security received full funding in FY2004 and FY2005 for the development and demonstration of an anti-missile system for commercial passenger jets. The program aims to leverage existing military technologies for deployment in civil aviation by FY2007. The DHS established a Counter-MANPADs Special Program Office (SPO) to manage the program which consists of three phases. Phase I, completed in July 2004, assessed proposed solutions from contractor teams led by Northrop-Grumman, BAE Systems, and United Airlines. Each team was awarded $2 million to develop detailed system descriptions and analyze economic, manufacturing, maintenance, safety, and operational effectiveness issues for commercial aircraft use. Following a DHS-led review of contractor teams' Phase I work and proposals for Phase II, $45 million was awarded to BAE Systems and Northrop Grumman for Phase II development. Both contractors developed laser-based directed IR countermeasure systems to protect commercial aircraft from IR-guided MANPADS attacks. The United Airlines-led team proposed a system using expendable flare decoys but was not selected for Phase II. The United Airlines team was not selected for Phase II due to safety issues with pyrotechnic decoys and system false alarms. BAE Systems and Northrop Grumman, along with other companies, developed prototypes for testing on commercial aircraft. Final testing for both systems has been delayed but initial data show they meet DHS test requirements. Both BAE Systems and Northrop Grumman have developed directed energy infrared countermeasures systems for the U.S. military and have met DHS test requirements. Northrop Grumman is delivering its Large Aircraft IRCM system for U.S. Air Force C-17 and C-130 transports, while BAE is working on an IRCM system for U.S. Army aircraft. The next phase of the DHS counter-MANPADS program for commercial aircraft is funded in FY2006 appropriations to improve system robustness under operational conditions in the commercial aviation environment. The FY2006 DHS Appropriations Act provides $110 million for Phase III of the civilian airline counter-MANPADS program. Phase III of the civilian airline counter-MANPADS program involves delivery and installation of pre-production equipment on commercially operated aircraft by U.S. cargo carriers. Two contractors will be maintained for competition, with goals including live-fire testing, system reliability improvement, ground notification alerting capabilities, and security features for sensitive military technology. A House proposal aims to designate $10 million for FY2006. The House proposal to designate $10 million for the DHS counter-MANPADS program towards alternative technologies was not included in the final FY2006 appropriation. Concerns were raised about the current technologies' ability to meet commercial challenges economically, suggesting funds be directed towards assessing simpler and more cost-effective ground-based countermeasures. Operating costs per airplane were estimated at over $300,000, causing concerns for airplane manufacturers and airlines. Despite concerns over the use of aircraft-based counter-MANPADS systems, policymakers have not formally examined alternative technologies. The FY2006 DoD appropriations included funding for ground-based sensor arrays to detect shoulder-fired missile attacks. The FY2007 President's budget includes $4.88 million for oversight and evaluation of Phase III contracts. No additional funding is requested for new DHS Counter-MANPADS initiatives. Congress is considering legislative and oversight approaches to address the shoulder-fired SAM threat. Congress may consider implementing various combinations of mitigation alternatives in response to threat assessments, such as equipping large widebody airplanes or aircraft used on overseas flights first. There may be debates on whether to equip only a portion of the air carrier fleet, all-cargo jets, or passenger-carrying regional jets. Equipping aircraft with missile countermeasure systems has advantages like fixed installation, minimal crew intervention, and protection in areas with limited security. However, downsides include high costs and potential passenger confidence issues. Procedural improvements like crew training and enhanced airport security may be more cost-effective and immediately effective in deterring terrorist threats. The 108th Congress introduced legislation for missile defense systems in turbojet aircraft used by commercial airliners. The Department of Homeland Security allocated funds for developing a prototype missile countermeasure system for commercial aircraft, with additional funding provided in subsequent years for further program development. The Department of Homeland Security allocated $110 million in FY2005 (P.L.108-280) for a third phase of the project to address the shoulder-fired SAM threat over the next two years. These actions may lead to additional protective measures."
