    "content": "The legislative branch bill funds various Joint Items, Capitol Police, Congressional Budget Office, Library of Congress, and other agencies. Table 1 shows funding levels from FY2008 to FY2019, while Figure 1 displays budget distribution in FY2019. Table 2 details funding for the Senate, House of Representatives, and the legislative branch. The FY2019 legislative branch budget request of $4.960 billion was submitted on February 12, 2018, prior to the enactment of FY2018 funding on March 23, 2018. The House passed H.R. 5895 on June 8, 2018, and the Senate passed H.R. 5895 on June 25, 2018. The Senate agreed to the conference report on H.R. The legislative branch budget request for FY2019 was signed into law as H.R. 5895 on September 21, 2018 (P.L. 115-244). The President has no formal role in the development of the legislative branch budget request, which is included in the annual budget without change. The executive branch does not review or maintain documentation for the legislative branch requests. The legislative branch budget request for FY2019 was signed into law as H.R. 5895 on September 21, 2018 (P.L. 115-244). The executive branch does not review or maintain documentation in support of the legislative branch requests. The legislative branch's proportion of total discretionary budget authority has averaged around 0.40% since FY1976. Member salaries for Congress are not funded or increased in the legislative branch bill. The Ethics Reform Act of 1989 established a formula for Member pay adjustments based on the Employment Cost Index. Congress can prohibit, revise, or adjust the pay increase, which last occurred in January 2009. Members of Congress currently earn $174,000, with a potential 2.3% pay adjustment in January 2019. In January 2019, a 2.3% pay adjustment of $4,000 for members was prohibited by the FY2019 act. The prohibition on annual pay adjustments for members is typically included in legislation without separate votes. This prohibition can be included in any bill or introduced as a separate bill. Legislative branch employees' salaries and benefits are provided separately from member pay adjustments. The salaries and benefits for legislative branch employees are funded by legislative branch appropriations acts, which do not address pay adjustments. The House and Senate consider funding levels for legislative branch agencies and joint entities, but do not propose funding levels for each other's items. Reports on legislative branch appropriations bills show deference between the House and Senate. Adjustments may be necessary to address any omissions in Senate bill totals provided to the Architect of the Capitol at different stages of consideration."
