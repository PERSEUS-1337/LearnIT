    "content": "Debt-for-nature initiatives were created to address the environmental impact of developing countries heavily indebted to foreign creditors. These countries struggled to pay off debts in hard currency, leading to increased natural resource exports at the expense of the environment. By allowing portions of debt to be paid with local currency and increasing funds for conservation, the initiatives aimed to improve environmental conditions and relieve debt-related difficulties. Money from these transactions has funded projects like national park protection. Since 1993, there has been a decline in debt-for-nature transactions involving official and private funds. Reasons for this decline include accounting changes and higher commercial debt prices. Despite periodic authorization for U.S. participation in such transactions, appropriations have decreased over the years. The early focus of debt-for-nature legislation was on promoting third-party transactions. The U.S. government focused on promoting third-party debt-for-nature transactions in the late 1980s. Legislation directed the Treasury Secretary to develop a pilot program to reduce debt owed by foreign countries while generating funds for the environment. Congress authorized debt reduction for eligible Latin American countries through the 1990 farm bill and subsequent laws. Loans made by USAID, the Export-Import Bank, and the Commodity Credit Corporation were part of President George H. W. Bush's Enterprise for the Americas Initiative. In 1996, USAID was authorized to conduct debt swaps, buybacks, and cancellations for Latin American and Caribbean countries. The Tropical Forest Conservation Act of 1998 allowed for debt swaps to fund tropical forest conservation. Congress reauthorized funding for the TFCA in 2004. S. 1023 in the 115th Congress would authorize $20.0 million annually for the TFCA from FY2018 to FY2021. The bill S. 1023 authorizes $20.0 million annually for the TFCA from FY2018 to FY2021, expanding it to include coral reefs and ecosystems. It allows concessional debt incurred before enactment to be eligible for debt-for-nature transactions, involving NGOs like The Nature Conservancy and Conservation International. The debt-for-nature agreements involve NGOs purchasing debt from debtor countries at a discounted rate, with the proceeds used for conservation projects. Funding for debt purchases can come from various sources, including NGOs, governments, banks, or private organizations. USAID was authorized in 1989 to assist NGOs in buying commercial debt for these agreements. Several NGOs participated in debt-for-nature transactions with financial assistance from USAID, but specific information on funds given by USAID for three-party transactions was not available. These transactions have resulted in less reduction in total debt compared to bilateral agreements, with approximately $200 million in debt reduced or swapped, generating $167 million in local currency for conservation purposes. Bilateral debt transactions involve official funds directly between creditor and debtor governments. The creditor government sets eligibility criteria for debt-for-nature agreements, involving financial and political conditions in the debtor country. Debt agreements are restructured to extend payback periods or bought back at a discounted price. Multilateral agreements involve multiple creditor countries and a debtor country. The US model for bilateral agreements was established in 1990 and has been expanded multiple times. The EAI legislation (P.L. 101-624; 7 U.S.C. 1738) authorizes the sale, reduction, cancellation, and buyback of eligible debt of Latin American and Caribbean countries meeting specific criteria, last amended by the Tropical Forest Conservation Act in 1998 (P.L. 105-214; 22 U.S.C. 2431). Debtor countries must meet political and macroeconomic criteria, including having a democratically elected government, not supporting terrorism, cooperating with the US on drug control, and not violating human rights. Eligible countries for the EAI must meet economic criteria such as having a loan from IBRD or IDA, a macroeconomic agreement with the IMF, and investment reforms. They must also sign an Americas Framework Agreement with the US to establish a trust fund for environmental, health, and child development programs. Debt-for-nature transactions under the EAI involve mechanisms like debt swaps, buybacks, and restructuring to fund environmental projects. Countries cancel a percentage of their debt in exchange for depositing money into an environmental fund. For example, the US reduced Colombia's $310 million debt by 10% in return for a $41.6 million deposit into an environmental fund over 10 years. In a debt buyback program, debtor countries purchase their debt at a reduced price, with a portion of the repurchase price deposited into an environmental fund managed by the Colombian government. For example, Peru bought back $177 million in debt for $57 million in 1998, generating $23 million in local currency funds for conservation and child development programs. Overall, more than $1 billion of debt was reduced from a total of $1.9 billion, and nearly $180 million in conservation funds were generated across eight debtor countries. The EAI funds have stopped receiving deposits, but some countries are still awarding grants. Programs under the EAI support small projects with grants and monitor funded projects. Examples include marine management in Jamaica, development projects in the Peruvian Andes, and conservation grants in Bolivia. Congress expanded the EAI to include countries with tropical forests through the Tropical Forest Conservation Act in 1998. The Tropical Forest Conservation Act (TFCA) was established to conserve tropical forests by reducing external debt in countries with such forests. It allows debt swaps, restructuring, and buybacks to generate funds for conservation. 14 countries have participated in the program, reducing at least $90.0 million in debt and generating $339.4 million for conservation projects. The Republic of the Philippines completed the largest debt-for-nature transaction under TFCA in 2013. Developing countries must meet eligibility criteria to participate in the program. The TFCA program allows developing countries with tropical forests to participate in debt swaps for conservation funds. Eligibility criteria include having unique biodiversity in tropical forests. Conservation funds are deposited in a tropical forest fund overseen by an administrating body with representatives from environmental organizations. The TFCA program allows developing countries with tropical forests to participate in debt swaps for conservation funds. Interest accrued on restructured loans is deposited into a tropical forest fund and used for grants to fund tropical forest conservation projects, including park establishment, training programs, community support, ecosystem management, and medicinal plant research. The TFCA was reauthorized in 2004 with appropriations of $20 million for FY2005, $25 million for FY2006, and $30 million for FY2007. The TFCA program was reauthorized in 2004 with appropriations of $20 million for FY2005, $25 million for FY2006, and $30 million for FY2007. The law authorizes funds for audits and evaluations of debt-for-nature programs, including the use of restructured loan principal for transactions. Advocates argue that reducing debt in developing countries will stimulate economic growth, trade liberalization, and protect the environment. Advocates of converting hard currency debts to local currency debts argue that it will lower debt burdens on developing countries and potentially reduce resource extraction at the expense of the environment. Critics of debt-for-nature initiatives claim that only a small percentage of debt is actually reduced, minimizing the positive impact on developing countries. Despite the small debt reduction, supporters highlight the significant establishment of laws, programs, and funds dedicated to conservation following debt-for-nature initiatives. The relationship between debt reduction and lower resource extraction rates remains controversial. Some analysts argue that debt reduction may not directly lead to lower extraction rates of minerals or timber in developing countries with foreign debt. Advocates of debt-for-nature initiatives point to the United States' history of supporting debt reduction efforts and funding environmental causes, such as the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative. HIPC aims to reduce debt in developing countries through social and economic policy reforms, potentially improving local environmental conditions and promoting sustainable resource use. Critics, however, question the effectiveness of these initiatives in reducing resource extraction rates. Critics argue that conservation spending is unbalanced, with funds directed towards specific projects and areas, neglecting other biodiverse regions. Debt-for-nature transactions are seen as crucial for tropical forest conservation to combat climate change, as deforestation in developing countries like Brazil and Indonesia contributes significantly to CO2 emissions. Some tropical countries with high levels of debt to the United States, like Indonesia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, also have large areas of tropical forest cover. However, political and economic eligibility requirements may prevent some countries from participating in debt-for-nature transactions under the TFCA. Critics argue that these transactions are not adequately enforced, generate insufficient funds for environmental improvements, and may infringe on national sovereignty. Debt-for-nature transactions, like those under the EAI, have safeguards to protect the U.S. government. A debt-for-nature swap in Bolivia caused controversy over national sovereignty when a conservation organization obtained land title. Conservation organizations now avoid directly buying land in debtor countries. The number of these transactions has decreased, possibly due to accounting changes requiring more funding from official debt. The Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 changed debt cancellations by requiring appropriations for debt restructuring based on the net present value of debts owed to the United States. Funds from Congress cover costs for debt-for-nature transactions, including face-value reductions in eligible debt. The TFCA has not received appropriations since FY2014, leading to a decline in debt-for-nature transactions. The conclusion of the Brady Plan in Latin American countries also impacted the availability of debt for resale. Other debt relief programs like HIPC offer more significant debt cancellations, making them more attractive to developing countries than debt-for-nature initiatives under the TFCA. Debt-for-nature transactions under the EAI or TFCA faced challenges due to lengthy negotiation periods and strict eligibility requirements. Limited studies have analyzed their effectiveness in conserving tropical forests, but a 2011 study showed that countries implementing these transactions tend to have lower deforestation rates. Many conservation organizations support the TFCA framework as a model for conserving ecosystems. Appropriations for debt reduction activities under EAI totaled $90 million, with $233.4 million allocated for TFCA from FY2000 to FY2013. Congress has not funded TFCA since FY2013, despite its expiration in FY2008. Bilateral debt-for-nature initiatives were supported through programs like EAI and TFCA. Recently, appropriations for debt-for-nature transactions under programs like EAI and TFCA have ceased, leading to decreased interest in these transactions. Reasons for the decline include reduced eligible debt, small transaction amounts for some countries, lack of appropriations, and a narrow focus on tropical forests. Despite this, some Members of Congress advocate for continuing TFCA transactions to address global climate change. Tropical forests are crucial for storing carbon and are considered a carbon sink. Efforts like debt-for-nature swaps aim to prevent deforestation and reduce carbon emissions. There are calls to expand these efforts to include coral reefs, potentially involving more countries in such transactions. The impact of TFCA initiatives on reducing stored-carbon emissions has not been quantitatively analyzed yet. The text chunk discusses various legislative acts such as the International Development and Finance Act of 1989, Support for East European Democracy Act of 1989, and FY1990 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act related to debt-for-nature swaps and debt obligations of foreign countries. The FY1990 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act directs the Secretary of the Treasury to support sustainable development and conservation projects when negotiating debt reduction, encourage the World Bank to assist with private debt restructuring through environmental projects, and promote multilateral development banks to support lending portfolios for debtor countries to restructure debt for conservation purposes. The Enterprise for the Americas Initiative allows the President to reduce P.L. 480 sales credit debt owed by countries. The Export Enhancement Act of 1992 (P.L. 102-429) authorizes the sale, reduction, cancellation, and buyback of outstanding Export-Import Bank loans for EAI purposes. The Jobs Through Exports Act of 1992 (P.L. 102-549) authorizes the sale, reduction, cancellation, and country buyback of eligible Commodity Credit Corporation debt. The Enterprise for the Americas Initiative Act of 1992 (P.L. 102-532) establishes guidelines for debt-for-nature swaps for Latin American and Caribbean countries. The Foreign Operations Appropriations for FY1993 (P.L. 102-391) provided $50 million for debt restructuring under EAI. The Foreign Operations Appropriations for FY1995 (P.L. 103-306) authorized nongovernmental organizations to place funds in interest-bearing accounts. The Foreign Operations Appropriations for FY1996 (P.L. 104-107) provided authority for debt buybacks/swaps with eligible loans. The Tropical Forest Conservation Act of 1998 (P.L. 105-214) facilitates protection of tropical forests through debt restructuring, buybacks, and swaps in eligible developing countries. Reauthorizations include appropriations of $50 million, $75 million, and $100 million for FY2002, FY2003, and FY2004, and $20 million, $25 million, and $30 million for FY2005, FY2006, and FY2007. The Tropical Forest Conservation Act of 1998 facilitates protection of tropical forests through debt restructuring and swaps in eligible developing countries. This allows for the principal on debt agreements to be treated by the debt-for-nature transaction."
