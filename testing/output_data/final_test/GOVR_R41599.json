    "content": "The Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) was established by Congress in 1970 as a nonprofit organization to protect customers of securities firms. With around 5,000 member firms, SIPC ensures that customers recover cash and securities in case of firm insolvency. Congressional action was prompted by issues in securities trading during the late 1960s, including trade processing bottlenecks, accounting abuses, and market decline leading to firm failures. In 1970, Congress enacted the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 (SIPA) to address issues in securities trading. SIPA created the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) to recover and return customers' cash, stocks, and securities when their brokerage firm closes due to financial problems. SIPC is overseen by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and funded by securities broker-dealers. The Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) is overseen by a seven-member public board of directors appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve Board, and the President. SIPC requires broker-dealers registered with the SEC or members of a national securities exchange to be members and pay annual assessments. This report discusses SIPC issues, including policy concerns from the Madoff fraud, reforms in the Dodd-Frank Act, and pending legislation. SIPC provides protection to customers for missing securities and cash left with failed securities firms, covering losses of up to $500,000 at the time of a firm's collapse. The Dodd-Frank Act increased cash loss coverage to $250,000. Covered assets include stocks, bonds, notes, and mutual funds, with SIPC overseeing recovery and distribution to customers. Securities held by the broker for the customer in \"street name\" are part of a shared customer property fund. When a SIPC member faces financial difficulty, SIPC alerts the SEC or self-regulatory organizations like FINRA. SIPC then files for liquidation in federal court and appoints a trustee to handle customer claims. The trustee uses the SIPC Fund to satisfy remaining customer claims in cash or securities. When a SIPC member faces financial difficulty, SIPC alerts the SEC or self-regulatory organizations like FINRA and files for liquidation in federal court. A trustee is appointed to handle customer claims, and SIPC advances funds to customers up to statutory amounts. SIPC does not protect against losses in commodities, precious metals, derivatives, or other non-securities transactions. Customers must file claims with the trustee for funds or securities owed to them from the failed firm. The failed firm has $5 billion in allowed claims, with $4.5 billion (90%) recovered through assets. Former clients will receive 90% of their allowed claims from recovered assets. For example, Client A with a $5 million claim would receive $4.5 million from recovered assets and $500,000 from SIPC. If the claim was $6 million, Client A would receive $4.5 million from recovered funds and $500,000 from SIPC, leaving $100,000 in uncovered losses. The SIPC Fund, also known as the SIPC reserves, provides advances to customers and covers administrative expenses of liquidation proceedings. The Fund's assets come from investments and assessments on SIPC-member firms. SIPC can borrow up to $2.5 billion from the U.S. Treasury if reserves are insufficient, as mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act.

The Fund's assets come from investments and assessments on SIPC-member firms. SIPC can borrow up to $2.5 billion from the U.S. Treasury if reserves are insufficient, as mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act. Treasury would relend funds to SIPC, which also had access to a $1 billion line of credit with banks. SIPC members' annual rates fluctuated over the years, with assessments based on revenues or flat fees. The Fund's target level was set at $150 million in 1970, adjusting for inflation and market changes. The SIPC Fund's target level was initially set at $150 million in 1970, but due to market changes and increased perceived monetary risk, the Board raised it to $1 billion by 1997. The Fund fluctuated between $1.0 billion and $1.7 billion from 1996 to 2008. After the liquidations of Lehman Brothers and Madoff's firm in 2009, the Board set a new target of $2.5 billion for the Fund. The SIPC Fund was increased to $2.5 billion in 2009, with member assessments now based on 0.25% of each member's net operating revenue. Critics argue that the current assessment protocol does not consider risk levels, potentially subsidizing high-risk broker-dealers. Proposals to address the issue of potentially subsidizing high-risk broker-dealers include giving SIPC a regulatory watchdog role and amending SIPA to require risk-adjusted fees for members. However, a 2003 report by Fitch Risk Management criticized the idea of a risk-based pricing system, citing difficulties in accurately assessing broker-dealer risks. The SEC sued Bernard L. Madoff for securities fraud related to a Ponzi scheme causing substantial losses. The Madoff case raised concerns about SIPC's protection based on net equity. The bankruptcy judge approved the trustee's net investment method for determining customer claims in the Madoff case, rejecting the \"last statement method\" proposed by some investors. This decision has faced criticism from investors and members of Congress. Representative Scott Garrett, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government-Sponsored Enterprises, supported the trustee and SIPC in the Madoff case. The SEC argued that Madoff's account statements were manipulated to show favorable returns divorced from actual market trading. H.R. 6531, introduced by Chairman Garrett, aimed to amend SIPA to determine a customer's net equity based on their last statement. Indirect investors, not covered by SIPA, are known as \"claimants without an account.\" Many investors, known as \"claimants without an account,\" invested money with Madoff's operation through various investment vehicles. Indirect investors criticized the restrictions on them as unfair, as they are not eligible for full SIPC protection. H.R. 5032 aimed to require SIPC to provide more protection for indirect investors. The proposed bill, H.R. 5032, aimed to provide up to $100,000 worth of protection to indirect investors in Ponzi schemes, including those involved in the Madoff liquidation. Recipients would need to waive their right to sue feeder funds to qualify for this benefit. Critics argue that the indiscriminate payout policy may not prioritize smaller pension funds and other investors. Critics argue that providing unqualified payouts to indirect investors in Ponzi schemes like Madoff may not prioritize smaller pension funds and other investment vehicles. Clawbacks, where bankruptcy trustees recover payments made before the scheme's discovery, are limited by statutory constraints. The trustee in the Madoff case is seeking to claw back funds from investors involved in feeder funds. The Madoff case trustee is trying to recover funds from investors who withdrew their money before Madoff's arrest. H.R. 5032 aims to prevent clawbacks unless investors are proven complicit in the Ponzi scheme. John Coffee, Jr. supports the current policy of not allowing fraudulent investors to benefit from redemptions. Professor Coffee supports preventing fraudulent investors from benefiting from redemptions in Ponzi schemes. He suggests that reform efforts like H.R. 5032, which aim to benefit net winners, would come at the expense of net losers. In February 2009, the SEC charged Robert Allen Stanford for orchestrating a multi-billion dollar investment scheme. The $8 billion CD program by Stanford's companies, SIB and SGC, targeted investors globally, including Americans. SIPC does not protect investors who physically received Stanford CDs, and no protection exists for fraudulent securities issued by non-SIPC members like SIB. SIPC also provides no protection for securities rendered worthless by fraudulent conduct, as in the Stanford case. SIPC does not protect investors from loss of value due to fraudulent conduct, such as in the Stanford case. Many Stanford CD holders criticized SIPC for not providing them with protections. Some victims lobbied Congress for legislative changes to improve SIPC's treatment of fraud victims. There is controversy over SIPC's interpretation of SIPA, which only covers physical loss or theft of securities, not loss in value. Observers suggest that increasing fraud in the securities markets, especially targeting inexperienced investors, calls for expanding SIPC's mandate to include fraud-induced value loss. In 2010, SIPC acknowledged the need for updates to the Securities Investor Protection Act. The Securities Investor Protection Act underwent significant amendments in 1980. A Modernization Task Force was formed by SIPC to review SIPA, chaired by SIPC's chairman and vice chairman, with representatives from various sectors. The task force aims to propose necessary statutory amendments considering changes in the securities industry and judicial precedents. Key areas of concern include the adequacy of the SIPC Fund, no account claimants, investor education, clawbacks, SIPC protection level, net equity, and excess SIPC. The SIPC Board will review the task force's findings for potential legislative changes and reforms to SIPA. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (P.L. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376) amended the Securities Investor Protection Act (SIPA) in 2010. Changes included adjustments to the minimum assessment amount for SIPC-member firms and an increase in the line of credit available from the Treasury Department. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act amended the Securities Investor Protection Act in 2010. Section 929H increased SIPC protection for cash claims from $100,000 to $250,000 and allowed for indexing to inflation. Section 929V criminalized misrepresentation of SIPC membership with a fine of $250,000 or imprisonment. The maximum fine for other prohibited acts under SIPA was raised to $250,000. Section 983 expanded SIPC protection to customers with futures contracts. Customers with futures and options on futures in portfolio margin accounts can now benefit from SIPC protection under a program approved by the SEC."
