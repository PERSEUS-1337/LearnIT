    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Putting Parents First Act\". Congress recognizes the unique role of the family in passing down values, stating that parents have the primary responsibility for the care and upbringing of their children. They emphasize the importance of parental involvement in decisions regarding the creation of life, believing that it is crucial for the protection of human life. Parental inclusion is crucial for protecting human life, and Congress has the authority to enact laws that safeguard the right to life under the 14th Amendment. SEC. 101 of the bill requires parental consent or judicial bypass for minors seeking abortion, with penalties for violations. SEC. 102 outlines the judicial bypass procedure. A court can waive parental consent for a minor's abortion if it's not in their best interest or if they are emancipated. The process is confidential and ensures the minor's anonymity, with proceedings given priority. The court proceedings for waiving parental consent for a minor's abortion must be expedited and concluded within 72 hours, with written findings required. Decisions can be reviewed through expedited appellate review. The term \"court of competent jurisdiction\" refers to a State court eligible to hear juvenile or family law matters, with the option for States to designate specific courts for judicial bypass. \"Expedited appellate review\" means review by the usual appellate courts for juvenile or family law matters, with States able to designate specific appellate courts for appeals under this section. SEC. 103 of the title does not override State laws that offer more protection to parents of minors seeking abortions. In TITLE II, parental consent is required for decisions regarding contraceptives and abortion referrals. All federally funded programs distributing contraceptive drugs or devices to minors or providing abortion referrals must obtain written consent from a custodial parent or legal guardian. Exceptions include minors with a court order waiving the need for parental consent through a judicial bypass process. The court can waive the need for parental consent for minors in certain cases, such as when it is not in the minor's best interest or if the minor is emancipated. The proceedings for this waiver are confidential and prioritize the minor's anonymity. The court proceedings for waiving parental consent for minors must be expedited and concluded within 72 hours, with written findings and a confidential record maintained for appellate review. Decisions denying waiver requests are eligible for expedited appellate review. In subsection (a), court decisions on waiving parental consent for minors are eligible for expedited appellate review. Definitions include \"court of competent jurisdiction\" as any State court for juvenile or family law matters, and \"expedited appellate review\" as review by the appropriate court for appeals. Use of State funds is not affected by this section. (d) State funds can be used to distribute contraceptive drugs or devices, provide abortion referral information to minors without parental consent if paid for by the State. The State must take action to allow this without requiring parental consent. (e) Applicability of State Law--Providers of services covered by this section must comply with State laws on reporting child abuse, molestation, sexual abuse, rape, or incest."
