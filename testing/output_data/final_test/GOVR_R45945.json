    "content": "The federal flag code provides guidelines for the appearance and display of the U.S. flag, including how to deliver the Pledge of Allegiance and conduct during the National Anthem. State laws attempting to punish flag disrespect have been struck down under free speech principles. Laws against physical mistreatment of the flag exist but may violate the Constitution. The federal Flag Protection Act, which criminalizes flag desecration, was struck down on First Amendment free speech grounds. Some flag-misuse laws also prohibit certain displays on the U.S. flag, which may face free speech challenges. State requirements for daily recital of the Pledge of Allegiance have been upheld, but mandatory student participation was ruled a violation of free speech. The flag code provides guidelines for the appearance and display of the flag. The American flag should be displayed with alternating red and white stripes and a blue field with stars representing each state. It should be hoisted and lowered ceremoniously, illuminated at night if needed, and displayed daily at public institutions, polling places on election day, and schools on school days. Guidelines are provided for displaying the flag in processions, on floats or motorcars, with other flags, and at half-staff. There are also rules for using the flag to cover a casket or suspend it across a building corridor or lobby. The American flag should be displayed with alternating red and white stripes and a blue field with stars representing each state. Guidelines are provided for displaying the flag in processions, on floats or motorcars, with other flags, and at half-staff. The President can modify the flag display requirements, and the Supreme Court has struck down flag improper use laws on free speech grounds. In Street v. New York, the Court considered a challenge to a law prohibiting flag desecration. The Court in Street v. New York evaluated the government's interest in punishing the defendant's words for flag desecration, concluding that the speech was not \"fighting words\" and the statute was not narrowly drawn. The Court also dismissed arguments that government interests in avoiding disrespectful speech outweighed freedom of expression. The Court in Street v. New York protected public expression of opinions about the flag, even if defiant or contemptuous. In Spence v. Washington, a student's act of affixing a peace symbol to a U.S. flag was considered symbolic speech. In Texas v. Johnson, the Court overturned a conviction for flag burning, ruling that the act was symbolic speech protected by the First Amendment. The Court found no valid governmental interest in prohibiting offensive speech and concluded that the flag was not physically damaged. The Court in Texas v. Johnson overturned a conviction for flag burning, ruling that it was protected symbolic speech under the First Amendment. The law was deemed targeting expression, not conduct, and was found to be content-based as it only applied to severe acts likely to be offensive. Texas's argument that the law was needed to preserve the flag as a symbol of nationhood was rejected as unjustified. The defendant's conviction for flag burning was held to violate the First Amendment in response to the Johnson decision. Congress then enacted the Flag Protection Act of 1989, leading to cases like United States v. Eichman where protestors were prosecuted for flag burning. The government argued that the Flag Protection Act aimed to protect the flag's physical integrity as a national symbol. The Flag Protection Act of 1989 prohibited disrespectful treatment of the U.S. flag, but the Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional as it regulated expressive activity. The Act aimed to protect the flag's symbolic value, but the Court held that flag destruction must be done with intent to communicate a message to affect its significance. The Flag Protection Act of 1989 was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in Johnson. Resolutions for a constitutional amendment to prohibit flag desecration have not been introduced in the 116th Congress. Flag-misuse laws may include restrictions on using the flag for commercial speech, which has fewer constitutional protections. The Supreme Court considers speech commercial when it is in an advertisement, refers to a specific product or service, and the speaker has an economic motivation. The Court's decision in Eichman did not extend to prohibitions on commercial exploitation of the flag, raising questions about the constitutionality of using flags for advertising. The use of a U.S. flag in advertising may not be considered commercial speech as it adds little expressive content to the advertisement's commercial aspects. While the display of the flag may be economically motivated, it is more likely to convey a political message such as patriotism or national pride. This raises questions about whether prohibitions on using flags for advertising violate the First Amendment. The Supreme Court analyzed the use of a U.S. flag in advertising, considering it as expressive conduct rather than commercial speech. Even if treated as commercial speech, the prohibition on using flags for advertising may still violate free speech rights. In Central Hudson Gas & Elec. v. Public Service Commission, the Court applied a four-part analysis for commercial speech protection, emphasizing that it must concern lawful activity and not be misleading. In Central Hudson Gas & Elec. v. Public Service Commission, the Court applied a four-part analysis for commercial speech protection, emphasizing that it must concern lawful activity and not be misleading. The Court must determine whether the regulation directly advances the governmental interest asserted and whether it is \"narrowly drawn\" to be no more extensive than necessary to serve that interest. The Court found that New York's interest in reducing inequities in the regulated electricity market was substantial, as was the government's energy conservation interest. However, it was speculative whether the governmental interest in avoiding inequities would be served, and the State's interest in energy conservation was substantial. The Court struck down the advertising ban in Central Hudson Gas & Elec. v. Public Service Commission as not narrowly drawn to the interest of energy conservation. Despite limited protection for commercial speech, the Supreme Court has not upheld governmental suppression of truthful commercial speech in over twenty years. Post-Central Hudson cases show more protection for commercial speech than originally thought. For example, in City of Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc., the Court rejected a regulation banning commercial publications from public newsracks. The Supreme Court has shown more protection for commercial speech in recent cases, rejecting bans on commercial publications from public newsracks and requiring a rigorous review of commercial speech regulations. Arguments suggest that flag-misuse laws regarding advertising could violate free speech if the advertising is not inherently unlawful or intended to mislead. The Supreme Court has provided more protection for commercial speech, rejecting bans on commercial publications and requiring a rigorous review of regulations. Flag-misuse laws on advertising could potentially violate free speech if not inherently unlawful or misleading. The remaining three prongs of the Central Hudson test would need to be considered, including substantial government interest, direct advancement of that interest, and narrowness of the law. The Court's analysis of restrictions on symbolic speech is relevant, with concerns about breaching the peace and preserving the flag as a symbol of national unity being potential governmental interests. Teacher-led recitations of the Pledge of Allegiance have been challenged as violations of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, specifically regarding the phrase \"one Nation under God.\" The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that daily recitations of the Pledge of Allegiance violate free speech rights. In Newdow v. United States Congress, the Ninth Circuit considered a case where a father argued that the Pledge of Allegiance recitation by his daughter's public school teacher violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The father claimed his daughter was compelled to watch her teacher proclaim the nation as under God, using the \"coercion test\" from Lee v. Weisman. In Weisman v. Lee, the court ruled that government cannot coerce individuals to support or participate in religion, especially in public schools. The graduation prayers were seen as state-endorsed, putting pressure on students who objected. The court emphasized protecting freedom of conscience in schools and found that the school's supervision of the ceremony was impermissible. Similarly, in Newdow v. United States Congress, the court considered the coercion of students in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance with religious content. The Supreme Court overturned the Newdow case on grounds of lack of standing, allowing the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in public schools with the phrase \"Under God.\" Other courts have also rejected Establishment Clause challenges to the Pledge of Allegiance. The Supreme Court overturned a case challenging the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in public schools. The Court ruled that mandating student participation in the Pledge violates free speech principles under the First Amendment. The federal \"flag code\" specifies that reciting the Pledge is voluntary. In West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, the Court considered a mandate for daily Pledge recitation in public schools, leading to a student's expulsion for non-compliance. In West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, the Supreme Court ruled that mandating student participation in the Pledge of Allegiance violated free speech protections of the First Amendment. The Court found that the requirement for students to perform a stiff-arm salute and recite the Pledge was compelled speech and a violation of their rights. The Court also emphasized that remaining passive during the flag salute did not pose a clear and present danger that would justify regulation. The Supreme Court ruled in West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette that mandating student participation in the Pledge of Allegiance violated free speech protections of the First Amendment, regardless of any religious objections."
