    "content": "The opioid epidemic in the United States involves the abuse of various types of opioids, including prescription pain medications like hydrocodone and fentanyl, as well as illicit drugs like heroin. Opioids bind to receptors in the body to alleviate pain, but misuse can lead to harm. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration conducts surveys on heroin use and misuse of prescription pain relievers, rather than specifically asking about opioids. In 2017, SAMHSA estimated that 11.4 million people misused opioids, including 11.1 million prescription pain reliever \"misusers\" and 886,000 heroin users. Additionally, 3.2 million Americans ages 12 and older were current \"misusers\" of prescription pain relievers, and approximately 494,000 Americans ages 12 and older were current users of heroin. The University of Michigan's Monitoring the Future Survey in 2018 found that 3.4% of surveyed 12th graders were current users of \"narcotics other than heroin\", and 0.1% of surveyed 8th, 10th, and 12th graders were current users of heroin. Opioids can improve functioning for legitimate pain patients but abusing them poses short- and long-term physical risks, including nonfatal overdoses with various health issues. Drug overdose deaths have increased significantly, with synthetic opioids being the main driver. Illicitly manufactured fentanyl is likely contributing to recent overdose death increases. In addition to overdose harm, addiction is a primary concern with opioids. Opioid addiction is a major concern, leading to public health issues and overdose deaths. Rates vary by state, with eastern states showing higher numbers. Fentanyl is a significant factor in the increase of overdose deaths, as reported by the DEA and CDC. The increase in overdose deaths is linked to rising fentanyl seizures. There is a strong relationship between synthetic opioid deaths and fentanyl reports. The number of fentanyl-related deaths is likely underestimated due to lack of testing. Heroin, fentanyl, and prescription opioids are significant drug threats in the United States. The availability of prescription drugs, including opioids, has decreased in recent years, while heroin availability has increased. Illicit fentanyl availability has also risen. The market for opioids shifted significantly in the 1990s, with a sharp increase in abuse of prescription opioids like hydrocodone and oxycodone. This trend continued into the early 2000s. Illegitimate prescription opioid users resorted to various methods to obtain opioids, including doctor shopping, pill mills, internet pharmacies, and prescription fraud. The federal government implemented measures such as grants for monitoring programs, cracking down on pill mills, regulating internet pharmacies, reformulating OxyContin, and rescheduling hydrocodone to combat unlawful prescription drug supply and abuse. Some experts suggest a link between the crackdown on prescription drugs and the rise in heroin abuse as heroin becomes a cheaper alternative for those seeking an opioid high. The Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act (SUPPORT Act) imposed tighter oversight on opioid production and distribution, required additional reporting and safeguards to address fraud, and limited Medicare coverage of prescription opioids. The DEA proposed a significant reduction in opioid manufacturing for 2019 due to a decline in prescriptions written for schedule II opioids since 2014. The heroin supply in the United States has evolved over the last few decades, with white powder heroin from South America dominating the market in the east and black tar heroin from Mexico in the west. The purity and price of heroin varied by region in the 1990s, with South American heroin being around 46% pure and Mexican heroin around 27% pure. The DEA has been setting production quotas for schedule II opioids since 2014 to meet medical needs and combat the opioid crisis. Retail prices for heroin fell dramatically throughout the 1990s, with Mexican heroin being around 27% pure, while Southeast Asian and Southwest Asian heroin were around 24% and 30% pure, respectively. By 2017, retail-level heroin prices continued to decline, while purity, especially that of Mexican heroin, has increased. Mexican-sourced heroin dominates the U.S. market due to its proximity, established transportation, and distribution infrastructure, with nearly 90% of seized heroin in 2016 coming from Mexico. Increases in Mexican heroin production have ensured a reliable supply of low-cost heroin, with transnational criminal organizations expanding their retail presence in the US. Concerns arise from heroin seizures containing fentanyl, especially illicit nonpharmaceutical fentanyl from China, which is 50 to 100 times more potent than heroin. Illicit fentanyl, including \"gray death,\" is highly potent and sold as heroin. Prices range from $30,000 to $38,000 per kilogram. Law enforcement anticipates new fentanyl products to evade regulations. Illicit opioids come from plant-based and synthetic sources, with most opium poppy cultivation being illegal. Afghanistan is the largest producer of illicit opium poppy. In 2018, Afghanistan cultivated approximately 263,000 hectares of opium poppy. Mexico cultivated 44,100 hectares in 2017, up from 28,000 in 2015. Opium poppy cultivation also reported in Burma, Laos, and Colombia. Illicit synthetic opioids in the US are mostly foreign-sourced. Illicit synthetic opioids in the United States are mostly sourced from foreign countries like China, India, Mexico, Canada, and the Dominican Republic. These countries have pharmaceutical industries that can be exploited for the production and export of synthetic drugs. The ingredients for prescription opioids can come from various countries globally, and these drugs can be manufactured domestically or abroad. Prescription drugs, whether manufactured domestically or abroad, are regulated in the United States through a supply chain involving various entities. Misuse of prescription opioids often involves drugs prescribed for legitimate use being diverted or counterfeit opioids being sold. Traffickers may disguise other opioids as prescription drugs to gain access to new users. Mexican transnational criminal organizations are major suppliers of illegal drugs in the US, particularly heroin. Most heroin enters through legal ports of entry in vehicles or trailers, with some seized from individuals. In FY2018, 5,205 pounds of heroin were seized at ports of entry. Fentanyl is smuggled in powder or counterfeit pill form into the US. Fentanyl is smuggled into the United States primarily from China through the mail, from China through Canada, or across the Southwest border from Mexico. Smaller quantities of high-purity fentanyl come from China, while larger quantities of low-purity fentanyl are transported from Mexico. Mexican traffickers often obtain fentanyl precursor chemicals from China and may adulterate fentanyl received from China before smuggling it into the US. In FY2018, 1,785 pounds of fentanyl were seized at ports of entry, and 388 pounds were seized between ports of entry, with the San Diego border sector being the primary entry point for fentanyl into the US. The San Diego sector is the main entry point for fentanyl into the US through the Southwest border. ONDCP is responsible for creating drug control policies and strategies to combat illicit opioid trafficking. The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) coordinates the implementation of drug control policies and priorities established by the Administration. ONDCP manages grant programs like the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) program, which aims to reduce drug production and trafficking by promoting coordination between law enforcement agencies at various levels. The HIDTA program aims to enhance intelligence sharing and coordination among federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement to combat drug trafficking. It provides funds to address the most critical drug threats in a region, such as heroin trafficking. ONDCP's Heroin Response Strategy (HRS) launched in 2015 focuses on reducing drug overdose fatalities through collaborative efforts across different levels of public safety and public health agencies. The ONDCP's Heroin Response Strategy (HRS) coordinates public health and public safety agencies at different levels to reduce drug overdose fatalities and disrupt illicit opioid trafficking. It provides information, prevention activities, and collaborates with other agencies on counter-trafficking operations, such as the Opioid Detection Challenge. DOJ controls the opioid supply through law enforcement and regulation. The DOJ controls the opioid supply through law enforcement, regulation, and grants to state and local agencies. Efforts to target opioid trafficking focus on law enforcement initiatives, with various agencies involved in countering trafficking activities. The OCDETF program aims to disrupt major drug trafficking organizations, with participation from federal agencies like the DEA, FBI, ATF, and others. The DOJ collaborates with federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies through the OCDETF program to target drug trafficking organizations. The OCDETFs focus on organizations listed on the CPOT List, with a significant emphasis on heroin investigations. The DEA enforces federal controlled substances laws nationwide and has a 360 Strategy to combat drug cartels and violent gangs. The 360 Strategy utilizes federal, state, and local law enforcement, diversion control, and community outreach to combat drug cartels, violent gangs, and the opioid/heroin abuse issue. The DEA employs community-based enforcement strategies and task forces to address opioid trafficking, along with programs like the Heroin Signature Program (HSP) and Heroin Domestic Monitor Program (HDMP) to identify heroin sources in the US. The DEA uses chemical analysis to identify heroin signatures linked to specific regions. The FBI investigates opioid trafficking to counter organized crime, cybercriminals, and fraudsters. Other DOJ agencies, like the Offices of the U.S. Attorneys, play key roles in combating the opioid epidemic. The Offices of the U.S. Attorneys prosecute cases related to the opioid epidemic, targeting prescribers, pharmaceutical companies, and pharmacies involved in illegal activities. Other agencies like the ATF and U.S. Marshals seize illicit opioids, while the Office of Justice Programs administers grant programs to address opioid supply and demand. CBP works to counter opioid trafficking at U.S. borders using various tools like nonintrusive inspection equipment and canines. CBP utilizes nonintrusive inspection equipment, canines, and laboratory testing to detect illicit drugs at U.S. borders. The agency seizes heroin and fentanyl primarily at ports of entry, with the Coast Guard focusing on interdicting noncommercial maritime flows of cocaine. The Coast Guard primarily encounters cocaine, the most common drug moved via noncommercial vessels. Other illicit drugs, including opioids, are more commonly moved on land or in commercial maritime vessels. The Coast Guard participates in multi-agency counterdrug task forces. USPIS, the law enforcement arm of the U.S. Postal Service, has seen a significant increase in drug seizures in international and domestic parcels, particularly related to opioids. In FY2018, USPIS and its partners seized over 96,000 pounds of drugs in the mail. The DEA plays a crucial role in drug control by regulating the distribution of controlled substances in the United States. Registrants, including exporters, importers, manufacturers, distributors, healthcare professionals, pharmacists, and researchers, must register with the DEA and keep records of all transactions. The agency also conducts traditional law enforcement activities such as investigating drug trafficking, including opioids. The DEA regulates over 1.5 million registrants who must keep records of controlled substances transactions, maintain inventories, and file reports. They ensure secure storage and prevent drug diversion through inspections, education, and quotas. Administrative actions include suspension orders and production quota adjustments. The DOJ grant programs, including COAP, focus on addressing drug threats, specifically opioid abuse. These programs support projects related to diversion and alternatives to combat drug-related crime and address demand issues. The COAP grant program supports projects related to opioid abuse, including diversion and alternatives to incarceration, collaboration between criminal justice and social service agencies, overdose outreach, prescription drug monitoring programs, and comprehensive strategies to address the opioid epidemic. The program also incorporates the Harold Rogers Prescription Drug Monitoring Program to collect and analyze data on prescriptions for controlled substances. The Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Office's Anti-Heroin Task Force (AHTF) Program provides funding to state law enforcement agencies to investigate illicit activities related to heroin or diverted prescription opioids. Funds are distributed to states with high rates of treatment admissions for opioids, focusing on agencies with multi-jurisdictional reach and task forces. The Drug Court Discretionary Grant program supports drug courts to address opioid abuse and diversion. The Drug Court Discretionary Grant program enhances drug court services for nonviolent substance-abusing offenders to reduce recidivism and substance abuse through supervised treatment, drug testing, and rehabilitation services. It is not focused solely on opioid abusers but includes drug-involved offenders. The program is administered by the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) and also supports the Veterans Treatment Court Program. The Veterans Treatment Court Program, administered by BJA through the Drug Courts Program, serves veterans with addiction, mental illness, and co-occurring disorders. Grants fund state, local, and tribal veterans treatment courts, authorized by CARA to provide services for qualified veterans, including peer-to-peer support and rehabilitation. OJJDP supports juvenile and family drug courts. The OJJDP supports juvenile and family drug court programs through its Drug Treatment Courts Program, focusing on juveniles and parents with substance abuse issues, especially related to opioid abuse or co-occurring mental health disorders. The JAG program, administered by BJA, provides funding for various criminal justice initiatives at the state, local, and tribal levels. The JAG program, administered by BJA, provides funding for various criminal justice initiatives at the state, local, and tribal levels, including drug treatment, enforcement, planning, evaluation, technology improvement, crime victim and witness programs, and mental health and related law enforcement and corrections programs. Funds can be used for opioid abuse programs, but it is not mandatory. The JMHCP supports collaborative efforts between criminal justice and mental health systems to assist individuals with mental illnesses or co-occurring disorders who come into contact with the justice system. It encourages early intervention, training for professionals, and collaborative support services. The JJDPA authorizes OJJDP to make formula grants to states for the development of more-effective juvenile delinquency programs and improved juvenile justice systems, including substance abuse prevention and treatment programs. Grants under this program could potentially be used to combat opioid abuse. The JJDPA authorizes OJJDP to make discretionary grants to states for delinquency prevention programs for juveniles at risk of entering the justice system. The grants can be used for various purposes including alcohol and substance abuse prevention, education, and mental health services. The Opioid Affected Youth Initiative is a competitive grant program that addresses challenges from opioid abuse impacting youth and community safety.

The U.S. has employed a multipronged foreign policy approach to address illicit opioids entering the country. The U.S. Department of State engages with international organizations like the United Nations to address drug control issues, including opioids. This includes diplomatic engagement with the Commission on Narcotic Drugs, the International Narcotics Control Board, and the U.N. Office of Drugs and Crime. The U.S. also addresses opioid trafficking through the Organization of American States. The objective of U.S. efforts at the U.N. is to accelerate counternarcotics policies. The U.S. engages with international organizations like the United Nations to address drug control issues, including opioids. U.S. diplomats advocated for the international control of key chemical precursors used in fentanyl production. The U.S. also engaged the Universal Postal Union to improve global efforts to detect and interdict synthetic drugs shipped through international mail. The Trump Administration announced a one-year withdrawal process from the UPU in October 2018, potentially impacting opioid engagement. Bilateral cooperation on opioids involves efforts in China, Mexico, and Canada through diplomatic dialogues, law enforcement cooperation, and foreign assistance programming. Cooperation with China and Mexico on counternarcotics is a top priority for the United States. Meetings like the U.S.-Mexico Strategic Dialogue on Disrupting Transnational Criminal Organizations are used for cooperation. The United States engages in structured dialogues and law enforcement cooperation with Mexico, Canada, and China to address heroin and fentanyl issues. This includes the U.S.-Mexico Security Cooperation Group, U.S.-Mexico Bilateral Drug Policy Working Group, and National Fentanyl Conference for Forensic Chemists. Additionally, the U.S. funds programming in China for drug-related information exchanges and training on synthetic opioids. INL funds a Resident Legal Advisor in Beijing to conduct outreach on amending China's drug control laws. In Mexico, efforts focus on disrupting drug production and distribution, border security, and judicial reform. The U.S. government also takes action domestically against foreign opioid sources and traffickers. The U.S. government takes domestic action against foreign sources and traffickers of opioids through the criminal justice system and financial sanctions. Recent indictments involve Chinese nationals in fentanyl production, with sanctions imposed on individuals and entities under the Kingpin Act. Similar actions have been taken against Mexican individuals and entities trafficking heroin and fentanyl to the U.S., with cooperation from the Mexican government on counternarcotics efforts. The Mexican government implements supply reduction measures to combat opioid trafficking, including eradicating opium poppy, seizing precursor chemicals, and dismantling drug laboratories. They have increased their budget for public security and formed an Office of National Drug Policy. President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador continues cooperation with the United States on drug control efforts. The Mexican government, led by President L\u00f3pez Obrador, is working with the United States to combat drug trafficking. The Mexican military eradicates illicit drug crops, including opium poppy, and has seized significant amounts of opium gum. With U.S. assistance, Mexican authorities have increased fentanyl seizures by using specialized training and equipment. In 2018, a production mill for carfentanil was discovered in Mexico, highlighting the ongoing challenges in combating drug trafficking. China has imposed controls on fentanyl analogues and precursor chemicals, leading to a decrease in availability in the United States. President Xi Jinping expressed willingness to further control fentanyl substances, supported by President Trump. Starting May 1, 2019, all fentanyl-related substances will be added to China's list of controlled narcotic drugs. Li Yuejin, Deputy Director of China's National Narcotics Control Commission, announced this decision. China will issue guidance on laws for handling criminal cases related to fentanyl substances, investigate illicit manufacturing bases, remove drug-related content from the Internet, cut off online communication for criminals, pressure parcel delivery services to register senders' real names, increase inspections of international parcels, set up special teams for criminal investigations on fentanyl trafficking, and enhance information-sharing with relevant countries, including the United States. China will issue guidance on laws for handling criminal cases related to fentanyl substances, investigate illicit manufacturing bases, remove drug-related content from the Internet, cut off online communication for criminals, pressure parcel delivery services to register senders' real names, increase inspections of international parcels, set up special teams for criminal investigations on fentanyl trafficking, and enhance information-sharing with relevant countries, including the United States. The DEA and ONDCP welcomed China's decision to crack down on illicit fentanyl rings and assist in DOJ investigations of Chinese nationals suspected of illicit activities. China's postal service, China Post, has an agreement with the USPS to provide advanced electronic data on parcels mailed to the United States. Congress has taken a public health approach towards addressing the opioid crisis, with recent laws focusing on prevention, treatment, and supply control. Three major laws enacted in the 114th and 115th Congresses include the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA), the 21st Century Cures Act, and the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act. CARA primarily focused on opioids but also addressed broader drug abuse issues, while the Cures Act authorized state opioid grants and included substance abuse provisions. The SUPPORT Act broadly addressed various aspects of the opioid epidemic. The SUPPORT Act addressed substance use disorder prevention and treatment, diversion control, and opioid abuse funding in FY2017-FY2019 appropriations. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 provided $347.0 million for comprehensive opioid abuse reduction activities, including programs authorized by CARA. The DEA received an increase of $77.8 million in FY2019 to combat drug abuse. In FY2019, the DEA received an additional $77.8 million to combat drug trafficking, specifically heroin and fentanyl. The funding will also support the addition of four new heroin enforcement teams and DEA 360 Strategy programming. Other opioid-specific funding in FY2019 includes allocations for various programs such as the Opioid-Affected Youth Initiative, COPS Program for tribal law enforcement, anti-heroin task forces, CBP for opioid detection, and Homeland Security Investigations for additional personnel. In FY2019, additional funding was allocated for opioid detection, Homeland Security Investigations, DHS research and development, and ONDCP for Community-based Coalition Enhancement Grants. The funding aimed to combat drug trafficking, specifically heroin and fentanyl, by supporting various programs and adding personnel for investigations. States have adapted their criminal justice responses to the opioid epidemic by increasing law enforcement access to naloxone to reduce overdose deaths. This section highlights common state policy approaches in addressing the crisis. Law enforcement officers are trained to identify and respond to opioid overdoses by carrying naloxone. Over 2,400 police departments in 42 states have officers equipped with naloxone, with immunity provided to those who possess, dispense, or administer the drug. State and local law enforcement collaborate on special operations to combat fentanyl and heroin trafficking, in addition to participating in federal initiatives. State and local police, along with district attorneys, lead operations to dismantle trafficking networks in areas with high opioid overdose rates. A recent example in southeast Massachusetts involved the Bristol County District Attorney's office leading a year-long investigation resulting in 11 arrests. \"Good Samaritan\" laws have been enacted to encourage seeking medical help for overdoses without fear of prosecution. These laws vary by state. As of June 2017, 40 states and the District of Columbia have Good Samaritan overdose immunity laws for drug offenses. States have drug diversion programs for offenders with substance abuse issues, including opioid abuse. The National Governors Association has supported activities to combat the opioid epidemic, such as expanding opioid addiction treatment in drug courts. The President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis has emphasized the importance of addressing opioid abuse treatment for justice-involved populations. In 2017, the President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction recommended DOJ to promote drug courts in every county. States have enacted laws to increase access to medication-assisted treatment for incarcerated drug-addicted offenders. SAMHSA issued guidance in March 2019 to states on expanding MAT in criminal justice settings."
