    "content": "A strain of the avian influenza virus H5N1, first seen in Hong Kong in 1997, has resurfaced in 2003 and spread across Asia, causing over 130 human deaths. The virus is concerning due to its high fatality rate and potential to spread efficiently between humans. International health officials are worried about weak links in prevention efforts and the possibility of the virus mutating into a form easily transmissible among humans. The typical response to an outbreak includes quarantining infected areas, culling or vaccinating birds, and restricting movement. The government responses to combat avian influenza include culling or vaccinating poultry, restricting poultry movement, testing and treating humans, public information campaigns, and seeking anti-viral medication. Effective responses involve clear directives, mobilizing resources, working with international health authorities, and securing funding. Congress allocated funds for global H5N1 initiatives, with ongoing efforts focusing on overseas governments' containment measures. In East Asia, government responses to combat avian influenza vary widely. Affected countries have improved their openness to international health authorities since the SARS outbreak in 2003. The more affluent governments have sophisticated preparation for avian influenza. For more information on H5N1, U.S. domestic preparedness efforts, and international assistance, refer to CRS reports RL33219, RL33795, and RL33145. In response to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, affluent governments like Japan, Taiwan, and Singapore have stockpiled antiviral medication and implemented detailed contingency plans. South Korea conducted a simulation exercise praised by WHO officials. Japan and South Korea successfully controlled bird outbreaks. Thailand and Vietnam struggled initially but have contained the virus. The central governments in Indonesia and China have launched campaigns to contain bird flu outbreaks, facing challenges in poor public health infrastructure and limited resources. Cambodia and Laos have minimal capacity for reporting cases, posing possible gaps in documented cases. Burma and North Korea offer little reliable information about the presence of bird flu within their borders. In Myanmar and North Korea, limited cooperation with international organizations poses a weak link in pandemic preparedness. Human cases of H5N1 were first reported outside East Asia in early 2006, raising global concern. Turkey, Iraq, and Azerbaijan saw confirmed human deaths from H5N1, prompting increased international efforts. Turkey responded slowly initially but has since taken strong containment measures. Iraq's instability has hindered prioritization of H5N1, with limited public information available. Global fear of human deaths and economic damage has spurred heightened efforts to combat the rapid spread of the disease among birds across continents. In February 2006, the OIE reported a spike in H5N1 cases in birds outside of Asia, with nearly 60 countries affected. Many cases were in countries with poor public health infrastructure. Russia, Laos, and African countries had no confirmed human cases, but were included due to their geographical significance. Iraq was excluded due to lack of information. Sub-Saharan African countries confirmed H5N1 in poultry in early July. In early July, H5N1 presence confirmed in seven sub-Saharan African countries: Nigeria, Niger, Cameroon, Sudan, Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire, and Djibouti. Nigeria's outbreak significant due to population size and likely source for Niger and Cameroon. Djibouti reported first human case in May 2006. Nigerian response includes quarantining farms, destroying infected birds, and testing poultry and contacts. Culling within three kilometers of infected sites and treating presumptive cases as actual. Integrated response teams formed by national and state authorities. Officials in Nigeria have formed integrated response teams to address the H5N1 outbreak. Public information campaigns have been launched to educate the public about bird flu and encourage reporting of bird deaths. Farmers are being compensated for losses due to control measures. Efforts to ban poultry sales and trade have had mixed results, with international experts noting inconsistent implementation. Healthcare teams are testing suspected H5N1-exposed individuals, such as poultry workers. Efforts to test suspected H5N1-exposed persons, like poultry workers, have been hindered by a lack of testing kits and knowledge about the consequences of a positive result. Nigeria has requested international aid for protective gear and disinfectants. USAID, along with other organizations, is providing support in Djibouti and Nigeria by deploying Personal Protective Equipment sets, public awareness tool kits, and communication efforts to prevent the spread of H5N1. The H5N1 virus has been confirmed in Niger and Cameroon, affecting farm ducks and other poultry. In Burkina Faso, the virus was found near the capital city. USAID's West Africa Regional Program is responding to the outbreak in Niger and working with the U.S. embassy and FAO to develop an emergency response plan. Limited funding will support FAO-led efforts. Limited funding is being allocated towards FAO-led efforts to combat the spread of H5N1. USAID has sent 2,000 PPE kits to Niger for bird culling and sampling, coordinating with CDC and WHO. CDC epidemiologists in Cameroon are monitoring H5N1 developments. USAID is dispatching PPE kits and providing $200,000 to aid Cameroon's response. FAO and OIE have deployed a team to Burkina Faso to assess and advise on H5N1 response. Multiple African countries have banned poultry imports from Nigeria and implemented surveillance measures for bird flu. In January 2006, West African countries discussed bird flu contingency planning. In late February, 12 West African countries agreed to launch a coordinated regional effort to counter H5N1, including the creation of a joint tracking committee and a group of experts. They also discussed the creation of an emergency regional H5N1 intervention fund. Southern African Development Community (SADC) and African Union (AU) health experts assessed regional avian flu preparedness in a conference supported by USAID, FAO, and WHO. African countries have national H5N1 preparedness plans but lack resources for full implementation. Some countries have WHO Global Influenza Network labs for diagnosing H5N1, while others are training personnel. ECOWAS organized a meeting in Nigeria to combat the outbreak. West African ministers met in Nigeria to develop measures to combat the H5N1 outbreak, agreeing to establish an avian flu emergency fund. The World Organization for Animal Health set up a regional control center in Mali to coordinate efforts to control H5N1. U.S. Navy medical personnel identified the first human fatalities from H5N1 in Azerbaijan. The H5 subtype of avian influenza virus caused three fatalities in Azerbaijan, following reports of H5N1 avian influenza in wild bird carcasses near Baku. By July 4, 2006, WHO confirmed eight cases of H5N1 infection in Azerbaijanis, with five fatalities. Measures were taken by the government, including the establishment of a State Commission to Prevent the Spread of Bird Flu. Authorities in Azerbaijan took action to combat the H5N1 avian flu outbreak by banning poultry imports, allocating funds for veterinary services, and purchasing disinfection equipment. Critics accused the government of being ill-prepared and slow to inform the public about the outbreak. In Cambodia, five people died from the virus, with more cases expected. In Cambodia, poultry farms are smaller but more numerous compared to Thailand. Many chickens roam freely, making monitoring difficult. Villagers have eaten sick birds due to food scarcity. The government has limited capacity to contain outbreaks. International organizations and donors could help mobilize an effective response to avian flu. U.S. Secretary of Health signed a cooperation agreement during a visit to Southeast Asia. In Southeast Asia, the U.S. Human Services Secretary pledged $1.8 million to Cambodia to combat H5N1. Germany also offered $3 million to help fight the disease. The first human cases of H5N1 in China raised concerns about the virus spreading due to the close proximity of people, birds, and animals in southern China. The communist government's lack of transparency in China has raised concerns among health specialists about the country's role in a potential H5N1 global flu pandemic. The government's early lack of cooperation during the SARS outbreak in 2003 contributed to the rapid global spread of the virus. As of August 14, 2006, China had reported 21 cases of human H5N1 infection, with 14 fatalities. The most recent death was a 62-year-old farmer from Xinjiang Uigur Autonomous Region, where no recent poultry outbreaks were reported. The World Organization for Animal Health confirmed a continuing outbreak of H5N1. The H5N1 avian flu virus outbreak in China in 2006 was confirmed by the World Organization for Animal Health. In 1997, the virus jumped from animals to humans in Hong Kong, infecting 18 people and killing six. The outbreak led to the extermination of 1.5 million birds. H5N1 became endemic in parts of China and affected domestic poultry, migratory birds, and even pigs. The 2003 SARS outbreak made Chinese leaders more aware of health issues. Beijing has been more assertive in combating the H5N1 virus, establishing monitoring labs and an emergency plan. PRC officials face challenges in implementation, with regulations in place to punish delays in reporting new flu outbreaks. The Chinese government notified the central government of new flu outbreaks within four hours. By November 2005, officials confirmed plans to vaccinate the entire poultry population, including 14 billion birds. The logistical challenges include the size of the poultry population, the need for two doses of vaccine, and concerns about the campaign potentially spreading the disease further. The Chinese government announced a broad campaign to vaccinate the entire poultry population against avian flu, with concerns that it could backfire and spread the disease further. Potential issues include the use of unlicensed vaccines, the possibility of virus spread by vaccinators, and the need for strict decontamination procedures. Additionally, China allocated 2 billion yuan to fight avian flu, banned poultry imports from affected countries, and partnered with Roche to develop a generic version of Tamiflu. The Guangdong Provincial Government and the World Health Organization Regional Office for the Western Pacific announced a joint venture to establish the WHO Collaborating Center for Surveillance, Research, and Training on Emerging Infectious Diseases at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Guangdong Province. The GCC will focus on emerging diseases, including influenza and SARS. International health experts have concerns about the PRC's transparency on avian flu issues, highlighted by suspicious bird deaths in Qinghai Lake. In June 2005, Chinese farmers used human anti-influenza drugs to treat poultry for H5N1 bird flu, potentially making the drugs ineffective against the virus in humans. China faces challenges with local compliance in flu eradication efforts, which could harm farming families. The PRC co-hosted an international event on flu control in 2006. In 2006, the PRC, World Bank, and European Commission co-hosted the \"International Pledging Conference on Avian and Human Influenza\" to raise $1.2\u2014$1.4 billion for combating avian flu in developing countries. Representatives from 100 countries and 20 organizations attended, pledging $1.9 billion. Presidents Bush and Hu Jintao discussed avian flu coordination during various meetings in 2005, signing a joint initiative during Bush's visit to Beijing. China agreed to share influenza strains for research purposes and cooperate with international organizations like the WHO, FAO, and OIE. In 2006, China agreed to provide virus samples for study in WHO labs. Cooperation on influenza vaccine development between the US and China remains uncertain. China has advanced in vaccine development with clinical trials approved by the State Food and Drug Administration. The Chinese-developed human avian flu vaccine was approved for clinical trials by PRC's State Food and Drug Administration in November 2005. In Egypt, there have been 13 cases of human infection with 5 deaths since mid-February 2006. The government has taken measures such as mass culling of poultry and banning transportation of live poultry between provinces to control the spread of the virus. Egypt, a developing country with the largest population in the Arab world, has around 25 million people employed in agriculture. Many of these workers are illiterate and lack access to government services, making it difficult to contain the spread of bird flu. Some farmers are reluctant to slaughter infected poultry, leading to infections in children who play with the birds. Improper disposal of bird carcasses has caused rumors of the Nile being infected, resulting in a surge in bottled water sales. Indonesia has made strides in stepping up its prevention and containment campaign as the outbreak of avian flu has become more severe. A lack of resources, expertise, and slow recognition of the problem has hindered Indonesia's response. The virus is now considered endemic in the bird population of Indonesia, with outbreaks reported in most provinces. Indonesia saw its first human H5N1 fatality in June 2005. In 2006, deaths from H5N1 in Indonesia surpassed Vietnam. The government has taken steps to address the outbreak, including rapid reaction and vaccine distribution plans. Indonesia announced a three-year national strategic plan to contain the avian flu virus in December 2005. The three-year national strategic plan to contain the avian flu virus includes culling, vaccination, and community-based surveillance of bird populations. Indonesia, Singapore, and the United States are collaborating on a trilateral effort in Java. The plan involves site surveys, data collection, and testing implementation schemes for replication in other areas. International health organizations are part of the pilot project. The Indonesian government is making limited progress in addressing a large-scale outbreak, with plans to compensate farmers for slaughtered animals. Minister Anton Apriyanto plans to cull poultry to control outbreaks, with the government spending $13 million in 2005 for this purpose. Indonesia's poultry industry, led by eleven companies, is hesitant to allow government monitoring. Health experts warn of a lack of antiviral treatments for a potential human pandemic. In 2005, Indonesia's Minister of Health sought international assistance for the country's preparedness. In September 2005, Indonesia's Minister of Health requested international aid due to concerns about containing the spread of H5N1. The international community pledged $140 million, while Indonesia allocated over $60 million for bird flu prevention. WHO urged countries to donate antiviral drugs. Australia pledged funds for Tamiflu tablets and signed a $7 million assistance agreement. India agreed to provide 1,000 doses. Indonesian officials were aware of H5N1 in birds for two years but suppressed the information, possibly due to lobbying by the poultry industry. Some claim the avian flu outbreak in Indonesia was suppressed by the poultry industry. Allegations suggest the government has not funded its policy to vaccinate poultry. Reports indicate the national team combating the virus is under-resourced and relies on volunteers. Secretary of State Rice discussed the outbreak with President Yudhoyono in 2006. Indonesia avoids mass poultry slaughter, opting for selected slaughters and vaccinations. Lack of public awareness hinders containment efforts, with ignorance of human-to-human transmission. Indonesia's decentralized government and lack of central authority hinder efforts to contain H5N1. The country has not implemented mandatory culling of infected birds, relying on \"band-aid\" solutions. In 2006, a consultation was held to review strategies for controlling the spread of the virus in animals and humans. The conference brought together experts from various organizations to review strategies for controlling the spread of the H5N1 virus in animals and humans. The WHO announced human-to-human transmission in Indonesia, leading to the country granting access to its H5N1 data to foreign scientists. Laos had an outbreak in poultry in 2004, with no known human cases or new outbreaks reported. In 2005, the Lao government estimated significant bird losses due to infection and culling. Some experts urge foreign health organizations to assist Laos due to its proximity to countries with bird flu and limited government capacity. Laos lacks capabilities for surveillance, monitoring avian populations, and confirming virus cases. The country's healthcare system is deemed to have severe limitations and would be quickly overwhelmed in a large-scale outbreak. Despite no reported H5N1 outbreaks in two years, experts caution against overlooking the potential threat in Laos. The FAO and WHO have strong relationships with the Lao government. In 2005, agreements were signed for funding bird flu control programs. The H5N1 strain spread to Central Asia and southern Russia in 2005. No confirmed human cases were reported in Russia. In 2005, the avian flu spread to eight southern regions of Russia, including two regions bordering the Caspian Sea. Russia was efficient in identifying avian influenza and quarantined affected areas. Concerns were raised about Russia's capacity to respond to the virus due to limited resources for public health services. In 2005, Russia implemented WHO recommendations to control avian influenza, but regional officials struggled with the financial burden. Analysts noted a lack of coordination in outbreak responses, prompting President Putin to seek FAO membership for better cooperation in combating epidemics. Thailand has emerged as a leader in combating avian influenza, successfully containing the spread of the virus since the initial outbreak in 2004. The country's poultry industry, a major exporter, has suffered economically due to decreased demand from both domestic and international markets. Despite initial criticism of a slow response, Thai authorities have taken steps to address the issue and promote regional cooperation. During a meeting with Prime Minister Thaksin in September 2005, President Bush praised Thailand for its leadership in fighting avian influenza and pledged further U.S. cooperation. Thai officials have taken steps to contain the virus, with the Department of Livestock Development and Department of Disease Control playing key roles. The National Committee on Avian Influenza Control was established in 2004 to create a national strategy, leading to the extermination of over 40 million birds and deployment of surveillance teams. In December 2005, the Ministry of Public Health announced the production and distribution of oseltamivir (Tamiflu) at subsidized prices. The Government Pharmaceutical Organization (GPO) in Thailand manufactured the first 200,000 generic tablets of Tamiflu in early February 2006 for influenza. Border authorities targeted bird smuggling from Cambodia, and over 11,000 poultry farms met biosecurity standards by mid-2005. Small farms with open-air facilities remain less regulated, unlike China, which bans H5N1 vaccines in poultry. Law enforcement cracked down on illegally imported bird flu vaccines from China due to concerns about virus mutation. Agriculture Ministry established guidelines for poultry farmers after the re-surfacing of the flu in July 2005. The Ministry in Thailand established guidelines for poultry farmers to get permission from local leaders before moving their flocks, with mobile checkpoints set up in affected provinces. Fighting cocks are a main transmitter to humans, and the government compromised with the industry to register birds and stadiums, and control their movement. Thailand also led efforts for regional cooperation on flu containment, proposing a regional vaccine stockpile and an ASEAN animal hygienic fund. The proposed center funded with $300,000 aims to enhance cross-border surveillance and control measures for ASEAN countries. Thailand pledged to contribute 5% of its own antiviral drug supply to a regional stockpile. Thailand and Indonesia agreed to exchange information on influenza prevention and vaccine development. Thailand received funding from FAO to set up laboratories for avian experts. Thailand has been designated by the OIE as the center for avian flu prevention in Asia and has received technical assistance from the EU. It is praised for its successful control measures by the UN and has provided aid and training to neighboring countries in combating H5N1. Thailand has also contributed funds to ACMES member countries for avian flu control. In early January 2006, the WHO confirmed four cases of H5N1 virus in humans in Turkey, with two fatal cases. The virus was believed to be carried by migratory birds from Asia. Turkey took measures to contain the spread, including quarantining affected areas, culling drives, and increased surveillance efforts. Critics accused Turkish authorities of being slow to detect the virus. Turkey has culled nearly 1.5 million birds and detected the bird flu virus in 24 cities. The government has implemented public awareness campaigns, restricted poultry transportation, and banned bird imports from Greece, Iran, and Romania. The WHO is assisting in containment efforts, and the Turkish Health Ministry has stockpiled Tamiflu. Concerns exist about the virus spreading to neighboring countries. The FAO has urged bordering countries to strengthen surveillance mechanisms. The FAO urged bordering countries to strengthen surveillance along the border for signs of avian influenza. Fatal H5N1 cases were confirmed in Iraq and Azerbaijan. Vietnam has reported 93 confirmed human cases, with 42 deaths, since late December 2003. The H5N1 virus is believed to be endemic in Vietnam's waterfowl population, with a total poultry population of around 250 million birds. 60-70% of poultry is raised in backyard farms, and 65% of farm households nationwide raise poultry. Live poultry is sold in local markets and slaughtered at home. In 2005, the Vietnamese government intensified its response to avian influenza by establishing interagency working groups. Local inter-ministerial steering committees were set up within the Vietnamese Communist Party's people's committees. The quality of coordination and capacity of local institutions to handle disease outbreaks have been questioned. The central government in Hanoi is developing a national pandemic preparedness plan. Over 40 million birds have been culled since the first outbreak of avian influenza. In August 2005, Vietnam initiated a mass poultry vaccination program after the first outbreak of avian influenza. By January 2006, over 240 million birds had been vaccinated in two phases. The government signed agreements with the United States and U.N. agencies for joint prevention programs, with conflicting reports on their cooperation with international health workers. The Vietnamese government was praised for its quick response to initial false positive blood tests for the virus in 2005. International health agencies noted cooperation at the APEC Leaders' Meeting in November 2005 to address the threat of a pandemic influenza in the region. The APEC Initiative on Preparing for and Mitigating an Influenza Pandemic was reinforced at the Leaders' Meeting. Regional cooperation has been spurred by fear of massive economic and human costs, with a potential pandemic in Asia estimated to kill three million people and cost close to $300 billion. In May 2006, APEC adopted a five-part Action Plan on the Prevention and Response to Avian and Influenza Pandemics, focusing on multi-sectoral cooperation, risk communications, mitigating negative effects on agriculture and trade, and ensuring business continuity. The APEC Action Plan on Avian Influenza Pandemics focused on multi-sectoral cooperation, risk communication, mitigating negative effects on agriculture and trade, ensuring business continuity, and strengthening regional and international cooperation. A disaster exercise in June 2006 tested communication capabilities during a simulated outbreak, with creative responses noted by Australian officials. ASEAN has established institutional arrangements to improve transnational coordination in combating potential pandemics, including a regional human vaccine stockpile. Implementation details were not specified, but Malaysia announced plans to set up a WHO headquarters for coordination. ASEAN, in partnership with various organizations, announced a grant program to help member nations control avian flu. Japan also pledged support by providing Tamiflu and protective clothing. The East Asia Summit achieved drafting an avian influenza declaration during its inaugural meeting in December 2005. The East Asia Summit (EAS) in Kuala Lumpur in December 2005 focused on Avian Influenza prevention. Leaders committed to transparent communication, information sharing protocols, regional stockpiles of antiviral drugs, and preparedness strategies supported by national legislation."
