    "content": "The text chunk \"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE, FINDINGS, AND PURPOSE.\" is a concise summary of the section's title, findings, and purpose. The Act is titled \"Oak Park Medical Center Property Acquisition\" and Congress finds that the Department of Commerce owns a property in Boulder, Colorado where NIST, NOAA, and NTIA conduct research. The Department decided to move the main site entrance to a more central location. The Department of Commerce plans to move the site entrance and construct a perimeter security fence to enhance security at the Boulder Campus. This will result in the closure of the current access road. A one-acre parcel of land owned by Mr. Bruce Tenenbaum, including the Oak Park Medical Center, will be affected as its only access is through the main entrance to the campus. Upon construction of the perimeter security fence at the Boulder Campus, NIST must provide alternative access to the Oak Park Medical Center per an easement agreement with the owner. Various options have been considered, taking into account costs, security concerns, and patient safety. The owner and medical tenants at the Oak Park Medical Center have not agreed on alternative access. The Government may purchase the Center and merge it with the Boulder Campus. The purpose of this Act is to authorize the purchase of the Center for the Boulder Campus. SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION TO PURCHASE. The Secretary of Commerce is authorized to acquire the Oak Park Medical Center in Boulder, Colorado, determine its fair market value, and negotiate the sale price with the owner. The Secretary of Commerce is authorized to negotiate the acquisition price of the Oak Park Medical Center in Boulder, Colorado with the owner. If an agreement is not reached within 3 years after an appraisal, the Secretary can initiate condemnation proceedings to acquire the Center. Acquired lands and improvements will become part of the Department's activities at its Boulder Campus. The exterior boundary of the Boulder Campus is modified to include non-Federal lands of the Center. Acquired lands will be governed by laws applicable to Department of Commerce lands. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. This Act defines key terms such as Department (Department of Commerce), NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology), NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), NTIA (National Telecommunications Information Administration), and Secretary (Secretary of Commerce)."
