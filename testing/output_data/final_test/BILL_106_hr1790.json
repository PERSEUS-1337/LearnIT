The Act \"Chemical Safety Information and Site Security Act of 1999\" defines key terms and exempts off-site consequence analysis information from the Freedom of Information Act. The distribution of this information is restricted for certain individuals. The Act \"Chemical Safety Information and Site Security Act of 1999\" restricts the distribution of off-site consequence analysis information to State or local government officials for official use only. Requests for this information will be provided in paper form with specific conditions. The Administrator determines the maximum number of sources for off-site consequence analysis information requests. A fee may be charged to cover processing and reproduction costs. The Administrator may provide off-site consequence analysis information in paper form to State or local government officers for official use. State or local government employees can only share this information as permitted by federal guidelines. The Administrator ensures that risk management plans submitted to the EPA are available for public inspection in paper or electronic form during business hours. Electronic forms cannot rank stationary sources based on off-site consequence analysis. The Government Printing Office assists in this process. The Government Printing Office will assist the Administrator in implementing the paragraph by providing necessary funds. The Administrator, after consulting with other agencies, may release off-site consequence analysis information to the public in electronic form without revealing source identities or locations. Only the Administrator can authorize the release of such information in this form. The Administrator may collect and maintain records of individuals seeking access to information under this section only as necessary for EPA's legal purposes. Violators of this subsection may face fines, imprisonment, or both. The President's executive order requires records to be subject to section 552a of title 5, United States Code. State or local government officers can collect and maintain relevant records for legal purposes. The Administrator will issue guidance within 60 days for making off-site consequence analysis information public. The Administrator may consult with other Federal agencies to develop guidance and revise it as needed. The guidance issued is not subject to judicial review, and regulations may be issued instead. The Administrator is authorized to prescribe necessary regulations and delegate powers as deemed necessary. Regulations issued under this subsection are subject to judicial review like regulations under the Clean Air Act. Officers and employees of agents and contractors must use off-site consequence analysis information for official purposes only. State or local government officers and employees are also subject to restrictions and sanctions under this section. An officer or employee of a State or local government can share off-site consequence analysis information with agents and contractors for official use only. They will be subject to the same restrictions and sanctions as government employees. The Administrator has the authority to withhold such information if it poses a risk to human health. The section addresses the endangerment to human health or the environment and the separability of provisions if one is held invalid. The Attorney General may review industry practices on site security and report recommendations to Congress for enhancing security measures."
