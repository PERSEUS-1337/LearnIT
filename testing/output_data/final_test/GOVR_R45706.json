    "content": "The nuclear power industry in the United States is struggling due to high costs, low demand growth, and competition from cheaper energy sources like natural gas and renewables. Several reactors have closed since 2012, with more planned for retirement by 2025. Aging reactors reaching the end of their licenses will lead to more closures in the future. Efforts to build new nuclear units have been hindered by cost overruns and delays, with the Vogtle nuclear plant in Georgia being significantly behind schedule and over budget. The United States nuclear power industry is facing challenges with high costs, low demand growth, and competition from cheaper energy sources. Light water reactors (LWRs) are the main source of nuclear power, but conventional reactors are large and costly. Some in Congress argue for more nuclear power plants to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and provide low-carbon power to areas with limited electricity access. The Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act of 2017 (NEICA) defines \"advanced nuclear reactor\" as a reactor with significant improvements over current models or one using nuclear fusion. It requires the Department of Energy to support advanced reactor development, including studying the need for a versatile fast neutron test reactor. Congress allocated $65 million for R&D to develop the versatile test reactor. The Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act for FY2019 allocated $65 million for R&D to support the development of the versatile test reactor. The Trump Administration has requested an additional $100 million for FY2020. The Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization Act (NEIMA) defines \"advanced nuclear reactor\" and requires the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to develop a regulatory framework for advanced nuclear technologies. Advocates of nuclear power emphasize the importance of a robust domestic nuclear industry for goals such as energy security, grid resilience, and clean air. The promotion of a domestic nuclear manufacturing base and exports, clean air, and geopolitical influence are key goals. The U.S. Navy utilizes nuclear energy for submarines and aircraft carriers, benefiting from a strong domestic nuclear industry. Advanced nuclear reactors offer advantages over conventional LWRs, including safety features, lower waste yields, and increased efficiency. Advanced reactors encompass a wide range of technologies, including next-generation water-cooled reactors, non-water-cooled reactors, and fusion reactors. Some concepts are new, while others have been considered for decades. Not all are optimistic about their safety, affordability, and sustainability. Testing and demonstration are needed to validate claims. Many environmental advocates argue that nuclear power may not be necessary for decarbonization. The U.S. advanced nuclear industry has grown with 35 companies developing advanced reactor technologies. NuScale predicts commercial operation of its first nuclear plant by 2026. This report discusses the history and categories of advanced reactors, federal programs, and current issues. Advanced reactor designs, known as \"Generation IV\" nuclear reactors, aim to improve upon earlier generations in areas such as cost, safety, security, waste management, and versatility. These designs may include features like inherent safety, modular designs, enhanced load-following capabilities, and closed fuel cycles. They are categorized into three primary groups, including Advanced water-cooled reactors. Advanced water-cooled reactors, Non-water-cooled reactors, and Fusion reactors are three primary categories of advanced reactors. A fourth category is small modular reactors (SMRs), defined as reactors with capacities of no more than 300 MW that employ modular construction techniques. Small modular reactors (SMRs) can be transported by truck and installed quickly at remote locations or military bases. They produce 1-20 megawatts of thermal energy and can be used for industrial processes or electricity generation. Advanced reactor concepts vary in technological maturity, with light water-cooled SMRs, high-temperature gas-cooled reactors, and sodium-cooled fast reactors being among the most mature. Molten salt reactors, gas-cooled fast reactors, and fusion reactors are further from commercialization. Small modular reactors (SMRs) are defined as reactors with an electric generating capacity of up to 300 MW, compared to existing U.S. commercial reactors with an average capacity of about 1,000 MW. Expert estimates for commercialization of advanced reactor concepts like molten salt reactors and gas-cooled fast reactors range from the mid-2020s to midcentury or later. Chinese research institutions and a Canadian/U.S. company, Terrestrial Energy, plan to bring a molten salt reactor online in the next decade. SMRs are smaller than traditional reactors, with all major components in a single vessel for factory assembly and transport to the site, reducing construction time and costs. Mass production could further lower costs and shorten schedules. SMRs require less capital investment and offer reduced financial risk to owners. However, the smaller size may limit economies of scale compared to larger reactors. The most mature light water SMR design under development is a 60 MWe reactor module by U.S. company NuScale Power. The design allows for 6 to 12 SMR modules to be co-located in a central pool of water for passive cooling. NuScale plans to operate its first 12-module plant in the mid-2020s at Idaho National Laboratory with federal and non-federal support. The major components of the NuScale plant are factory-fabricated and shipped to the plant site. The NuScale plant components are factory-fabricated and shipped for installation. Companies worldwide are developing light water SMRs, including Holtec, Westinghouse, and GE Hitachi. The supercritical water-cooled reactor (SCWR) uses supercritical water to improve efficiency, reaching up to 44%. Liquid water passes through the core, turning into steam to drive a turbine-generator. Supercritical water-cooled reactors (SCWRs) eliminate the need for reactor coolant pumps and steam separators. They can operate in fast or thermal neutron spectrums, using light or heavy water as coolant. High temperature gas reactors (HTGRs) operate at higher temperatures (700-1,000\u00b0C) for industrial processes like electricity generation and hydrogen production. Organizations in various countries are developing SCWRs and HTGRs. High temperature gas reactors (HTGRs) operate at lower temperatures (700-850\u00b0C) for industrial processes like electricity generation and hydrogen production. Two primary design variants include graphite blocks with embedded fuel particles and billiard ball-sized graphite spheres with embedded fuel particles in a \"pebble bed\" configuration. The fuel is composed of poppy. Many HTGRs have been designed as small modular reactors (SMRs). High temperature gas reactors (HTGRs) are designed with fuel composed of poppy seed-sized particles encased in silicon carbide and other heat-resistant coatings. These reactors, known for their high heat capacity, are able to withstand maximum core heat during accidents without core meltdown or radioactive releases. HTGRs are technologically mature and have been built in various countries since the 1960s, with a new plant under construction in China. The development of HTGRs was supported by the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) program in the United States. The United States promoted the development of High Temperature Gas Reactors (HTGRs) through the NGNP program. X-energy received funding to develop a modular pebble bed HTGR design and is working on fuel technology for HTGR reactors. Other U.S. companies like HolosGen and Hybrid Power Technologies are also developing HTGRs. Gas-cooled fast reactors (GFRs) operate in the fast neutron spectrum without the need for a massive graphite moderator like HTGRs. Gas-cooled fast reactors (GFRs) use a closed U-Pu fuel cycle and operate at high temperatures, making them suitable for industrial heat production and electricity generation. However, they have lower heat removal capability in accidents compared to reactors using liquid metal coolants. A consortium of European countries is working on developing a demonstration GFR called ALLEGRO based on a French design, with a goal of completing the conceptual design by 2025. Sodium-cooled fast reactors (SFRs) are technologically mature nuclear concepts that use liquid sodium as a primary coolant, operating under lower pressure conditions. The high heat-transfer properties of liquid sodium allow for passive cooling through natural circulation, even in emergencies without backup electricity. SFR coolant outlet temperature is 500-550\u00b0C, lower than GFRs, allowing for the use of proven materials. Sodium-cooled fast reactors (SFRs) use liquid sodium as a primary coolant, with two main design variants: loop-type and pool-type. Sodium's reactivity with air and water poses safety concerns, leading to the use of an intermediary coolant to prevent radioactivity release in case of accidents, adding complexity and costs to the system. Sodium leaks have caused shutdowns in several SFRs. Sodium-cooled fast reactors (SFRs) have safety concerns due to fires from sodium leaks. SFR designs aim for a closed fuel cycle for indefinite fuel supply. SFRs can reduce long-term radioactivity in nuclear waste. Around 20 experimental SFRs have been built worldwide since 1951, with the United States prioritizing SFRs in its nuclear R&D program. Lead-cooled fast reactors (LFRs) are designed to use a closed fuel cycle with either molten lead or lead-bismuth eutectic (LBE) alloy as a primary reactor coolant. General Electric-Hitachi's PRISM design is the only SFR to have passed the NRC preapplication review process and has been selected to support the Department of Energy's Versatile Test Reactor program. Several U.S. companies are developing SFRs, including Advanced Reactor Concepts, Columbia Basin Consulting Group, Oklo, and TerraPower. Lead-cooled fast reactors (LFRs) utilize molten lead or lead-bismuth eutectic (LBE) alloy as a primary coolant, offering advantages such as low-pressure operation, passive cooling, and retention of radioactive fission products. However, challenges include lead corrosion at high temperatures, requiring further research for commercialization. Lead-cooled fast reactors (LFRs) face challenges with lead corrosion at high temperatures, requiring technological advances for corrosion-resistance in structural steel components. Lead's opacity and high density pose visibility and monitoring issues, while its high melting point complicates maintaining liquid form for circulation. Russia leads in LFR R&D, with plans for pure LFR facilities and collaboration within the European Union for an Advanced Lead Fast Reactor. Molten salt reactors (MSRs) are being developed globally, with collaborations like Alfred in the EU. Various countries and companies are exploring MSR technologies. MSRs can use molten salts as coolants or fuels, with different designs like salt-cooled MSRs and salt-fueled MSRs. Molten salt fast reactors (MSFRs) show promise for waste reduction and fuel efficiency. Different molten salts can be utilized in MSR designs. MSRs use molten salts for waste reduction and fuel efficiency. Outlet temperatures range from 700-1000\u00b0C, with a safety feature called a \"freeze plug\" for emergencies. Long-term storage of spent MSR fuel is uncertain. MSR technology has been in development for decades. Several countries are developing molten salt reactors (MSRs) for commercialization in the late 2020s. China is working on two prototype MSR microreactors, while Terrestrial Energy in Canada is in the second stage of design review for its integral molten salt reactor (IMSR). Other U.S. companies like Alpha Tech Research Corp., Elysium Industries, Flibe Energy, Kairos Power, TerraPower are also developing MSRs. Fusion reactors from companies like Alpha Tech Research Corp., Elysium Industries, and others aim to produce power by fusing light atomic nuclei. Significant R&D investment, including over $20 billion for the ITER project in France, is focused on achieving fusion power. This technology requires heating light atoms to 100 million degrees to create a plasma for fusion reactions, a major technical challenge addressed through magnetic fields. ITER is a fusion project aiming to achieve \"burning plasma\" by using a powerful magnetic field. Fusion reactions are produced at the laboratory scale, but ignition, where fusion energy sustains plasma heating, has not been achieved yet. ITER plans to produce its first plasma by 2025 and conduct burning plasma experiments by 2035. U.S. companies are also working on commercializing fusion power, which produces no harmful emissions or waste fuel and is meltdown-proof. Investment in fusion technologies by U.S. companies like AGNI Energy, Brillouin Energy, and Lockheed Martin is driven by the goal of developing meltdown-proof fusion power plants. While fusion reactions do not produce radioactive waste, some reactor materials may become radioactive. Tritium, a primary fuel source for fusion, is radioactive but less so than fission products. The cost of electricity generating technologies plays a significant role in investment decisions, with conventional nuclear plants facing challenges in competing with cheaper natural gas and renewables. The success of advanced reactors in competitive electricity markets depends on reducing capital costs and offering competitive electricity prices. High capital costs are a significant barrier to deploying new nuclear plants in the United States due to rigorous safety regulations and specialized construction materials. Capital cost estimates for advanced reactors vary by technology and design, with some designs allowing for greater factory fabrication. Labor and engineering costs dominate conventional nuclear capital costs, while reactor and turbine components make up a smaller percentage. Achieving cost reductions for advanced reactors will require improvements in construction methods. Developers are exploring ways to enhance construction methods for nuclear reactors, with a focus on modularization of structures and components to reduce costs. Modular construction allows for increased factory production of components, leading to savings in onsite labor and specialized knowledge. NuScale, a U.S.-based SMR vendor, has estimated a 10% cost reduction in its proposed SMR plant through modular construction. This approach has shown success in improving construction pace and reducing costs in various industries, including recent nuclear projects in Asia. Reactor developers and advocates emphasize cost reduction potential through simplified designs, standardized components, and smaller sizes. Advanced reactors could lower financing costs with shorter construction times and revenue generation from the first module. Some designs aim to reduce operational costs through automation and improved efficiency. Improved thermal efficiencies and more efficient power conversion technologies are expected to shorten payback periods for advanced reactors. Some advanced reactor designs may not lead to cost reductions due to lower power ratings and fuel enrichment requirements. These designs could also incur higher fuel fabrication costs and require spent fuel reprocessing. Higher security measures may be needed for waste storage. Some research on Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) suggests that their small size may prevent economies of scale, but modularization could balance this with \"economies of multiples.\" While SMRs may be cheaper to construct, the cost per unit of power generated is likely to be higher. Estimating costs for advanced reactors is challenging as many designs are still in early stages with limited cost information available. Academic analyses have produced a range of results on the costs of non-traditional reactors. The cost of electricity production from non-traditional reactors is measured using the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), which considers total construction and operating costs divided by total electricity output. While LCOE is a useful metric for comparison, other factors like construction costs per kilowatt, air emissions costs, and economic competitiveness should also be considered. A standardized analysis of cost projections from eight advanced reactor vendors found varying results. The average projected LCOE for \"nth-of-a-kind\" (NOAK) advanced reactors is $60/MWh, while a separate study projected LCOEs in the range of $110 to $120/MWh. Comparatively, competing electricity sources have estimated LCOEs per MWh as follows: large LWRs, $112-$183; coal, $60-$143; natural gas combined cycle, $42-$78; wind, $30-$60; utility-scale solar, $43-$53. Advanced reactor designs vary in size from less than 15 MWe to 1,500 MWe or more, with optimal size influenced by design characteristics or customer/site needs. Unconventional reactor concepts share commonalities. Small modular reactors (SMRs) are gaining popularity due to their small size and modular construction techniques. These reactors, with a capacity of 300 MWe and below, can be easily transported to the plant site and offer customization based on customer needs. SMRs, including microreactors under 20 MW, have the potential to expand nuclear energy applications to a wider range of sites and industries. Multiple reactor modules allow for size customization based on customer needs or site characteristics. Safety in nuclear energy involves minimizing the risk of radioactivity release into the environment. Advanced reactor systems may have safety advantages or disadvantages due to their size, design, and chemical properties. Operational safety of these systems is not yet established, requiring testing and demonstration. Conventional nuclear plants use multiple safety systems, while advanced reactors may rely on different mechanisms. Advanced nuclear reactors incorporate passive safety systems that self-regulate fission rates and provide core cooling without relying on electricity. The use of advanced coolants, fuels, and moderators enhances inherent safety by offering higher boiling points, heat capacities, and retention of radioactive fission products. Advanced reactors, like liquid metal-cooled ones, operate at atmospheric pressure, reducing stress on components. Small reactors, including SMRs and microreactors, are seen as safer due to lower radioactive material volume and potential for streamlined approval processes. Their smaller size allows for innovative siting options like underground or at sea. Some advanced reactors may have safety advantages but also pose concerns due to chemical properties of coolants. Examples include reactivity, toxicity, and corrosiveness of sodium, lead, and molten salts. Molten salt-cooled reactors raise safety concerns for plant workers due to higher radioactivity levels in the coolant. Opaque coolants present challenges for core monitoring compared to transparent ones like water. Fuel technologies and accident-tolerant features are also utilized in advanced and conventional reactors. Near-term accident-tolerant fuels (ATFs) like coated zirconium cladding and iron-chrome-aluminum-based cladding could be available by the mid-2020s. Longer-term ATF concepts such as metallic fuels and silicon carbide cladding require more testing before licensing. Nuclear fuels like uranium and plutonium can be used for peaceful energy purposes but also pose a risk of weapons proliferation. Advanced reactor designs offer advantages and disadvantages regarding nuclear weapons proliferation. Advocates believe these designs are more resistant to proliferation due to factors like sealed core designs, infrequent refueling, smaller inventories of fissile materials, and remote monitoring capabilities. Some designs produce less attractive waste for weapons proliferation. However, advanced reactors may pose unique inspection and monitoring challenges according to the International Atomic Energy Agency. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) report highlighted challenges in monitoring advanced reactors, such as the opacity of certain coolants like sodium, lead, and molten salts. This makes it harder to ensure nuclear materials are not diverted. Advanced reactor technologies like transportable reactors, pebble-bed design HTGRs, and molten salt reactors present unique safeguarding challenges. Proliferation resistance and ease of verification are not interchangeable, according to the report. Some Generation-IV reactors use highly enriched fuels, posing nonproliferation challenges. Fuel enrichment levels of 5% to 20% or higher could allow for easier production of nuclear weapons. Enriching uranium to weapons-grade levels becomes easier with higher initial enrichment levels. Certain reactor designs also produce spent fuel with isotopes desirable for weapons production, making them more susceptible to diversion. The need for additional security measures to safeguard nuclear materials throughout the supply chain, including during fuel fabrication, transit, and reprocessing, is crucial. Advanced reactors may require reprocessing of spent fuel to extract fissile materials, making them vulnerable to theft for weapons production. France, Japan, and the United Kingdom have been involved in civilian nuclear fuel reprocessing for years, accumulating materials that could be used for weapons production. The United States has accumulated over 290 metric tons of separated plutonium from civilian nuclear fuel reprocessing. Security risks are low for existing nuclear power plants in the US due to safeguards in place. The lack of reprocessing facilities in the US is seen as a policy advantage. Many advanced nuclear power plant designs, including small modular reactors (SMRs) and microreactors, offer potential benefits such as increased safety and flexibility in power generation. SMRs can be easily adjusted in size to meet specific power and heating needs, making them suitable for various applications in remote areas or for industrial use. The Department of Defense (DOD) is interested in using SMRs to power remote bases like the Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska. The John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 directs DOE to pilot at least one microreactor at a military or DOE site by 2027. DOD issued a request for information on microreactor designs in January 2019. A recent MIT study highlighted that small size alone may not give advanced reactors a market edge due to high costs per unit power. The focus on smaller reactor sizes will only be beneficial if the per-unit capital cost is significantly reduced. Advanced nuclear reactors operating at higher temperatures could tap into the market for industrial process heat, with potential to supply 17%-19% of the U.S. market. Advanced reactors (150-300 MWt) have potential applications in providing process heat for various industries. However, they may face barriers due to competition from natural gas plants. The radioactivity of nuclear waste presents unique challenges for waste management and facility contamination. Radioactivity builds up in a nuclear reactor through the accumulation of fission products and actinides. The radioactivity of nuclear waste poses long-term health hazards due to fission products and actinides. The U.S. inventory of spent nuclear fuel is projected to increase to 138,000 MTU by 2050, with no long-term repository currently licensed. Newly discharged waste is stored onsite at nuclear plant locations. Unconventional reactors, such as fast reactors, offer advantages in managing nuclear waste by effectively destroying actinides, reducing long-term health risks associated with radioactive hazards. However, some fission products in nuclear waste remain hazardous for hundreds of thousands of years, which may not be significantly reduced by unconventional reactors. Some advanced reactors may not significantly reduce hazardous fission products in nuclear waste. Adoption of these reactors may not eliminate the need for a long-term waste repository. New fuel forms used in advanced reactors can pose challenges in waste management and disposal. Research on safe waste management is crucial for commercializing these technologies. Environmental impacts of any power source must consider air emissions, water discharges, and waste challenges. The environmental impacts of nuclear power, particularly air emissions and waste management challenges, are key considerations throughout the technology's life cycle. While current LWR nuclear technologies are well-studied, advanced reactor technologies aim to reduce these impacts. Evaluation of newer technologies is necessary to determine if they are more or less impactful than current ones, and if they introduce new challenges. Nuclear energy is a low-carbon electricity source with no direct emissions. The nuclear energy industry is a low-carbon source of electricity, with support industries and no direct emissions from the fission process. However, historical reliance on fossil fuel-powered plants for energy supply has impacted the industry's carbon footprint. Current uranium enrichment plants use less electricity and are less reliant on coal-fired generation. The study compared greenhouse gas emissions of nuclear power to renewable energy and fossil fuels, showing nuclear power has low emissions. Advanced reactor technologies could address cost, safety, and waste issues, potentially expanding nuclear power's role in reducing greenhouse gases. Some argue for improving existing light water reactors for more effective decarbonization. Advanced reactor technologies could reduce long-term radioactivity of nuclear waste and improve waste forms. Higher thermal efficiency in plants can decrease heat rejection into the environment, reducing ecosystem impacts. This includes significant reductions in water usage for waste heat rejection and less heat absorbed by adjacent water bodies. The Department of Energy supports advanced nuclear technologies through R&D programs in the Office of Nuclear Energy and the Office of Science. These programs received 23% of energy R&D funding in FY2019, surpassing funding for existing nuclear, renewables, or fossil energy. ARPA-E also funds early stage R&D for advanced nuclear projects. The Office of Nuclear Energy focuses on existing nuclear fleet, advanced reactor concepts, and fuel cycle technologies. The Department of Energy's Office of Nuclear Energy primarily supports nuclear fission technologies and has set a goal for advanced reactor development by the early 2030s. Analysts suggest higher funding levels are needed for DOE to support advanced reactor R&D beyond the initial stages. In FY2019, Congress allocated $753 million for nuclear R&D, with $319.5 million specifically designated for advanced nuclear technology R&D. In FY2019, Congress allocated $319.5 million for advanced nuclear technology R&D programs, including Super-critical Transformational Electric Power, Advanced Small Modular Reactor, Advanced Reactor Technologies, Versatile Fast Test Reactor, and Material Recovery and Waste Form Development. Development: $38 million allocated for activities related to improving the nuclear cycle, with $27 million specifically for advanced nuclear technologies. NE's NEET program supports research for existing and advanced nuclear technologies, including DOE's GAIN initiative for industry funding and access to national labs. The GAIN industry funding opportunities include the U.S. Industry Opportunities for Advanced Nuclear Technology Development, a five-year funding program offering cost-sharing for advanced reactor development. The Nuclear Energy Voucher Program provides industry awardees access to DOE nuclear expertise through vouchers redeemable for research and technical support at national laboratories. Recipients must provide a 20% cost-share. The GAIN program has distributed $10.7 million worth of vouchers to 22 companies. NE has supported the review and licensing of advanced reactors by NRC. The NE SMR Licensing Technical Support program provided cost-sharing for NRC design certification and licensing. DOE's Office of Science funds nuclear fusion technologies with $432 million in FY2019. In 2017, ARPA-E announced a funding opportunity for advanced nuclear plant designs. MEITNER awarded $24 million for 10 projects in June 2018. ARPA-E granted $12 million for five nuclear projects in December 2018. DOE's EM provides waste management services for advanced reactor R&D activities. DOE's EM manages spent nuclear fuel from the Advanced Test Reactor at the Idaho National Laboratory and funds environmental remediation for advanced reactor facilities like the Energy Technology Engineering Center and the Hanford site. EM has conducted decontamination and decommissioning activities at the Fast Flux Test Facility at Hanford since 1992. The Energy Department's EM managed a liquid-metal-cooled nuclear research and test reactor for 10 years to develop advanced fuels and materials. EM also funds overhead operations for facilities conducting advanced reactor R&D, including infrastructure maintenance, safeguards, and security. The appropriate level of federal support for technology development is a key question in the national R&D policy debate. The debate over R&D policy for nuclear energy technology development includes research on fuels, materials, reactor concepts, testing, licensing, demonstration, and commercialization. Early stages involve lab work and simulation, while later stages focus on specific designs and construction of power plants costing billions. The Trump Administration advocates federal support for early-stage research. The Trump Administration advocates federal support for early-stage research in nuclear energy technology development, focusing on lab work and simulation. Federal funding should not be allocated for late-stage or near commercial ready technology, as market forces should determine the success of technologies in the marketplace. The conferees on FY2019 DOE appropriations did not adopt the Administration's proposed focus on early-stage research, directing the Department to maintain a diverse portfolio of research activities. Supporters argue that federal support is necessary for new technologies to survive the \"valley of death\" and attract private-sector funding for later development phases. Obtaining funding for risky demonstration projects is a significant challenge. According to former DOE Under Secretary John Deutch, energy innovation is hindered by the lack of successful implementation. World electricity generation is expected to increase by 50% from 2015 to 2040, with fossil fuels still making up 55% of total generation if current trends continue. Proponents of advanced nuclear power believe it can address safety, cost, waste, proliferation, and supply concerns, making it essential for meeting growing electricity demand without greenhouse gas emissions. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology study highlights the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while meeting the increasing demand for electricity. It suggests that lower-cost nuclear generation could minimize the cost of worldwide greenhouse gas reductions, although this is disputed by some groups advocating for renewable energy sources like wind, solar, and geothermal. Greenpeace states that these renewable sources could provide the majority of U.S. energy needs. Some environmental groups argue against nuclear power due to safety and environmental risks, stating that it is not environmentally friendly and creates different problems than fossil fuels. Germany's \"Energiewende\" policy aims to reduce carbon emissions through renewable energy and efficiency while phasing out nuclear power by 2050. The German government aims to reduce carbon emissions by phasing out nuclear power by 2050 and increasing renewable energy use. Studies suggest that renewable energy could supply a significant portion of electricity generation by 2050, with nuclear, coal, and gas filling the remaining gap. Nuclear power plants are mainly located east of the Mississippi River for economic reasons. Supporters are pushing for the construction of a fast spectrum Versatile Test Reactor (VTR) by the DOE to develop nuclear fuels and materials for advanced reactors. A new test reactor with advanced capabilities is needed to revive the U.S. nuclear industry. Currently, there are limited capabilities for testing fast neutron reactor technology worldwide, with none in the U.S. DOE is required to plan and develop a \"versatile reactor-based fast neutron source\" by the end of 2025. The Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities Act of 2017 (NEICA) authorized the development of a versatile reactor-based fast neutron source by the end of 2025. The Nuclear Energy Leadership Act (NELA) in the 116th Congress would provide funding for the facility. Energy Secretary Rick Perry launched the VTR project in February 2019, with additional funding requested by the Trump Administration for FY2020. GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy was awarded a contract to help develop the conceptual design and cost estimate for the VTR. The VTR project, based on the PRISM sodium-cooled fast reactor design, aims to be operational by October 2026 with an estimated cost of $3-3.5 billion. The Nuclear Energy Research Infrastructure Act of 2018 would have provided $1.99 billion for the project. Concerns have been raised about the potential user base justifying the construction and operating costs. Some advanced nuclear reactor developers doubt the VTR will start operating before their designs are finished. Concerns include the need for new facilities to fabricate fuel, handling and disposing of spent fuel, and opposition to using plutonium-based fuel due to nuclear weapons concerns. Proposals to allow privately funded experimental reactors at DOE national laboratories have been included in recent Congresses. Supporters believe reactor developers could benefit from DOE expertise and facilities. Safety oversight of private-sector experimental reactors is a consideration. DOE may oversee private-sector experimental reactors at national labs without NRC licensing. NEICA requires NRC licenses for reactors demonstrating commercial viability. DOE's NRIC program allows private sector-funded testing at DOE sites. DOE collaborates with NRC on advanced reactor technologies. Agreement with UAMPS for potential NuScale SMR plant at INL. Under an agreement with UAMPS, potential locations are being identified at the INL site for the construction of a NuScale SMR plant. The NuScale SMR is undergoing NRC review for design certification, expected after 2020. DOE previously announced agreements with companies for SMR deployment plans at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina. Funding for reactor testing and demonstration projects may come from NEICA. The NEICA bill requires DOE to report to Congress on costs and issues related to hosting reactor testing and demonstration projects funded by the private sector. This includes safety review, potential sites for advanced reactors, contractual mechanisms, and waste management. The construction of demonstration reactors is a crucial step in nuclear technology commercialization, with costs expected to be several billion dollars each. The VTR, a test reactor and demonstration of GE's PRISM, is mentioned. The VTR, serving as a test reactor for GE's PRISM reactor, is estimated to cost up to $3.5 billion. The first 12-module NuScale plant is estimated at $3 billion. Bringing new reactor technology to market could take up to 30 years and cost $15 billion. Most U.S. advanced reactor companies lack necessary funding for commercial-scale demonstration. DOE has options to support demonstration reactor construction and commercialization. The DOE can conduct technology demonstration projects on a cost-shared basis under the Energy Policy Act of 2005. At least 50% of costs must come from non-federal sources, with the possibility of reducing the non-federal share based on technological risk. Repayment of the federal contribution is not required. Federal cost sharing can cover construction, licensing, design work, and engineering. Research facilities like the VTR may be funded through congressional appropriations, with users paying for research. The VTR would demonstrate PRISM technology on a smaller scale than the commercial version. The DOE can conduct technology demonstration projects on a cost-shared basis under the Energy Policy Act of 2005. The federal government can purchase power generated by demonstration reactors and pay for research use. For the proposed NuScale demonstration, DOE announced a memorandum of understanding with UAMPS. DOE can issue loan guarantees to build advanced nuclear reactors. The DOE has $8.8 billion in loan guarantee authority for advanced nuclear energy projects. Projects must be financially viable and pay a subsidy cost upfront. Title XVII loan guarantees cannot be given to projects using federal funds other than federally guaranteed funding. $12 billion in loan guarantees were awarded for two new reactors at the Vogtle nuclear power plant in Georgia. Advanced nuclear power plants are eligible for a federal tax credit of 1.8 cents per kilowatt-hour of electricity generated. The nuclear production tax credits, extended by P.L. 115-123, have no expiration date but are limited to 6,000 MW of capacity with a cap of $125 million per year per 1,000 MW for eight years. These tax credits could aid nuclear demonstration projects in securing financing and reducing the subsidy cost of DOE loan guarantees. A methodology for selecting projects and technologies to support may be necessary due to limited federal funding for large-scale nuclear projects. Market-based selection criteria, such as evidence of a customer base, could be part of the selection process for demonstration reactor support. The selection criteria for nuclear demonstration projects may include evidence of a customer base, private matching funds raised, technology maturity level, and financial and technical strength of the project sponsor. The U.S. nuclear industry has raised concerns about the burdensome and inflexible NRC procedures for reviewing and licensing new nuclear reactors. The U.S. nuclear industry has raised concerns about NRC procedures for licensing new reactors. Industry groups advocate for a technology-neutral regulatory framework to accommodate advanced reactors. NEIMA includes provisions for advanced reactor licensing, such as staged licensing for commercial reactors. This process allows applicants to gain approval for each step, like conceptual design assessment. The step-wise pre-licensing design review processes in Canada and the UK provide earlier opportunities for reactor vendors to demonstrate the licensability of their designs. NEIMA requires NRC to develop procedures for using licensing project plans, agreements between the agency and applicants to support resource planning. NRC must also increase the use of risk-informed and performance-based licensing evaluation techniques within the existing regulatory framework. The Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization Act (NEIMA) requires the NRC to develop a technology-inclusive regulatory framework for advanced reactor applicants. NRC is focusing on light water reactors but is preparing for potential licensing of advanced reactors. New nuclear fuels are also regulated by the NRC, with a process that can take up to six years. Transporting new fuel forms may require additional innovation and regulation. The nuclear industry faces obstacles in deploying advanced reactors due to high NRC fees for reviewing designs and license applications. NEICA allows DOE to grant funds to cover some NRC fees for license applicants. Federal agency power purchase agreements could improve financial feasibility for advanced reactor projects by providing a revenue stream and reducing financing costs. Additionally, offering above-market prices for power could encourage commercialization of nuclear technologies. Proposals in NELA aim to extend power purchase agreements (PPAs) for up to 40 years to support nuclear reactor construction costs recovery. The General Services Administration (GSA) could enter into PPAs, allowing the federal government to buy electricity from public utilities. This extension is intended to facilitate the commercialization of nuclear technologies. NELA Section 3 aims to extend power purchase agreements (PPAs) for up to 40 years to support nuclear reactor construction costs recovery. The DOE would be required to enter into at least one PPA to purchase power from a commercial nuclear reactor by the end of 2023, with special consideration given to first-of-a-kind or early deployment nuclear technologies for national security facilities. PPAs with currently operating commercial nuclear plants would not qualify for above-market rates, and federal PPAs are subject to cancellation if sufficient funds are not appropriated. The Western Area Power Administration (WAPA) has the authority to sign power sale contracts for up to 40 years, which could facilitate power purchase agreements (PPAs) for demonstration reactors at Idaho National Laboratory (INL) or elsewhere in the WAPA service area. This could involve WAPA entering into an interagency agreement with a military base in California to award a 40-year PPA to a demonstration reactor at INL. Many advanced reactors may use fuels that are not currently commercially available. Many advanced reactors may require fuels that are not currently available commercially, such as higher-enriched uranium fuel and new fuel types under development. Without investment in fuel processing capabilities, there may be a shortage of next-generation fuels to support advanced reactor deployment. Concerns exist about the availability of high-assay low enriched uranium (HALEU), enriched between 5% and 20%, which is necessary for many advanced nuclear reactors. The Nuclear Energy Leadership Act (NELA) aims to provide high-assay low enriched uranium (HALEU) for advanced nuclear reactors. DOE is required to make at least 2 metric tons of HALEU available by the end of 2022 and a total of 10 metric tons by the end of 2025. $20 million has been allocated for HALEU development and testing, with DOE exploring using existing HALEU stored at INL for fuel fabrication. The DOE plans to sign a contract with Centrus Energy to build centrifuges for uranium enrichment. The Nuclear Energy Institute estimates it would take seven years to establish infrastructure for commercial fuel supply. Downblending high enriched uranium is proposed to bridge the gap. 32 GWe of advanced reactor capacity is needed for economic viability. IFNEC ensures efficient and high-standard use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. IFNEC, formed in 2010, promotes efficient and safe nuclear energy use. It has 34 participant countries and focuses on nuclear infrastructure, fuel services, and supply chains. The Generation IV International Forum (GIF) collaborates on developing next-gen nuclear systems with nine original members. The Generation IV International Forum (GIF) collaborates on developing next-gen nuclear systems with nine original members, including South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Switzerland, the European Union, China, Russia, and Australia later joined. In 2002, the GIF identified 6 nuclear energy systems for further development known as Generation IV reactors, which include Gas-Cooled Fast Reactor, Lead-Cooled Fast Reactor, Molten Salt Reactor, Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactor, Supercritical Water-Cooled Reactor, and Very High Temperature Reactor. Commercialization of some technologies may occur by 2030, with demonstrations possible within the next decade. Each technology is at a different level of technical maturity. Gas-cooled fast reactors, lead-cooled fast reactors, and molten salt reactors are not expected to reach commercialization until 2050 under current rates of development."
