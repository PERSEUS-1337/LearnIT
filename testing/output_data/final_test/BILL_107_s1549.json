The \"Technology Talent Act of 2001\" highlights the importance of a technically trained workforce in driving economic growth through technological innovation. Studies show that science, engineering, and technology are crucial for creating new goods, services, jobs, and capital. The Act emphasizes the need for a highly trained workforce in these fields to support innovation and economic growth. The number of undergraduate degrees in science, mathematics, engineering, and technology has been stagnant or decreasing since 1987, despite a rise in enrollment. The demand for H-1B visas has increased, indicating a shortage of scientists and engineers in the United States compared to other countries. Technological and scientific advancements have the potential to improve the quality of life and standard of living in the country. The importance of maintaining a technically trained workforce to support advancements in science and engineering is crucial for the United States' prosperity and national security. Definitions in the Act include terms like \"community college\" and \"Director\" referring to specific entities within the National Science Foundation. The National Science Foundation defines \"institution of higher education\" as per the Higher Education Act of 1965. SEC. 3. DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM AUTHORIZED. The Director can award grants to institutions of higher education for increasing the number of students in science, mathematics, engineering, or technology programs. Grants must be awarded for a 3-year period, contingent on satisfactory progress. At least 10 grants must be awarded each year. Institutions of higher education can receive grants to increase students in STEM programs. Grants are awarded for 3 years with at least 10 grants annually. Principal investigators must be in an administrative role, and subsequent grants can be applied for to continue progress towards program goals. The institution must propose specific increases in the number of students obtaining bachelor's degrees in STEM fields to receive a grant under this Act. The Director will review grant applications through a peer review process and give priority to institutions that increase the number of students obtaining associate and bachelor's degrees in STEM fields. The National Science Foundation Science and Engineering Talent Expansion Center aims to increase the number of students obtaining degrees in STEM fields, particularly in areas with industry needs or declining graduates. The institution awarded a grant under this Act will be known as a \"National Science Foundation Science and Engineering Talent Expansion Center\". The policy elements outlined in Section 4 focus on the goals and objectives of the National Science Foundation Science and Engineering Talent Expansion Center. The Director will consider supporting programs to increase underrepresented students in STEM fields, enhance institutions' capacity in science and technology education, and provide bridge programs for students needing extra preparation in STEM disciplines. Programs in STEM education focus on underrepresented groups, interdisciplinary approaches, quality of student learning, high-caliber teaching, and new pedagogical strategies. This includes enabling faculty to spend more time teaching in smaller class settings and developing web-based course strategies. Programs in STEM education focus on underrepresented groups, interdisciplinary approaches, quality of student learning, high-caliber teaching, and new pedagogical strategies. This includes facilitating student exposure to potential careers through internships, part-time employment in industry, and industry or government-sponsored research opportunities. Additionally, programs assist institutions of higher education in states participating in the Experimental Program. Programs in STEM education under EPSCoR aim to broaden the student base in science, engineering, mathematics, and technology fields. This includes encouraging undergraduate research, providing financial incentives for students, leveraging federal investment with matching funds, and exploring innovative approaches to achieve program goals. SEC. 5. EVALUATION AND DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION. The Director, in consultation with the advisory committee, evaluates institutions of higher education annually to track progress in increasing students obtaining degrees in science, mathematics, engineering, or technology. Additionally, the Director awards a grant to an evaluative organization to develop metrics for effective program approaches. Information on program activities and results is disseminated to participating institutions yearly. The program under this Act assists institutions of higher education in increasing students obtaining degrees in science, mathematics, engineering, or technology. SEC. 6. REPORTS. The Director will develop a list of existing efforts related to the program, submit an interim progress report after two years, and a final report in 2007 evaluating program features and the number of degrees granted. The Director will provide information on the number of degrees granted to students under the Act, as well as details on graduates pursuing graduate degrees and other career paths. The Director will establish an advisory committee with industry and academic leaders to assist in the grant program under the Act. The committee will help secure industry and government participation, recommend innovative approaches, and provide feedback on program metrics and progress. Authorization of appropriations and funding is also addressed. Authorization of appropriations for the National Science Foundation under the Act includes $25,000,000 for fiscal year 2002 and necessary sums for subsequent years. Additionally, funds from the Director under the Immigration and Nationality Act can be used for this purpose."
