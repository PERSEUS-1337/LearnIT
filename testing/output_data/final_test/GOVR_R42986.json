    "content": "Recent advancements in natural gas production, including hydraulic fracturing and directional drilling, have made the United States the largest producer of natural gas in the world. The U.S. Energy Information Administration projects that natural gas will make up nearly 39% of U.S. energy production by 2050. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) predicts that natural gas will make up almost 39% of U.S. energy production by 2050, driven by shale gas and tight oil plays. Exploiting new unconventional resources could reshape energy policy, geopolitics, and emissions trends. Advocates cite natural gas as a domestically available, cleaner-burning \"bridge\" fuel to a less polluting economy. Natural gas emits less CO2 than coal and oil in electric utility plants, with no mercury, minimal particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides. Pollution control in natural gas systems has received less attention, but concerns have arisen with increased production from unconventional resources, focusing on water quality, land use changes, and environmental impacts. The rise of grassroots movements and political opposition against hydraulic fracturing in unconventional reservoirs has led to calls for regulatory actions and bans at various levels. Natural gas development in the United States is regulated by a complex system of local, state, and federal laws, with state and local authorities primarily responsible for oversight. Regulatory agencies in each state oversee the permitting and operation of wells. Regulatory agencies oversee permitting, design, operation, and abandonment of wells for environmental compliance. State laws address water management, air emissions, wildlife impacts, and worker safety. Federal statutes regulate pollution control in natural gas systems, implemented by state and local authorities. For example, the Clean Water Act regulates surface water discharges and contaminated stormwater runoff. The Safe Drinking Water Act regulates underground injection of wastewater and fluids used in hydraulic fracturing. The Clean Air Act addresses air emissions. The Clean Air Act limits emissions from engines, gas processing equipment, and natural gas activities. Natural gas is a fossil fuel used for energy and chemical products. It is extracted through drilling and processing by the oil and gas industry. The oil and gas industry is involved in drilling and extraction activities for crude oil and natural gas. The industry is divided into four sectors: crude oil and natural gas production, natural gas processing, transmission and storage, and distribution. This report focuses on the production sector and discusses operations, emissions, and regulations related to natural gas systems. Natural gas is mainly composed of methane and other low molecular-weight hydrocarbon compounds. Natural gas, primarily methane (CH4), may also contain ethane, propane, butane, and other hydrocarbons. These nonmethane hydrocarbons can include VOCs, ground-level ozone precursors, and hazardous air pollutants. Nonhydrocarbon gases like CO2, helium, hydrogen sulfide, nitrogen, and water vapor may also be present. The composition of raw natural gas varies, with \"dry\" gas being mostly methane and \"wet\" gas containing heavier hydrocarbons, nonhydrocarbon gases, and water vapor. Natural gas mixtures can vary in composition, with \"wet\" gas containing heavier hydrocarbons, nonhydrocarbon gases, and water vapor. VOCs, HAPs, and H2S levels can differ depending on the resource reservoir, with higher H2S percentages leading to \"sour\" or \"acid\" gas. Emissions from natural gas systems are categorized as fugitive, combusted, and associated, with fugitive emissions being released during industry operations either intentionally or unintentionally. Fugitive emissions can be intentional or unintentional releases from natural gas systems, containing air pollutants like methane, VOCs, and HAPs. Combusted emissions result from burning natural gas for safety or industry operations. The combustion of natural gas releases various air pollutants like CO2, CO, NOx, SO2, and PM. Associated emissions come from secondary sources in natural gas systems, contributing to air pollution. The focus is on fugitive and combusted natural gas emissions, with associated sources also playing a role. The report focuses on air quality issues related to natural gas emissions during production operations in the crude oil and natural gas sector. Various activities and equipment in natural gas systems have the potential to emit air pollutants, making this sector unique from others. Operations include well drilling, hydraulic fracturing, and well completion activities. During production operations in the crude oil and natural gas sector, emissions of fugitive gas can be released from various activities and equipment, including well drilling, hydraulic fracturing, and well completion activities. These emissions may contain VOCs, H 2 S, HAPs, and other pollutants found within the reservoirs. The types and quantities of emissions depend on how wastes are managed, such as venting, flaring, or separation. The production sector's air emissions concern leaks from equipment, pipelines, and combustion exhaust. Recently, drilling, hydraulic fracturing, and processing operations have also raised worries. Natural gas processing plants can release significant air pollutants from combustion engines and fugitive VOC, SO2, and HAPs emissions. The transmission, storage, and distribution sectors of natural gas systems involve the movement of processed gas through pipelines, compressors, storage facilities, and metering stations. Fugitive releases of gas in this sector can be a significant source of emissions, including VOCs, H2S, and HAPs. The natural gas sector emits methane, VOCs, NOx, SO2, and various forms of HAPs. Methane is a significant component and precursor to ground-level ozone formation. EPA estimates methane emissions from natural gas systems to be 6,541 gigagrams in 2016. In 2016, natural gas systems emitted 6,541 gigagrams of methane, equivalent to 339.6 billion standard cubic feet. This accounted for 2.5% of all greenhouse gas emissions in the United States and represented nearly 25% of total methane emissions from domestic sources. Natural gas systems are the second-largest contributor to U.S. anthropogenic methane emissions and a significant source of VOC emissions, making up around 20% of man-made VOC emissions nationwide. Natural gas operations emit VOCs, NOx, and sunlight, leading to ozone formation. NOx is a significant emission from natural gas sites due to combustion activities. It contributes to respiratory ailments and ozone formation. Exposure to NOx and SO2 from natural gas operations is linked to respiratory ailments. Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs), such as VOCs, n-hexane, and BTEX compounds, are emitted from natural gas systems and can cause serious health effects. Additionally, high levels of H2S may be present in some natural gas reservoirs. The report summarizes actions taken by EPA, BLM, and PHMSA to control air emissions in the natural gas industry. The Clean Air Act aims to protect human health and the environment from outdoor air pollution by setting national standards for emissions. EPA has listed \"Crude Oil and Natural Gas Production\" and \"Natural Gas Transmission and Storage\" as source categories for emissions control. The Clean Air Act delegates responsibility to states for compliance with air quality standards, with EPA overseeing implementation. NAAQS are set for pollutants like SO2, PM, NO2, CO, ozone, and lead. States must monitor and control these pollutants through specified plans. States must implement air pollution control plans to monitor pollutants and ensure NAAQS are met. Additional measures are required in nonattainment areas. EPA regulates emission standards for new sources that may endanger public health. EPA has established NSPS based on the best system of emission reduction. Under the Obama Administration in 2012, EPA implemented new standards for controlling VOC and SO2 emissions from various sources in the oil and gas industry. These standards require a 95% reduction in VOC emissions from new hydraulically fractured gas wells through the use of \"reduced emissions completions\" (RECs). The EPA implemented new standards in 2012 for controlling VOC and SO2 emissions in the oil and gas industry, requiring a 95% reduction in VOC emissions from new fractured gas wells using \"reduced emissions completions\" (RECs). The rules also mandate certain equipment to achieve at least a 95% reduction in VOC emissions. Amendments made in 2014 included defining the \"flowback period,\" changes to storage vessel provisions, and removing an affirmative defense provision. The EPA promulgated updates to the 2012 standards for methane and VOC emissions from oil and gas sources in 2016, setting controls for methane emissions and extending controls for VOC emissions to include various equipment at new or modified oil wells, compressor stations, and processing plants. The rule also includes an Information Collection Request for companies to provide data to develop regulations to reduce methane emissions. The EPA finalized Control Techniques Guidelines for the oil and natural gas sector to reduce VOC emissions in ozone nonattainment areas. President Trump signed Executive Order 13783 to review regulations burdening domestic energy production, including methane standards. EPA withdrew the Information Collection Request for methane emissions on March 2, 2017. On June 5, 2017, EPA delayed certain requirements of the 2016 NSPS for 90 days. The U.S. Court of Appeals later vacated EPA's 90-day stay on July 3, 2017. EPA then proposed a two-year rulemaking process on June 16, 2017. On March 12, 2018, EPA made two revisions to the 2016 NSPS, removing the requirement for repairing leaking components during unplanned shutdowns and introducing separate monitoring rules for Alaskan North Slope well sites. Additionally, EPA proposed amendments on October 15, 2018, including changes to fugitive emissions, pneumatic pump, and professional engineer certification requirements. The proposed amendments aim to decrease monitoring frequency for fugitive emissions, shorten repair schedules, expand technical infeasibility provision for pneumatic pumps, and amend professional engineer certification requirements. The EPA continues to address policy issues in the oil and gas sector, with a separate proposal planned for greenhouse gas regulation. The comment period for the amendments closes on December 17, 2018. EPA is required by Section 112 of the CAA to establish National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs) for both new and existing sources. The EPA proposed amendments to NESHAPs for hazardous air pollutants in the oil and gas sector, focusing on emission standards for BTEX compounds, carbonyl sulfide, and n-hexane. The standards include provisions for major and area sources, such as storage vessels, equipment leaks, and dehydrators. The aim is to establish technology-based standards, including maximum achievable control technology (MACT) requirements. The air standards promulgated on August 16, 2012, revise NESHAPs to establish MACT standards for \"small\" dehydrators, strengthen leak detection requirements, and retain existing NESHAPs for storage vessels. The CAA Amendments of 1990 added Title V, requiring major sources of air pollution to obtain operating permits, delegated to state and local authorities. Sources subject to permit requirements generally emit 10 to 250 tons per year, depending on the pollutant and area's attainment status. Gas processing facilities are usually not classified as major sources, but EPA rules clarify definitions for major sources in the oil and gas sector. The Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases Rule requires annual reporting for facilities in the sector to inform the Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions. Under the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, BLM is authorized to set standards to conserve federal mineral resources, including preventing waste of oil or gas. BLM's \"Waste Prevention, Production Subject to Royalties, and Resource Conservation\" rule targets natural gas emissions to reduce waste on federal and Indian lands. The BLM rule aims to reduce waste of gas on federal and Indian lands by setting criteria for when flared gas qualifies as waste subject to royalties. The House passed a resolution to repeal the rule, but the Senate rejected it. The Trump Administration delayed compliance dates for certain requirements of the rule. The BLM rule aims to reduce waste of gas on federal and Indian lands by setting criteria for when flared gas qualifies as waste subject to royalties. The Trump Administration delayed compliance dates for certain requirements of the rule, which led to legal challenges from California, New Mexico, environmental groups, and tribal organizations. The U.S. District Court ruled against BLM's postponement, prompting BLM to finalize rulemaking to suspend or delay certain provisions. BLM finalized rulemaking to suspend or delay certain requirements of the 2016 final rule until January 17, 2019. The U.S. District Court issued an order enjoining the rule, which remains in effect. BLM proposed a new rule to revise the 2016 final rule, which was finalized on September 28, 2018, rescinding novel requirements related to waste-minimization plans, gas-capture percentages, well drilling, and completion. The final rule, effective on November 27, 2018, revises provisions related to venting and flaring, adding deference to state or tribal regulations. The U.S. Department of Transportation regulates pipeline safety and underground gas storage facilities, impacting air quality downstream in the natural gas supply. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) under the U.S. Department of Transportation oversees federal pipeline safety regulations, including inspections, investigations, and enforcement. President Obama signed the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 to address various pipeline safety provisions. The Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 addressed pipeline safety by increasing federal inspectors, requiring automatic shutoff valves, verifying operating pressure, and imposing civil penalties for violations. President Obama also signed the Protecting our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016, reauthorizing provisions for PHMSA operational expenses and other safety measures. The mandates under recent statutes like P.L. 112-90 and P.L. 114-183 remain incomplete, particularly those related to air quality in the oil and gas industry. Debates on federal regulation of air emissions in this sector are ongoing, with discussions on safety measures at natural gas storage facilities and standards for leak detection systems. Some argue that state and local authorities are better suited to develop emission standards for the crude oil and natural gas sector, citing the need to balance environmental protection with economic growth. They believe that federal regulations are often unnecessary and burdensome, adding costs and delays to projects. States can address the specific characteristics of oil and gas activities more effectively, considering factors like geology, climate, and industry differences. Some argue for state and local control over emission standards in the oil and gas industry, citing successful examples in Colorado and Wyoming. They believe federal regulations can be burdensome and advocate for consistent national standards to avoid competition among localities. The federal government sets minimum national standards for environmental programs, allowing states flexibility in implementation. States benefit from sharing lessons learned in collaborative regulatory programs. Emissions estimates for the oil and gas sector are based on EPA data, but some emissions are difficult to evaluate. The EPA uses a methane study from 1996 to calculate greenhouse gas emissions from the oil and gas sector. The methodology has been revised over time based on new information, resulting in fluctuations in methane emissions estimates. The EPA's estimates for methane emissions from natural gas systems have varied between 96.4 and 221.2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent over the past years due to changes in reporting methodology. Industry groups and other sources have criticized EPA's GHG inventory, leading to competing estimates. Efforts are ongoing to create a consistent emissions data set for the sector, complicated by EPA's separate inventory for VOC emissions. The National Emissions Inventory (NEI) estimates pollutants and HAPs from air emissions sources in the US every three years. Data is provided by state, local, and tribal agencies, supplemented by EPA data. VOC emissions estimates fluctuate due to modeling differences. The NEI shows different data from the GHG inventory for VOCs from the \"Petroleum and Related Industries\" sector, possibly due to inventory differences and uncertainties. The 2012 federal air standards focus on regulating emissions of VOCs and SO2 from certain equipment and activities in the oil and gas industry. The scope of these standards is influenced by statutory limitations, cost-benefit analyses, and stakeholder feedback provided during rulemaking. EPA has made adjustments in response to stakeholder comments and legal proceedings. The 2016 NSPS revisited the 2012 standards to include controls on methane emissions from new oil and gas equipment. However, H2S emissions and offshore sources are still not regulated by federal standards. The 2012 federal air standards do not cover VOC or SO2 emissions from existing sources unless classified as HAPs, and do not include methane emissions. Determining which activities and equipment are considered \"major sources\" of pollution has been controversial. Well completions, pneumatic controllers, compressors, and storage vessels are exempt from the classification of \"major source.\" Natural gas facilities emitting 10 to 250 tons per year may be classified as \"major sources\" based on aggregation of emissions units. EPA defines a major stationary source as any emitting structure in the same industrial grouping on contiguous properties under common control. The definition of major sources is determined on a case-by-case basis for each permitting decision, considering factors like contiguous or adjacent properties under common control. EPA has recently clarified the term \"adjacent\" for determining the scope of a stationary source in the oil and gas sector. The effectiveness of these guidelines is still unknown. Major and area source determinations for NESHAPs in the sector are clearly outlined. The Clean Air Act outlines major and area source determinations for NESHAPs in the oil and gas sector. Upstream crude oil and natural gas operations are exempt from aggregation for determining source categories, with exceptions near large metropolitan areas. Federal air standards aim to improve air quality and reduce health effects from exposure to pollutants, but the full impact on human health and the environment is not fully quantified. EPA recognizes this limitation in the 2012 rule. Comprehensive epidemiological studies are challenging to conduct due to the unavailability of data and lack of published literature correlating oil and gas production to health outcomes. Stakeholders argue that the lack of peer-reviewed research makes it difficult to assess the impacts of natural gas operations, leading to uncertainty about the need for additional pollution controls. Some recent studies show significant increases in VOC and/or ozone levels in areas with heavy drilling activity, such as the Marcellus Basin in Pennsylvania, the Piceance and Denver-Julesburg Basins in Colorado, and the Green River Basin in Wyoming. The rise in VOC emissions is attributed to increased traffic, combustion exhaust, and local emissions from oil and gas development activities. Several surveys have shown increases in ozone values in regions with heavy drilling activity, attributed to factors like stratospheric ozone intrusions and changes in weather patterns. Health agencies have expressed concerns about emissions from natural gas facilities, prompting investigations into the health impacts. Community health complaints related to natural gas operations, including odors, dizziness, nausea, respiratory problems, and cancer risks, have prompted further investigations into emissions and risks. Studies show mixed impacts of greenhouse gas emissions from natural gas systems, with some highlighting lower carbon intensity compared to other fossil fuels, while others focus on the potential negative effects of fugitive methane releases. The oil and gas industry's natural gas emissions can counteract environmental benefits gained from switching to natural gas. Pollution abatement can lead to economic benefits for the industry by offsetting compliance costs with recovered natural gas products. Various recovery technologies are used, and profitability depends on factors like release extent, capture technology, and market prices. Incentives to control emissions in the crude oil and natural gas sector are inconsistent due to varying factors. EPA and BLM considered costs and benefits of their rulemakings, as required by statute and executive orders. While CAA and MLA do not mandate cost-benefit analysis, executive orders require agencies to develop and consider CBA, RIA, and other administrative addenda before proposing regulations. The agencies calculated regulatory compliance costs for the affected industry, including initial capital costs and annualized engineering costs, adjusted for estimated revenues. Regulatory benefits were calculated in both monetized and nonmonetized terms, including reductions in methane emissions. The 2012 NSPS require natural gas producers to capture 95% of methane and VOCs from hydraulic fracturing operations, leading to environmental benefits such as VOC reductions of 190,000 tons annually. Monetized benefits include reductions in methane emissions valued using the social cost of methane, while nonmonetized benefits include improvements in air quality, health effects, visibility, ecosystem effects, and natural gas recovery. The 2012 NSPS require natural gas producers to capture 95% of methane and VOCs from hydraulic fracturing operations, resulting in VOC reductions of 190,000 tons annually. Compliance costs were estimated at $170 million per year, with a potential net gain of $11 million to $19 million per year. Industry estimates countered with compliance costs exceeding $2.5 billion annually. Third parties projected a net cost between $316 million and $511 million. The 2016 NSPS aimed for VOC reductions of 210,000 tons, air toxics reductions of 3,900 tons, and methane reductions of 510,000 tons by 2025, with total annualized engineering costs estimated at $530 million. The 2016 NSPS aimed to reduce VOCs, air toxics, and methane emissions by 2025, with estimated annualized engineering costs of $530 million. Industry sources disputed EPA's benefit estimates, projecting net costs of $150 million to $400 million by 2025. Third parties suggested lower costs but questioned the effectiveness of the standards. BLM estimated the rule would prevent 175,000-180,000 tons of methane emissions annually, with total benefits ranging from $209 million to $403 million per year. Under the Trump Administration, analysis of the costs and benefits of environmental regulations is under reconsideration, which could significantly impact the cost-benefit analysis of the Obama-era methane standards. Industry disputes the estimated benefits of the proposed rule, arguing against the use of certain metrics and assumptions. Cost estimates are based on factors such as captured emissions quantity, equipment costs, and natural gas prices. The growth in U.S. natural gas production is attributed to technological advances in unconventional resources. Advocates support natural gas for economic, national security, and environmental reasons, citing its lower emissions compared to coal and oil. Many view natural gas as a transitional fuel towards a cleaner economy despite concerns over the recent expansion in production. The recent expansion in natural gas production in the United States has raised concerns about human health and environmental impacts, particularly on air quality. Regulations at local, state, and federal levels govern the oil and gas industry, with states taking the lead in day-to-day oversight. Organizations like STRONGER assist states in evaluating environmental regulations. The EPA has set national standards for methane, VOCs, SO2, and HAPs emissions. The BLM has established national standards for emissions in the crude oil and natural gas sector, focusing on methane, VOCs, SO2, and HAPs. These standards are based on existing state regulations and are currently being reconsidered by the Trump Administration. Producers are implementing recommended practices to capture and sell fugitive natural gas releases. The Trump Administration's proposed budget cuts to environmental programs like the Natural Gas STAR Program and the Global Methane Initiative have sparked debate over methane, VOC, SO2, and HAP emissions regulations in the oil and gas industry. Conflicts between federal and state governments persist, with arguments about the impact of environmental regulations on economic growth. The lack of a national inventory of fugitive emissions from natural gas systems complicates the debate on efficient and cost-effective emissions controls in the sector."
