    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Foreign Subsidiary Tax Equity Act\" and includes provisions regarding income from manufacturing operations in countries with tax holidays. The \"Foreign Subsidiary Tax Equity Act\" includes amendments to the Internal Revenue Code regarding foreign base company manufacturing related income. This new provision defines and includes foreign base company manufacturing related income in the currently taxed amounts. The \"foreign base company manufacturing related income\" refers to income derived from manufacturing or selling personal property by a controlled foreign corporation outside the United States. This includes property manufactured in a tax holiday plant or runaway plant. The term \"runaway plant\" is defined as a facility outside the United States where economic benefits accrue to a corporation for establishing, maintaining, or expanding the facility, in connection with manufacturing personal property. The term \"runaway plant\" refers to a facility established by a controlled foreign corporation outside the US, where at least 10% of the manufactured personal property is used in the US, and the effective tax rate in that country is less than 90% of the US tax rate. The term 'economic benefit under any tax law' includes any exclusion or deduction of amounts from gross income related to manufacturing facilities or the manufacture/sale of personal property, as well as any reduction in tax rates imposed on such facilities or properties under the laws of a country. The term 'manufacture' or 'manufacturing' encompasses production, processing, assembling, or finishing of personal property or components not yet assembled, along with any tax credits, abatements, or reductions in tax amounts owed to a country. The term 'controlled foreign corporation' includes any related person. An economic benefit shall be treated as accrued in the taxable year of the corporation when obtained, regardless of when it was allowable or carried forward/back. The term 'foreign base company manufacturing related income' excludes income from a controlled foreign corporation if it is not significantly engaged in manufacturing, the investment in expansion was not substantial, or the property was used in a certain way. The term 'foreign base company manufacturing related income' excludes income from a controlled foreign corporation if it is not significantly engaged in manufacturing, defined as owning or controlling real property and capital assets dedicated to manufacturing operations exceeding 10% of total assets. The value of property owned by a corporation is the basis of the corporation in that property. The basis of property acquired other than by purchase is the fair market value at the time of acquisition. Property controlled but not owned by the corporation under a lease is treated as property acquired other than by purchase. Substantial investment is defined as owning or controlling real property and capital assets dedicated to manufacturing operations exceeding 10% of total assets. The term 'substantial investment' is defined as any amount added to the capital account of an existing facility during a 3-year period, exceeding 20% of the total value of the facility. The last sentence of subsection (b)(4) of section 954 is amended to include foreign base company manufacturing related income. Subsection (b)(5) is amended to include both foreign base company oil related income and foreign base company manufacturing related income. Additionally, a new paragraph is added to treat foreign base company manufacturing related income separately. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years of foreign corporations starting after December 31, 1988, and to taxable years of United States shareholders. No facility of a foreign controlled corporation shall be treated as a tax holiday plant or runaway plant. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years of foreign corporations starting after December 31, 1988, and to taxable years of United States shareholders. No facility of a foreign controlled corporation shall be treated as a tax holiday plant or runaway plant based on expenses added to the capital account before the enactment of this Act."
