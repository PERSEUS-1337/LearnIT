Congress emphasizes the importance of scientific integrity in informing public policy decisions, ensuring trust in science free from political and financial influences. Publicly funded science must uphold integrity to maintain public trust. SEC. 4. PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS. Federal agencies funding scientific research must promote open data exchange and prevent data suppression or distortion. Section 1009(a) of the America COMPETES Act is amended to require the development of principles for open communication and exchange of research data while protecting privacy and national security. The America COMPETES Act is amended to develop principles for open communication and exchange of research data, ensuring privacy, confidentiality, and national security. The principles aim to promote sharing of data and findings while complying with existing Federal laws. Scientific integrity policies are established under SEC. 6 to ensure open communication and exchange of research data while maintaining privacy, confidentiality, and national security. The Scientific Integrity Act amends Section 1009 of the America COMPETES Act to require Federal agencies funding scientific research to develop and enforce integrity policies for data release. These policies must be submitted to the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy and Congress. The Scientific Integrity Act requires Federal agencies to develop and enforce integrity policies for data release. These policies must be consistent with established principles, address permitted and recommended actions, be designed for the agency, applied uniformly, and publicly accessible. Additionally, the policies must ensure that scientific conclusions are not influenced by political considerations and that candidates for science positions are selected based on expertise and integrity. The Scientific Integrity Act mandates that Federal agencies maintain integrity in personnel actions for scientists and engineers, ensuring decisions are not politically motivated. Scientists must uphold ethical standards in research and dissemination of findings. Procedures are in place to safeguard the scientific process, including allowing scientists to review public materials citing their work and addressing any breaches in scientific integrity. The Scientific Integrity Act ensures that scientific and technological information used in policy decisions undergoes well-established processes, including peer review. Federal agencies must make these findings publicly available, and scientific staff must ensure the accuracy of scientific documents and reports. The Scientific Integrity Act requires federal agencies to ensure that scientific data and conclusions are accurately represented in reports and documents. Procedures and whistleblower protections must be in place to maintain the integrity of scientific information used in decision-making. The policy applies to employees and contractors involved in federally funded scientific research. Federal agencies must disseminate their scientific integrity policies and procedures to ensure transparency and accuracy in research. The Scientific Integrity Act mandates federal agencies to make their scientific integrity policy publicly available, disseminate it to new employees and contractors, and provide training on the policy. Existing scientific integrity policies can still satisfy the Act's requirements. The Act requires federal agencies conducting scientific research to submit their policy to the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy and Congress if it meets the Act's requirements. This Act does not impact US copyright law. SEC. 7. NAPA REVIEW. The Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy will collaborate with the National Academy of Public Administration to assess the effectiveness of scientific integrity policies in promoting data exchange and preventing distortion. Recommendations for improvements will be made. The Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy will collaborate with the National Academy of Public Administration to assess and recommend improvements to scientific integrity policies for promoting data exchange and preventing distortion."
