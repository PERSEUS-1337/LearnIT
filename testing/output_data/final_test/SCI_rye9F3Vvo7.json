    "content": "The matrix product operator RBM (MPORBM) is a novel approach that preserves input formats in both visible and hidden layers for higher expressive power. It utilizes a tensor network generalization of matrix-variate and tensor-variate RBMs, making it directly applicable to matrix and tensor data. The proposed matrix product operator (MPO) addresses limitations in existing RBM models by using 4-way tensors as building blocks, allowing for better capture of correlations between different data modes. The MPO-cores are key for expressing weight tensors in an MPORBM model. The storage complexity is O(dIJR^2) for a model with uniform ranks and dimensions. The final step involves applying a logistic sigmoid function to the resulting tensor. Training is done using contrastive divergence with Gibbs sampling. The derivatives of the log-likelihood with respect to bias tensors B, C are MPO-cores, demonstrated through numerical experiments. MPORBM shows superior data classification accuracy and is effective in generative modeling tasks like image completion on the binarized MNIST dataset."
