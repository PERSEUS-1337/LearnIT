    "content": "The Act titled \"Catastrophe Obligation Guarantee Act of 2009\" establishes a debt guarantee program for catastrophic events. It includes provisions for eligible State programs, catastrophic debt guarantees, payment of losses, and funding definitions. Congressional findings are also outlined in the Act. The Congress recognizes the need for better preparation and protection from natural catastrophes, citing past devastating events like hurricanes and earthquakes with potential for significant insured losses. The Congress acknowledges the potential for significant insured losses from natural catastrophes like hurricanes and earthquakes. Efforts to improve insurance availability at the State level face challenges with capital adequacy and financial strength, leading to increased risks for uninsured properties and strain on the banking system. State catastrophe insurance programs may struggle with capital adequacy and financial strength, leading to challenges in covering insured losses from natural disasters. Some States have taken action to ensure the availability and affordability of residential property insurance for their residents. However, a small but significant number of catastrophic events may exceed the financial capacity of State programs and local insurance markets. The Government Accountability Office found that a substantial portion of Federal emergency appropriations after the 2005 hurricanes was used by FEMA and the Small Business Administration. The recent financial turmoil raises concerns about State catastrophe insurance programs' ability to secure adequate financing after a catastrophic event. The Secretary of the Treasury will establish a debt guarantee program to protect holders of debt obligations issued by eligible State programs against loss of principal or interest. Eligible State programs will be covered under this program. A State program must meet certain requirements to be considered an \"eligible State program\" under this Act. The program must be established by State law as an insurance program offering residential property insurance coverage without pooling resources from insurers. The State program, as an eligible program under this Act, must offer residential property insurance coverage for insured losses due to covered perils. It can operate as a standalone insurance program or a reinsurance program designed to enhance private insurance markets and ensure continued availability of insurance coverage for all residents of the State. The State program must meet specific requirements: the governing body must consist mostly of public officials, the State must have a financial interest in the program, and any appropriated funds not used for program purposes must be returned with interest. The program must also have a designated tax status from the Secretary or their designee. The State program must have a designated tax status from the Secretary or their designee, and it shall insure losses caused by earthquakes, related perils, and tropical cyclones with specific wind speeds. The State program, established to provide insurance coverage for natural catastrophes, includes perils such as hurricanes, tornadoes, volcanic eruptions, winter storms, hail, and other defined by the Secretary. Provisions for prevention and mitigation of losses are also included in the program. The State insurance program covers natural catastrophes like hurricanes and tornadoes. Premium rates must be actuarially sound. The Secretary establishes certification procedures for eligible State programs. SEC. 5. CATASTROPHIC DEBT GUARANTEES. Eligibility for Guarantee: The Secretary may issue a commitment to guarantee the debt of an eligible State program for a duration of three years, extendable annually. The guarantee is contingent on the State program's ability to meet repayment obligations. The Secretary cannot guarantee debt obligations without a required amount of insured losses. The Act allows the Secretary to guarantee debt obligations of eligible State programs if insured losses are likely to exceed available cash resources. The guaranteed debt amount cannot exceed 80% of expected insured losses minus qualifying assets. The Act allows the Secretary to guarantee debt obligations of eligible State programs if insured losses are likely to exceed available cash resources. The guaranteed debt amount cannot exceed 80% of expected insured losses minus qualifying assets of the eligible State program. The debt guaranteed under this section must be used only to pay for losses. The guaranteed amounts under this section are to be used solely for paying insured losses and expenses incurred by the eligible State program, and not for any other purpose. SEC. 6. EFFECT OF GUARANTEE. The Secretary's issuance of a guarantee under the program is conclusive evidence of its validity and enforceability. The full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to pay all guarantees under the program. SEC. 7. MAXIMUM LIMITATION ON OUTSTANDING GUARANTEES UNDER PROGRAM. SEC. 7. MAXIMUM LIMITATION ON OUTSTANDING GUARANTEES UNDER PROGRAM. The total guaranteed debt for earthquake perils is capped at $5,000,000,000, and for all other perils at $20,000,000,000. If any portion of the principal or interest on a debt obligation guaranteed under this Act is unpaid due to insufficient funds from the State program, the Secretary will pay the amount to the fiscal agent. Payments will be made after the due date or upon notice of insufficient funds. Upon making payments for any unpaid portion of a debt obligation guaranteed under this Act, the Secretary will be subrogated to the rights of the recipient and can recover the amount from the eligible State program. The Attorney General will enforce any rights of the United States resulting from the guarantee. Any forbearance for the State program must be approved by the Secretary and funded accordingly. The Secretary has the authority to complete, recondition, reconstruct, renovate, repair, maintain, operate, or sell any property acquired under this Act, regardless of other laws governing property acquisition by the United States. SEC. 9. FUNDING FOR PAYMENTS OF GUARANTEES. Appropriations are hereby made to satisfy debt guarantee commitments and administrative expenses for the guarantee program. The cost of guarantees issued under this Act will be calculated by adjusting the discount rate for government risk. SEC. 10. DEFINITIONS. Definitions in this Act include \"commitment to guarantee,\" \"covered perils,\" \"insured loss,\" and \"qualifying assets.\" These terms relate to debt guarantees, natural catastrophe perils, losses covered by insurance or reinsurance, and the policyholder surplus of State programs.
