    "content": "Ukraine, once part of Kyivan Rus, was later absorbed by the Russian Empire and then the Soviet Union. Despite a brief period of independence, it became a significant European state. With a population comparable to France, Ukraine plays a key role in the geopolitical competition between the West and Russia. Ethnic Russians make up around 17% of the population. Ethnic Russians in Ukraine, concentrated in the southern and eastern regions, make up about 17% of the population. They are the majority in Crimea, especially in Sevastopol where they account for 72% of the population. Many Russians feel a historical sense of ownership over Ukraine, leading to strong support for the 2014 annexation of Crimea. In 2008, Russian President Putin told U.S. President George W. Bush that Ukraine was not a state and eastern Ukraine belonged to Russia. The U.S. and Europe believe in a strong, independent Ukraine. Ukraine's political scene is dominated by oligarchs who manipulate the government for their own gain. Former President Yanukovych was involved in political unrest and was ousted in 2004 after questionable elections. Former President Yanukovych, who drew support from oligarchs in eastern Ukraine, was reelected in 2010 but faced criticism for corruption and human rights abuses. Despite growing dissatisfaction, public unrest erupted in Ukraine in November 2013. In November 2013, the Yanukovych government rejected an Association Agreement with the EU, sparking antigovernment demonstrations in Kyiv's Maidan Nezalezhnosti. The decision led to public outcry over the government's lack of respect for basic human rights. In February 2014, the Yanukovych government's violent crackdown on Maidan protestors led to over 100 deaths, causing support for the regime to collapse. The Ukrainian Rada approved a resolution for the withdrawal of forces from Kyiv, leading to Yanukovych and his supporters fleeing to Russia. The Rada, now mainly composed of former opposition deputies, took control after Yanukovych abandoned Ukraine. The Ukrainian parliament swiftly passed measures to address unrest and reform the government after Yanukovych was deposed as president. New presidential elections were scheduled for May 25, 2014, and an interim government led by Arseniy Yatsenyuk was approved. Despite skepticism from Maidan protestors, the new government was formed, leading to hostility from Moscow. In February 2014, Russian-speaking forces, supported by Russian troops, seized key installations in Crimea. Putin claimed they were local self-defense forces. Moscow annexed Crimea after a referendum with 96% approval. Ukraine, US, and EU condemned the annexation. In March 2014, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a \"treaty\" with Crimean leaders, incorporating Crimea into Russia. Pro-Russia rebels, aided by Moscow, seized government facilities in eastern Ukraine, leading to a full-scale conflict. Ukraine elected Petro Poroshenko as president in May 2014, who pledged to move closer to the West and address corruption. In October 2014, Ukraine held national elections for its parliament. In October 2014, Ukraine held national elections for the 450-seat Rada. The main victors were the Petro Poroshenko Bloc and the People's Front, forming a pro-Western coalition with other parties. Far-right groups, often portrayed as neo-Nazi gangs by Russian propaganda, only won a few seats. Due to the conflict in eastern Ukraine, some parliamentary seats remained unfilled. The 450 seats in the parliament remain unfilled after the election. The new coalition government, led by Yatsenyuk, was approved on December 2, 2014. The government aimed to adopt European standards and fight corruption. The new government led by Yatsenyuk in Ukraine focused on fighting corruption by reducing government regulation, bureaucracy, and the influence of oligarchs. Key appointments were made to signal dedication to reforms and moving towards the West. President Poroshenko also initiated reforms after taking office. President Poroshenko in Ukraine launched political, economic, and judicial reform initiatives to address corruption among the country's elite. Reforms included setting up an Anti-Corruption Bureau, passing stricter anticorruption laws, and implementing annual income disclosures for public officials with the help of the US, EU, and UK. Some reforms in Ukraine were slow to be implemented, with Secretary Nuland highlighting the need to address endemic corruption, stabilize the economy, and reform the justice system. Only 5% of the population completely trusted the judiciary at the time. The Prosecutor General's Office needed to be reinvented to serve the citizens and prosecute corruption cases effectively. The newly created Inspector General's Office was also mentioned as part of the reform efforts. Nuland emphasized the importance of the newly created Inspector General's Office in Ukraine's prosecution service to work independently and effectively without interference. The deputy prosecutor resigned due to government corruption issues, leading to President Poroshenko requesting the prosecutor general's resignation. Reform progress faced resistance from corrupt networks. Resistance from corrupt networks, including influential business-political-criminal groups, poses a threat to Ukraine's European future. Oligarchs and kleptocrats are fighting back against Maidan reformers using control of media, state enterprises, and political machinery to block change. The difficulties faced by reformers in the government were evident in the resignation of the economy minister in February 2016. The economy minister, Abromavicius, resigned in February 2016 due to political interference and lack of reforms. The IMF delayed funds for Ukraine, and there were signs of trouble for the governing coalition. In September 2015, a controversial constitutional amendment on administrative decentralization for the Donbas region was passed by the Rada, causing serious splits within the governing coalition. President Poroshenko faced a struggle between those pushing for a settlement in the east and hardline elements unwilling to make concessions to Russia. The Radical Party left the coalition over the decentralization issue, and in January 2016, the Self-Reliance Party called for a no-confidence vote. In January 2016, the Self-Reliance Party called for a no-confidence vote against Prime Minister Yatsenyuk, leading to a review of the Yatsenyuk Cabinet's work. Questions arose about Yatsenyuk's ties to wealthy oligarchs and the need for government changes for stability. President Poroshenko later asked for Yatsenyuk's resignation due to slow reforms and lack of support, but Yatsenyuk refused and took his case to the Rada. After surviving a no-confidence vote in the Rada, Prime Minister Yatsenyuk faced doubts about his future effectiveness. Despite promises to consider Cabinet replacements, the Fatherland Party left the coalition on February 17, 2016. The Self-Reliance Party followed suit the next day. The Fatherland Party and Self-Reliance Party quit the coalition in February 2016, leaving the government with a minority in the Rada. Despite speculation about a new government led by Yatsenyuk or a new prime minister, no changes had materialized by late March 2016. Observers believed that the former coalition partners would continue to support the reform agenda. Speculation focused on Volodymyr Groysman as a potential new leader. In late March 2016, speculation arose about Volodymyr Groysman replacing Yatsenyuk as the new Prime Minister of Ukraine. Yatsenyuk refused to resign until a new governing coalition was formed, leading to political maneuverings. The United States and the EU were concerned about the pace of reform but did not want the government to collapse, as new elections could cause instability. The fear of new elections weakening both Poroshenko and Yatsenyuk's parties further slowed down reform efforts. Observers feared that Ukraine's political turmoil could lead to a repeat of past failures, such as the Orange Revolution. However, there was some positive news as the country stabilized its currency and rebuilt its reserves, according to U.S. Secretary Nuland. Ukraine has stabilized its currency, rebuilt reserves, seen modest economic growth, passed budget in line with IMF requirements, approved civil service reform, recruited new corporate board for Naftogaz, broke wheat export record, established Anti-Corruption Bureau, began decentralizing power to local communities. Rada deputies approved critical reform legislation to stay on track with IMF conditions and advance visa-free travel with EU. Despite progress in passing reform legislation, public skepticism remains high regarding the government's ability to combat corruption and implement necessary reforms. Disenchantment was evident in the decline of support for Yatsenyuk's party in the 2015 local elections. In a public opinion poll conducted in November 2015, only 27% viewed President Poroshenko favorably and 12% had a favorable opinion of Prime Minister Yatsenyuk. Yatsenyuk faced disenchantment from the public and some within the Rada, leading to uncertainty about addressing corruption. Yatsenyuk failed to form a new government by early April 2016 and indicated he would resign if a new prime minister was agreed upon. On April 14, 2016, the Rada approved Volodymyr Groysman by a slim margin. The Rada approved Volodymyr Groysman as the new prime minister by a slim margin, relying on support from various parties. Initial doubts were raised about his ability to lead and implement reforms, especially due to his close association with President Poroshenko. The Washington Post criticized Poroshenko and Groysman for not taking radical steps needed for Ukraine's reform, despite their commitment to IMF program and fighting corruption. Vice President Biden urged the new team to quickly fulfill reform commitments and Minsk-2 agreement to maintain international support. The period since the formation of the Groysman government in Ukraine has seen slow but successful progress in reform and economic strengthening. Former Prime Minister Yatsenyuk was ousted due to his reluctance to challenge oligarchs and address corruption. Yury Lutsenko was appointed as the new prosecutor general, initially seen as a move to consolidate Poroshenko's influence. The Groysman government in Ukraine has made progress in reforms and economic strengthening. Lutsenko is committed to prosecuting corrupt officials. Danyliuk, the new finance minister, has gained support for his reform efforts. Notable successes include energy subsidies, corruption, transparency, and banking reform. The Ukrainian government has made progress in reforms and economic strengthening, including addressing energy subsidies, corruption, transparency, and banking reform. The IMF has urged for further reforms in the banking and pension sectors, electronic declarations by high officials, land reform, and privatizations to receive additional funding. Despite facing protests over increased electricity prices, the government has reduced household energy subsidies. Corruption remains a significant issue in the Ukrainian banking system. The Ukrainian government has made progress in reforms and economic strengthening, including addressing energy subsidies, corruption, transparency, and banking reform. Some believe the chairwoman of the National Bank of Ukraine has made significant progress in cleaning up the banking industry. The government took over PrivatBank in response to the Central Bank's claim that it had not fulfilled its recapitalization program, backed by international donors to protect the financial system. These reform initiatives have generated opposition and raised concerns about winners and losers in Kyiv. Despite concerns about potential opposition to reform efforts in Kyiv, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Victoria Nuland expressed encouragement at signs of commitment to reform from Ukraine's government. The EU and IMF also seemed satisfied with the Groysman government's progress, leading to the approval of another $1 billion in IMF assistance for Ukraine in fall 2016. The IMF's $17 billion assistance program for Ukraine was under review in November 2016, with no additional funds approved due to lack of progress in meeting international demands, particularly in addressing corruption. U.S. Ambassador Geoffrey Pyatt highlighted Ukraine's achievements in civil society during his farewell speech. According to Pyatt, Ukraine has made progress in various areas such as civil society, anticorruption institutions, energy sector transformation, media freedom, and accountability of politicians. However, the focus still needs to be on building a strong rule of law, including a trustworthy judiciary and court system. The Poroshenko/Groysman government has not fully gained support from the Rada, Maidan reformists, or the general public. The presence and influence of powerful oligarchs in Ukraine's politics and economy have hindered the government from gaining full support from the Rada, Maidan reformists, and the general public. Oligarchs maintain dominance in strategic economic sectors, control numerous members of parliament, and own the majority of television stations, making it difficult to strip them of their influence. The presence of powerful oligarchs in Ukraine's politics and economy hinders government support. Efforts to weaken their influence may lead to political conflict and destabilize the country. Reforming institutions is crucial for success. Despite progress, incidents have raised concerns about government stability. In June 2016, Ukrainian war hero Naydia Savchenko criticized the government for failing public expectations and called for early parliamentary elections to bring fresh blood into politics. She also expressed presidential ambitions, causing shockwaves nationally and internationally. In August 2016, Savchenko went on a hunger strike to push for the release of Ukrainian prisoners of war. In December 2016, the Fatherland party expelled Savchenko from their parliamentary faction, leading her to sit in the Rada as an independent MP. A new European liberal political party was launched in July 2016 by young Maidan activists in government, Rada, or civil society. The group supports free-market approaches, small- and medium-sized businesses, personal choice, tough anticorruption measures, and a professional judiciary. They plan to use social media, Internet news, civic networks, and crowd funding for support. In July 2016, increased fighting broke out in eastern Ukraine, resulting in the deadliest month for the Ukrainian military in nearly a year. A car bomb explosion in Kyiv killed a well-known Belarussian investigative reporter, Pavel Sheremet, known for his criticism of Russia. In July 2016, a car bomb killed investigative reporter Pavel Sheremet, known for criticizing Russia's leadership and his friendship with Boris Nemtsov. It is unclear if his killing was internally or externally motivated. President Poroshenko called it an attempt to destabilize Ukraine. Amnesty International reported widespread prisoner abuse by Russian-backed separatists, also implicating Ukrainian authorities and paramilitary groups. Ukraine held special elections in seven districts on July 17. In July 2016, Ukraine held special elections in seven districts to fill vacant seats in the Rada. The Poroshenko Bloc did not win any races, with independent candidates and those supported by different factions emerging victorious. The government passed a landmark anticorruption reform in November, requiring officials to declare their wealth. The government officials, including the president and prime minister, were required to declare their wealth in an online database as a key condition set by the IMF and the EU. Over 100,000 submissions have been reported, revealing surprising amounts of wealth. Anticorruption bodies have announced investigations into the sources of this wealth, marking a significant step in tackling corruption. The disclosure initiative, despite its flaws, is seen as a significant step in combating corruption. The publicly available database helps uncover connections between public officials and can reveal conflicts of interest. Civil society and journalists must maintain pressure for criminal investigations. Ukraine's reform process, praised by former Finance Minister Natalie Jaresko, has led to GDP growth, reduced inflation, and expanded credit despite challenges like Russia's occupation of Crimea and internal displacement. The reform process in Ukraine, praised by former Finance Minister Natalie Jaresko, has led to GDP growth, reduced inflation, and expanded credit despite challenges like Russia's occupation of Crimea and internal displacement. However, reforms are not yet irreversible and require continued international support. Observers warn that corruption remains endemic, and little progress has been made in breaking the old elite's power structure. With fresh IMF and U.S. financing, the new government has a window of opportunity to push through additional reforms and continue economic recovery, or risk an early parliamentary election next spring. In spring 2017, Jaresko warned about slow progress in Ukraine, attributing it to opposition parties and populist politicians. Populist parties are pushing for early elections, which Jaresko views as negative. The formation of a new political party by the Azov Battalion, with far-right leanings, could challenge the current government. The International Crisis Group believes the government has had mixed results in pushing through reforms. Politicians fear Groysman may lose a confidence vote in the spring. The Crisis Group predicts that Groysman will lose a confidence vote in the spring, leading to a collapse of Poroshenko's majority in the Rada. Opposition parties sympathetic to the Russian worldview are gaining ground, with Tymoshenko's Batkivshchyna and the Opposition Bloc becoming prominent. Despite declining support, Poroshenko and Groysman pledge to continue reform efforts. The Ukrainian government is focused on reform and economic progress, monitoring the country's mood and potential for new elections. Concerns include maintaining support from the US and EU to prevent Moscow from destabilizing the government. Recent events in Syria and the Donbas conflict have hardened the EU's stance on Russia, potentially benefiting Ukraine. Ukraine's economy, the second most important in the former Soviet Union after Russia, was heavily reliant on agriculture and heavy industry. Despite economic decline in 2013, external factors like Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 exacerbated Ukraine's challenges. Ukraine's economy was further impacted by Russia's support for separatists in eastern Ukraine. Russia's support for separatists in eastern Ukraine led to a significant drop in the region's production, costing Ukraine a substantial portion of its GDP. Trade sanctions imposed by Russia in 2013 resulted in a drastic decrease in Ukraine's exports to Russia, affecting various industries such as machinery, steel, and agriculture. The loss of the Russian market had a significant impact on Ukraine's overall GDP, with few investors willing to engage in a region plagued by conflict. Ukraine's net foreign direct investment plummeted after the conflict began, with the Odessa Port Plant failing to attract any bidders for privatization. However, signs of economic stabilization emerged in 2015 with the help of an IMF loan and rising interest rates supporting the hryvnya. In August 2015, Ukraine reached a deal to restructure $18 billion of public debt. The IMF adjusted its rules to continue funding Ukraine despite arrears to Russia. The 2016 budget aimed to reduce the deficit to 3.7% of GDP, in line with IMF commitments. The IMF demanded reforms from Ukraine, including a $17 billion loan, flexible currency exchange rate, gas and heating price increases, energy and governance reforms, and anticorruption measures. IMF Director Lagarde warned of jeopardized support due to slow progress, leading to the replacement of Prime Minister Yatsenyuk with Groysman, who emphasized reform and appointed a new prosecutor general. In response to Prime Minister Groysman's reforms, the IMF sent a new assessment team to Ukraine and agreed to release $1 billion of the $17.5 billion bailout package. This brought total IMF funding to $7.7 billion. The 2016 budget debate in the Rada was challenging due to fiscal austerity measures, the conflict in the east, and a recession leading to a decline in living standards and public support for the government. Reductions in energy subsidies resulted in higher electricity prices. Reductions in energy subsidies led to higher electricity prices, sparking public outrage and protests. Despite a decline in electricity prices in late 2016, Russia's trade restrictions caused Ukrainian exports to Russia to drop by 50%. Ukraine has successfully redirected its trade to the EU, but faces economic uncertainties due to Brexit negotiations and stagnation in the EU. The EIU forecasted growth in real GDP. The EIU forecasted growth in real GDP for the UK and the EU as Brexit negotiations begin in 2017. Ukraine is expected to see 1.5% GDP growth this year, with unemployment at 9% and inflation at 12%. Domestic gas tariffs may lead to inflation. Ukraine's agriculture sector is progressing, with $7.6 billion in farm commodity sales in 2015. Ukraine's agriculture sector is thriving, with grain sales estimated to exceed 60 million tons in 2016. The country aims to become the third-largest food producer globally by the mid-2020s. However, foreign investment remains low due to concerns over governance reforms and corruption. Despite improvements in the business environment, Ukraine dropped in the World Economic Forum's Global Competitiveness Index. Investors cite obstacles such as corruption, judicial mistrust, the conflict with Russia, and an unstable financial system. In 2016, Ukraine faced challenges such as lack of trust in the judiciary, conflict with Russia, and an unstable financial system. However, there were positive observations on the business climate, with new determined entrepreneurs emerging and a shift towards a westernized business approach. Additionally, the signing of a Canada-Ukraine free trade pact was noted as a positive development. The recent signing of a Canada-Ukraine free trade pact followed the first Canada-Ukraine Business Forum in Toronto, attended by representatives of Canadian and Ukrainian companies. Japan's Fujikura opened a car parts factory in Lviv. Ukraine's energy sector is crucial for economic reforms and combating corruption, with efforts to reduce subsidies and address inefficiencies. International donors urged reforms in this sector, which the Poroshenko/Groysman government initiated. Ukraine's energy sector reforms, including subsidy reductions, have led to lower consumption. Historically dependent on Russia for energy supplies, Ukraine resisted Moscow's attempts to control its pipelines and storage facilities. Ukraine's vulnerability to Russian political pressure through energy policy has been somewhat mitigated by the fact that the main oil and natural gas pipelines to Central and Western Europe transit Ukraine's territory. Past Russian efforts to increase gas prices for Ukraine led to gas cutoffs in 2006 and 2009. Russia has negotiated with European countries to build pipelines bypassing Ukraine, such as the Nord Stream pipeline under the Baltic Sea. Russia has proposed various pipelines to Europe, including Nord Stream under the Baltic Sea and South Stream through the Balkans. However, due to EU objections, the South Stream project was canceled. In response, Russia announced plans for the Turkish Stream pipeline through Turkey. Russia has also used gas prices as a tool in its policies towards Ukraine, leading to a price increase from $268 to $485 per thousand cubic meters. Ukraine refused to pay the higher price, prompting Russia to build alternative pipelines to bypass Ukraine. In June 2014, Russia cut off natural gas supplies to Ukraine for non-payment of debts. The EU brokered a deal for lower gas prices through March 2015. Ukraine faces a possible gas crisis with Gazprom in winter 2017 due to a $6.6 billion fine imposed on Gazprom for abusing its monopoly position. Gazprom denies the fine's legality. Some in Ukraine fear Gazprom may trigger another gas crisis by threatening to cut supplies to pressure the EU to intervene in a fine dispute. To reduce dependence on Russian gas, Ukraine has increased imports from Poland, Hungary, and Slovakia. Legislation reducing energy subsidies led to higher prices but also decreased energy consumption by 20% in 2015, with continued reductions in 2016. In 2015, Ukraine reduced gas consumption due to economic slowdown and increased availability of gas from EU countries. The government stopped buying gas from Russia and filled storage facilities for winter 2016-2017. Ukraine relied on the EU to mediate with Russia for gas purchases. In the long term, Ukraine aims to develop its own hydrocarbon reserves, import liquefied natural gas, and improve energy conservation. The country also seeks international support for its sovereignty, economic reorientation towards Europe, and diversification of gas imports through the EU's Southern Energy Corridor. Ukraine reoriented its economy towards Europe and sought international assistance to improve its economic situation. The parliament renounced its neutral status in favor of closer relations with NATO. President Poroshenko requested military assistance from NATO, leading to the establishment of trust funds for Ukraine's military. Despite achieving independence in 1991, Russian influence over Ukraine remained strong. Recent Russian perspectives on Ukraine are influenced by long-standing resentment of the outcome of the Cold War. Russian leaders believe nations in the post-Soviet region should be of privileged interest to Russia, citing a right to protect Russian citizens and \"compatriots.\" Ukraine holds a significant place in Russian psychology, with Putin referring to Ukrainians as \"brothers\" of the Russian people. Russians emphasize their historical ties to Crimea and Ukraine, dating back to the Russian Empire. Russia's historical ties to Ukraine date back to the Russian Empire, with efforts to incorporate Crimea and most of Ukraine into the Russian Empire. Russia has demanded changes in Ukraine's political future, including making Russian the second official language and confirming Ukraine's neutral status. Trade sanctions and energy cuts have been imposed on Ukraine, with a concentration of ethnic Russians in the southern and eastern regions where ties to Russia are strong. Soviet leaders established key industries in eastern Ukraine, further solidifying ties to Russia. The concentration of heavy industries in eastern Ukraine tied the region economically to Russia and fostered a Soviet-style mindset, especially in the Donbas region. The Kremlin used indirect methods of influence in Ukraine, including favorable loan terms and economic sanctions. Since the change in government in 2014, Ukrainian officials have reported increased Russian interference in domestic political affairs and the economy. The hosting of representatives from the two largest opposition political parties in Moscow, the Party of the Regions and the Fatherland party, has raised concerns. Russian disinformation and propaganda activities have been increasing, with a parallel seen between disinformation targeting Ukraine and military activity. Accusations against Ukraine, such as hitting a civilian car with a tank and violating Russian airspace over Crimea, have been circulating in pro-Kremlin media. The Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister accused the EU of betrayal, Ukrainian soldiers sell fuel to buy clothes, and Ukraine faces three options - return to Russia, division, or a coup. Ukraine has been targeted by cyberattacks linked to Russia, with government servers hit by sophisticated attacks. Speculation suggests Russian government and Kremlin-supported sources are behind the attacks, including groups like Black Energy. A new version of malware was detected being used by hackers targeting Ukrainian government officials to harvest information. Black Energy, a widespread cybercrime tool, was suspected to be active again. Previous attacks by Black Energy hackers targeted government infrastructure and power companies in Ukraine, causing unscheduled power outages. Power outages affecting many customers in Ukraine, with reports of malware found in Ukrainian companies across critical infrastructure sectors. President Poroshenko announced a ban on military cooperation with Russia in 2014, leading to a decline in sentiments towards Russia among Ukrainians. This move could significantly impact Ukrainian defense firms closely linked to Russian companies. On October 20, 2016, Ukraine's Rada approved a document blaming the former Soviet Union for World War II due to the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. Tensions between Ukraine and Russia escalated in Crimea and southern Ukraine in 2016, with military alerts and threats exchanged. Ukraine's military conducted missile tests near the Crimean border, prompting warnings from Moscow. Russia has increased its military presence in Crimea, deploying the S-400 anti-aircraft missile system to the region. This system poses a significant threat to the Ukrainian air force and could impact Ukraine's defense of the city of Mariupol. In September 2016, elections were held in Crimea for seats in the Russian Duma, with United Russia winning 73% of the vote. The results were deemed illegal by the US, Europe, and the OSCE. The Kremlin pledged a $593 million subsidy to boost the Crimean economy in 2017, but annexation has led to increased inflation and a collapse of tourism. The United Nations General Assembly voted to recognize Crimea as \"temporarily occupied\" by Russia, condemning abuses against Crimean Tatars and other groups. Russia annexed Crimea in March 2014, leading to pro-Russian protests in eastern Ukraine. Demonstrators sought union with Russia or greater autonomy from Kyiv, seizing government buildings and clashing with pro-Maidan groups. In April 2014, armed men seized government buildings in eastern Ukraine, including Donetsk, Luhansk, and Slovyansk. The Ukrainian government responded with military force and accused Russian intelligence agents of orchestrating the attacks. Senior U.S. officials and NATO believed Russia supported the armed separatist groups with arms, troops, and material support. In 2014, armed separatist leaders in Donetsk and Luhansk held \"referendums\" on independence from Ukraine, with high approval rates but no international observers. Ukraine denounced the referendums as illegal and resumed military operations against the separatist forces, successfully dislodging them from strongholds in Slovyansk and Kramatorsk. In 2014, armed separatist leaders in Donetsk and Luhansk held \"referendums\" on independence from Ukraine. Ukraine denounced the referendums as illegal and dislodged separatist forces from strongholds in Slovyansk and Kramatorsk. Subsequently, the tragedy of Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 occurred when the plane was downed by a surface-launched missile. Investigations revealed that the missile was fired by separatist forces using a Russian-supplied Buk missile. Russia increased support to separatists in late August and early September 2015, deploying troops and supplying military equipment, despite denying involvement. In 2014, Ukraine faced heavily supplied separatist forces, supported by Russian troops, resulting in losses and casualties. To avoid further casualties and territorial loss, Ukraine agreed to a cease-fire plan in Minsk, Belarus, on September 5, 2014. The plan (Minsk-1) included provisions for a cease-fire, exchange of hostages, monitoring by OSCE, and withdrawal of illegal armed groups from Ukraine. The Minsk-1 agreement aimed to end the conflict in the Donbas region of Ukraine, leading to a ceasefire and withdrawal of armed groups. However, the agreement was not fully implemented, with continued fighting resulting in casualties and territorial losses. President Poroshenko accused Russia of having troops and military equipment in Ukraine. Sanctions were imposed by the US and EU in response to the annexation of Crimea and the conflict in Donbas. The United States and the European Union imposed sanctions and travel bans on Russian and Ukrainian personnel involved in destabilizing Ukraine. They linked easing sanctions on Russia to the full implementation of the Minsk protocol. The Obama Administration mostly left negotiations to France, Germany, and Ukraine in the Normandy format meetings with Russia. In the Normandy format, key figures from Russia, Ukraine, Germany, and France met to address the conflict in Donbas. Despite the failure of the Minsk-1 protocol, a new cease-fire agreement, Minsk-2, was signed on February 12, 2015. Some observers remained skeptical about its effectiveness. Some observers expressed skepticism about the implementation of the Minsk-2 agreement, which called for cease-fire monitoring by the OSCE, local elections in rebel-held regions, legal and constitutional reforms for decentralization, and amnesty for separatist leaders. Concerns were raised about the agreement potentially turning occupied Donbas into a new Transnistria. The return of control of the Russia-Ukraine border to Ukraine was tied to the implementation of decentralization reforms. Skeptics doubted the effectiveness of the Minsk-2 agreement, noting that Putin avoided binding himself to any obligations. The agreement lacks conditions for Russia and was signed by Russia's ambassador to Ukraine. Implementation of the agreement has been slow, with no total cease-fire in place and limited progress on provisions such as cease-fire monitoring by the OSCE. The OSCE's Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) in Ukraine has faced restrictions from Russia-backed separatists, including limitations on their operational area and interference with their drones. Cease-fire violations, mostly by the separatists, have resulted in numerous casualties, with over 9,000 dead since 2015. Fighting intensified in July 2016, with heavy clashes along the contact line. In July, heavy fighting along the contact line in Ukraine led to the deaths of 27 soldiers and injuries to 123 others, making it the deadliest month for the Ukrainian military in nearly a year. Separatist forces blocked OSCE Monitoring Team access and disabled SMM cameras and UAVs to hinder monitoring efforts. In July 2016, heavy fighting in Ukraine resulted in the deaths of 27 soldiers and injuries to 123 others. Separatist forces obstructed OSCE Monitoring Team access and disabled monitoring equipment. In August, sporadic fighting continued, but heavy fighting decreased. In September, a cease-fire agreement was reached, but incidents of conflict persisted, leading to injuries among Ukrainian soldiers. Ukraine's military postponed a planned withdrawal due to violations of the agreement by pro-Russian separatists. On October 17, 2016, a Russian national and prominent figure in the Donetsk People's Republic was killed by a bomb in Donetsk. The separatists blamed the government in Kyiv and vowed to retaliate. In December, separatist forces launched an artillery barrage and ground assault against Ukrainian military forces near Svitlodarsk. The OSCE reported almost 3,000 explosions in the region leading up to the assault. The Ukrainian military reported casualties and heavy fighting in the region, with almost 3,000 explosions before the assault. Despite sporadic withdrawals of heavy weapons, separatists have not fully complied with the Minsk-2 agreement, with a significant presence of Russian tanks and artillery in Ukraine. At the OSCE Permanent Council meeting, Ambassador Baer highlighted numerous weapons violations in separatist-controlled areas in Donbass, including artillery systems, personnel carriers, and rocket launchers. The SMM observed 874 violations between April 20 and July 22, three times more than in government-held territory. The separatists' lack of cooperation hinders the OSCE from determining the extent of Russian involvement in arming and supporting them. Several prisoner exchanges have occurred between Kyiv and the separatists. Prisoner exchanges have taken place between Kyiv and the separatists, with Ukrainians releasing 287 prisoners and separatists releasing 317. The Ukrainian government estimated holding 220 prisoners, while separatists held around 100 Ukrainian soldiers. The UN noted 3.8 million Ukrainians needing humanitarian aid. Aid is now being provided in Donetsk, with the EU distributing \u20ac26 million in 2016 for assistance. In December 2016, aid totaling \u20ac4 million was provided to organizations in Ukraine and the Donbas. The UNHCR and the International Committee of the Red Cross delivered tons of humanitarian assistance to the Luhansk region. Russia claims to also be providing aid to the Donbas, but international inspectors have limited access to verify this. Progress on Minsk-2 requirements in Kyiv has been mixed, with the Rada passing amnesty and special status laws for the Donbas, but President Poroshenko has not signed them yet. The Rada has struggled to pass a constitutional amendment for self-government in the Donbas due to a lack of support and demands for a total cease-fire. Russia and separatists refuse to return control of the border to Ukraine until elections are held. OSCE SMM has limited access to checkpoints along the contested border. Kyiv has stopped providing pensions and social payments to Donbas citizens. Since the conflict, Kyiv has halted pensions and social payments to Donbas citizens under separatist control. Those who cross into Ukrainian-held areas can receive some benefits. Limited commerce exists, with a black market for goods. Some eastern companies sell coal to the government. Elections in the Donbas are stalled due to security issues and Russian troop presence. OSCE observers cannot enter disputed areas for preparations. Both sides have not fulfilled steps for the election process. The Ukrainian government and separatists have not reached an agreement on election preparations in disputed areas. The Normandy Group, including Putin, met in Berlin to discuss the Minsk-2 agreement. Kyiv insists on a real cease-fire before passing an elections law in the Rada. Separatists demand a total amnesty law before agreeing to election process demands. The Ukrainian government insists on a real cease-fire, withdrawal of Russian troops, and control of the border by the OSCE before passing an elections law in the Rada. Putin continues to push for elections, special status for Donbas, and amnesty without guarantees on key issues. President Poroshenko agreed to create a detailed plan for implementing the Minsk-2 peace accords, including the possibility of deploying an armed OSCE mission to protect the monitoring mission in eastern Ukraine. However, the separatists and Russia's denial of military presence made the roadmap unclear. Poroshenko faced challenges in passing legislation for increased autonomy in Donbas without enough votes in the Rada. Moscow has not recognized Donetsk and Luhansk as independent countries or annexed them to Russia. Russian officials see the separatist regimes as legitimate in discussions about Ukraine's future. They advocate for decentralization in Ukraine, granting regions autonomy in various areas. The concept of Novorossiya, expanding Russia's control over eastern and southern Ukraine, has faded from official rhetoric since the conflict began. Putin's goal of expanding Russia's control over eastern and southern Ukraine, including linking Russian-controlled areas with Crimea, may now require a significant military effort due to increased Ukrainian capabilities. Experts believe Putin's main objective is to weaken the pro-Western government in Kyiv and discredit Western policies. Moscow's focus in Ukraine's east appears to be strengthening the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics, according to the International Crisis Group. According to the International Crisis Group, Moscow has been funding pensions, social benefits, and salaries in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, with daily activities controlled by Russian ministries. This indicates a shift towards turning the conflict into a frozen one, with no resolution in sight and Russia maintaining control over the border. The lack of progress in Ukraine may lead to the DPR and LPR seeking more independence from Moscow, potentially uniting into one entity. This could escalate Russian aggression in Ukraine. Some suggest that DPR leaders may resort to military conflict with LPR to secure more territory, while others believe Putin may push for an election in Donbas to weaken European resolve on sanctions. Some Europeans had suggested lifting sanctions on Russia incrementally as parts of Minsk-2 are implemented, but the EU extended sanctions until July 2017. Observers believe Putin may see an opportunity with the incoming U.S. administration for a compromise that aligns with his goals for the Donbas region. Moscow's strategy involves reintegrating Donbas into Ukraine, electing pro-Russia legislators to gain leverage in Kyiv, and controlling a bloc of votes in the Rada to block reform progress. Putin's strategy involves controlling a bloc of votes in the Rada to block reform progress and force Kyiv to reintegrate the politically poisoned Donbas region into Ukraine, potentially leading to criticism from the West. This move could threaten Ukraine's sovereignty and democracy. Some, including the United States and Europe, push Ukraine to implement Minsk-2 to pressure Moscow for a settlement. Despite economic challenges, Moscow remains committed to supporting separatists for destabilizing Ukraine and reversing its Western orientation. Observers believe that EU and U.S. pressure on Ukraine to comply with Minsk-2 is misplaced, as they doubt the intentions of pro-Russia separatists and the Kremlin. Ukrainian war hero Naydia Savchenko welcomed a Minsk cease-fire agreement but disagreed with key aspects of the deal. Savchenko faced criticism for meeting with separatist representatives in Minsk. Roman Sohn, a columnist for Ukrainska Pravda, criticized the Minsk-2 agreement as a \"farce\" used by U.S. and EU leaders to avoid conflict in Europe at Ukraine's expense. He highlighted Putin's pressure on Ukraine to fulfill the agreement while ignoring separatist non-compliance. EU pressure on Ukraine was evident during a meeting with President Poroshenko in February 2016. In February 2016, European leaders met with President Poroshenko to discuss reforms in Ukraine, particularly focusing on constitutional changes for the Donbas region. Pressure was also placed on Ukraine to uphold the Minsk agreement, with warnings of potential collapse of EU sanctions against Russia. This pressure has raised questions about European motivations and the implications of rewarding separatists in Ukraine. Since the Europeans met with President Poroshenko in February 2016 to discuss reforms in Ukraine, pressure has been placed on Kyiv to uphold the Minsk agreement. Russia's actions in Crimea and eastern Ukraine continue to violate OSCE principles, causing resentment towards the West and raising doubts about Europe's commitment to the rule of law. Amending Ukraine's constitution to appease separatists could lead to accusations of treason against Rada members. The International Crisis Group report on Ukraine questions Europe's commitment to the rule of law and the priority of lasting peace versus implementing the Minsk agreement. Various experts suggest that the Minsk agreement is flawed and may need to be replaced with a better solution. Former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine John Herbst acknowledges the flaws in Minsk-2 but argues it is currently the only option available. The EU has prioritized Ukraine for political and economic integration, aiming for eventual membership. The initial protests in 2013 led to the collapse of the Yanukovych regime. In response, the EU unveiled a support package of \u20ac11 billion, including \u20ac1.6 billion in loans for Ukraine's government. The EU provided \u20ac11 billion in support to Ukraine, including \u20ac2.2 billion in loans and \u20ac1.5 billion in grant aid. The package also includes \u20ac9 billion in financing from the EIB and EBRD for infrastructure projects. Additionally, \u20ac110 million is allocated for developing the private sector. The Association Agreement is the EU's main instrument to deepen economic ties with Ukraine and promote European values. The Association Agreement (AA) between the EU and Ukraine includes a free-trade agreement, known as a deep and comprehensive free trade agreement (DCFTA). It requires Ukraine to adopt EU legislation and standards, potentially leading to increased foreign investment. The EU and Ukraine signed the political parts of the AA in March 2014 and the economic parts, including the DCFTA, in June 27. Ratification was initially delayed due to Russian threats, but both parliaments eventually ratified the agreement. The EU and Ukraine ratified the Association Agreement on September 16, 2014. Moscow responded by closing off imports of selected Ukrainian products. Implementation of the DCFTA was postponed until 2016, with Ukraine receiving unilateral trade preferences from the EU. The agreement partially came into effect on January 1, 2016, pending ratification by all 28 EU member states. In April 2016, Dutch voters rejected the agreement, leading to negotiations for a compromise. The Netherlands clarified that the Association Agreement (AA) with Ukraine is not a path to EU membership or a guarantee of military aid. The EU Council accepted Dutch proposals, pending ratification by the Dutch parliament. The AA offers economic benefits to Ukraine, triggering Russia to suspend its free-trade deal and ban Ukrainian food imports. The EU also established support mechanisms like an Investment Forum and Ukraine Support Group. The EU established a dedicated Ukraine Support Group to provide advice and support in reform sectors, modernized Ukraine's gas transit system, and worked on reversing pipeline flows. They also agreed to accelerate the Visa Liberalization Action Plan for Ukrainians to travel in the EU. However, there are concerns about growing disenchantment with Europe in Ukraine due to anti-EU messages promoted by oligarch-run media outlets and populist leaders. Some in Ukraine believe key EU member states are delaying promises, leading to anti-EU sentiments. The US and EU condemned Russia's actions in Crimea and imposed sanctions to press for a political settlement with Ukraine. EU imposed sanctions after Crimea's referendum to join Russia. The EU imposed sanctions on Russian and Ukrainian figures involved in Crimea's annexation to Russia, adding more names by May 2014. The US suspended bilateral cooperation with Russia but did not target Putin's inner circle like the EU. The US suspended projects and law enforcement cooperation with Russia under the U.S.-Russia Bilateral Presidential Commission, redirecting funding to aid Ukraine. Additional restrictions were placed on defense-related exports to Russia, and visa bans and asset freezes were imposed on individuals undermining democratic processes in Ukraine. Executive orders expanded sanctions, targeting senior figures from Russia and Crimea. The EU expanded sanctions against Russia in response to the Malaysian Airlines tragedy on July 17, 2014. This included freezing assets of individuals in key sectors like financial services, energy, and defense. Sanctions were further strengthened in September 2014. The EU expanded sanctions against Russia in response to the Malaysian Airlines tragedy in July 2014, freezing assets in key sectors. Sanctions were further strengthened in September 2014 after a Russian-supported offensive in Ukraine. Despite efforts to minimize economic harm, some European business sectors have been affected, while Russia has implemented counter-sanctions, impacting European economies. The US and EU have continued to add and extend sanctions on Russia since January 2015. In January 2015, the US and EU extended sanctions on Russian individuals and entities. Key sectoral sanctions were renewed until January 2017. EU member states debated the sanctions' effectiveness at an EU Council meeting in October 2016. Some countries believe the sanctions have not influenced Russia's policies towards Ukraine and advocate for easing or lifting them. Italy, Greece, Cyprus, and Hungary are among the more skeptical nations. Several European countries, including Italy, Greece, Cyprus, and Hungary, have expressed skepticism towards the sanctions on Russia. The French General Assembly and Senate passed resolutions urging the French government to support lifting the sanctions. European Commission President Juncker met with President Putin in 2016, indicating the EU's intention to renew the sanctions. However, there are calls from countries like Poland and the Baltic states to maintain pressure on Moscow. Germany, under pressure from its business community, is seeking EU consensus on Russia while addressing the Ukraine crisis. German Foreign Minister Steinmeier suggested a gradual reduction of sanctions on Russia, despite Merkel's stance on maintaining them until positive actions are taken in resolving the Ukraine conflict. Verhofstadt emphasized the importance of EU unity in keeping sanctions until the Minsk agreement is fully implemented, including the withdrawal of Russian forces from Ukraine. The EU extended sanctions on Russia until July 2107, requiring unanimous vote among member states. Concerns exist about US support for sanctions. Easing sanctions could harm Europe's credibility and be a major loss for Ukraine. On September 1, 2016, the U.S. updated sanctions targeting activities related to the conflict in Ukraine, adding 37 individuals, 11 Crimean officials, subsidiaries of Gazprom, and companies in Crimea. In December 2016, 15 Russian individuals and companies were blacklisted for dealings in Crimea. The U.S. updated sanctions in September 2016, targeting activities related to the conflict in Ukraine.

NATO and allied advisers are assisting Ukraine in defense issues, capacity building, professional development, and demining operations. NATO and its allies are supporting Ukraine in disposing of obsolete weapons and mines. The Alliance has established trust funds for various purposes, including cyber defense and military rehabilitation. The U.S.-Ukraine Charter on Strategic Partnership emphasizes cooperation in defense, security, economics, and democracy. The United States is committed to enhancing engagement between Ukraine, the EU, and NATO. The United States strongly supports Ukraine's alignment with the West, providing financial and technical assistance for reform and anticorruption efforts. Recent visits by high-level officials reaffirmed this commitment, including the approval of a $1 billion loan guarantee. Ukraine has also been granted market economy status by the United States. The United States has granted Ukraine market economy status, making it the 80th largest goods trading partner with $2.2 billion in total goods trade in 2014. U.S. exports to Ukraine include coal, machinery, vehicles, agricultural products, fish, and aircraft, while imports include iron, steel, chemicals, oil, and aircraft. The U.S. has provided over $4 billion in aid to Ukraine from FY1990 to FY2012 and committed more than $1.3 billion since 2013 to support reforms and democratic institutions.

In FY16, the United States plans to provide Ukraine with military equipment including HMMWVs, thermal goggles, night vision devices, secure radios, Explosive Ordnance Disposal robots, counter-mortar radars, and up-armored civilian SUVs. The aim is to train and equip Ukraine's border guards, military, and coast guard to secure its borders, defend against attacks, and deter illicit smuggling. The U.S.-Ukraine defense relationship is transitioning to a lasting partnership focused on developing NATO-interoperable Ukrainian Armed Forces. This partnership aims to help Ukraine's security forces preserve territorial integrity, deepen defense reforms, and improve resource management. The United States has announced a $335 million bilateral security assistance package for Ukraine in FY2016. The $335 million bilateral security assistance package for Ukraine in FY2016 includes training for Ukrainian conventional and special operations forces, equipment such as radars and UAVs, and advisers for defense reforms. On July 28, 2016, 24 RQ-11B Raven Unmanned Aircraft Systems arrived in Ukraine as part of ongoing security assistance efforts. The Raven UAV System provides reconnaissance and surveillance capabilities, transmitting live video and location information to ground control stations. Ukrainian soldiers have completed training on the drones, but reports suggest they have been less effective than anticipated against Russian electronic warfare and rebel artillery. The Multinational Joint Commission on Defense Reform and Security Cooperation with Ukraine, led by the United States, assesses Ukrainian requirements and prioritizes training, equipment, and advisory initiatives. The United States and Ukraine host military exercises each year to enhance interoperability and strengthen regional security. Ukraine also participates in U.S.-hosted exercises in Europe. In early September 2016, Secretary of Defense Ash Carter signed a bilateral partner concept with Ukrainian Minister of Defense Stepan Poltorak to enhance Ukraine's defense capacity, advance defense reforms, improve resource management, and boost defense technology cooperation. General John Abizaid (Ret.) was named as a senior defense adviser to Ukraine. The U.S. Congress has been active in providing assistance to Ukraine and supporting sanctions against Russia for its actions in Crimea and destabilizing Ukraine. The House passed a resolution urging the US and EU to work together for a peaceful resolution in Ukraine, with the possibility of sanctions against Ukrainian leaders if violence occurs. President Obama later signed a law authorizing aid and security assistance to Ukraine. The US provided security assistance to Ukraine and other Eastern European countries, imposed visa bans and asset seizures on individuals in Ukraine and Russia responsible for violence, and required increased broadcasting in eastern Ukraine, Crimea, and Moldova. Additional legislation included urging NATO allies and EU member states to suspend military cooperation with Russia and imposing sanctions on Russian and Ukrainian officials complicit in intervention in Ukraine. The Ukrainian Freedom Support Act (P.L. 113-272) passed near the end of the 113th Congress called for increased pressure on Russia by targeting specific entities and prohibiting various activities, including access to the U.S. banking system and entry into the United States. The Ukrainian Freedom Support Act authorized the President to target Russian financial institutions and foreign financial institutions involved in Russia's defense and energy sectors. Congress debated supplying defensive weapons to Ukraine, with some members supporting providing man-portable anti-tank weapons and other nonlethal assistance like secure communications equipment and reconnaissance drones. In February 2015, a bipartisan group of Senators urged President Obama to take action. In 2015, a bipartisan group of Senators urged President Obama to provide defensive military equipment and financial aid to Ukraine to counter Russian aggression. Advocates argued that sanctions alone were insufficient, while opponents feared escalation of violence if Ukraine was armed. In 2015, a bipartisan group of Senators urged President Obama to provide defensive military equipment and financial aid to Ukraine to counter Russian aggression. Some experts warned that arming Ukraine could lead to escalation and a new Cold War, potentially hindering U.S.-Russian cooperation and splitting Western unity on Russia policy. Congress supported enhanced security assistance for Ukraine in the 2015, 2016, and 2017 Defense Authorization Acts, authorizing up to $350 million in FY2017, with a requirement for Ukraine to take substantial action on defense reforms before full funding is released. The U.S. House adopted the STAND for Ukraine Act (H.R. 5094) on September 21, 2016, addressing the crisis in Ukraine by clarifying the U.S. position on Russia's illegal occupation of Crimea and tightening sanctions. The legislation links sanctions relief to Russia fulfilling obligations under the Minsk Agreement, makes Crimea-related sanctions permanent, enforces sanctions with an anti-evasion framework, and aims to drive private-sector investment to Ukraine while restricting Russia from buying defense equipment from NATO allies. The Senate introduced a version of the act to clamp down on Russia buying defense equipment from NATO allies, target human rights abuses in Russian-occupied areas, and counter Russian propaganda. Ukraine faces challenges in political discord and reform efforts, with doubts among the public regarding the reform agenda. Prime Minister Groysman has shown strength in tackling corruption issues. Prime Minister Groysman has shown a strong commitment to reform and has faced challenges from powerful oligarchs trying to stall the reform agenda. Instability has increased, and his government may face a no-confidence measure in 2017 if these challenges are not quickly overcome. The United States and Europe want to avoid a new national election in 2017 in Ukraine, fearing a strong challenge from opposition forces supported by Moscow. The major challenges for Kyiv include eastern Ukraine and Vladimir Putin's view that Ukraine is not a legitimate state. As long as Moscow maintains this attitude, the conflict will persist despite Western efforts. The fighting between Russian-supported separatists and the Ukrainian military along the demarcation line continues, with occasional flare-ups despite attempts at cease-fires. The OSCE reports weapons crossing from Russia, leading to concerns about the Minsk-2 agreement being honored. Analysts believe large-scale fighting is unlikely in the short term, but the region is evolving into a frozen conflict. The separatist rebels in the Donbas show no signs of moving towards a cease-fire. The separatist rebels in the Donbas are not progressing in implementing the Minsk-2 agreement beyond the cease-fire. Elections in the disputed territory may not be free or fair, raising doubts about OSCE monitoring access. The stalemate in the Donbas is widening the gap within Ukraine on implementing the agreement. Putin may try to stir up political chaos in Kyiv or push for flawed elections in Ukraine. European leaders suggest reducing sanctions incrementally as parts of the Minsk-2 agreement are met, which could be seen as progress by Putin. Poroshenko and Groysman face a dilemma on whether to accept these developments. The dilemma facing Poroshenko and Groysman in Ukraine is whether to accept the Kremlin's conditions, which could weaken European resolve on sanctions. The new U.S. administration's stance is also uncertain, with potential implications for EU solidarity and Ukraine's relationship with Moscow. Progress in economic and reform efforts could bring stability but also pose challenges for Kyiv. Continued success in reform, EU sanctions on Russia until July 2017, and NATO deployments in Eastern Europe could provoke Putin's reaction. Putin may escalate conflict in eastern Ukraine to hinder reforms and create opposition to the government. Kremlin's disinformation and cyberattacks could intensify before national elections in the spring. Increased support to opposition political groups could pressure the Groysman government. Putin may offer deals to the US administration to create rifts with Brussels, posing risks to stability in Ukraine. Sanctions on Russia have been escalating since its annexation of Crimea, with asset freezes on Russian officials announced in March 2014. The US Administration imposed asset freezes on high-ranking Russian officials, wealthy businessmen in Putin's inner circle, and Bank Rossiya. Additional sanctions were placed on senior officials like Igor Sechin and 17 entities linked to sanctioned persons. Visa bans were also implemented, likely including those under asset freezes. On July 16, 2014, the United States imposed sanctions on key firms in Russia's financial, energy, and military technology sectors. This included Gazprombank, Vnesheconombank (VEB), Novatek, and Rosneft. Additional companies like Bank of Moscow, VTB Bank, and Russian Agricultural Bank were added to the list in July 27. Sanctions were also imposed on United Shipbuilding Company. In September 2014, more Russian companies were targeted in response to the separatist offensive in Ukraine. On December 19, 2014, the President issued an executive order to bar any U.S. person from participating in new investment in Crimea and imports/exports to the region. The EU also imposed sanctions on Russia's financial, defense, and energy sectors, including individuals in Putin's inner circle. These sanctions were strengthened in response to a Russian-supported offensive in Ukraine. The EU imposed sanctions on Russian state-owned banks, defense companies, and energy companies, restricting trade in financial instruments and services for oil exploration. They also added persons to their travel ban and asset freeze list, with sanctions on Crimea and considering more for support of separatists in Ukraine. The US Administration added 29 individuals and 33 entities to its sanctions list in September 2015, targeting those with ties to Kremlin-linked insiders and companies involved in the separatist offensive in eastern Ukraine. The sanctions included individuals like Gennady Timchenko and companies like Rosneft and Kalashnikov. In September 2016, the Department of the Treasury updated the sanctions list to target activities related to the conflict in Ukraine, adding 37 individuals to the list. The US imposed new sanctions related to the conflict in Ukraine, targeting 37 individuals, subsidiaries of Gazprom, companies in Crimea, officials, and companies involved in infrastructure projects. Additionally, 15 Russian individuals and companies were blacklisted for their activities in Crimea and Ukraine, including the construction of a bridge connecting Russia to Crimea. The sanctions also targeted individuals associated with Putin or involved in destabilizing Ukraine."
