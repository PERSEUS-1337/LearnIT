    "content": "The federal role in cybersecurity is complex, involving securing federal systems and protecting nonfederal systems. Various statutes address cybersecurity, including The Counterfeit Access Device and Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1984, The Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, and The Computer Security Act of 1987. These acts prohibit attacks on federal computer systems, unauthorized eavesdropping, and establish security standards for federal computer systems. The federal government has implemented various cybersecurity statutes over the years. The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 assigned cybersecurity policy development to the Office of Management and Budget. The Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 established agency heads' responsibility for information security and created the chief information officer position. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 expanded the Department of Homeland Security's cybersecurity responsibilities. The Cyber Security Research and Development Act of 2002 allocated cybersecurity research duties to the National Science Foundation and NIST. The E-Government Act of 2002, along with the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002, established cybersecurity requirements for federal IT management. Over 40 other laws also have provisions related to cybersecurity, with proposed revisions. Numerous cybersecurity bills have been introduced in recent Congresses, aiming to update current laws and standards. Several bills propose revisions to current laws, with four bills specifically focusing on cybersecurity being enacted at the end of the 113th Congress. Federal agencies have cybersecurity responsibilities for their own systems and sector-specific responsibilities for critical infrastructure. DHS is the primary civil-sector cybersecurity agency, NIST develops cybersecurity standards, and the Department of Justice enforces laws related to cybersecurity. The Justice Department enforces cybersecurity laws, while agencies like NSF, NIST, and DHS conduct R&D in cybersecurity. NSA is the main cybersecurity agency in national security, with U.S. Cyber Command handling military cyberspace operations. The Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative was established in 2008. The Obama Administration released a description of the 12 subinitiatives in March 2010, focusing on consolidating access points, deploying intrusion detection systems, improving research coordination, developing next-generation technology, and clarifying the federal role in protecting critical infrastructure. The Administration appointed the first White House Cybersecurity Coordinator in December 2009, but the coordinator has limited control over agency budgets. Some argue that operational entities like the NSA have more influence in cybersecurity activities. In April 2010, OMB implemented automated monitoring of federal information systems. In July 2010, operational responsibilities were delegated to DHS. In December 2011, FedRAMP was established for cloud-computing cybersecurity. In April 2011, a legislative proposal was sent to Congress. President Obama issued Executive Order 13636 in February 2013 to improve critical infrastructure cybersecurity. In February 2013, President Obama issued Executive Order 13636 to improve critical infrastructure cybersecurity by expanding information sharing, prioritizing critical infrastructure protection, developing cybersecurity standards, and assessing regulatory requirements. This was accompanied by a presidential policy directive (PPD-21) aimed at enhancing integration and efficiency in CI security policy. Legislative proposals on cybersecurity have focused on 10 broad areas. Legislative proposals on cybersecurity in recent Congresses have addressed issues in 10 key areas, including protection of critical infrastructure, information sharing, federal agency responsibilities, FISMA reform, R&D, cybersecurity workforce, data breaches, cybercrime penalties, national cybersecurity strategy, and international efforts. Despite previous lack of enactment, there is support for significant legislation in these areas from the House, Senate, and White House. In recent Congresses, bills addressing cybersecurity have been introduced in various areas. The House and Senate have taken different approaches, with the House focusing on narrower bills and the Senate on more comprehensive legislation. Four bills passed both chambers in the 113th Congress, focusing on protecting federal civilian information systems and DHS activities. In October 2011, a House Republican Cybersecurity Task Force released recommendations for House committees. In June, a Task Force Report with cybersecurity recommendations was released for House committees. Several House bills addressing cybersecurity issues were passed in April 2012, including Cybersecurity Enhancement Act, Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act, Advancing America's Networking and Information Technology Research and Development Act, and Federal Information Security Amendments Act. The Security Amendments Act of 2012 (H.R. 4257) and the Promoting and Enhancing Cybersecurity and Information Sharing Effectiveness Act of 2011 (H.R. 3674) addressed cybersecurity issues in the 112th Congress. Other introduced bills covered various cybersecurity topics such as protection of critical infrastructure, information sharing, education, workforce, research, data breaches, and cybercrime. In April 2013, four bills from the 112th Congress were reintroduced and passed with amendments, including the Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2013 (H.R. 756) and the Cyber Intelligence Sharing Act. In April 2013, several cybersecurity bills were passed by the House, including the Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2013 (H.R. 756), Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (H.R. 624), Advancing America's Networking and Information Technology Research and Development Act of 2013 (H.R. 967), and Federal Information Security Amendments Act of 2013 (H.R. 1163). Additionally, in July 2014, four more cybersecurity bills passed, addressing topics such as critical infrastructure research and development, cybersecurity workforce, and secure federal websites. In 2014, H.R. 3635 required secure certification for federal websites collecting personal information before deployment. H.R. 3696 provided cybersecurity authorities to DHS, including protection of federal systems and information sharing. Other bills addressed various cybersecurity issues like critical infrastructure protection, data breaches, and cybercrime. Several cybersecurity bills were proposed in Congress, including S. 2105, S. 3414, S. 3342, and others addressing data breaches and cybercrime. S. 3342 was debated in July 2012, but cloture motions failed in August and November. In 2014, several cybersecurity bills were reported out of committee, such as the Cybersecurity Act of 2013 (S. 1353). Several cybersecurity bills were reported out of committee in 2014, including the Cybersecurity Act of 2013 (S. 1353) addressing federal cybersecurity R&D, workforce, and public/private partnerships; DHS Cybersecurity Workforce Recruitment and Retention Act of 2014 (S. 2354) providing DHS with additional workforce authority; National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center Act of 2014 (S. 2519) establishing an information sharing center in DHS; Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (S. 2521) addressing FISMA reform; and Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2014 (S. 2588) focusing on information sharing and coordination. S. 2354 was added as an amendment to S. 1691, the Border Patrol Agent Pay Reform Act of 2014, which passed the Senate in September 2014. Several cybersecurity bills were debated and enacted in the 113th Congress in December 2014. The bills addressed a range of cybersecurity issues including protection of critical infrastructure, information sharing, workforce, data breaches, cyberespionage, and cybercrime. Four bills were enacted, including the CIRDA Act (H.R. 2952) with an amendment requiring an assessment of the DHS cybersecurity workforce, S. 1691 which provides DHS with additional cybersecurity workforce authority, S. 2519 establishing an information sharing center in DHS, and S. 2521. In the 113th Congress, several cybersecurity bills were debated and enacted in December 2014. The bills addressed various cybersecurity issues such as protection of critical infrastructure, information sharing, workforce, data breaches, cyberespionage, and cybercrime. Legislative proposals in recent Congresses have taken different approaches to address cybersecurity issues, including FISMA reform and DHS authorities for protection of federal systems. Bills in the 113th Congress focused on topics like sharing cybersecurity information, cybersecurity workforce, research and development, and other related issues. The Obama Administration has identified 16 sectors of critical infrastructure (CI), much of which is owned by the private sector. The federal role in protection of privately held CI has been contentious in the cybersecurity legislation debate. Additional actions are needed to address cybersecurity risks to CI, but there is disagreement on the need for federal regulation. Legislative proposals like S. 2105 and the White House Proposal have addressed protection of privately held CI. S. 2105 requires a sector-by-sector risk assessment for critical infrastructure entities to prioritize designations, determine necessary cybersecurity requirements, develop regulations, and enforce compliance. Owners and operators would need to certify compliance annually or face civil penalties. S. 3414 revises S. 2105 to establish a federal interagency. S. 3414 revises S. 2105 by establishing a federal interagency council to perform risk assessments, identify critical cyber infrastructure, adopt recommended practices, and provide incentives for voluntary adoption. It allows federal regulatory agencies to require adopted practices by CI entities they regulate and establishes a voluntary certification program for compliance. Third-party assessments are required, with the council authorized to perform assessments when risks justify it. The White House Proposal and Task Force Report recommended additional regulation for highly regulated industries to improve cybersecurity, while suggesting voluntary incentives for most critical infrastructure. Compliance plans, independent evaluations, and limited liability were key components of the proposed regulations. Shutdown orders and specific enforcement measures were prohibited. The subcommittee version of H.R. 3674 proposed continuous risk assessments of critical infrastructure (CI) and required federal agencies to review cybersecurity regulations for CI. It aimed to fill gaps using consensus standards and prohibited additional regulatory authority. The full-committee version allowed the Secretary to engage in protective activities for privately held CI only upon request. The bills in the 113th Congress focused on cybersecurity for critical infrastructure (CI) systems. They did not grant additional authority to DHS but included criminal penalties for damage to CI computers. The bills also included information-sharing provisions for CI protection. H.R. 3696 and S. 1353 proposed a process led by NIST similar to Executive Order 13636, while H.R. 3696 and S. 2519 provided statutory authority and responsibilities for the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration. The National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) responsibilities were stipulated by S. 2519 in December 2014. H.R. 3696 would give DHS coordination responsibilities across critical infrastructure sectors for cybersecurity activities and incident response. Barriers to information sharing on cybersecurity threats have hindered effective protection of critical infrastructure systems. The traditional approach to cybersecurity emphasizes secrecy and confidentiality, hindering information sharing. Proposals to reduce barriers have raised concerns about risks to privacy, free speech, and misuse of information. Several legislative proposals aim to improve information sharing and address cybersecurity threats. Several legislative proposals aimed to improve information sharing and address cybersecurity threats by creating entities for information sharing, including a nongovernmental clearinghouse for sharing cybersecurity information among private-sector and government entities. The Task Force Report recommended the establishment of a National Information Sharing Organization (NISO) for this purpose. The DHS National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) was established in 2009 with statutory authorization and specified governance. Legislative proposals like S. 2151 and S. 3342 aimed to enhance information sharing by listing existing centers. Various bills, including H.R. 3523, S. 2102, and S. 3414, focused on sharing classified cybersecurity information with private-sector entities. H.R. 3523 also allowed cybersecurity providers to share threat information. H.R. 3523, S. 2102, S. 2105, S. 3414, S. 2151, and S. 3342 proposed various measures to enhance information sharing for cybersecurity purposes among federal and nonfederal entities. These bills allowed for the sharing of threat information with designated entities, cybersecurity centers, and private-sector entities, with restrictions on usage for cybersecurity and law enforcement purposes. S. 2151 and S. 3342 proposed measures for sharing threat information with cybersecurity centers and federal entities. S. 2151 required providers to share threat information related to federal contracts, while S. 3342 focused on informing federal entities of significant incidents impacting their missions. The White House Proposal allowed nonfederal entities to disclose information to cybersecurity centers for protection purposes. The Task Force Report, H.R. 3523, H.R. 3674, H.R. 624, S. 2102, S. 2105, S. 2151, S. 3342, S. 3414, and the White House Proposal aimed to restrict disclosure of cybersecurity information for specified purposes and limit government use of shared information. The legislative proposals aimed to restrict disclosure of cybersecurity information for specified purposes and limit government use of shared information. They also sought to limit liability for information sharing and protect nonfederal entities from liability for sharing information. The legislative proposals aimed to restrict disclosure of cybersecurity information and limit government use of shared information. They also sought to protect nonfederal entities from liability for sharing information and provide privacy and civil liberties protections. The Task Force Report recommended prioritizing personal privacy in information sharing safe harbors and proposed a privacy board for the nongovernmental clearinghouse. The bill aimed to minimize impacts on privacy and civil liberties by creating policies and procedures for sharing information. It required reports on implementation and prohibited federal use of certain identifying information. Additionally, it proposed including privacy and civil liberties representatives on the NISO board and implementing anonymization procedures. The bill aimed to protect privacy and civil liberties by implementing policies for information sharing. It required the appointment of a privacy officer, guidelines for protection, and compliance with federal regulations. Reports assessing impacts and minimizing information sharing impacts were also mandated. The bill required assessments by privacy officers and the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, along with reports on noncompliance and recommendations for statutory changes. It also mandated the development of procedures for sharing information while considering privacy and civil liberties. The bills aimed to protect privacy and civil liberties through anonymization and other means, with efforts to limit impacts from sharing. They required biennial reports on the impact of shared information on privacy and civil liberties, steps to reduce impact, and recommended changes. The White House Proposal emphasized removing information that could identify individuals unrelated to cybersecurity threats and proposed a new section on privacy and civil liberties in the HSA. It mandated the development of policies and procedures on information access and disclosure in consultation with privacy experts. The White House Proposal required the development of policies and procedures to minimize impacts on privacy and civil liberties, safeguard identities, protect confidentiality, and establish limits on information access, use, and disclosure. Agency heads were mandated to develop compliance programs, enforce sanctions for violations, and obtain approval from the Attorney General. Annual reports to Congress by privacy officers and the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board were also required. The Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board report recommends statutory changes for information sharing. Bills in the 113th Congress, H.R. 624 and S. 2588, focus on sharing classified cybersecurity information with private-sector entities. These bills establish procedures for sharing threat information and allowing the use and sharing of countermeasures. S. 2588 and H.R. 624 aim to facilitate sharing cybersecurity information with designated entities at DHS and DOJ, allowing for information sharing among federal entities for cybersecurity and law enforcement purposes. The bills establish policies for information provision and specify the process for receipt and sharing of information. They also provide exemptions from the Freedom of Information Act for cybersecurity information and restrict disclosure to specified cybersecurity purposes. Additionally, the bills limit government use of shared information to specified purposes. H.R. 624 and S. 2588 aim to restrict regulatory use of shared information for cybersecurity and law enforcement purposes, including protection from physical harm and sexual exploitation. The bills also limit liability for information sharing and provide for privacy and civil liberties protections. The bills H.R. 624 and S. 2588 aim to minimize impacts on privacy and civil liberties by creating policies and procedures for sharing information. They prohibit federal use of identifying information from certain records and require guidelines for handling threat information. Reports on implementation and impacts on privacy and civil liberties are also mandated. S. 2588 and H.R. 624 require reports assessing impacts on privacy and civil liberties, with specific provisions for cybersecurity activities and information sharing. S. 2588 differs from previous bills by not focusing on cybersecurity exchanges and having less restrictive monitoring and countermeasure authorizations. The DHS's role in cybersecurity has been a topic of debate, with some proposals aiming to enhance its authorities. Various legislative proposals have suggested different ways to address DHS's responsibilities for federal information systems. H.R. 3674 and other proposals would have provided specific authorities and responsibilities to DHS for risk assessments and protective capabilities. The legislative proposals aimed to enhance DHS's cybersecurity authorities by creating a new center with a Senate-confirmed director responsible for federal cybersecurity efforts, information security policies, risk assessments, and incident response coordination. The White House Proposal differed by giving enhanced authority to the DHS Secretary instead of creating a new center, but still required the establishment of a center for protecting federal information systems and facilitating information sharing. H.R. 3674 would have established a DHS center for information sharing and technical assistance. The legislative proposals aimed to enhance DHS's cybersecurity authorities by establishing a new center with a Senate-confirmed director responsible for federal cybersecurity efforts, information security policies, risk assessments, and incident response coordination. S. 2151 and S. 3342 would have authorized DHS to protect federal systems through risk assessments and access to agency information-system traffic. S. 2519 and H.R. 3696 would add provisions on DHS cybersecurity authorities to Title II of HSA, providing statutory authority and responsibilities for the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC). The Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA) was enacted to protect civilian federal information systems. S. 2521, enacted in December, provides DHS operational authority to enforce FISMA requirements. Several legislative proposals in the 112th Congress aimed to revise FISMA, addressing criticisms such as a focus on procedure and reporting rather than operational security, lack of cybersecurity metrics, and variations in agency interpretation of mandates. The White House Proposal and other legislative proposals aimed to revise FISMA by retaining key requirements for agency-wide information security programs, annual independent reviews, reports on program effectiveness, and continuous monitoring of agency systems. There were differences in who would be responsible for developing cybersecurity standards and overseeing federal information-security policy. The White House Proposal and legislative proposals aimed to transfer information security policy authorities from OMB to DHS or Commerce. Different proposals had varying approaches, with only H.R. 4257 retaining OMB's power for enforcement. New protective authorities were proposed for the Secretary of Homeland Security, including intrusion detection and directing agencies to take protective measures. The White House Proposal and legislative proposals aimed to transfer information security policy authorities from OMB to DHS or Commerce. H.R. 4257 retained OMB's power for enforcement, while S. 2151 and S. 3342 had provisions for incident reporting and information sharing within DHS. H.R. 3635 and S. 2521 propose measures for cybersecurity, including website security certification and DHS oversight of agency systems. S. 2521 revises FISMA to grant DHS statutory authority for cybersecurity, but does not mandate continuous monitoring of information systems. The enacted version of S. 2521 includes compromise language on continuous monitoring and clarifies the roles of OMB, DHS, and agencies. Various proposals aim to address concerns about the cybersecurity workforce, such as providing additional federal hiring authorities and assessing workforce needs. The White House Proposal includes workforce-related provisions in various bills in the 113th Congress to assess workforce needs, establish educational programs for cybersecurity professionals, and use public/private-sector personnel exchanges. Some bills aim to provide additional DHS hiring and compensation authorities and establish federal occupation categories for cybersecurity. The 113th Congress introduced bills to address cybersecurity workforce needs, establish federal occupation categories, and enhance educational programs for cybersecurity professionals. This included provisions for the NSF/DHS Scholarship-for-Service program, cybersecurity competitions, and a study of existing education and certification programs. Additionally, the Cybersecurity Research and Development Act of 2002 focused on cybersecurity R&D by NSF and NIST. The Cybersecurity Research and Development Act of 2002 (H.Rept. 107-305, H.Rept. 107-355) focuses on cybersecurity R&D by NSF and NIST. While the Homeland Security Act of 2002 does not specifically mention cybersecurity R&D, DHS and other agencies make significant investments in it. Various legislative proposals have addressed cybersecurity R&D, with agencies like DHS, NIST, and NSF accounting for funding and research topics such as threat detection, identity management, and supply-chain security. The Task Force Report and various legislative proposals addressed planning and coordination of research among federal agencies for cybersecurity R&D. The White House Proposal included cybersecurity R&D requirements for the Secretary of Homeland Security. Provisions in H.R. 756 and H.R. 967 are similar to bills from the 112th Congress. H.R. 2952 focuses on DHS R&D strategic planning and public-private consortiums. In the 113th Congress, legislation is being proposed for cybersecurity R&D strategic planning, public-private consortiums, and data breach notification requirements. In the 113th Congress, legislation is being proposed to address data breaches in federal information systems. Several bills have been introduced to tackle data breaches more broadly, with a hearing held on S. 1927 in February 2014. Defense-related cybersecurity bills and laws also contain provisions related to cybersecurity. In the 113th Congress, cybersecurity legislation includes provisions for contractors to share information about cyberattacks with the contracting agency. Bills such as H.R. 4310 and S. 1681 require defense and Intelligence Community contractors to notify DOD of cyberattacks. S. 2410 would mandate sharing information if the attack is by a known or suspected advanced persistent threat actor. Additionally, there are provisions on technological and workforce aspects of cybersecurity at DOD, U.S. Cyber Command, and the National Guard in various bills. In the 113th Congress, cybersecurity legislation addressed various topics such as requiring NIST to develop a strategy for federal use of cloud computing and implementing data center consolidation consistent with cybersecurity standards. The White House Proposal aimed to restrict state and local governments' power to mandate data center locations. CRS identified over 50 potentially relevant statutes for revision. In the 113th Congress, cybersecurity legislation addressed topics like NIST developing a strategy for federal cloud computing use and data center consolidation. Over 50 statutes were identified for potential revision, with proposed updates for most. The report includes entries with statute names, public law numbers, and discussions on cybersecurity relevance and suggested revisions. Entries are in chronological order and focus on specific proposals for revising existing statutes, not new provisions. Examples include recommendations for data-breach notification language in the White House Proposal and Task Force Report. In the 113th Congress, cybersecurity legislation addressed topics like NIST developing a strategy for federal cloud computing use and data center consolidation. Over 50 statutes were identified for potential revision, with proposed updates for most. The report includes entries with statute names, public law numbers, and discussions on cybersecurity relevance and suggested revisions. Entries are in chronological order and focus on specific proposals for revising existing statutes, not new provisions. Examples include recommendations for data-breach notification language in the White House Proposal and Task Force Report. The House Proposal and Task Force Report, along with bills introduced in the 112th Congress, did not specify named statutes to be revised. One bill, S. 1151, would have revised 18 U.S.C. Chapter 47 by adding a new section, but it did not modify any named statute specified in the bill or U.S. Code. Another bill, H.R. 5590 from the 111th Congress, had cybersecurity provisions that could be seen as modifications to the HSA but were not cited as such. The report focuses on revising existing statutes related to cybersecurity, with over 50 statutes identified for potential updates. The analysis highlights limitations in naming laws and proposed modifications in the U.S. Code, which may result in gaps in coverage. The approach taken in the report is not considered complete, as some provisions may not be addressed. The analysis discusses restrictions on the use of military forces in civilian law enforcement within the United States, highlighting violations of the act and concerns about military cooperation on cybersecurity with civil agencies. Some suggest amending the act due to difficulties in distinguishing criminal cyberattacks from those involving national defense. Some propose amending the act to clarify when the military can respond to cyber threats on critical infrastructure, while others argue that the President already has the authority to direct military support during domestic disasters. The creation of the Cyber National Mission Force and a DHS-DOD agreement may increase military involvement in responding to cyberattacks, but concerns exist about privacy and civil liberties. The antitrust laws, including Section 5 of the FTC Act, prohibit agreements that unreasonably restrain trade and unfair competition. Sharing information among competitors can raise antitrust concerns due to the risk of collusion. Information-sharing agreements among private corporations may raise concerns about collusion among competitors and may be subject to antitrust scrutiny. However, agreements aimed at combating cybersecurity threats may be compliant with antitrust principles as long as they focus on cybersecurity rather than restraining competition. Some argue that an explicit exemption from antitrust laws is necessary to develop effective cybersecurity agreements. Congress has previously proposed such exemptions, like H.R. 2435 (107th Congress), which would have granted an exemption from antitrust laws for agreements solely for cybersecurity purposes. An antitrust exemption for information sharing on cybersecurity threats has been proposed by Congress to allow private entities to share information without concerns about antitrust laws. H.R. 624 and S. 2588 in the 113th Congress address cybersecurity information sharing among private-sector entities, with S. 2588 expressly exempting such exchanges from antitrust laws. Some argue that antitrust laws are flexible enough to accommodate cybersecurity agreements. The antitrust laws are seen as flexible in relation to information-sharing agreements for cybersecurity threats. Antitrust agencies are involved in reviewing and approving collaboration plans for permissible purposes. The DOJ reviews and approves collaboration plans for cybersecurity threats, issuing business review letters stating non-enforcement of antitrust laws. DOJ and FTC guidance emphasizes that sharing cyber threat information should not raise antitrust concerns. The agency's responsibilities include technical standards and research topics like computer and telecommunication systems. In the 111th Congress, H.R. 4061 passed by the House required NIST to conduct research on identity management and security of information systems. Similar bills were passed in the 112th and 113th Congresses. H.R. 3696 and S. 1353 (113th Congress) would establish a process led by NIST for developing consensus standards for addressing cybersecurity in critical infrastructure. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) was established to regulate interstate sale and transmission of electric power. Concerns about cyberattacks on the electric grid have led to calls for enhancing FERC's authority to address cybersecurity threats, especially with the development of smart-grid technology. Multiple bills were introduced in the 111th Congress to address these issues. Several bills were introduced in the 111th Congress in response to concerns about cyberattacks on the electric grid and the development of smart-grid technology. H.R. 5026, passed by the House, expanded FERC's jurisdiction over electric infrastructure and authorized actions in response to cybersecurity threats. In the 112th Congress, S. 1342 and H.R. 668 aimed to provide FERC with expanded cybersecurity and emergency authorities. In the 113th Congress, H.R. 4298 and S. 2158 were similar to H.R. 5026. The President has authority in a national emergency to control electromagnetic radiations and close communication facilities. Some suggest revising the act to involve the FCC more in cybersecurity. There is debate over whether the President can shut down Internet communications during a war, known as the \"Internet kill switch.\" There has been debate over the need for additional authority or legislation regarding emergency measures by the President in response to cyberattacks on critical infrastructure. Bills in previous Congresses addressed this issue, including provisions to prevent the government from shutting down the Internet. Ch. 343, 61 Stat. 495 50 U.S.C. 401 et seq. reorganized U.S. defense and national security functions, creating the National Security Council, CIA, and Secretary of Defense. In the 113th Congress, H.R. 624 aims to improve cybersecurity by amending the act to allow sharing of intelligence information on cyber-threats between federal intelligence entities and private-sector providers. The bill also includes provisions for protection from liability for entities sharing information and exemption from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. S. 2588 under the \"Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)\" allows sharing of classified cybersecurity information without revising the act. It restricts the State Department from disseminating public diplomacy information domestically and limits communication with the American public. Critics argue that these restrictions are outdated and only served to restrict the now-defunct U.S. Information Agency from propagandizing Americans with foreign-targeted materials. Critics argue that restrictions on disseminating public diplomacy information domestically are outdated and hinder effective communication by the State Department. The provisions create a barrier that prevents effective communication and some believe it restricts the military from conducting information operations in cyberspace. Yearly appropriations bills include restrictions on \"propaganda\" activities without a clear definition, and proposed bills aim to remove the barrier between domestic and foreign audiences. The State Department is authorized to disseminate information through the Internet and media to both domestic and foreign audiences without restrictions. H.R. 5736 did not cover other federal departments like DOD. Concerns about international cybersecurity efforts have been raised in the 111th Congress. In the 111th Congress, S. 3193 and S. 1426 aimed to establish a coordinator for cyberspace and cybersecurity issues within the Department of State. Concerns have been raised about sharing cybersecurity information between the federal government and nonfederal entities due to potential public release under FOIA. Exemption 1, 3, and 4 under FOIA allow agencies to withhold certain records, including cybersecurity information. Exemption 3, for example, includes Section 214 of the HSA, which protects voluntarily submitted security information about critical infrastructure. Despite existing protections, concerns remain about potential harm from public release under FOIA. The White House Proposal and Task Force Report suggest adding a FOIA exemption for cybersecurity purposes. Several bills in Congress have proposed such exemptions, but concerns about federal transparency remain. Title I of P.L. 90-351 established federal grant programs for state and local law enforcement, while Title III allowed wiretapping under strict limitations. Cybercrime has increased, raising concerns about resources for combating it. H.R. 1292 in the 111th Congress proposed grants for law enforcement agencies to combat white-collar crime. The Task Force Report recommended expanding RICO to include computer fraud as a racketeering offense. The White House Proposal aimed to make felony violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act a predicate offense for racketeering. Additionally, P.L. 93-579 specifies the establishment and operation of federal advisory committees, ensuring transparency and public access to meetings and records. The HSA has been criticized for potentially hindering public/private partnerships in cybersecurity by impeding private-sector communications and policy input. Section 871 grants the Secretary of Homeland Security the power to establish exempt advisory committees, but additional exemption authority may be beneficial. The subcommittee version of H.R. 3674 in the 112th Congress aimed to exempt organizations from the act's requirements. P.L. 93-579 limits the disclosure of personally identifiable information held by federal agencies. The Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. \u00a7552a) limits disclosure of personally identifiable information held by federal agencies and establishes fair information practices. Some argue for revisions to clarify PII in cybersecurity contexts and allow sharing of certain information among agencies or with third parties. The act contains exemptions for law enforcement activities and duties of the Comptroller General. The Privacy Act limits disclosure of personally identifiable information held by federal agencies. Some argue for revisions to clarify PII in cybersecurity contexts. The act contains exemptions for law enforcement activities and duties of the Comptroller General, but none specifically related to cybersecurity. P.L. 98-473 provides criminal penalties for unauthorized access and wrongful use of computers and networks. The White House Proposal aims to enhance penalties for damaging certain CI computers and clarify offenses related to unauthorized access to federal government computers. Several bills in the 112th Congress had similar provisions, including enlarging the scope of the password trafficking offense. The Task Force Report recommended broadening the act to cover CI systems and possibly all private-sector computers with increased criminal penalties. The Task Force Report recommended broadening the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act to cover critical infrastructure systems and private-sector computers, with increased criminal penalties. Some bills in the 113th Congress aimed to adjust provisions to avoid unintended liability and reduce overzealous enforcement. The act attempts to balance privacy rights and law enforcement needs regarding data stored in electronic and telecommunications services. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act consists of three parts: Title III prohibits interception of communications, the Stored Communications Act prohibits unlawful access to stored communications, and the Pen Register and Trap and Trace statute governs the use of trap and trace devices. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) includes the Pen Register and Trap and Trace statute, which regulates the use of trap and trace devices and pen registers. It establishes rules for law enforcement to access data from service providers, requiring different levels of authorization depending on the type of information and service. ECPA reform aims to update the legal framework for modern technology while protecting users' privacy expectations. Cloud computing presents challenges to ECPA, especially when law enforcement seeks data stored in the cloud. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) regulates law enforcement access to data from service providers, with different authorization levels based on the type of information and service. ECPA reform advocates for requiring a search warrant based on probable cause to disclose non-public communications stored by covered entities. A governmental entity may access location information of a mobile device with a warrant based on probable cause. They can also access dialed number information, email data, and other information with judicial approval. Nonparticularized requests must be approved by a court. The Task Force Report recommended changes to laws governing data protection. The Task Force Report recommended changes to laws governing electronic communications for cybersecurity information sharing, including an anonymous reporting mechanism. Legislation in the 113th Congress would require warrants for government access to certain information stored in the cloud. Additionally, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7167 provides authority to the U.S. Special Operations Command for various activities specified by the President or Secretary of Defense. Title 10 of the U.S. Code provides specific authority to the Department of Defense (DOD) for various activities, including combatant commanders' authority for missions assigned by the President or Secretary of Defense. This includes the use of force in self-defense and for mission accomplishment, even in the information operations environment. DOD also undertakes clandestine military activities to prepare for and respond to cyberwarfare-related incidents. Some military activities, including covert actions influencing foreign governments, may be conducted clandestinely. In the cyber domain, distinguishing between covert and clandestine actions is challenging due to the difficulty in discerning attacking adversaries' intent and location. Updating the relevant act to reassess DOD's authorities in light of its unique intelligence capabilities could aid in responding to and conducting offensive cyberattacks. P.L. 102-194 establishes a federal high-performance computing program addressing security needs and requiring interagency coordination. The Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) Program was established by an act to address security needs and require interagency coordination. NIST is tasked with setting security and privacy standards for federal high-performance computing systems. Concerns have been raised about the program's lack of strategic planning and emphasis on cybersecurity R&D. H.R. 2020 in the 111th Congress aimed to address these concerns by requiring a five-year strategic plan and increasing research on cyber-physical systems. H.R. 3834 (112 th Congress) and H.R. 967 (113 th ) added provisions on cloud computing to H.R. 2020. Several bills in different Congresses aimed to establish cybersecurity standards and metrics for computer networks. P.L. 103-414 requires telecommunications carriers to assist law enforcement in electronic surveillance. The Telecommunications Act requires carriers to support electronic surveillance for law enforcement, with calls for potential revisions to address cybersecurity concerns and improve effectiveness. The Telecommunications Act requires carriers to support electronic surveillance for law enforcement, with potential revisions to address cybersecurity concerns and improve effectiveness. The Task Force Report recommended changes to laws governing the protection of electronic communications to facilitate sharing of appropriate cybersecurity information, including the development of an anonymous reporting mechanism. P.L. 104-104 (Title V), 110 Stat. 133. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7223, 230, regulates indecency and obscenity on telecommunications systems, including the Internet, with provisions that could also apply to graphic, violent terrorist propaganda or incendiary language. Section 230(c)(1) of the Communications Decency Act absolves Internet service providers and web-based services from responsibility for third-party content. Critics argue that the law should be revised to compel ISPs to take down sites containing harmful information that could incite harm against the United States. Some argue for a revision to hold services liable for defamatory or infringing content, while others believe it goes against the free exchange of information on the Internet. Concerns also exist about the balance between preserving intelligence value and potential threats. The Officer (CIO) assists agency heads in IT acquisition and management. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) oversees major IT acquisitions and sets federal computer standards with input from NIST. H.R. 1136 in the 112th Congress aimed to address cybersecurity concerns in federal IT acquisition by requiring vendors to meet security requirements and agencies to conduct vulnerability assessments. The White House Proposal and various bills in Congress debated the authority and jurisdiction of Chief Information Officers (CIOs) in federal agencies. While CIOs in the private sector often have control over IT resources, federal CIOs do not. The Obama Administration aimed to redefine the role of federal CIOs to focus on portfolio management and information security, moving away from just policymaking and infrastructure maintenance. The White House Proposal and congressional bills debated the authority of Chief Information Officers (CIOs) in federal agencies. The Obama Administration aimed to redefine the role of federal CIOs to focus on portfolio management and information security. Legislative authority may be needed for full implementation of proposed changes. Previous Congresses considered establishing statutory basis for federal Chief Technology Officer (CTO) and federal CIO positions. Theft is a federal crime with penalties for identity theft. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) handles complaints and provides victims with information. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) assists with threat information and recovery plans for critical information systems. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) assists with threat information and recovery plans for critical information systems. It permits the Secretary of Homeland Security to designate qualified technologies for protection from liability in claims related to terrorism. The act established mechanisms for information sharing among federal agencies and nonfederal government personnel. DHS is authorized to establish a system of volunteer experts (\"Net Guard\") to assist local communities in responding to attacks on information systems. The act also strengthened criminal penalties for cybercrime and created the Directorate of Science and Technology within DHS for R&D responsibilities, including cybersecurity. Various concerns have been raised about the act's cybersecurity provisions, leading to proposals for enhancement. In the 111th and 112th Congress, proposals were made to enhance cybersecurity provisions, including the establishment of a center for cybersecurity and communications within DHS, coordination with sector-specific agencies, and the creation of the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) for information-sharing procedures and assistance to the private sector. The proposals aimed to identify cyber vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure and establish requirements to address them. The White House Proposal aimed to enhance cybersecurity provisions by establishing procedures for response to cyber threats, enforcing requirements, and protecting information. It also required a risk-management strategy for supply chain security and the establishment of a cybersecurity R&D program in DHS. Additionally, it would have established a public/private-sector cybersecurity advisory council and enhanced DHS authority in cybersecurity. The White House Proposal aimed to enhance cybersecurity provisions by establishing procedures for response to cyber threats, enforcing requirements, and protecting information. It did not codify the establishment of US-CERT or provide the President with emergency powers, but granted the DHS Secretary authority to direct responses to cybersecurity threats. S. 2105 and S. 3414 in the 112th Congress contained elements of the White House Proposal and S. 413, establishing a new center with new authorities but omitting provisions on US-CERT and presidential emergency powers. These bills also required cybersecurity R&D plans. H.R. 3674, reported to the House, would enhance DHS responsibilities for protecting federal information systems, including information sharing, cybersecurity R&D, and recruitment of cybersecurity personnel. It would create a center within DHS for information sharing and technical assistance, but did not include a nongovernmental clearinghouse as recommended. The bill also mandated cybersecurity R&D activities such as testing, evaluation, and technology transfer. Several bills in the 111th, 112th, and 113th Congress aimed to enhance cybersecurity measures for critical infrastructure sectors. These bills proposed establishing new offices, fellowship programs, training initiatives, and adding security measures, including cybersecurity, to existing acts. Additionally, provisions were introduced to define statutory authority and responsibilities for the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Several bills in the 111th, 112th, and 113th Congress aimed to enhance cybersecurity measures for critical infrastructure sectors. These bills proposed establishing new offices, fellowship programs, training initiatives, and adding security measures, including cybersecurity, to existing acts. Additionally, provisions were introduced to define statutory authority and responsibilities for the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). H.R. 3696 and S. 2521 were enacted in December 2014, giving DHS responsibility for managing federal efforts to protect civilian federal information systems and operational authority to enforce FISMA requirements. Other bills like H.R. 3107, S. 1691, and S. 2354 aimed to provide additional DHS hiring and compensation authorities, establish federal occupation categories for the cybersecurity workforce, and clarify liability protection for cybersecurity technologies. The bill enacted in December 2014 focused on enhancing cybersecurity measures for critical infrastructure sectors. It required an assessment of cybersecurity workforce needs at DHS and established a security framework for federal information systems under FISMA. Key responsibilities were assigned to various federal agencies and officials to manage and enforce cybersecurity requirements. The bill enacted in December 2014 focused on enhancing cybersecurity measures for critical infrastructure sectors. It required executive agencies to inventory major computer systems, identify and provide appropriate security protections, and develop agency-wide information security programs. OMB was given oversight of federal information-security policy, while NIST was tasked with developing cybersecurity standards complementary to those for national security systems. Heads of federal agencies were required to provide security protections based on risk assessment. The bill enacted in December 2014 focused on enhancing cybersecurity measures for critical infrastructure sectors. It required heads of federal agencies to provide security protections commensurate with risk and comply with applicable security standards. Specific responsibilities were designated for agency officials, including risk assessments, implementing security controls, and evaluating them periodically. Chief information security officers were tasked with developing agency-wide information security programs, policies, and procedures, as well as training security personnel. Additionally, agencies were required to designate an information security officer, provide security awareness training, address deficiencies, handle security incidents, and ensure continuity of operations. Annual agency assessments were also mandated. The Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) established measures for handling security incidents and ensuring continuity of operations. It required annual agency reports to Congress, performance plans, and independent evaluations of information security. FISMA also established a central federal incident center overseen by OMB to analyze incidents, provide technical assistance, inform agency operators about threats, and consult with other agencies. Concerns have been raised about FISMA's effectiveness in providing adequate cybersecurity to government IT systems. Several legislative proposals in the 111th and 112th Congresses included major revisions to the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA). The proposals aimed to address inadequate resources, lack of cybersecurity metrics, and variations in agency interpretation of the mandates in the act. Key provisions included the creation of a White House office for cybersecurity, transfer of responsibilities to the Secretary of Homeland Security or Commerce, and revisions to agency responsibilities emphasizing continuous monitoring and risk-based approaches. In the 111th and 112th Congresses, legislative proposals aimed to revise FISMA by emphasizing continuous monitoring, metrics, risk-based security measures, and cybersecurity requirements for acquisitions. H.R. 5136 passed in the House, S. 3480 was reported out of the Senate Committee, and H.R. 4257 passed the House in 2012. The OMB Director's role was under scrutiny in various legislative proposals in the 111th and 112th Congresses. H.R. 4257 passed the House in April 2012, with S. 413 proposing changes to transfer federal information security policy responsibilities to a new DHS center. The White House Proposal differed by not creating a cybersecurity office and transferring responsibilities to the DHS Secretary. Other bills like S. 2105 and S. 3414 had a similar approach, while S. 2151 and S. 3342 suggested transferring responsibilities to the Secretary of Commerce. In the 113th Congress, H.R. 1163 and S. 2521 address operational cybersecurity oversight by DHS, with S. 2521 granting statutory authority but narrower than previous bills. S. 2521 does not mandate continuous monitoring of information systems but requires agencies to follow DHS directives, potentially including this requirement. It also shifts responsibility for the federal incident center to DHS. The enacted version of S. 2521 includes compromise language on continuous monitoring and clarifies roles of OMB, DHS, and agencies. Both H.R. 3635 and S. 2521 require OMB to establish breach notification procedures for personally identifiable information. P.L. 107-297 provides federal cost-sharing subsidies for terrorism-related losses, but cyberattack losses are not covered. P.L. 107-305 requires National Science. P.L. 107-305 requires the National Science Foundation (NSF) to award grants for basic research to enhance computer security and improve programs in computer and network security. It also mandates NIST to establish programs for cybersecurity research and develop security settings for federal computer hardware and software. The focus of R&D in cybersecurity is on coordination, prioritization, and understanding fundamental principles to develop transformational technologies. Efforts have been made by the Bush and Obama administrations to address gaps in research. Concerns have been raised about the process of creating cybersecurity standards. Legislation such as H.R. 4061, H.R. 2096, and H.R. 756 aim to expand NSF R&D programs and require NIST to develop automated security specifications. In the 112th and 113th Congress, legislation aimed to expand cybersecurity topics addressed by NSF and require NIST to develop automated security specifications for cybersecurity standards. The primary legislative vehicle established the Office of Electronic Government within OMB and the interagency CIO Council to work with NIST on security standards. The White House Proposal aimed to renew a personnel exchange program between federal agencies and private sector organizations to address cybersecurity expertise gaps. It also sought to remove eligibility restrictions for management personnel. The program would help agencies fill IT management training needs and comply with federal cybersecurity standards, including the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA). The White House Proposal aims to address gaps in cybersecurity expertise by renewing a personnel exchange program between federal agencies and private sector organizations. S. 1732 would have revised privacy provisions to accommodate the increased availability of personally identifiable information and required agencies to designate chief privacy officers. Additionally, penalties were established for aggravated identity theft, which has been the fastest-growing type of fraud in the United States. Identity theft is a prevalent fraud complaint, with 32% of consumer fraud complaints between 2000 and 2012 related to it. In 2010, 8.1 million Americans were victims of identity theft, decreasing from 11.1 million in 2009 but rising to 13.1 million in 2013. Nearly half of the 2013 fraud cases involved online transactions, costing consumers $37 billion in 2010 and $18 billion in 2013. The Identity Theft Enforcement and Restitution Act of 2008 aimed to enhance identity theft laws, authorizing restitution to victims for their recovery time. Legislation has not yet adopted recommendations to expand identity theft statutes to include theft from corporations and organizations, in addition to individuals. The task force recommends clarifying the laws to cover all potential victims, including organizations targeted by identity thieves using methods like \"phishing\" to solicit personal information. The task force recommended expanding the list of predicate offenses for aggravated identity theft to include crimes like mail theft, counterfeit securities, and tax fraud. They also suggested requiring restitution for victims of identity theft and computer fraud. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 established the position of the Director of National Intelligence and mission responsibilities for entities in the intelligence, homeland security, and national security communities. It addresses issues related to security-related information sharing and establishes a Privacy and Civil Liberties Board. The act aims to reform the intelligence community and activities of the US Government, based on findings from the 9/11 Commission Report. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 established the Director of National Intelligence and addresses security-related information sharing. It aims to reform the US Government's intelligence community based on the 9/11 Commission Report. The act currently addresses cybersecurity issues, focusing on identifying, assessing, defeating, responding to, and recovering from threats. Updating the act to include cybersecurity could impact various organizations and activities."
