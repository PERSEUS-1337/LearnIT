The purpose of the Act is to establish the park. The Congress authorized the establishment of the Richmond National Battlefield Park in 1936 to include all military battlefield areas related to the Civil War battles near Richmond, Virginia. The park originally encompassed the Richmond Battlefield State Park and approximately 225,000 acres in and around the city. The Sites Advisory Committee identified 38,000 acres of historically significant areas related to campaigns against and in defense of Richmond. The National Park Service identified 7,121 acres in Richmond meeting criteria for inclusion in the battlefield park, with an additional 186 acres later identified. There is a national interest in preserving Civil War sites in Richmond. The Commonwealth of Virginia and its local government have authority to protect historic resources related to campaigns against and in defense of Richmond, including the New Market Heights Battlefield. This battlefield is significant in American history, particularly in black military history, with 14 black Union soldiers awarded the Medal of Honor for their valor. The sacrifices of the United States Colored Troops in this battle helped ensure the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment. The purpose of this Act is to revise the boundaries for the Richmond National Battlefield Park and direct the Secretary of the Interior to work with various entities in managing and protecting resources related to the Civil War battles in and around Richmond, Virginia.
