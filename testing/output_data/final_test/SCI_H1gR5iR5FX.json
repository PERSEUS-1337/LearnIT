    "content": "Mathematical reasoning is a core ability in human intelligence, involving inferring, learning, and exploiting laws and rules. A new challenge is presented for evaluating neural architectures through a task suite of mathematics problems in a free-form textual format. The structured nature of the domain enables the testing of different architectures' capabilities and failure modes in composing and relating knowledge and processes. The text discusses the analysis of sequence-to-sequence architectures in resolving mathematical problems and generalizing knowledge. Deep learning, utilizing convolutional and recurrent networks, has shown success in pattern matching tasks like image recognition, machine translation, and reinforcement learning. However, these models lack the robustness and flexibility of human intelligence, particularly in discrete compositional reasoning. This ability to \"algebraically generalize\" is a unique strength of human cognition. In mathematics, humans use cognitive skills to solve complex problems involving function composition. A dataset of various math problems is introduced to challenge models in generalization and problem-solving abilities. Mathematics presents a wide range of problem types, including generalization, which is crucial for analyzing neural architectures. It offers a self-consistent universe with consistent notation across different problems, making it easily extendable. Rules and methods learned in one problem type often apply elsewhere, showcasing the importance of knowledge transfer for solving complex problems. Mathematics is a crucial domain for analyzing neural architectures, offering a self-consistent universe with transferable rules and methods. It serves as a foundation for experiments validating new architectures aiming to capture algorithmic reasoning. The dataset includes various math problems that may lead to more powerful models for solving substantial new mathematical problems. The dataset includes a sequence-to-sequence dataset with various math questions for measuring mathematical reasoning. It also provides interpolation and extrapolation tests to assess generalization abilities beyond the training set. The experimental evaluation investigates the algebraic abilities of neural architectures, showing good performance on some math questions but not all. Different papers use various architectures like convolutional, tree networks, and message passing networks for discrete reasoning tasks. The dataset in this paper covers a wide range of problems, including math and reasoning tasks. It differs from other datasets by requiring general reasoning skills and not just mapping inputs to specific architectures. Other datasets like bAbI focus on extracting knowledge from textual questions. The CLEVR dataset of BID8 and BID20 use Raven's progressive matrix puzzles to assess visual analysis and abstract reasoning. There is also interest in solving algebraic word problems, with datasets ranging in size and focus, including supervised \"answer rationale\" and geometry problems. The dataset focuses on mathematical reasoning rather than linguistic comprehension, covering various areas of mathematics with a modular structure for question generation. Procedural generation is used to create a large number of training examples with precise difficulty controls. The dataset provides a large number of training examples with precise difficulty controls for mathematical reasoning. It allows for analysis of performance by question type and better guarantees on question correctness. Additionally, it offers potential for more efficient model training by varying the time spent on each module and ease of testing generalization. The questions are presented in a freeform format as sequences of characters for flexibility and simplicity. The dataset offers precise difficulty controls for mathematical reasoning with freeform inputs and outputs, simplifying model development. Questions are seen as mappings with input and output types, allowing for unit testing of models on real-world tests during development. Function composition in mathematics involves mapping functions to integers, generating composed questions by chaining modules with matching types. This process makes the dataset more challenging by incorporating various mathematical rules and concepts. Intermediate values are used as inputs for subsequent sub-problems, requiring storage and manipulation in working memory. This approach moves the questions beyond pure perception and enhances the complexity of the dataset. The dataset includes mathematics problems covering algebra, arithmetic, calculus, and comparisons. It is based on a national school curriculum up to age 16, with additional areas for testing algebraic reasoning.

The dataset includes mathematics problems covering algebra, arithmetic, calculus, and comparisons based on a national school curriculum up to age 16, with additional areas for testing algebraic reasoning. The biggest challenge in producing the dataset is generating diverse questions that are neither trivial nor impossibly hard. To achieve this, a different approach is employed for most modules where the answer is sampled first, and then the question is generated backwards. The generation code ensures diversity in training and test questions by setting lower bounds on question appearance probabilities. Test questions have a probability of at most 10^-8 to guarantee distinctiveness from training data. Module generators accept an input \u03b1 to control question probability, with train questions sampled from [3, 10] and test questions generated with \u03b1 = 8. The generation code ensures question diversity by setting lower bounds on appearance probabilities. Test questions are generated with \u03b1 = 8, ensuring distinctiveness from training data. Various mechanisms are used to achieve probabilistic guarantees, such as generating sequences of integers with specific sets to control probabilities. Extrapolation tests measure mathematical generalization along different axes. The curr_chunk discusses the inclusion of various modules in the extrapolation test sets to measure generalization along different axes. Each question is scored based on the correctness of the answer, and performance is calculated as the average score across all questions. The dataset will include 2 \u00d7 10^6 training examples and 10^4 pre-generated test examples per module. The questions and answers in the dataset are restricted in nature. The dataset includes questions and answers using a common alphabet of size 95. Questions are limited to 160 characters and answers to 30 characters. Mathematical equations follow Python/SymPy BID16 conventions. Existing models can be adapted to solve the presented problems with symbolic solvers or computer algebra systems.

Mathematical equations follow Python/SymPy BID16 conventions. Existing models can be adapted to solve the presented problems with symbolic solvers or computer algebra systems. The linguistic diversity of questions and answers grows, and we are interested in evaluating general purpose models without mathematics knowledge already inbuilt. Neural architectures are ubiquitous in tasks like translation, parsing, and image captioning due to their lack of bias from domain-specific knowledge. We focus on general sequence-processing architectures for future comparison, excluding neural network-driven approaches with direct access to mathematical operations. The study compares recurrent neural architectures and attentional/transformer BID25 models for sequence-to-sequence tasks. Differentiable Neural Computers with external memory were also tested but did not perform well. The LSTM BID6 is highlighted as a powerful building block. The LSTM BID6 is a powerful building block for sequence-to-sequence models, achieving state-of-the-art results. Two standard recurrent architectures are benchmarked, including a Simple LSTM model and an Attentional LSTM model. The Simple LSTM feeds the question into the LSTM one character at a time and outputs the answer one character at a time. The Attentional LSTM is an encoder/decoder-with-attention architecture. The Attentional LSTM architecture introduced in BID2 improves upon the Simple LSTM model by addressing issues with out-of-order information and bottleneck in processing. It consists of a recurrent encoder for encoding the question and a recurrent decoder for generating the answer. The encoding and decoding LSTMs with different hidden units were optimized through hyperparameter sweep. Additional computation steps were added to integrate information before outputting the answer. The use of Adaptive Computation Time did not improve results compared to a fixed number of steps. A new recurrent architecture called relational recurrent neural network, or relational memory core (RMC), with multiple memory slots interacting via attention, has been developed as an alternative to LSTM. The RMC is a recurrent unit with multiple memory slots that interact via attention, making it a natural candidate for mathematical reasoning tasks. However, after a hyperparameter sweep, it was found that using 1 memory slot was the best setting. The Transformer model BID25 is a sequence-to-sequence model achieving state-of-the-art results in machine translation, consisting of an encoder and decoder. The Transformer model uses attentional mechanisms and fully connected layers to predict answers for mathematical reasoning tasks. It treats questions and answers as sequences of characters and uses a greedy decoder to predict the answer. The model is optimized using the Adam optimizer with specific hyperparameters. The study compares the performance of different architectures in mathematical reasoning tasks. Results show that RMCs with multiple memory slots did not improve performance, while LSTMs were more data efficient but trained slower. Attentional LSTMs performed similarly to simple LSTMs. The study compares different architectures in mathematical reasoning tasks. The Transformer model outperforms recurrent models, including LSTMs, across various modules. Increasing the number of \"thinking\" steps in the attentional LSTM model improves performance. The LSTM's sequential architecture does not necessarily lead to better performance in algorithmic reasoning tasks. The Transformer model has advantages over LSTM architectures in algorithmic reasoning tasks, such as more calculations with the same parameters and a sequential internal memory. Easiest math questions for neural networks include place value, rounding decimals, and comparisons. The success extends to questions involving module composition and mixtures of decimals and rationals. The Transformer model excels in algorithmic reasoning tasks, with high performance on simple math questions like place value and comparisons. However, it struggles with more complex modules involving number theory, such as primality detection and factorization. The model performs well on addition and subtraction tasks, but its accuracy drops significantly on mixed arithmetic problems.

However, it struggles with more complex modules involving number theory. The model shows good performance on addition and subtraction but struggles with mixed arithmetic problems and polynomial manipulation. The Transformer model outperforms recurrent models in polynomial manipulation tasks, excelling in tasks such as polynomial expansion, addition, composition, and differentiation. It shows better performance in manipulating polynomials due to its parallel sequential nature. Additionally, both LSTM and Transformer models give correct answers for adding integers up to n=6, but struggle with n=7 and higher. The Transformer model excels in polynomial manipulation tasks, showing better performance in tasks like expansion, addition, composition, and differentiation. It outperforms recurrent models and can handle adding integers up to n=6, but struggles with n=7 and higher. The model's failure modes are interesting, such as discrepancies in answers based on question phrasing and challenges with adding more numbers than seen during training. The Transformer model excels in polynomial manipulation tasks, outperforming recurrent models. It struggles with adding more numbers than seen during training, achieving a grade equivalent to an E grade student on British 16-year-old math exam questions. The disappointing grade assumes no marks for incorrect attempts like factorisation. Knowledge of exam syllabus may help encode necessary knowledge for neural networks to excel at unseen exams. A dataset has been created for neural models with moderate performance, but some modules remain unsolved. Extrapolation performance is low, and the dataset aims to become a benchmark for developing better models. The dataset aims to be a benchmark for developing models with algebraic reasoning abilities. It is easily extendable and covers a wide range of mathematics up to university level. The main restriction is that answers must be unique, but there are possibilities for assessing answers with metrics like BLEU BID18.

Possibilities for assessing answers include metrics like BLEU BID18. Linguistic complexity has not been addressed in the dataset, suggesting the need for distinct translations of mathematical problems to enhance it. The dataset aims to be a benchmark for developing models with algebraic reasoning abilities up to university level mathematics. One direction for extension is to include visual (e.g. geometry) problems to enhance mathematical reasoning. This involves developing questions that require intermediate visual representations and visual working memory. The model consists of an encoder and a decoder for mapping questions to answers. The encoder maps the question to key-value pairs, using LSTM or bidirectional LSTM cores. The decoder has a hidden size of 2048 and generates query vectors and logits for answer prediction. The query vectors are used to obtain a softmax weighting over encoded question values. The decoder LSTM input consists of the soft-weighted values and the 1-hot embedding of the current answer character. The model is trained using cross-entropy loss for predicting the correct answer.

It also includes tasks like finding the simplest fraction of an expression, calculating the nearest integer to an nth root, and simplifying expressions involving square roots. Additionally, it mentions extrapolation tests involving larger integers for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The differentiate module in module composition handles first and higher order derivatives of multivariate polynomials. It includes tasks like finding the closest number in a list, determining the kth biggest or smallest number, pairwise number comparison, and sorting lists of numbers. Additionally, there are extrapolation tests for tasks like finding the closest number in larger lists, determining the kth biggest number in larger lists, and sorting longer lists of numbers.
