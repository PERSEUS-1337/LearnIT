The \"Northern Front Range Roadless Area Protection Act\" designates certain lands within the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests in Colorado as protected roadless areas, including the South St. Vrain Protected Roadless Area and the Fourth of July Protected Roadless Area. The \"Fourth of July Protected Roadless Area\" in the Roosevelt National Forest is approximately 844 acres and is known as the \"Rainbow Lakes Protected Roadless Area.\" Additionally, the Mount Evans Wilderness adjacent areas in the Arapaho National Forest comprise approximately 5,741 acres known as the \"South Chicago Creek Protected Roadless Area.\" The Arapaho National Forest includes three protected roadless areas: Mount Goliath (717 acres), Chief Mountain (1,038 acres), and Bear Creek (2,787 acres). These areas are designated on maps dated July 2000. The Arapaho National Forest includes three protected roadless areas: Mount Goliath, Chief Mountain, and Bear Creek. Additional areas designated in July 2000 are Jones Pass, Bard Creek, and Mt. Sniktau. The Act designates three new protected roadless areas in the national forests: Mt. Sniktau, North St. Vrain, and Square Top Mountain, totaling approximately 18,162 acres. The Secretary of Agriculture is required to file maps and descriptions promptly after the Act's enactment. The Secretary of Agriculture must file maps and boundary descriptions of newly designated protected roadless areas with relevant committees. These areas will be managed similarly to recommended wilderness lands to preserve their roadless character and potential for national inclusion. The Secretary of Agriculture will report to Congress recommendations on the suitability of identified lands for inclusion in the National Wilderness Preservation System and other management recommendations within 3 years of this Act's enactment. Livestock grazing on these lands will be managed according to National Forest System laws."
