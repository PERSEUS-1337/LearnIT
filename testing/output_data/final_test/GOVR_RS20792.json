    "content": "The United States is a member of five multilateral development banks (MDBs) - the World Bank, African Development Bank (AfDB), Asian Development Bank (AsDB), European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), and Inter-American Development Bank (IDB. The MDBs have similar programs but differ in structure and emphasis, each with a president and executive board managing operations. MDBs make market-based loans to middle-income countries and concessional loans to the poorest countries. The World Bank administers trust funds for global issues like food security and the environment. The Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) provide loans to governments or organizations with government repayment guarantees. They have specialized facilities for different types of loans, such as market-based and concessional loans. The World Bank's International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the IDB's Inter-American Investment Corporation (IIC) make loans or equity investments in private-sector firms in developing countries without government guarantees. The AsDB also provides similar loans from its market-rate loan account, while the World Bank's Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) underwrites private investments in developing countries. The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) underwrites private investments in developing countries to protect against noneconomic risk. The Multilateral Investment Fund (MIF) at the IDB helps Latin American countries with policy reforms to stimulate investment, worker retraining, and support small enterprises. The NADBank funds environmental projects in the U.S.-Mexico border region. The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) focuses on reducing poverty through agricultural development. The World Bank serves as trustee for targeted multilateral development funds. The Administration has requested and Congress has appropriated funds for multilateral funds including the Clean Technology Fund (CTF), the Strategic Climate Fund (SCF), the Global Environment Facility (GEF), and the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP). Major donors negotiate new funding plans for MDBs' concessional aid programs and market-rate loan facilities. MDBs fund their loans and equity investments with contributions from members and funds borrowed from commercial capital markets, backed by member countries' subscriptions. MDBs provide capital subscriptions in the form of paid-in and callable capital. Callable capital is a contingent liability, only payable in case of bankruptcy. Countries' voting shares are based on their contributions, with the US holding the largest share. Congress has authorized but not appropriated callable capital since the 1980s. Figures and tables show annual appropriations to MDBs, excluding callable capital. The MDBs have seen an increase in appropriations starting in 2009, driven by capital increases for lending facilities and trust funds. However, funding levels have started declining in recent years, with appropriations dropping to $1.52 billion in FY2018. President Trump has proposed cutting $650 million compared to previous commitments. The Trump Administration requested $1.42 billion for MDBs in FY2019, a 16% cut from FY2017. Most of the funding would go towards concessional lending facilities, AfDB capital increase, trust funds for environmental issues, and food security programs. Funding for MDBs has been declining in recent years, with appropriations dropping to $1.52 billion in FY2018."
