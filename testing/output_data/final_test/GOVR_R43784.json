    "content": "Under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (P.L. 93-288), presidential actions for federal supplemental assistance include emergency declarations and major disaster declarations. Emergency declarations aim to protect property and public health, while major disaster declarations provide broader authority for recovery efforts after a catastrophic event. The differences between emergency and major disaster declarations under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act are a subject of study. Federal disaster assistance, managed by FEMA, is funded through the Disaster Relief Fund for presidentially declared disasters. Disaster assistance is seen as a valuable political tool due to its humanitarian impact and potential for aid. Disaster assistance is considered valuable political currency due to its humanitarian impact and aid potential. It is funded through supplemental appropriations, not adding to the budget deficit, and promotes the local economy. However, disaster declarations result from tragic incidents disrupting lives, with severe long-term economic and environmental impacts. Rebuilding and recovery efforts may take years following a disaster. The declaration process initiates federal recovery assistance after disasters. P.L. 93-288 (the Stafford Act) outlines the legal requirements for a major disaster declaration, now including tribal requests. Requests are made by the Governor based on the severity of the disaster and the need for federal assistance. The Governor can request major disaster assistance under the Stafford Act, directing state emergency response actions and providing information on resources committed. The President may declare a disaster based on the Governor's request. Indian tribal governments can also request a disaster declaration. In response to a request from an affected Indian tribal government, the President can provide disaster assistance under the Stafford Act. The Indian tribal government can also receive assistance through a declaration made by the President at the request of a State. Cost share adjustments are available for Indian tribal governments receiving assistance. The President may waive or adjust non-Federal contribution payments for Indian tribal governments receiving assistance under the Stafford Act if deemed necessary. Criteria for these determinations will be established. Special authority allows the President to exercise discretion for events with a distinctly federal character. The President may declare an emergency based on a request from the Governor of the affected State, stating that the situation requires Federal assistance beyond the State's capabilities. The Governor must provide information on State and local efforts, resources used, and the type of Federal aid needed. The President may declare an emergency when he determines that the United States has primary responsibility for response due to exclusive authority. The President can consult with the Governor of any affected State, and Indian tribal governments can also request a declaration of emergency. Indian tribal governments can request a declaration of emergency from the President, allowing them to receive assistance under this subchapter. The President can consult with the Governor of any affected State, and if a declaration is not made for the same incident, the Indian tribal government can still receive assistance through a State's request. The declaration process for federal disaster relief has evolved over the past three decades, with little change until tribal groups were included in P.L. 113-2. Disaster relief has a long history in the U.S. and has grown alongside government concerns. Federal disaster declarations now occur weekly, reflecting a shift from episodic to commonplace relief efforts. New Deal social welfare programs have had a lasting impact on American political discourse, influencing responses to disasters. Policy makers struggle to achieve equity in treating different natural disaster events due to their varying types, scopes, and impacts on states and tribal groups. Each state or tribe has unique characteristics affecting their ability to respond and recover from disasters. The process of conducting a Preliminary Damage Assessment (PDA) to determine the need for supplemental assistance begins with a decision by the governor or tribal head. Information from PDAs and FEMA regional office summaries are sent to the White House for the President's review. FEMA started making these materials available under the Freedom of Information Act in 2008, as directed by Congress. In 2008, FEMA began listing PDA results on its website as directed by Congress. The Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013 allowed Native Americans to directly request federal disaster assistance. This change amended the Stafford Act to enable tribal groups to request disaster declarations without going through governors. The Stafford Act was amended in 2013 to allow tribal groups to directly request disaster declarations from the federal government, bypassing the need for state governors to make the request. This change was made to recognize tribal governments as sovereign nations and strengthen FEMA's relationships with them for better emergency management. The new FEMA policy allows tribal governments to request disaster declarations directly, recognizing them as sovereign nations. FEMA will work to eliminate obstacles in collaborating with tribal communities, treating them on par with states for disaster assistance requests. Tribal governments can now directly request disaster declarations, gaining equal authority to states. This change addresses challenges such as language barriers and tribal sovereignty issues in accessing disaster relief. The amendment allows tribal leaders to manage disaster response and recovery, improving emergency management in tribal areas. The Stafford Act now allows tribal governments to request disaster declarations directly from the President, ensuring they can receive assistance without needing a separate declaration from the governor. FEMA has provided guidance and resources to help tribes participate in this process effectively. FEMA reports extensive outreach efforts with tribes to establish new partnerships for disaster declarations. Congress and various administrations have reviewed the federal disaster declaration process, questioning FEMA's assessment criteria and consistency. The quality and consistency of FEMA's assessment criteria for disaster declarations have been questioned, as they may not accurately reflect a state's financial capacity to respond to disasters. This could result in federal funds being provided when not needed, leading to increased emergency spending. Congressional interest in the declaration process stems from concerns about the rising costs of disaster funding, particularly for large catastrophic events. The majority of Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) spending is for catastrophic events meeting Stafford Act criteria. Supplementals are driven by urgency of disasters depleting funds, leading to additional funding from Congress. Recent years show increased need for assistance from multiple incidents, not just one large event. Large expenditures relate to declarations for major disasters like Hurricanes Katrina or Sandy. During this time period, disaster declarations were made for Hurricane Hugo, the Loma Prieta earthquake, Hurricane Andrew, the Midwest floods of 1993, and the Northridge earthquake. Large supplemental funding bills were also issued for Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy. Over 200 other declarations accounted for one quarter of such outlays, many of them of relatively minute cost and extent. These \"low end\" declarations have become new sources of federal spending at the local level, akin to \"pork barrel spending.\" The Budget Control Act (BCA) has been implemented to address disaster funding and establish a reliable budgetary process for it. The Budget Control Act (BCA) has established a reliable budgetary process for disaster funding, including the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF). Despite this, Congress still allocates some spending for catastrophic events outside of the budget process. FEMA Director Joe M. Allbaugh emphasized the need for objective criteria in disaster declaration processes. During the 110th Congress, attention was given to establishing consistent criteria for disaster declarations to help states understand when to seek federal assistance. Following tornadoes in 2007, Arkansas did not receive federal aid while Alabama and Georgia did. This led to a review of FEMA's procedures by Chairman Bennie Thompson. FEMA's process for determining disaster funding and the role of the federal government versus state and local responsibilities were examined by Congress in a 2007 supplemental appropriations bill. Concerns were raised about FEMA's ability to manage resources effectively, leading to a mandated study by the GAO on how FEMA develops estimates for supplemental funding. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) is requested to review how FEMA estimates funding needed for disasters within six months of enactment. This includes examining initial estimates, refinements, accuracy in predicting costs, and recommendations for effective resource management. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) was asked to review FEMA's disaster funding estimates within six months of enactment. The study focused on ongoing FEMA spending, including refining early estimates and managing spending projections for the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF). GAO's report suggested that FEMA's cost estimates have improved but could benefit from additional refinement, with factors like hidden damage impacting estimates beyond FEMA's control. FEMA could improve its cost estimates by conducting sensitivity analyses to isolate key cost drivers and using more geographically specific indicators for the Individual Assistance program. Concerns were raised during a hearing in the 111th Congress about the speed and transparency of FEMA's disaster declaration process, with delays in declarations being questioned by Ranking Republican Mike D. Rogers of Alabama. Alabama's Emergency Management Agency director, Brock Long, expressed frustration over delays in disaster declaration requests, citing a lack of information on their status. There are concerns that FEMA's focus on routine disasters is reducing preparedness for catastrophic events, potentially leading to insufficient federal responses. Congress should address these issues to improve disaster response effectiveness. The federal response to catastrophic events may be insufficient, and Congress should reduce the cost-share provision for FEMA declarations to 25 percent. Defining \"routine natural disasters\" is challenging as it varies by location and depends on state resources. Consistency in federal guidance and support is needed to address disparities in disaster response. The curr_chunk discusses proposals for more stringent regulations on disaster declaration processes to assess impacts and eligible damage. Different reactions to these reforms have been seen in the history of disaster declaration processes. The declaration process reform efforts have been met with differing perceptions, with some viewing them as punitive measures. Various stakeholders, including local officials, governors, and Members of Congress, have argued that reforms should not hinder the delivery of federal aid. The Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006 exemplifies the desire for reform without obstructing the declaration process, creating the Small State and Rural Advocate position at FEMA. The Small State and Rural Advocate position at FEMA was created to ensure the needs of smaller states and rural communities are met in the declaration process. FEMA drafted regulations in 1986 to establish a \"state deductible\" based on a per capita minimum dollar amount to limit future presidential declarations for repairs to state and local infrastructure. FEMA proposed changes to disaster assistance eligibility criteria, including adjusting the minimum dollar amount based on state/local price index ratios. Some Members of Congress opposed the proposal, fearing it would limit elected leaders' discretion. Instead of adopting FEMA's empirical solution, Congress added a provision to the Stafford Act to prevent the use of any \"arithmetic formula\" in disaster cost sharing. The Stafford Act was amended by Congress to prevent the use of sliding scales based on income or population for disaster assistance eligibility. FEMA's regulations now incorporate arithmetic formulas but not solely. Discussions include ways to reduce or increase declarations for disasters while ensuring equity in the process. The process of requesting a major disaster or emergency declaration moves deliberately, gathering information from various sources. The governor or tribal leader must request the President for such declarations, as the President cannot issue them without a request. The only exception is when the President determines that the emergency response is primarily the responsibility of the United States. The Stafford Act outlines the steps a governor or tribal leader must take before requesting federal disaster assistance, giving them discretion if they believe the situation is beyond their capabilities. The decision to request federal assistance is based on the leader's assessment of state or tribal resources. The importance of governors or tribal leaders in the disaster declaration process is highlighted, especially considering their experience in responding to emergencies. Former governors who became Presidents also play a significant role in this process. States respond to a higher number of emergencies compared to federal disaster declarations, emphasizing the importance of state and tribal resources and capabilities. The disaster declaration process allows for wide political discretion to the president, with general considerations guiding the decision-making. Former governors in Congress also influence the process, despite some advocating for keeping it imprecise. Some Members of Congress express disappointment with the disaster declaration process, which involves FEMA making a recommendation to the White House for a \"Presidential determination.\" The President has the discretion to make a decision counter to recommendations received. The number of major disaster declarations has been increasing. The number of major disaster declarations has been increasing over the last few decades, with 460 declarations between 1990 and 1999, 568 between 2000 and 2009, and 307 in just the first four years of the current decade. Despite public discussions on climate change, politics often play a role in determining federal aid distribution for disasters. For example, Bill Clinton refused aid for floods in Chicago in 1994 but provided aid to New Orleans a year later. The difference in federal aid distribution for disasters is influenced by political considerations. Bill Clinton refused aid for floods in Chicago in 1994 but provided aid to New Orleans a year later, based on the perceived value of the states for his re-election. Natural disasters prompt politicians nationwide to allocate federal aid, with factors like state capacity also playing a role in aid decisions. The default assumption for disaster recommendations is the primacy of politics, with presidential and congressional influences affecting disaster declaration rates and FEMA expenditures. States politically important to the President have a higher rate of disaster declaration, and expenditures are higher in states with congressional representation on FEMA oversight committees. Follow-up studies have questioned assumptions of political corruption in the disaster declaration process and spending. Since 1989, the odds of a president approving a governor's disaster request have increased to about 80.3%. The broader authority under the Stafford Act allows presidents more discretion in declaring disasters, leading to a higher rate of gubernatorial request approvals since 1988. The increasing capacity of states to make effective disaster requests, based on regulations and understanding of FEMA's review process, has led to a higher rate of gubernatorial request approvals since 1988. This reflects the growing maturity and sophistication of emergency management as a field, as well as the improved relationship between state and tribal emergency management offices and FEMA regional offices. Preliminary Damage Assessments (PDAs) play a crucial role in determining if an event may be declared a major disaster by the President. Preliminary Damage Assessments (PDAs) are crucial in determining if an event qualifies as a major disaster. PDAs help assess the impact and magnitude of damage, unmet needs, and the necessity for federal aid. States may conduct an initial abbreviated assessment to decide if a complete PDA with federal involvement is required. Despite findings that federal aid may not be necessary, political factors could still lead to a gubernatorial request for assistance. The process of determining if an event qualifies as a major disaster involves Preliminary Damage Assessments (PDAs) to assess damage and federal aid needs. Despite findings that federal aid may not be necessary, political factors could lead to a gubernatorial request for assistance. Governors may feel pressure from media coverage and political considerations, influencing their decisions to request presidential disaster declarations. They are cautious about being turned down for aid, as it could reflect poorly on their handling of emergency incidents. The governor's decision to request a disaster declaration can have negative connotations and reflect on their decision-making skills. A traditional PDA team assesses the damage, including state and FEMA officials, local representatives, and sometimes the Red Cross or Small Business Administration. FEMA briefs the team on factors to consider. The responsibilities of representatives include briefing the team on factors to consider and how information should be reported. FEMA now requires participants to reconcile any differences in their findings. The quality of the PDA team and its findings is crucial, especially considering the use of temporary employees in FEMA's regional offices. Consistency in approach became an issue during the 2004 hurricane season in Florida. During the 2004 hurricane season in Florida, questions arose about county designations. The Public Damage Assessment (PDA) process involves joint teams inspecting damaged areas to assess recovery needs beyond local capabilities. The PDA does not determine total recovery costs or guarantee presidential assistance. The PDA process, led by FEMA Regional Director Susan Reinertson, faces challenges in collecting necessary data for assessing recovery needs. Information like damage to bridges and culverts is observable, but details like insurance coverage or demographics can be harder to obtain quickly. The geographic extent of damage complicates the team's ability to cover all affected areas in a limited time. Additionally, challenges arise from the inclusion of visited areas in the governor's or tribal leader's request. The FEMA PDA process faces challenges in collecting data for assessing recovery needs, including difficulties in obtaining details like insurance coverage and demographics. Some incidents, like Hurricanes Katrina and Sandy, are so massive that a declaration is not in doubt, but the decision lies in determining the extent of coverage needed. The President can waive the PDA requirement in certain cases, but a PDA may still be necessary to identify unmet needs for specific programs like crisis counseling or disaster unemployment assistance. The PDA process involves gathering information from various sources to help the governor decide on requested assistance programs. Multiple pressure points influence PDA team members' conclusions, with the president often encouraging gubernatorial requests for disaster assistance. The media context and political factors play a significant role in influencing a gubernatorial request for a presidential disaster declaration. Publicity from news organizations like CNN can elevate a local incident to a national level, impacting the president's decision. Despite political motivations and media scrutiny, there are specific regulations for assessing whether a state should receive a major disaster declaration. Public Assistance (PA) includes various categories of aid to state and local authorities. Public Assistance (PA) covers repairs or replacement of infrastructure, debris removal, and emergency protective measures for state and local governments. FEMA assesses PA damage based on cost, localized impacts, insurance coverage, hazard mitigation, recent disasters, and other federal programs. Cost estimates are a key factor, serving as a threshold figure in determining assistance eligibility. FEMA considers cost estimates as a key factor in determining Public Assistance (PA) eligibility. The threshold figure of $1 million in PA damage is the first number FEMA looks for in a request. Additionally, FEMA also considers a state-wide threshold of $1.39 per capita in estimated eligible disaster costs before approving PA help. This per capita threshold may be challenging to reach for states with large populations like California. In California, PA damage is close to $48 million before federal assistance is available. Comparatively, Nevada would be eligible for assistance with about $3.5 million in damage due to its smaller population. Both states have significant industries and are at risk of disasters. Different measurements have been suggested to capture a state's capacity to respond to disaster events more accurately. FEMA considers a minimum of $3.50 per capita in infrastructure damage in a county before designating it for PA funding. High local levels of damage per capita would not supersede a finding that damages state-wide fell below the state-wide threshold amount. The legislation introduced in the 113th Congress aims to give more weight to localized impact when determining disaster declarations for Public Assistance. This would benefit local communities in large states where meeting the \"estimated cost\" threshold is challenging. The proposed bill suggests assigning a 40% weight to the \"Localized Impact\" factor, compared to 10% for other factors, to address the issue of very large localized impacts influencing the President's discretion. The legislation introduced in the 113th Congress aims to give more weight to localized impact when determining disaster declarations for Public Assistance. This would benefit local communities in large states where meeting the \"estimated cost\" threshold is challenging. Another legislation, H.R. 1859, would direct FEMA to consider all factors equally and develop regulations to address concerns about relying solely on state-wide damage thresholds. The Committee directs FEMA to review its disaster declaration recommendation process to incorporate the ''localized impacts'' factor outlined under Title 44, Part 206.48 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Insurance coverage is also considered in assessing damage, with officials deducting the amount of insurance held by governments and non-profit organizations from the total eligible damage amount. This assessment is complex due to states and local governments that \"self-insure\" against disasters and may argue for total liability without a federal disaster declaration. In disasters like earthquakes, the state insurance commissioner must certify hazard insurance availability and affordability. FEMA can easily determine flood insurance availability for deducting from total awards. Hazard mitigation poses challenges for Public Assistance requests. FEMA considers states' mitigation efforts in disaster declaration requests, factoring in infrastructure damage reductions due to mitigation measures. Savings calculations depend on cost-benefit analysis and estimates of avoided damages to encourage future mitigation projects. Mitigation work credited to states may have been funded by previous FEMA assistance programs. FEMA considers recent multiple disasters when evaluating state requests for disaster declarations. The amount of funds committed by the state and impact on residents are key factors. States that have responded to disasters on their own may receive more favorable consideration. FEMA also considers the availability of other federal programs when reviewing requests. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the Magnuson-Stevens Fisheries Act (P.L. 94-265) are examples of other federal programs that may be more appropriate for handling specific types of natural disasters, such as damage to federal-aid-system roads or outbreaks of oceanic bacteria affecting the fishing industry. These programs offer more tailored forms of emergency assistance compared to FEMA under the Stafford Act. FEMA uses various factors to determine if a major disaster declaration is needed, with assistance for public infrastructure repairs based on eligible damage. There is no cap on funding, but projects must be related to the disaster event. States must contribute 25% of costs. Individual Assistance provides help for families and individuals. Individual Assistance (IA) includes housing, unemployment, counseling, and other programs for disaster-affected individuals. FEMA considers factors like damages, trauma, special populations, and insurance coverage. The SRIA mandates a review of IA factors, last updated in 1999, in collaboration with state and local agencies. FEMA's regulations aim to expedite the declaration process for disaster assistance by considering the concentration of damages in communities. Highly concentrated damages indicate a greater need for federal aid, especially for infrastructure supporting neighborhoods. While dispersed damage may be less visible, it does not mean that individual and family needs are non-existent, particularly in rural states. FEMA plans to begin the rulemaking process for IA factors in 2014. The Rural and Small State advocate position at FEMA addresses challenges in viewing and assessing damages. Legislation emphasizes \"Localized Impacts\" under Public Assistance, which may become more important. FEMA defines trauma as loss of life, injuries, disruption of community functions, and emergency needs like power or water loss. Loss of life and injuries have little impact on declaration decisions but influence media coverage. Extreme losses are considered in evaluating a governor's request for assistance. The evaluation of the governor's request for assistance considers traumatic events, such as loss of life and injuries. FEMA's assistance is limited, with the ONA program providing help for uninsured funeral expenses and medical needs. Media coverage can impact decision-making, and disruptions in community functions and utilities are factors in declaration decisions. The evaluation of FEMA's assistance considers traumatic events like loss of life and injuries, with special attention given to the factor of Trauma. FEMA is updating its Individual Assistance factors, with a focus on the severity, magnitude, and impact of disasters. FEMA's report indicates that regulatory text for the update is in progress, with anticipated publication in 2014. FEMA considers special populations when assessing requests for Individual Assistance, including demographics like age, income, home ownership, and impact on Native American tribal groups. This information helps FEMA evaluate trauma and community disruption. Special populations are a factor in requests, but the total number of eligible households remains the primary consideration. Voluntary agency assistance is also evaluated based on the resources available from volunteer groups and government entities. FEMA evaluates the assistance provided by volunteer groups and government entities to disaster victims. The assessment includes the ability of state, tribal, and local programs to meet the needs of victims, which can vary greatly among disasters. State programs may not have resources comparable to federal help. The NEMA survey of state-funded disaster assistance shows that few states go beyond Stafford Act authorization. Data from the survey indicates a decrease in PA programs since 2010 but an increase in IA assistance. Evaluating local voluntary groups' capacity to handle disaster \"unmet needs\" is challenging. FEMA officials need to carefully assess IA programs due to limited information on available resources. The assessment of the non-profit and voluntary sector's ability to meet disaster needs is crucial. A strong local charitable sector could prevent a disaster declaration and federal funding. Some argue that FEMA's criteria may discourage local capacity for assistance. Clear criteria are needed for smaller communities to deliver aid effectively. One analyst emphasized the importance of clear criteria for smaller disaster events to avoid reliance on federal government bailouts. FEMA evaluates local organizations' capabilities based on existing help, not expected assistance. Insurance coverage is also considered in FEMA's decision-making process. The statute of the duplication of benefits ensures that individuals affected by disasters do not receive duplicate financial assistance. FEMA can provide help to those waiting on insurance or other aid, with the condition that they reimburse FEMA. This provision does not cause delays in assistance. FEMA can determine if a disaster declaration is needed by assessing insurance coverage, particularly for tornado disasters. NFIP, administered by FEMA, helps assess flood insurance status in communities. Knowledge of residents' income helps predict insurance coverage, including special hazard insurance like flood or earthquake insurance. Most individuals are likely already insured against natural disasters through homeowners insurance. Purchasing insurance against flood and earthquake disasters is necessary for homes located in high-risk areas. FEMA considers average Individual Assistance amounts by state when assessing needs for disaster victims. FEMA suggests using average loss statistics to develop plans for meeting victims' needs. The agency is directed to update factors based on disasters occurring after July 1995. The data on average Individual Assistance amounts by state is based on disasters between July 1995 and July 1999, using 10-year-old data. States are categorized by population size, but the figures have not been updated in 15 years and are based on 1990 Census data. It is unclear how much weight these numbers hold in determining FEMA assistance, as they are not considered thresholds. Congress's mandate in the Stafford Act prevents these figures from being the sole basis for assistance decisions. The presentation of loss indicators may guide states in deciding whether to request assistance, but the data's usefulness in Table 2 is uncertain without a review of detailed information in PDA forms. The numbers of eligible households assisted may reflect the estimated damage for disaster declarations, based on experience from past events. Congress reviews GAO reports and SRIA legislation for insights on the declaration process. In the declaration process, considerations include the composition of Preliminary Damage Assessment teams, involving local officials, state or tribal personnel, and FEMA staff. Some suggest forming permanent teams solely dedicated to PDAs for more consistent assessments. The Preliminary Damage Assessment (PDA) is a crucial part of the declaration process, providing on-site assessments closest to the disaster event. It is important to ensure that these assessments accurately reflect the event's impact and eligible damages. FEMA's IA averages are based on data from 1995 to 1999, but may be updated following post-Hurricane Sandy legislation to reflect more recent experiences in delivering assistance. The IA averages for disaster assistance are based on state population size, with no set threshold like the PA figure of $1 million. Instead of a dollar amount, factors like number of affected families or homes with major damage could be considered. Per capita indicators based on state population lack precision, as seen in the comparison between California and Nevada's earthquake risk and population sizes. The GAO report in 2001 highlighted that per capita personal income measures may not accurately reflect a state's fiscal capacity. The GAO report in 2001 suggested using Total Taxable Resources (TTR) as a better measure of state funding capacity, which tracks growth within a state and provides a more comprehensive view of resources subject to state taxation. FEMA questioned if using TTR would violate legislative prohibitions against arithmetic formulas, but the detailed information it offers could make it a more accurate indicator for disaster aid allocation. The disaster declaration process remains unchanged over time, with FEMA starting to provide PDA information to reveal decision-making. Congress has shown interest in understanding the process and its effectiveness, with calls for more objective criteria for presidential disaster declarations. Calls for more objective criteria for presidential disaster declarations can be muted when disasters occur in politically significant places. While established criteria aim for a uniform process, they may not always determine critical elements. Victim emphasis in natural disasters influences declarations, but political factors also play a role. Precedent can improve the process but may be problematic for different events. The 113th Congress has focused on legislation regarding the disaster declaration process. The 113th Congress has introduced legislation focusing on local impacts in the disaster declaration process. Congress may review FEMA's consistency in damage assessments, state capabilities, and factors used to evaluate disaster damage assessments and state requests.
