The \"Drug Free Sports Act\" mandates professional sports associations to implement random drug testing for athletes at least 5 times a year, without prior notification to athletes or staff. The \"Drug Free Sports Act\" requires random drug testing for athletes at least 5 times a year without prior notification. The Secretary, in consultation with the Director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, will prescribe substances for testing, including prohibited substances by the World Anti-Doping Agency and performance-enhancing substances for each sport. The Secretary may determine additional performance-enhancing substances or substances to conceal them in the body for testing. Professional sports associations can provide exemptions for athletes based on established criteria. The Secretary, in consultation with the Director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, will establish criteria for drug testing in professional sports. Positive test results will lead to penalties, including suspension from participation in the sports association. An athlete testing positive for prohibited substances in professional sports will face suspensions ranging from half a season to a full season, depending on previous violations. Athletes who violate policies on prohibited substances will face permanent suspension from professional sports, with loss of pay during the suspension. Positive test results leading to suspension will be made public, and there are criteria for reducing suspension periods in exceptional circumstances. The Secretary will establish criteria for determining fault or negligence in doping violations, considering WADA's policies. Athletes have the right to a prompt hearing and appeal within 5 days of learning about penalties. The association must hold a hearing before an arbiter within 5 days of learning about a positive test. The arbiter must reach a final decision within 45 days. Penalties are stayed pending an appeal and final decision. The arbiter must be mutually agreed upon by the association and athletes, approved by the Secretary. In prescribing regulations, the Secretary may consult with anti-doping authorities, medical experts, and sports associations. Approval for the arbiter must be mutually agreed upon by the association and athletes, approved by the Secretary. SEC. 4. NONCOMPLIANCE.\n\nAfter 1 year from the final rules issuance, the Secretary can fine professional sports associations not following testing policies. The initial fine is $5,000,000 and can increase by $1,000,000 per day of noncompliance. Fines can be reduced if deemed burdensome.\n\nSEC. 5. REPORTS. The Secretary must provide a report every 2 years on the effectiveness of regulations and compliance by professional sports associations. The Comptroller General will conduct a study on testing policies for performance-enhancing substances in colleges and secondary schools. The Comptroller General will conduct a study on prohibited substance policies and testing procedures in intercollegiate athletic associations, college and university athletic departments, secondary schools, and State and regional interscholastic athletic associations. The study will also analyze estimates for the use of anabolic steroids and human growth hormones by athletes. A report assessing the adequacy of these testing policies and procedures will be transmitted to relevant committees within 1 year of the Act's enactment. The study will assess the adequacy of testing policies in detecting performance-enhancing substances and may recommend expanding regulations to athletic associations. SEC. 6. RULES OF CONSTRUCTION. This Act does not prevent professional sports associations from enforcing existing policies on performance-enhancing substances until new rules are adopted. It also allows associations and athletes to agree on stricter policies than those required by the Act."
