This move aligned with Iran's interests and did not conflict with the US goal of establishing democracy in Iraq. ISCI, an Iraqi faction with close ties to Iran, won a majority in the 2005 election. Nuri al-Maliki became Prime Minister, with key ISCI figures in leadership roles. The group, including leaders like Ayatollah Mohammad Baqr Al Hakim, had ties to Iran. After his death, his brother Abd al Aziz al-Hakim took over, followed by his son Ammar al-Hakim. Other prominent ISCI leaders include Finance Minister Bayan Jabr and deputy president Adel Abd al-Mahdi. The group had an underground militia called the \"Badr Brigades,\" later renamed the \"Badr Organization.\" During the Iran-Iraq war, Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps trained and armed the Badr Organization, an underground militia that conducted attacks in southern Iraq. The militia later integrated into Iraq's security forces and political process. The Sadr faction, initially with limited ties to Iran, has become more politically connected over time. The Sadr clan has political and ideological ties to Iran, with Moqtada Sadr studying in Iran since 2008. Iran recognized the political value of Sadr's faction, which had a significant following among lower-class Iraqi Shiites and built a militia called the \"Mahdi Army\" after Saddam's fall. During 2004-2008, Moqtada Sadr alternately unleashed and reined in the Mahdi Army (JAM) to challenge the U.S. occupation of Iraq. Iran armed the militia through the Qods Force, escalating sectarian killings of Sunnis during the height of conflict in 2005-2006. This added to U.S.-Iran tensions over Iran's nuclear program and regional influence. Tensions over Iran's nuclear program and regional influence heightened as U.S. officials feared Iran's support to armed groups in Iraq aimed at pressuring U.S. forces, bleeding the U.S. militarily, and retaliating in case of military action against Iran's nuclear program. Reports indicated Qods Force aid to Shiite militias in southern Iraq. Iran's Qods Force officers in Iraq are linked to pro-Iranian governors and aid Shiite militias with weapons like armor-piercing EFPs and mortars. This support has led to over 200 U.S. combat deaths since 2003. Pro-Sadr militias in Iraq are using \"Improvised Rocket Assisted Munitions\" with Iranian-supplied rockets. Lebanese Hezbollah is aiding Iraqi Shiite militias with Iran's support of $3 million per month. Former Sadr aide and Hezbollah operative were involved in the killing of five U.S. forces in Karbala. Iran's Ambassador to Iraq is a member of the Qods Force. Gen. Petraeus testified in 2008 about Iran's support for Shiite militias in Iraq, arming and training them to create a Hezbollah-like force. This support led to a split among Iraqi Shiite groups, culminating in Prime Minister Maliki launching an offensive to clear JAM militiamen from Basra. Maliki launched the Basra offensive to reduce Sadrist strength in provincial elections. ISF units, supported by U.S. and British forces, restored normality after initial faltering. Sadr agreed to a ceasefire but not disarmament. Basra battles highlighted the rift between Maliki and Sadr, stemming from their differing views on cooperating with the U.S. troop surge in 2007. In 2007, Maliki shifted his stance to allow U.S. military pressure on the JAM, leading to a rift with Sadr who withdrew his faction from the UIA. This caused clashes between JAM fighters and Iraqi forces in Shiite cities, prompting a backlash against Sadr and a six-month ceasefire declaration. In 2007, clashes between JAM fighters and Iraqi forces led to Sadr declaring a six-month suspension of activities. The Basra battles weakened Sadr politically, prompting him to re-orient his fighters towards peaceful activities under a new movement called \"Mumahidun.\" This included forming special companies to combat U.S. forces in Iraq. New Shiite militias like Asa'ib al-Haq and Keta'ib Hezbollah emerged. New Shiite militias like Asa'ib al-Haq and Keta'ib Hezbollah emerged in 2007, with the latter being designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization in 2009. Asa'ib al-Haq has reconciled with the Iraqi government, while Keta'ib Hezbollah has close links to Lebanese Hezbollah and receives assistance from Iran. The exact relationships among these groups remain unclear. The United States and partner countries have sought to reduce Shiite militia activity in Iraq to stabilize the country and decrease Iranian political influence. U.S. forces arrested Iranians, including alleged Qods Forces officers, and Hezbollah members involved in arms smuggling into Iraq. All detainees were released as the U.S. combat mission transferred to Iraqi Security Forces in 2010. Efforts have been made to outlaw Iranian shipments to Iraqi militias and other pro-Iranian groups in the region. Iranian shipments to Iraqi militias and pro-Iranian groups were targeted by U.S.-backed Resolution 1747 in 2007. U.S. military built bases near the Iranian border to stop arms exports. Efforts to financially squeeze the Qods Force were made by the Bush Administration in 2007. The Bush Administration designated the Qods Force and Revolutionary Guard as terrorism and proliferation-supporting entities in 2007. The Treasury Department took action against Iranian operatives in Iraq, freezing their assets and banning transactions. Keta'ib Hezbollah was designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization in 2009. The Order designated Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis as an FTO for facilitating Iranian weapons deliveries to Shiite militias. Other designees include Qods Force members and Iraqi militia figures accused of fomenting violence in Iraq. At the height of Shiite militia activity in Iraq, the United States engaged Iran to stabilize the region. Initially hesitant due to concerns about Iran's nuclear program, the US eventually attended regional conferences with Iran and Syria in 2007. Key figures involved include Abu Mustafa al-Sheibani, Isma'il al-Lami, and Akram Abbas al-Kabi. The Bush Administration engaged in bilateral meetings with Iran in Baghdad regarding the Iraq issue, led by U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker and Iranian Ambassador Kazemi-Qomi. Despite several meetings, substantive discussions did not take place. Talks scheduled for December 18, 2007, were postponed as Iran wanted them at the ambassador level. Iran later halted the dialogue on May 6, 2008, citing civilian casualties caused by U.S. forces in Sadr City. Iranian Foreign Minister Manuchehr Mottaki visited Iraq in February 2009 and ruled out new talks with the United States on Iraq, citing improved security. This decision may have reflected Iran's uncertainty on how to respond to the Obama Administration's overtures for dialogue. The U.S. continued to offer negotiations with Iran, but shifted focus to imposing additional U.N. sanctions on Iran after the 2009 crackdown on protesters. The U.S. and its allies are discussing imposing more U.N. sanctions on Iran. New sanctions were imposed in June and July 2010. A new Iranian Ambassador in Baghdad, Hassan Danaie-Far, assumed his duties in August 2010. U.S. commanders noted a decrease in Shiite militia activity since late 2008. The March 2010 DoD report stated that Shiite militias were still active but facing internal conflicts and a lack of leadership. Overall, the militias were seen as less of a threat to Iraq's security. The top U.S. commander in Iraq, rotating out in August 2010, highlighted ongoing threats from Shiite militant groups receiving support from Iran. Despite some observers noting that these militias are currently unarmed and focusing on informal influence, Iranian-backed militia activity has decreased since the 2008 Charge of the Knights operation. Public rejection of Iranian political influence in Iraq was evident in early 2009, although Iran continues to seek alternative ways to influence Iraqi policy. Iran seeks to influence Iraqi policy by cultivating relationships with senior political leaders, framing its actions as humanitarian assistance. Despite opposition to the U.S.-Iraq Security Agreement, Iran's influence has limits, as seen in the pact's approval. This criticism may have led to Iraqi leaders demanding significant concessions from the U.S. Iranian attempts to derail the U.S.-Iraq Security Agreement were countered by provisions in the final agreement, including a ban on using Iraqi territory for attacks on other nations and a timetable for U.S. forces withdrawal by the end of 2011. Despite Iran's opposition, the agreement was passed by Iraq's parliament and took effect on January 1, 2009. However, Iran's Supreme Leader warned that the U.S. may not fulfill its pledges under the pact. Iran's political influence in Iraq was further jeopardized by widening political rifts among pro-Iranian Shiite factions, particularly ISCI, during the January 31, 2009, elections. ISCI did not come in first in any Shiite province, indicating a decline in their fortunes. In the Shiite south, Maliki's State of Law slate won in most provinces, securing 28 seats in Baghdad and a majority in Basra. ISCI tied with Maliki in Najaf but had little influence in provincial leadership. The Sadrist list often came in third, with only 2 seats in Basra. However, Sadr's faction formed coalitions to gain leadership positions in some provinces, like Babil. The Sadrist faction gained the chairmanship of the provincial council in Babil Province, marking a setback for Tehran. The 2009 Defense Department report noted that Iraqi nationalism could limit Iran's influence, but Iran still posed a challenge to Iraq's stability. Iran supported Sadr's religious studies in Qom and tried to influence the 2010 national elections in Iraq to rebuild a pan-Shiite political coalition. Tehran's efforts to rebuild the pan-Shiite political coalition in Iraq floundered due to differences among Shiite leaders over retaining Maliki as Prime Minister. As a result, Maliki decided to compete separately in the 2010 elections. Tehran then reportedly worked with certain Shiite politicians to undermine Sunni Arab prospects in the election by disqualifying prominent Sunnis from the main Sunni-supported list. The \"disqualification crisis\" in Iraq, feared to cause a Sunni boycott or violence, involved Iran working through Chalabi and al-Lami to undermine election legitimacy. Despite this, the Iraqiyya coalition won the most seats in the March 2010 elections. Post-election, major political slates, including Iraqiyya, visited Iran for consultations. After the March 2010 elections in Iraq, major political slates, including Iraqiyya, visited Iran for consultations on forming a new government. Despite no agreement being reached after five months, Iran and its allies shifted position to include Iraqiyya in the new governing coalition to appease Sunni voters and prevent potential violence. This move was seen as a strategy to ensure stability in the region. Iranian shift towards stability in Iraq and inter-sect harmony, rather than Shiite dominance. Tehran aims to forge Shiite unity behind a prime ministerial candidate, potentially Maliki. Iran seeks to eliminate its Iraq-based opposition, including urging the expulsion of the Iranian opposition group PMOI from Iraq. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is seen as backing Allawi's bid for Prime Minister. Iraqi leaders, reflecting Iran's influence, want to expel the PMOI group from Iraq. Despite the U.S.-Iraq Security Agreement, tensions rose in 2009 when ISF tried to assert control over Ashraf, leading to clashes with PMOI residents resulting in casualties. The PMOI leaders reported 10 residents killed and many injured in clashes with ISF. The Iraqi government planned to relocate residents to Al Muthanna Province but has not done so. The U.S. considers the issue an Iraqi matter and Iraqi forces have control over Ashraf. Uncertainty remains about the residents' options and status under international law. Around 200 residents have left as refugees through U.N.-led processes. About 200 PMOI residents have used U.N.-led processes to leave Iraq as refugees, while the rest at Ashraf have refused. Iraq is considering moving the camp to Anbar Province. Few countries accept PMOI activists due to their terrorist designation, but the EU removed them from its list in 2009. A U.S. appeals court ruling in 2010 instructed a review of the group's terrorist designation. Iran has targeted perceived enemies on the border using its close relations with Iraq. Iran has targeted perceived enemies on the border, including Kurdish-inhabited villages in Iraq. Iraqi officials have acknowledged responsibility for starting the Iran-Iraq war and signed agreements with Iran on military cooperation. Iraqi officials responded to U.S. complaints by stating that any Iran-Iraq military cooperation would not involve Iranian training of Iraqi forces. Iraq's Foreign Minister supported Iran's right to pursue \"peaceful\" nuclear technology. Iran has not returned 153 Iraqi military and civilian aircraft taken during the 1991 Gulf War. The ICRC is working to resolve the 75,000 Iranians and Iraqis still missing from the Iran-Iraq war. Iran accuses Iraq of not doing enough to prevent the Iranian Kurdish separatist group PJAK from finding safe haven in Iraq. Iran accuses Iraq of not doing enough to prevent the Iranian Kurdish separatist group PJAK from finding safe haven in Iraq. The U.S. Treasury Department named PJAK as a terrorism supporting entity in 2009. Territorial disputes between Iran and Iraq were resolved in 2000, but border demarcations remain unresolved. Foreign Minister Zebari urged Iran to move forward with demarcations in 2009. Iranian forces entered Iraq to seize control of the Fakkah oilfield in a remote section of the Iraqi province of Maysan, near the Iranian border. The incursion may have been an attempt to assert influence over Iraq's energy fields. Maliki visited Iran four times as Prime Minister to consult on major issues and sign agreements, including deals on cross-border migration, intelligence sharing, pipelines for crude oil transport, mine clearance, and buying electricity. Ahmadinejad visited Iraq in 2008, announcing $1 billion in credits for Iranian exports to Iraq. Iranian exports to Iraq have increased significantly, with a $1 billion credit extended in 2005 for building a new airport near Najaf. Trade relations have grown, with bilateral trade reaching $4 billion by 2009. Agreements for cooperation in various sectors have been signed, including a $1 billion contract awarded to an Iranian firm for rebuilding Basra and repairing historical sites in southern Iraq. Plans are in place to increase trade to $5 billion annually through oil and electricity-related trade. Iran and Iraq have increased trade relations, with Iran supplying electricity and fuel to Iraq to help with electricity shortages. A free trade zone has been developed around Basra, with plans to double trade volumes. The Kurdish region of Iraq has also seen exports of oil and gasoline to Iran. The U.S. attempt to isolate Iran has given Iraq increased leverage in the relationship. Iran and Iraq have strengthened trade relations, with Iran providing electricity and fuel to help with shortages in Iraq. Iraq has gained leverage in the relationship due to U.S. attempts to isolate Iran. Additionally, Iraq has approved a natural gas pipeline route from Iran to Europe, potentially aiding Iran in offsetting sanctions. Iran's influence in Iraq has decreased since 2005-2008, with predictions of further decline as Iraq asserts its nationhood and Arab-Persian differences resurface. Iraq's loyalty to the Iraqi regime during the Iran-Iraq war is evident. Najaf, a secure and prosperous city, may surpass Qom as the center of the Shiite theological world. Despite some emerging trends, the intense enmity seen during Saddam Hussein's rule is unlikely to return. Relations between Iraq and Iran are expected to remain non-adversarial, with Iraq potentially playing a crucial role in Iran's efforts to counter U.S. isolation attempts."
