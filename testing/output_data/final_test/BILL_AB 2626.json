    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. The Legislature of California emphasizes the importance of trust between law enforcement and communities for safety and protection. Principled policing, including procedural justice and implicit bias training, is key to improving these relationships. California supports evidence-based strategies to enhance trust between law enforcement and communities. Implementing principled policing, focusing on procedural justice and implicit bias, is crucial for building trust and enhancing safety in law enforcement and communities. The commission in California will provide guidelines and training on these principles for all peace officers. Procedural justice involves treating citizens fairly, remaining neutral, showing respect, and communicating effectively to demonstrate trustworthiness. (3) \"Implicit bias\" refers to unconscious thoughts or feelings that can impact actions towards social groups without awareness. The guidelines emphasize procedural justice to improve trust between law enforcement and communities and address how implicit bias can hinder procedural justice. The course of basic training for peace officers includes instruction on procedural justice and implicit bias to promote mutual respect and cooperation between law enforcement and communities. The curriculum is evidence-based and developed in consultation with experts in procedural justice and implicit bias, including law enforcement agencies, university professors, and community organizations specializing in civil and human rights and criminal justice. The commission aims to improve trust between law enforcement and communities by addressing procedural justice and implicit bias. Training will be provided to peace officers to teach these concepts to their colleagues within their departments. Law enforcement agencies are encouraged to send police executives or managers for this training. Law enforcement agencies are encouraged to send police executives and training officers to a training course on principled policing. Upon completion, officers will be certified to conduct the training for colleagues in their agencies. The course will be offered quarterly in regional training centers starting in June 2017. The commission will evaluate current basic training courses for peace officers and incorporate principled policing concepts by June 1, 2018. Refresher courses will be required every five years. Reimbursement for mandated costs will be provided to local agencies if determined by the Commission on State Mandates."
