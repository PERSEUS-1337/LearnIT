    "content": "The \"Prepare All Kids Act of 2007\" is cited as the short title. It amends the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 to include High Quality Full-Day Prekindergarten Programs in Chapter 8. The purpose of this amendment is to establish high-quality full-day prekindergarten programs. Congress finds that investments in children and early education should be a national priority due to the prohibitive cost of high-quality preschool for poor families. State-funded preschool is rapidly expanding, but unstable funding threatens its quality provision. Research shows that investing in high-quality prekindergarten programs is cost-effective, with every $1 invested resulting in over $17 in savings in various areas. High quality early education is crucial for preschool-age children, as it narrows the preparation gap between poor and middle-class children. It also leads to academic success by increasing graduation rates, improving test scores, reducing grade repetition, and decreasing special education placements. Additionally, it promotes responsible behavior in teens and adults by reducing crime and delinquency. The purpose of this Act is to assist States in providing high quality full-day prekindergarten programs for children from low-income families, aiming to reduce crime, teen pregnancy, and promote stable families.
