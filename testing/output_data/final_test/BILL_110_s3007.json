    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"World War II War Crimes Accountability Act of 2008\". Congress finds that surviving Nazi war criminals are rare, with many identities only revealed after the Cold War. Former communist countries have vast information on war crimes suspects but limited resources. The Office of Special Investigations in the US is responsible for prosecuting individuals involved in Nazi-sponsored persecution between 1933 and 1945. As of April 2008, OSI had successfully prosecuted many cases. In 2002, the Simon Wiesenthal Center launched Operation: Last Chance to help identify and prosecute Nazi war criminals residing in the United States. Some foreign governments hinder extradition efforts, while nongovernmental organizations have been crucial in searching for suspects for over 60 years. Operation: Last Chance aims to maximize identification and prosecution of remaining Nazi war criminals, seeking justice for Holocaust victims. Simon Wiesenthal dedicated his life to documenting Holocaust crimes and capturing fugitive perpetrators. As head of the Jewish Documentation Center in Vienna, he successfully brought wanted Nazi war criminals like Franz Stangl, Franz Murer, and Erich Rajakowitsch to justice. Erich Rajakowitsch was responsible for \"death transports\" in Holland. Simon Wiesenthal's work on justice, war crimes, and crimes against humanity should be continued. Operation: Last Chance has identified Dr. Aribert Heim as the most wanted ex-Nazi, known for committing terrible crimes at Mauthausen concentration camp. During the fall of 1941, hearts were removed from victims by torturous killing methods. Dr. Sandor Kepiro, a Hungarian officer, was convicted in 1944 for mass murder in Novi Sad. Milivoj Asner, a police chief, orchestrated robbery and persecution in Slavonska Pozega during 1941 and 1942. Milivoj Asner orchestrated the robbery, persecution, and destruction of local Serb, Jewish, and Gypsy communities, leading to the deportation of hundreds to Ustasha concentration camps where most were killed. After being exposed in Operation: Last Chance, he escaped to Klagenfurt, Austria. Charles Zentai is accused of murdering a Jewish boy in 1944 and fled to Australia in 1950 after extradition requests were ignored. The Senate encourages extradition and prosecution of Nazi war criminals, praises the Simon Wiesenthal Center for their work on the Holocaust, and commends the Office of Special Investigation for bringing WWII criminals to justice. Visa waiver program countries are designated. After a country is designated as a visa waiver program country, the Attorney General evaluates cooperation in extraditing Nazi war criminals and admitting aliens ordered removed from the United States. The President has discretion if it is not in the national interest. The President may choose not to terminate a country's visa waiver program designation if it is not in the national interest, after notifying specific congressional committees. The notification must include identifying crime suspects who have not been admitted. The President may choose not to terminate a country's visa waiver program designation if it is not in the national interest, after notifying specific congressional committees. The notification must include identifying crime suspects who have not been admitted and submitting relevant decisions from immigration judges and courts. In fiscal years 2009-2013, the President must submit an annual report to specified committees regarding countries with pending visa waiver applications. The report assesses if these countries are cooperating in extraditing Nazi war crimes suspects, prosecuting them effectively, and admitting certain aliens ordered for removal from the US."
