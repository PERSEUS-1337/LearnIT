A disqualified disposition includes any sale, exchange, or other disposition that violates restrictions on employer securities held in a qualified cash or deferred arrangement. The rules for qualified cash or deferred arrangements state that if a corporation has multiple arrangements, the most restrictive provisions regarding the disposition of employer securities apply. SEC. 420B imposes an additional tax on undisclosed retirement perks. SEC. 420B imposes a 50 percent tax on the net cost of personal perks provided to a retired executive of a publicly traded corporation, with exceptions for perks provided with shareholder approval. The net cost of personal perks for a retired executive is the excess of the corporation's cost of perks over the executive's reimbursement. Personal perks include corporate-owned property and travel expenses not related to business services. Expenses related to personal perks for executives are detailed under section 274, including tickets to events, club memberships, and personal services like residence maintenance. The cost of using corporate-owned property is determined by the allocable portion of operating expenses. The allocable portion of total cost for operating and maintaining corporate-owned property is determined based on the relationship of the use to the total use of the property during the taxable year. SEC. 420C requires the inclusion in gross income of funded deferred compensation of corporate insiders. SEC. 420C requires inclusion of deferred compensation in gross income for corporate insiders when there is no substantial risk of forfeiture. The tax treatment is determined under section 72 for amounts available under the funded deferred compensation plan. The term \"deferred compensation\" excludes plans where the employee's rights are no greater than a general creditor, all amounts remain the property of the employer, and are available to satisfy general creditors' claims at all times. This term does not include qualified employer plans. The term \"deferred compensation\" excludes plans where the compensation is payable only upon separation from service, death, disability, or at a specified time. The plan must not allow acceleration of payment by any event. If there is a modification to accelerate payment, all previously deferred compensation is affected. If there is a modification to accelerate payment in a deferred compensation plan, all previously deferred compensation becomes taxable in the year of modification. The taxpayer must pay interest on the underpayments that would have occurred if the compensation had been included in gross income earlier. A plan fails to meet requirements if the employee has a beneficial interest in the trust holding the deferred amounts. The trust must allow assets to satisfy general creditors' claims at all times, without hindrance. Factors making it harder for creditors to access trust assets than if held directly by the employer in the US are not allowed, except as specified by regulations. The term 'qualified employer plan' includes various types of plans and trusts, as well as any plan of a tax-exempt organization. The term 'plan' encompasses any agreement or arrangement. Compensation rights are subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture if tied to future services. Deferred compensation references are treated differently for specific purposes. References to deferred compensation are treated as including income attributable to such compensation or income. SEC. 420D. DEFINITIONS AND SPECIAL RULE. Definitions for corporate insiders, retired executives, and publicly traded corporations are provided in this subpart. A corporate insider is defined as an individual subject to certain requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. A retired executive is a former corporate insider no longer working full-time in the capacity that led to being subject to these requirements. The term 'publicly traded corporation' refers to a corporation issuing securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 'Corporate-owned property' includes planes, residences, vacation facilities, and cars owned or leased by a corporation. The term 'publicly traded corporation' excludes property used for transportation, lodging, or entertainment services to the general public. The tax imposed by sections 420A and 420B is not considered a tax under this chapter for determining credits or minimum tax. The amendments made by this section regarding executive perks and retirement benefits under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 have specific effective dates for stock acquisition and perks provided after the enactment of the Act. The amendments made by this section regarding executive perks and retirement benefits under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 have specific effective dates for stock acquisition and perks provided after the enactment of the Act. The first annual shareholders meeting after the enactment of this Act will be subject to new regulations, and Section 420C of the Code will apply to amounts deferred post-enactment."
