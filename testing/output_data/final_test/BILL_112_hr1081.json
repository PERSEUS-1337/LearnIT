    "content": "The Act titled \"Consumers Payment System Protection Act\" delays the application of rules issued under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act by 1 year. Additionally, a study and report are required. The Act requires a study on the impact of section 1075 of the Dodd-Frank Act on consumers, card issuers, merchants, and financial institutions. The study will include participants regardless of exemptions from related rules. The study will analyze costs and investments related to debit card transactions before the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as the potential impact of the proposed rule on interchange fees and routing. The study will analyze the impact of reduced debit card interchange fees on consumers, including cost, consequences, consumer protection, privacy, and effects on low- and moderate-income consumers and small businesses. The study will analyze the impact of reduced debit card interchange fees on consumers, including cost, consequences, consumer protection, privacy, and effects on low- and moderate-income consumers, small businesses, and debit card issuers. It will also assess whether reduced fees would recoup costs and investments, increase risks to issuers, and impact their safety and soundness. The impact of the exemption for smaller banks and credit unions on potential merchant behavior, discrimination against debit cards, adverse impact on deposit base, and payment system will be analyzed. Additionally, the study will assess the impact of reduced debit card interchange fees on merchants' ability to pass savings on to consumers. The impact of debit card exclusivity and transaction routing provisions on consumers, debit card issuers, and merchants will be analyzed, including effects on electronic payment technologies. The impact of mandating a specific number of enabled networks on debit cards and other entities utilizing debit card transactions will be analyzed under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act. A report by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and other agencies is due within 8 months of the Act's enactment. The Insurance Corporation, the Chairperson of the National Credit Union Administration, and the Comptroller of the Currency will jointly submit a report to Congress analyzing the results of a study, determining if revisions are needed for proposed or final rules, and assessing if changes are necessary to provisions under the Dodd-Frank Act. The Federal Reserve System's Board of Governors will have 4 months after the report submission to make any necessary rule revisions. The report submitted may lead to revisions in proposed or final rules if key regulatory agencies determine that certain costs are not covered or consumers will be negatively impacted. The exemption of small financial institutions, defined as those with less than $10,000,000,000 in assets, under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, may not be effective in practice. Definitions for \"consumer\", \"financial institution\", and \"State\" are consistent with the Electronic Fund Transfer Act."
