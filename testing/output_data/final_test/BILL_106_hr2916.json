The \"Handgun Licensing Act of 1999\" mandates that individuals must have a valid handgun license issued by the State and additional identification to transfer a handgun or handgun ammunition to someone not licensed under section 923 of title 18, United States Code. The Handgun Licensing Act of 1999 requires individuals to have a valid handgun license and additional identification to transfer a handgun or ammunition to someone not licensed. It is unlawful for an unlicensed individual to receive a handgun or ammunition without a valid handgun license. The Handgun Licensing Act of 1999 mandates that individuals must possess a valid handgun license issued by the State to transfer handguns or ammunition. The license must be issued by the chief law enforcement officer, contain specific personal information, and meet certain requirements. The State law requires that a handgun license applicant must be at least 21 years old, a resident of the State, pass background checks, and the license is valid for up to 2 years. The State law mandates that individuals must meet specific criteria to obtain a handgun license, including being at least 21 years old, passing background checks, and holding a handgun safety certificate. The law also requires the chief law enforcement officer to provide written reasons for denying a license within 20 days upon request. Additionally, the license can be revoked if the licensee no longer meets the eligibility requirements. The State law requires individuals to meet criteria for a handgun license, including being 21, passing background checks, and having a handgun safety certificate. If the license is revoked, it must be returned to the chief law enforcement officer. Failure to report theft or loss of a firearm can result in a civil penalty of at least $1,000. A safety certificate is issued under State law for completing a handgun safety course. The chief law enforcement officer must issue the certificate, and applicants must complete a 2-hour course taught by law enforcement officers. The bill requires applicants to complete a 2-hour handgun safety course and pass an exam designed by the chief law enforcement officer. The definition of handgun ammunition is also clarified, and a penalty amendment is included. The bill includes amendments to section 922 of title 18, United States Code, regarding licensing and registration systems for firearms. It authorizes grants for states to cover startup costs and appropriates $200,000,000 for fiscal year 2000 and beyond. The effective date of these amendments is specified. The amendments made by this section regarding licensing and registration systems for firearms shall take effect 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act. Requirement of business liability insurance: Amends title 18, United States Code to require businesses to have insurance providing personal injury protection up to $100,000 for individuals injured or killed by a handgun obtained due to the applicant's negligence."
