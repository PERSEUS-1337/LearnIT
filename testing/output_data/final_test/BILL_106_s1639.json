The Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act of 1977 is amended to allocate funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the United States Geological Survey for earthquake hazard reduction efforts in specific fiscal years. The Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act of 1977 is amended to authorize funding for earthquake hazard reduction efforts through the United States Geological Survey, with specific allocations for the Global Seismic Network and the Scientific Earthquake Studies Advisory Committee in fiscal years 2001, 2002, and 2003. The Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act of 1977 is amended to authorize funding for earthquake hazard reduction efforts through the United States Geological Survey, with specific allocations for the Global Seismic Network and the Scientific Earthquake Studies Advisory Committee in fiscal years 2001, 2002, and 2003, totaling $52,558,000. The Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act of 1977 is amended to allocate funding for earthquake hazard reduction efforts through the National Science Foundation, with specific amounts for engineering and geosciences research in fiscal years 2001, 2002, and 2003, totaling $52,558,000. The Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act of 1977 allocates funding for engineering and geosciences research through the National Institute of Standards and Technology, with specific amounts for fiscal years 2001, 2002, and 2003 totaling $52,558,000. SEC. 3. REPEALS. Section 10 and subsections (e) and (f) of section 12 of the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act of 1977 are repealed. SEC. 4. ADVANCED NATIONAL SEISMIC RESEARCH AND MONITORING SYSTEM. The Act is amended to include a new section on an Advanced National Seismic Research and Monitoring System. The Director of the US Geological Survey will establish an Advanced National Seismic Research and Monitoring System to enhance earthquake research and warning capabilities by coordinating national, regional, and urban seismic monitoring systems. Within 90 days of the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Authorization Act of 2000, a 5-year management plan for the system will be submitted to Congress. The Director of the US Geological Survey will establish the Advanced National Seismic Research and Monitoring System with annual cost estimates for modernization and operation, milestones, standards, and performance goals. Authorization of appropriations includes $33,500,000 for fiscal year 2002 and $33,700,000 for fiscal year 2003.

The Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act of 1977 is amended to include a new section establishing a Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation. The Director of the National Science Foundation will establish the George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation to upgrade and integrate experimental facilities for earthquake testing. $28,200,000 is authorized for fiscal year 2001 for this purpose. The National Science Foundation authorizes funding for the Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation: $24.4 million for 2002, $4.5 million for 2003, and $17 million for 2004. SEC. 6. BUDGET COORDINATION. Section 5 of the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act of 1977 is amended to include budget coordination guidance for Program agencies in preparing annual budget requests. Each Program agency must submit a report with its annual budget request to the Office of Management and Budget, detailing proposed activities, their contribution to the Program, and the allocation of funds. SEC. 7. REPORT ON AT-RISK POPULATIONS. The Director of FEMA must submit a report to Congress within one year of the Act's enactment, detailing how the Program addresses the needs of at-risk populations like the elderly, disabled, non-English speakers, single-parent households, and the poor. Recommendations for additional actions and legislative authority may also be included. SEC. 8 amends the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act to increase public access to earthquake information. SEC. 9 expands the definition of lifelines to include infrastructure. SEC. 10 establishes a Scientific Earthquake Studies Advisory Committee. The Director of the US Geological Survey will establish a Scientific Earthquake Studies Advisory Committee consisting of up to ten qualified individuals selected based on distinguished service records and diverse expertise.
