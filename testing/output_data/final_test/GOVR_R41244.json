    "content": "The U.S. Constitution grants Congress the power to regulate commerce among states and with foreign nations. In 1937, the Supreme Court ruled in NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp. that Congress can protect interstate commerce from obstructions. This decision allowed Congress to regulate activities that impact commerce, setting the stage for broader regulatory authority. In United States v. Lopez, the Supreme Court questioned Congress's reliance on the Commerce Clause for federal jurisdiction. The Court ruled that the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990 exceeded Congress's authority under the Commerce Clause because it did not regulate a commercial activity or require a connection to interstate commerce. This case raised concerns about the extent of Congress's power under the Commerce Clause. In Gonzales v. Raich, the Supreme Court upheld federal statutes passed under the Commerce Clause, setting new limits on Congress's legislative authority. The case involved a challenge to the Controlled Substances Act regarding the intrastate, noncommercial cultivation and possession of marijuana for medical purposes. The Court ruled that Congress could regulate individual activities with potential economic effects on national markets. In Gonzales v. Raich, the Supreme Court upheld federal statutes under the Commerce Clause, allowing Congress to regulate individual activities with economic effects on national markets. This decision was based on the precedent set in Wickard v. Filburn, where Congress was able to regulate wheat consumption on a farm to control prices. The Court in Raich upheld Congress's power to regulate the production and consumption of marijuana for medical purposes under the Commerce Clause. This decision was based on the precedent set in Wickard v. Filburn, where Congress regulated wheat consumption on a farm to control prices. The Court found that allowing the production and consumption of marijuana could impact the illegal market and frustrate federal interests in eliminating commercial transactions. Congress had a rational basis to determine that the production of commodities for home consumption could affect supply and demand. The Court upheld Congress's power to regulate marijuana for medical purposes under the Commerce Clause, citing Wickard v. Filburn. This decision could impact supply and demand, and the expansive interpretation of federal powers may overlap with state authority. The Necessary and Proper Clause in the Constitution supplements Congress's powers, but defining limits on federal power has been challenging for the Supreme Court. The Tenth Amendment, which reserves powers to the states or the people, has had limited impact on defining federal reach. The Supreme Court has had limited success in defining the reach of federal authority despite the Tenth Amendment's reservation of powers to the states. In National League of Cities v. Usery, federal wage and price controls on state and local employees were struck down as infringing on core state functions, with Justice Rehnquist emphasizing the importance of state sovereignty in determining employee compensation and work hours. The Supreme Court ruled in National League of Cities v. Usery that federal wage and price controls interfered with state sovereignty by imposing new costs and displacing state policies. Justice Stevens dissented, arguing that the majority opinion lacked a clear principle to distinguish valid state regulations. The Court's decision limited federal interference with state rights to set wages, but Justice Stevens contended that other forms of regulation could still apply. The Federal Government may regulate the activities of the capitol janitor, such as withholding taxes, enforcing safety regulations, and setting speed limits for state-owned vehicles. Lower courts struggled to define which \"core state functions\" were exempt from federal regulation after the National League of Cities ruling. After the National League of Cities ruling, lower federal courts found that certain state functions like ambulance services and licensing drivers were immune from government regulation. However, in Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, the Court reversed course and overruled National League of Cities, stating it was difficult to distinguish which activities were subject to federal regulation. The Court in Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority stated that disputes over the effects of federal commerce power legislation on state sovereignty are political questions. States should seek relief from federal regulation through the political process, ending the Court's attempt to limit federal government regulation of states. The Court then addressed how the Constitution limits the federal government's means of regulating states in New York v. United States regarding low-level radioactive waste disposal. In New York v. United States, the Court found that Congress overstepped its authority by attempting to force states to regulate low-level radioactive waste disposal or take ownership of the waste, violating the Tenth Amendment. In Printz v. United States, the Brady Handgun Act was challenged under the Tenth Amendment for requiring state executive branch officers to conduct background checks on handgun purchasers. The Court ruled that Congress cannot commandeer state officials, violating the Tenth Amendment. Justice Stevens dissented, raising practical concerns about the Court's Tenth Amendment decisions. The Court's Tenth Amendment decisions limit federal authority, potentially leading to increased federal regulation. Justice Stevens argues that this rule could damage safeguards against tyranny by incentivizing the National Government to expand its power through creating vast national bureaucracies. The Fourteenth Amendment's Section 5 grants Congress the power to enforce rights against state actions, leading to more deference from courts towards federal regulation. Interpretations of Congress's authority under Section 5 have evolved over time, with debates on the extent of its enforcement powers. The Supreme Court has debated the extent of Congress's authority to enforce rights under the Fourteenth Amendment's Section 5, particularly in cases like Flores v. City of Boerne where the Religious Freedom Restoration Act was struck down for exceeding Congress's power. This case arose when a church in Boerne, TX, was denied a building permit due to being in a historical district, leading to a legal challenge. The Supreme Court found that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) exceeded Congress's power under the Fourteenth Amendment's Section 5. RFRA was seen as an attempt to overturn a Supreme Court decision rather than remedy a specific problem. The Court deemed RFRA to be an overbroad response to a nonexistent issue, as it broadly inhibited state and local regulations without focusing on a specific harm to religion. The \"congruence and proportionality\" test in Boerne posed challenges in regulating states under different contexts. While Congress has broad power under the Commerce Clause, it cannot authorize suits against states for violating federal laws due to state sovereign immunity. However, Congress could abrogate state sovereign immunity under \u00a7 5, but its power was limited. In a 2004 decision, the Court upheld suits against states for ADA violations in Tennessee v. Lane. In Tennessee v. Lane, paraplegic plaintiffs alleged that the State of Tennessee violated Title II of the ADA by failing to provide physical access to state courts. The Court held that Title II was a proper exercise of Congress's authority under the Fourteenth Amendment to abrogate states' Eleventh Amendment immunity. The right protected in Title II was access to public services, programs, and activities. The Court emphasized that Title II of the ADA was intended to protect the more rigorously protected rights of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, such as the right of access to the courts. This required a higher standard of protection than would generally apply, making Title II a valid prophylactic remedy for the denial of access to courts."
