    "content": "The United States has been a leader in reducing restrictions on foreign investment for over 50 years, driven by a commitment to open markets and international capital flow. With $2.6 trillion in foreign direct investment and $4.1 trillion in U.S. direct investment abroad by 2011, the U.S. economy is deeply interconnected with the global economy through globalization. The United States has important economic, political, and social interests in international policies regarding direct investment. Domestic policies treat foreign investors favorably, with efforts to negotiate reduced restrictions on foreign direct investment globally. However, post-9/11, some Members of Congress are reevaluating this open-door policy for foreign investment. The United States has significant interests in international direct investment policies. Post-9/11, Congress has concerns about the impact of foreign investments on the economy and national security. In 2007, Congress strengthened its oversight of foreign investments through the Foreign Investment and National Security Act. The economic costs and benefits of policies restricting foreign investment for national security reasons are difficult to estimate. Foreign direct investment can be restricted for national security concerns, but it is unclear if these policies are for security enhancement or economic protectionism. In 2011, foreigners invested $234 billion in U.S. businesses and real estate, a 14% increase from 2010. U.S. parent firms also increased investments abroad by 28% in 2011. Global foreign direct investment flows rebounded in 2011 after a sharp drop in 2009 and 2010. The stock of foreign direct investment in the United States rose from $2.26 trillion in 2010 to about $2.55 trillion in 2011, marking a 12.5% increase. Foreign direct investments in the U.S. manufacturing sector were higher in 2011, accounting for nearly half of the overall increase. Investments in banking, finance, retail trade, and professional services also increased in 2011, while investments in wholesale trade, real estate, and information sectors decreased. Data for the first two quarters of 2012 show continued foreign direct investment trends. Foreign direct investment in the United States is down 41% in the first two quarters of 2012 compared to 2011. U.S. direct investment abroad fell sharply in 2009, dropping from $332 billion in 2008 to $221 billion in 2009. This decline was influenced by actions taken by U.S. parent firms to reduce reinvested earnings to take advantage of tax provisions in the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Global foreign investment flows reached $1.5 trillion in 2011, a 16% increase from 2010, driven by higher profits of multinational corporations and growth in developing countries. The financial crisis in 2009 led to a 33% drop in global investment flows, with developed economies seeing a decrease in their share from two-thirds to half between 2009 and 2011. Africa receives the smallest share of foreign investment, typically less than 5%, while Latin America receives about. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) reported that global foreign direct investment surpassed $20 trillion in 2011, with developed economies receiving the largest share of investment funds. The United States is a significant source and recipient of these funds. Foreign direct investment exceeded $20 trillion in 2011, with developed economies being the main recipients. Japan stands out as an exception, investing $962 billion abroad but receiving $226 billion in inflows. Asia, Latin America, and Africa are major destinations for direct investment. The US had 2,300 parent companies with 27,000 affiliates abroad, employing 13.3 million workers overseas and 23 million domestically. Foreign firms had 6,000 affiliates in the US, employing 5.8 million workers. U.S. firms employ 5.8 million workers abroad, while foreign firms employ 5.8 million workers in the United States. U.S. affiliates of foreign firms pay 80% of employee compensation in the U.S., while foreign affiliates of U.S. firms have higher gross product value. U.S. affiliates of foreign firms have lower total sales compared to foreign affiliates of U.S. firms. U.S. multinational companies also contribute significantly to the U.S. economy. U.S. multinational companies play a significant role in the economy, producing $2.9 trillion in goods and services in 2010. This amount accounted for about 21% of total U.S. private industry gross product. The data also show the impact of the U.S. economy's improvement after 2002 on these companies. The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, have led nations to reconsider their national security interests regarding foreign investments, particularly in areas deemed essential. This has raised concerns among organizations like the OECD, which promotes liberalized government restrictions on international investment. The United States, known for being receptive to foreign direct investment, has been a leader in this area. The United States has been a leader in promoting reduced restrictions on foreign direct investment internationally, supporting OECD efforts like the Code of Liberalization of Capital Movements and the Declaration on International Investment. The United States and other OECD signatories recognize the exception to open investment policies for essential security interests and public order. Each state can assess its own security interests regarding investments. Under customary international law, the argument of necessity pertains to incidents that pose a grave peril to a country's vital interests such as political or economic survival, essential services, internal peace, population survival, and environmental preservation. Nations have the exclusive right to determine if restricting foreign investment is necessary to protect their essential security interests. As governments review their foreign investment policies, they face a trade-off between maintaining an open international investment environment and safeguarding national security interests. Policies on reviewing foreign direct investments are precautionary measures due to potential threats to national security, such as loss of technology, jobs, and political influence. These threats do not include acts of transnational terrorism aimed at deterring foreign capital. The OECD reports that governments are reviewing policies on inward foreign investment due to national security concerns. Regulatory regimes have been used to deter certain investments, and the OECD formed the \"Freedom of Investment, National Security and 'Strategic Industries'\" project in 2006 to address these issues. Members of the investment project have agreed to support three principles for national investment policy measures: transparency, predictability, proportionality, and accountability. The Group of Eight (G8) issued a declaration on freedom of investment, environment, and social responsibility in June 2007, emphasizing support for the OECD project on Freedom of Investment, National Security, and Strategic Industries. The G8 also expressed commitment to strengthening open and transparent investment regimes. The Group of Eight (G8) members support open and transparent investment regimes and oppose protectionism. They emphasize the importance of free markets for global capital movements and economic growth. They aim to minimize national restrictions on foreign investment, with restrictions only for national security reasons. The OECD project on investment provides policy guidance for building trust and confidence in international investment. The OECD project on investment provides policy guidance for building trust and confidence in international investment. OECD members have adopted 14 guidelines to establish consistency in implementing investment policies. G-20 members have resisted protectionist pressures and taken measures to facilitate investment flows without new restrictions on foreign investment for national security reasons. The OECD members have adopted 14 guidelines for investment policy measures, focusing on transparency, proportionality, and accountability. These guidelines aim to ensure national security while treating foreign and domestic investments equally. Key measures include transparency in regulatory practices, codification of laws, prior notification of policy changes, and consultation with interested parties. The OECD members have adopted 14 guidelines for investment policy measures, focusing on transparency, proportionality, and accountability. Governments should seek the views of interested parties when considering changing investment policies. Reviews should have time limits and protect sensitive information. Investment policy actions should be disclosed for accountability. Restrictions on national security should be proportionate and self-judging. Investment restrictions should be narrowly focused on national security concerns and benefit from appropriate expertise. Investment measures should be tailored to specific risks, used as a last resort, and reviewed for accountability. Critical infrastructure is a separate concern within essential security interests for foreign investment. National definitions of critical infrastructure vary among countries. National definitions of critical infrastructure vary among countries, with most defining it as physical infrastructure essential for economic and social well-being, public safety, and key government functions. These definitions allow governments flexibility in designating critical sectors, considering the economic and security context. Countries adhering to the OECD National Treatment Instrument can exclude sectors from designation as critical infrastructure. Countries adhering to the OECD National Treatment Instrument can exclude sectors from the national treatment standard based on essential security interests, allowing them to restrict foreign investment in critical infrastructure. This process involves notifying other members of the exemption request to maintain transparency. A recent OECD study found that all 39 nations party to the Instrument have implemented discriminatory foreign investment policies to safeguard critical infrastructure. All 39 nations party to the OECD National Treatment Instrument report discriminatory measures against foreign investment in critical infrastructure sectors, with transport being the most targeted. Restrictions fall into three categories: blanket, sector-specific, and broad measures to block investments deemed security threats. The OECD noted that national restrictions are generally described and attributed this to the nature of security threats. The OECD found that security threats can impact perceived vulnerabilities, with assessments influenced by the investor's nationality. Some threats can be mitigated easily, while others cannot. Not all countries can conduct thorough evaluations of security threats. Restrictions on foreign investment are seen as a last resort to enhance national security, assisting in identifying and addressing security threats posed by international investments. US policy on foreign direct investment focuses on the mutual benefits for both countries. Investment in direct foreign investment benefits both home and host countries, with economists arguing that international capital flows positively impact economies. Direct investment abroad helps firms exploit competitive advantages, enhancing their position domestically and globally. Inward direct investment benefits the United States by permanently adding to its economy. The United States benefits from inward direct investment as it adds to the nation's capital stock and skill set, brings technological advances, boosts capital formation, contributes to a competitive business environment and productivity, and enhances international trade and integration. U.S. policy generally treats direct investment impartially, with some exceptions such as sectoral restrictions and approval procedures for mergers and acquisitions. The United States benefits from inward direct investment, adding to the nation's capital stock, bringing technological advances, boosting capital formation, contributing to a competitive business environment, and enhancing international trade and integration. U.S. policy treats direct investment impartially, with exceptions like sectoral restrictions and approval procedures for mergers and acquisitions, including restrictions on foreign ownership in certain industrial sectors for national security reasons. The Exxon-Florio provision, approved in 1988, applies to foreign investment in existing U.S. firms through mergers, acquisitions, or takeovers. The Exxon-Florio provision, approved in 1988, grants the President discretionary authority to suspend or prohibit foreign acquisitions that threaten national security. The provision focuses on transactions involving key technologies essential to the U.S. defense industrial base, as directed by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) oversees national security implications of foreign investment in the economy, implementing the statute to protect national security and international obligations. The Exxon-Florio process reviews foreign mergers, acquisitions, or takeovers to determine if they threaten national security, with CFIUS having specific timeframes for review and investigation. The President has specific timeframes for conducting reviews and investigations related to foreign mergers, acquisitions, or takeovers that may threaten national security. The Treasury Department officials expect each member of CFIUS to apply a definition of national security consistent with their agency's legislative mandate, such as the Department of Defense's National Industrial Security Program. The provisions aim to prevent foreign firms from accessing critical technology and classified information through acquiring U.S. firms. This review process is separate from CFIUS and was influenced by the events of September 11, 2001. Congress showed a change in attitude in 2006 after the Dubai Ports World attempted to purchase P&O Ports. In this act, Congress defined \"critical industries\" as systems and assets vital to the United States' security, national economic security, public health, or safety. Specific sectors like telecommunications, energy, and transportation were identified as critical infrastructure. Congress later transferred the responsibility for identifying critical infrastructure. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred the responsibility for identifying critical infrastructure to the Department of Homeland Security. This act added key resources to the list of critical infrastructure and defined them as essential resources for the economy and government. The Department of Homeland Security identified 17 sectors as critical infrastructure and designated Sector-Specific Agencies for each sector. In 2008, Critical Manufacturing was added as the 18th sector on the critical infrastructure list. After the events of September 11, 2001, Congress redefined national security to include economic activities as a critical component. Policymakers now view foreign investments, especially those controlled by foreign governments, as potential risks to the economy. The Dubai Ports World case highlighted discrepancies between Congress's post-9/11 expectations regarding foreign investment and the role of economic infrastructure in national security. Some Members of Congress felt that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) was not aligned with these new security concerns. After September 11, 2001, Congress redefined national security to include economic activities. Some Members of Congress felt that CFIUS was out of touch with these new security concerns. In 2007, Congress strengthened its oversight of foreign direct investments through the Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007, enhancing reporting requirements and broadening the definition of national security. The Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007 expanded the definition of national security to include critical infrastructure and homeland security. It requires reviews by the Director of National Intelligence for investments posing a threat, and mandates CFIUS to investigate foreign investments owned or controlled by foreign governments. This change may signal a shift in U.S. policy towards foreign investment. The Foreign Investment and National Security Act of 2007 broadened the definition of national security to include critical infrastructure and homeland security. It shifted the burden onto firms owned or controlled by foreign governments to prove they are not a threat to national security. The number of investment transactions involving foreign governments is increasing, as some countries establish sovereign wealth funds to invest abroad, including in U.S. businesses. President Bush released a policy statement on open economies in response to the Dubai Ports World controversy and the passage of P.L. 110-49. The statement emphasized support for international direct investment for a stable and growing economy, while also recognizing the importance of national security in foreign investment. The United States supports an open investment regime, promoting international investment and fair treatment for U.S. investors abroad. Inbound and outbound investment stimulate growth, create jobs, and enhance competitiveness. The Administration aims to maintain the U.S. as an attractive investment destination and urges other nations to support open investment policies. The CFIUS process is part of the provisions that authorize the review of foreign direct investment transactions in the United States for their impact on the economy. These provisions operate independently and can overlap at times, illustrating the complexities in defining economic activities related to national security and economic security. The Strategic Materials Protection Board, established in 2006 by the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act, aims to restrict certain foreign investment transactions to protect strategic materials. This provision was influenced by a past merger involving the world's largest producer of Neo powder. The Strategic Materials Protection Board, established in 2006 by the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act, includes key officials like the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, and the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force. The Board meets biennially to make recommendations on critical materials for national security, with a focus on domestic supply and restrictions on foreign purchases.

The Board meets biennially to make recommendations on critical materials for national security, with a focus on domestic supply and restrictions on foreign purchases. The Board met on July 17, 2007, and published a report in September 2007, defining \"materials critical to national security\" as \"strategic materials critical to national security\" as specified in the statute. The report includes recommendations to ensure domestic availability of critical materials and strengthen the industrial base. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of specialty metals, including steel, metal alloys, titanium, and zirconium, as outlined in Section 842 of P.L. 109-364. It also touches on the growing importance of national security in foreign investment policies. The curr_chunk discusses how measures are designed to restrict foreign investors from acquiring domestic firms for national security reasons, often focusing on noneconomic objectives. These policies can expose political and philosophical differences among policymakers within and between countries, such as in the United States. Each nation has the authority to define its security concerns and adjust foreign investment policy accordingly, making it difficult to analyze the costs and benefits and potentially masking economic protectionism. The economic impact of restrictive investment policies is challenging to assess due to the lack of parameters defining national security implications. Evaluating foreign direct investment in mergers, acquisitions, or takeovers of U.S. firms is complicated, especially in peacetime when there is no immediate security threat. Government actions to restrict foreign investment are often precautionary measures against potential future actions by foreign investors. Measures to address potential future actions by foreign investors are complicated on a multi-lateral basis due to varying definitions of national security. Intervention in the economy for national security reasons can lead to a mix of industrial activities not achieved through market forces. This intervention may involve preventing foreign firms from acquiring certain U.S. firms or opposing acquisitions based on concerns over the country of origin. Intervention in the economy for national security reasons can involve preventing foreign acquisitions based on concerns over the country of origin. This can be justified by a combination of economic and noneconomic arguments, with economic costs and benefits tied directly to the specific circumstances. Economic production relies on land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurial ability. Growth is driven by capital and labor, with productivity setting limits on economic growth. In dynamic economies like the US, some sectors grow faster than others. In dynamic economies like the US, some sectors grow faster than others, absorbing capital and labor from declining sectors. This process may lead to a mismatch in skills between sectors, resulting in underutilized resources. In dynamic economies like the US, some sectors grow faster than others, absorbing capital and labor from declining sectors, leading to a mismatch in skills and underutilized resources. Economic theory states that market forces determine prices for labor and capital, allocating resources efficiently. Interference in this process, such as government subsidies for favored industries, can cause a misallocation of resources and inefficiency, imposing costs on the economy. The indirect cost of preventing resources from shifting into gaining sectors through market forces, particularly foreign capital, can lead to a misallocation of resources. Foreign investors acquiring U.S. firms bring additional technology and advantages that could be lost if prevented for national security reasons, contrary to market forces maximizing production efficiencies. Government policies restricting foreign acquisitions of U.S. firms may impact capital allocation in the economy, incurring short-term and long-term costs. Economists analyze production in the short run and long run, with labor being more easily shifted between sectors than capital. This can lead to a misallocation of resources and hinder market forces maximizing production efficiencies. In the short run, labor is considered a variable factor of production that can be easily shifted between sectors, while capital is seen as a fixed factor. However, in the long run, all factors are viewed as variable and can be reallocated in response to market forces. This distinction between short and long run implies that reallocating resources through public policy or restricting capital allocation through foreign investment can result in high short-term economic costs. During times of external threats like World War II, the economy may need to shift quickly from a consumer-oriented to an arms-producing economy, incurring high short-run costs but justifying them with added security benefits. The need for added security during external threats like World War II justified the economic costs of shifting resources to sectors prioritized for defense. Defining critical infrastructure and homeland security in peace-time is challenging, as is determining the role of foreign investment in national security. Evaluating the costs and benefits of protecting certain economic activities is complex when threats are not well-defined. In the current \"War on Terrorism,\" policymakers face challenges in determining the national security implications of foreign investment in U.S. firms. When deciding to protect certain economic activities for national security reasons, officials must weigh the costs and benefits to the nation. The benefits of blocking foreign capital from certain sectors include national security gains and capital inflow through foreign investment. Foreign investors can bring technological advantages and sustain jobs in the economy. Foreign investment can benefit the economy by sustaining jobs, producing goods and services, and addressing national security concerns. Policymakers need to weigh economic and noneconomic benefits to justify costs, avoiding economic protectionism disguised as national security. Benefits may accrue broadly in the economy or during national emergencies. The distinction between the dispersion of beneficiaries and the allocation of benefits within the economy is crucial in evaluating national investment policies. Citizens may be willing to absorb high costs for national security goals that benefit a small group, but alternative policies with lower economic costs should be considered. The national security component of production can be seen as a noneconomic good that satisfies a national objective related to public assessment of national security. This is based on a spectrum of benefits and threats, ranging from imminent destruction affecting the economy as a whole to activities tangentially related to national security. The benefits of policies based on national security grounds vary depending on the strength of the threats posed to the economy. The strength of arguments based on national security depends on the context. The costs to the economy from intervention are the same regardless of the threat. Public policy choices hinge on perceived benefits. In times of war, intervention in the economy is justified by the benefits that arise. Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, policymakers have increased scrutiny of foreign investment for national security. Estimating the economic costs and benefits of these policies is challenging, and it is unclear if they enhance national security or promote economic protectionism. Evaluating the impact of restrictive foreign investment policies on the economy is complex. The evaluation of policies to determine their impact on long-run economic performance and national security importance is complex. The debate over foreign investment in the economy, sparked by events like the proposed acquisition of P&O Ports by Dubai Ports World, involves defining national security implications of foreign direct investment. The national security implications of foreign direct investment are a topic of debate among Members of Congress and the Administration. The United States has been involved in discussions led by the OECD to develop best practices for national policies restricting foreign investment for security reasons. The participants agree that each nation should determine its own security interests, but policies should be transparent, predictable, and nondiscriminatory. The final OECD report is expected in May 2009. The curr_chunk discusses the challenges in assessing the impact of policies restricting foreign investment for national security reasons. It suggests using a framework based on marginal costs and benefits to evaluate such policies. The benefits include economic and noneconomic gains, while the costs involve real economic burdens. Restricting foreign direct investment for national security reasons involves assessing the economic costs and benefits. Policies should aim to achieve goals with lower costs to the economy, considering the dispersion of benefits. Nations may accept high costs to protect certain economic activities, but policies should not only benefit a small group at the expense of high economic costs. Restricting foreign direct investment for national security reasons should aim to achieve goals with lower costs to the economy, considering the dispersion of benefits. Policies should not only benefit a small group at the expense of high economic costs."
