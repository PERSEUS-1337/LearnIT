Bills have been introduced in the 113th Congress, but none have been enacted. Currently, 49 states have anti-bullying laws with varying content. This report provides definitions of bullying and cyber-bullying, research on prevalence and impact, and reviews on prevention strategies. The curr_chunk discusses research on bullying prevalence, impact, prevention strategies, and legal issues. It highlights the CDC's efforts to develop a consensus definition of bullying for consistent data collection. The lack of a uniform definition hinders our ability to understand the true magnitude, scope, and impact of bullying. Consistent terminology with standardized definitions is necessary to improve public health surveillance of bullying. Bullying also occurs at institutions of higher education and workplaces. Students may be exposed to bullying at school for many reasons. Certain individuals are more prone to bullying behavior. Certain individuals, such as those with low self-esteem, disabilities, or who are GLBT, are more vulnerable to bullying. Experts recommend school policies protect all students, not just specific groups. Research on student bullying has increased, but studies vary in definitions, age ranges, and time periods analyzed. Studies on student bullying show variations in age range, time periods analyzed, survey methodology, and prevalence rates. It is challenging to determine the exact relationship between bullying, victimization, and negative outcomes. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) examined nationally representative surveys on student bullying. Surveys on student bullying, including YRBSS, SCS/NCVS, HBSC, and NatSCEV, provided varying estimates of bullying prevalence. YRBSS reported 20.1%, HBSC reported 27%, and SCS/NCVS reported 27.8% prevalence of bullying among surveyed youth. The prevalence of electronic bullying varied across surveys, with estimates ranging from 1.8% to 16.2%. Different surveys reported on Internet harassment, bullying using computers or cell phones, and cyber-bullying. Results were inconsistent regarding whether bullying was more prevalent among specific demographics. Researchers studying student bullying believe that various factors like families, schools, peer groups, and cultural expectations influence bullying behavior. Creating a positive school environment with supportive adults, teachers, and peers can help reduce bullying. Bystanders play a crucial role in either reinforcing or curbing bullying behavior. Bullies, victims, and bully-victims share predictors such as family environment, school climate, and poor social problem-solving skills. Bullies exhibit externalizing behaviors, poor academic performance, and negative beliefs about others, while victims show internalizing behaviors and negative self-thoughts. Bully-victims, who switch between roles, are at the highest risk. Both bullies and victims lack social competence, with bullies generally more socially competent. Bully-victims are the most at risk group, displaying risk factors of both victims and bullies. Bullying can lead to psychological, physical, academic, and behavioral issues, with elevated rates of depression and suicide in both victims and bullies. The AFSP indicates that suicide is not caused by a single factor, but rather by a combination of factors such as mental disorders, adverse events, and personality traits. Research shows that bullying can lead to suicidal ideation and attempts in youth. Anti-bullying programs have shown some success in reducing bullying behavior and victimization in schools. Anti-bullying programs have been effective in reducing victimization by 17%-20%. The intensity, duration, and number of program elements were linked to effectiveness. Elements like parent training, firm disciplinary methods, and improved playground supervision were found to be important. Working with peers was not found to be effective. Accreditation for anti-bullying programs was recommended to ensure effectiveness. Addressing peer norms was also highlighted as crucial in anti-bullying efforts. Resources for effective anti-bullying programs in schools are more available now. There is a focus on school climate to prevent bullying and improve school indicators. The National School Climate Center provides resources on positive school climate practices, including addressing bullying. The ED published a document in 2008 to help schools evaluate anti-bullying policies. 49 states have anti-bullying laws, but the content varies. According to a report, 49 states have anti-bullying laws with varying requirements for schools. In 2010, the ED highlighted the increase in state legislation addressing bullying, with new bills reflecting the evolving landscape of bullying in schools, including cyber-bullying. The report evaluated the content and expansiveness of anti-bullying laws in 46 states, highlighting significant variations. Most states had definitions of prohibited behaviors and required school districts to adopt bullying policies. Many states had model bullying policies and included provisions for cyber-bullying. Thirteen states allowed schools to address bullying outside of school grounds if it affected the school environment. The report outlined 11 key components of a comprehensive state anti-bullying statute. The report evaluated anti-bullying laws in 46 states, categorizing them based on 11 key components. These components ranged from Purpose Statement to Statement of Rights, with more expansive laws being more inclusive and prescriptive. States varied in the number and detail of components included in their legislation. The report evaluated anti-bullying laws in 46 states, categorizing them based on 11 key components. It did not analyze the effectiveness of implementation in school districts and schools. A second phase will address implementation in a sample of districts and schools. Successful implementation of anti-bullying policies is crucial for benefiting schools and students. Legislation defining prohibited behaviors and sanctions may require extensive implementation procedures. Schools must balance various factors when developing bullying policies. Developing comprehensive and effective anti-bullying policies in schools can be challenging due to various factors such as meeting state, federal, and local regulations, addressing cyber-bullying, and balancing civil rights laws with free speech protections. As more schools adopt anti-bullying policies, issues like coverage variation and the impact of cyber-bullying on school environments are becoming more prevalent. Developing policies to address cyber-bullying can be challenging for schools due to evolving case law and legal uncertainties. Cyber-bullying experts recommend that schools ensure their policies cover disciplining students for cyber-bullying incidents that disrupt the learning environment, whether they occur on or off school grounds. The authors suggest that schools have the authority to intervene in bullying incidents, especially in cases involving serious threats, persistent cyber-bullying, or when the target feels unsafe. They recommend actions such as detention, suspension, or expulsion if necessary, with clear evidence linking the behavior to the school. In 2010, the U.S. Department of Education issued guidance on addressing such incidents. The Department of Education issued a Dear Colleague Letter providing guidance on schools' responsibilities regarding bullying, specifically addressing how some forms of bullying could amount to discriminatory harassment, potentially violating civil rights statutes. These laws protect against harassment based on race, color, national origin, sex, and disability, enforced by the Office for Civil Rights. Failure to address harassment falling under these categories means the school has not fulfilled its obligations to protect the student, as harassment creates a hostile environment that interferes with the student's ability to benefit from school services. The Department of Education's Dear Colleague Letter outlines schools' responsibilities in addressing discriminatory harassment based on race, color, national origin, sex, or disability. Schools must take prompt and effective steps to end harassment, eliminate hostile environments, and prevent recurrence, even if covered by an anti-bullying policy. Students with disabilities who are victims of bullying can file complaints under Section 504, Title II, and IDEA, in addition to state anti-bullying laws and civil rights legislation. The Department of Education requires schools to ensure a free appropriate public education for eligible students with disabilities to prevent denial of FAPE due to disability harassment. Disability harassment may lead to a denial of FAPE under IDEA, Section 504, or Title II. Parents can start due process procedures to address this issue. Schools must address bullying of students with disabilities, as it constitutes a denial of FAPE under IDEA. Changing the placement of a bullied student with a disability should be done carefully to maintain the least restrictive educational environment. Some groups have raised concerns about the guidance provided by the Department of Education in a Dear Colleague Letter from December 2010. The National School Boards Association expressed fear that the guidance would place a broad obligation on schools, potentially leading to unnecessary litigation and adversarial climates. The American Jewish Committee and the Religious Freedom Education Project/First Amendment Center issued proposed guidelines for school administrators to address bullying while protecting students' freedom of speech. Fifteen organizations endorsed these guidelines. The guidelines for schools emphasize balancing safety concerns with free expression. The Anti-Defamation League criticized the guidelines as ill-conceived and counterproductive in addressing bullying, noting that bullying situations often involve targeting individuals with less power for abuse. Several federal initiatives address student bullying, with a focus on causing harm rather than convincing of policy positions. Interagency efforts led by the U.S. Department of Education, Health and Human Services, and Justice Department aim to combat school bullying through various funding initiatives. The U.S. Department of Justice and other federal agencies collaborate on initiatives to address school bullying. A Federal Partners in Bullying Prevention Steering Committee coordinates efforts and provides resources through a website, stopbullying.gov. The U.S. Department of Education has sponsored anti-bullying summits. The U.S. Department of Education, along with other Federal Partners, has sponsored anti-bullying summits to address bullying in schools. The CDC is leading an effort to develop a consensus definition of bullying to improve data comparability and enhance prevention and response efforts. The Safe Schools/Healthy Students program, funded by ED and HHS's SAMHSA, allows grantees to include an anti-bullying component in their comprehensive plan of activities. The Safe Schools/Healthy Students program includes grants for local educational agencies to focus on healthy childhood development, violence prevention, and substance abuse prevention. Partnerships with law enforcement, mental health, and juvenile justice agencies are required. Federal agencies collaborated to create guides for emergency operations plans for schools, higher education institutions, and houses of worship. Currently, federal statutes do not explicitly prohibit student bullying or cyber-bullying, but some federal civil rights laws may apply to bullying in schools. Many states have laws that explicitly prohibit bullying, and it may also violate state criminal or tort law. Federal civil rights statutes like Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 can be used to combat bullying in schools based on race, color, or national origin. The federal civil rights laws prohibit discrimination in federally funded programs based on race, color, sex, disability, religion, or national origin. These laws include Title IX, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, Title IV of the CRA, and the Equal Educational Opportunities Act. These statutes aim to prevent segregation in public schools and address discriminatory conduct, including peer harassment. The federal civil rights laws prohibit discrimination in federally funded programs based on race, color, sex, disability, religion, or national origin, including peer harassment. Discriminatory conduct under these statutes includes peer harassment creating a hostile environment if encouraged, tolerated, or ignored by school employees. Bullying based on race, color, national origin, sex, or disability is prohibited by federal law, with guidance issued in 2010 clarifying schools' obligations to combat such behavior. This includes addressing bullying or harassment targeting LGBTQ+ students as a form of sex discrimination under Title IX. In the context of federal civil rights laws, discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity may be considered a form of sex discrimination violating Title IX. The Supreme Court has recognized that same-sex sexual harassment and gender stereotyping are forms of sex discrimination, extending protection to LGBTQ+ students who face harassment for not conforming to gender stereotypes. Title IX prohibits harassment based on failure to conform to gender stereotypes, but only when it constitutes sex discrimination. Discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity may violate Title IX. Harassment against religious groups may also be a form of national origin discrimination under Title VI. State laws offer protection to victims of bullying, with some states explicitly prohibiting bullying and all states having general criminal and tort laws that may provide remedies. Certain forms of bullying may violate laws against criminal assault and battery, with bullies facing penalties even in states without specific anti-bullying statutes. Victims of bullying can also seek remedies through tort law by suing on their own. Tort law remedies for bullying victims are available in all states, allowing them to sue for damages. These laws serve as a deterrent to prevent future injurious activities, with typical tort actions including intentional and negligent tort claims. Intentional tort claims involve assault and/or battery, while negligent tort claims may be against schools for failure to supervise or anticipate wrongful conduct. In order to succeed in claims against schools for bullying, plaintiffs must establish duty of supervision, breach of duty, foreseeability of injury, and actual injury. Anti-bullying policies in school districts may apply to cyber-bullying, with some states having legislation to prohibit it. School districts may adopt cyber-bullying policies, with laws varying depending on the case. Constitutional principles like the First and Fourteenth Amendments may limit the authority to enact anti-bullying laws. The due process clause and First Amendment limit state legislative action on free speech. Courts differentiate between protected and unprotected speech, such as true threats. Supreme Court cases like Watts v. United States set parameters for anti-bullying laws. The defendant in Watts v. United States was charged with threatening the President, but the Court ruled that his statement was protected political hyperbole and not a true threat. The Court emphasized the distinction between threats and constitutionally protected speech. Lower courts have developed varying tests to determine if speech constitutes a true threat, focusing on whether the speaker's words could reasonably be seen as threatening or if a reasonable recipient would feel threatened. This could impact the constitutionality of anti-bullying laws if the prohibited behavior does not meet the criteria of a true threat. In the school context, officials using anti-bullying policies to discipline students may face legal challenges based on the First Amendment. In Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, the Court ruled that student expression can be regulated if it disrupts school operations or interferes with others' rights. Students protested by wearing armbands against the Vietnam War, leading to suspensions for refusing to remove them. The Court ruled in Tinker v. Des Moines that wearing armbands as a form of expression is protected by the First Amendment in the school environment. In Bethel School District v. Fraser, the Court allowed school officials to discipline a student for delivering a lewd speech at a school assembly. The Court emphasized the school's duty to teach civility and appropriate behavior, protecting minors from indecent language. They concluded that the nomination speech disrupted the education process, giving school officials the authority to regulate speech in the classroom. The First Amendment does not protect offensive speech on school grounds, but there is ambiguity when speech occurs off school premises. In J.S. v. Bethlehem Area School District, a student created a website with derogatory remarks about a teacher, leading to legal questions about off-campus speech. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court reviewed a case involving a student who created a website ridiculing a math teacher, including a solicitation for a \"hit man.\" The court determined that the speech was not a true threat but acknowledged its offensive nature. The student argued that his website was protected speech, but the court focused on whether the school could discipline him for off-campus speech. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court reviewed a case involving a student who created a website ridiculing a math teacher, including references to Adolph Hitler. The court found the website to be offensive but not a true threat. It determined that there was a sufficient connection between the website and the school campus, allowing the school to discipline the student for off-campus speech. The court ruled that school officials could discipline a student for creating a vulgar and offensive website that caused a disruption at school. Court decisions in such cases vary, sometimes upholding disciplinary actions and other times protecting students' free speech rights. The Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause also poses constraints on legislation and school policies targeting bullying. The due process clause under the Fourteenth Amendment requires criminal statutes to be specific and clear to avoid being declared void for vagueness. A statute can be deemed unconstitutional if it fails to provide adequate warning of prohibited conduct or lacks standards to prevent arbitrary enforcement. For example, in Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville, a vagrancy ordinance punishing various behaviors was struck down as facially invalid. The Court found a statute invalid for failing to provide fair notice or require specific intent to commit an unlawful act, leading to arbitrary arrests and convictions. Due process principles may apply to the constitutionality of anti-bullying laws, as seen in Flaherty v. Keystone Oaks School District where a student was disciplined for online posts. The federal district court ruled that student handbook policies on discipline and technology were overreaching, violating students' free speech rights. The policies were deemed unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, not meeting the Tinker requirement for discipline only in cases causing substantial disruption to school operations. The court found student handbook policies on discipline and technology to be unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, lacking clear definitions and leading to arbitrary enforcement. Legislators and school administrators must consider constitutional constraints when drafting anti-bullying legislation and policies to ensure they do not infringe on protected speech. The court found student handbook policies on discipline and technology to be unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, lacking clear definitions and leading to arbitrary enforcement. Legislators and school administrators must consider constitutional constraints when drafting anti-bullying legislation and policies to ensure they do not infringe on protected speech. The policies should be narrow enough not to infringe upon protected speech and specific enough not to be found unconstitutionally vague."
