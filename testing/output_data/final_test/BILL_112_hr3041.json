    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Federal Consent Decree Fairness Act\" and includes findings. The \"Federal Consent Decree Fairness Act\" includes findings from the United States Supreme Court in Frew v. Hawkins, emphasizing the need to limit federal court oversight of state programs outlined in consent decrees and promptly return responsibility to state officials once objectives are met. The United States Supreme Court emphasizes the competence of state officials in discharging their governmental responsibilities and the importance of successor officials bringing new insights and solutions to problems. SEC. 3. LIMITATION ON CONSENT DECREES. Chapter 111 of title 28, United States Code, is amended to include a new section on consent decrees. A consent decree is defined as an order for relief against a State or local government entered by a U.S. court based on the parties' consent. It excludes private settlements and orders unrelated to official duties. States must implement a plan to end segregation based on race, color, or national origin in schools and higher education institutions. A State or local government official can file a motion to modify or terminate a consent decree after 4 years of its original entry by a U.S. court. The consent decree can be modified or terminated after a certain period, depending on the officials involved in the civil action. The consent decree can be modified or terminated after a certain period, depending on the appointed State or local official, the expiration date of the elected official's term, or the highest elected official in the government. The burden of proof lies with the party who filed the civil action to show that denying the motion is necessary to prevent a violation of Federal law. The court will rule promptly on a motion filed under this subsection, with a scheduling order to be issued within 30 days. If a party fails to prove that a violation is actionable and addressed in the consent decree, the court will terminate the decree. If the burden of proof is met, the court will ensure that any remaining provisions are the least restrictive means to prevent the violation. The court will issue a scheduling order within 30 days of a motion being filed under this subsection, setting limits on motions, discovery, and hearing dates. The court may also stay injunctive relief in a consent decree if a party opposing the motion seeks a continuance. The consent decree can be terminated if a delay prevents the court from ruling within 180 days. Federal courts can still issue new orders for relief, and parties can seek remedies under State law. SEC. 4. GENERAL PRINCIPLES. The amendments do not affect other laws on modifying or vacating consent decrees. No further judicial proceedings are required for prior adjudications.\n\nSEC. 5. DEFINITION. The term \"consent decree\" is defined in section 1660(a) of title 28, United States Code.\n\nSEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE. SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act and its amendments will be effective upon enactment, applying to all consent decrees regardless of entry date or relief obtained before enactment."
