    "content": "MEDICARE TREATMENT FOR CERTAIN CANCER HOSPITALS. The amendment to Section 1886(d)(1)(B) of the Social Security Act includes criteria for a hospital to qualify, based on cancer incidence and death rates in specific states. As of December 31, 2005, a hospital in a densely populated state served as a comprehensive center designated by the National Cancer Institute, providing significant support for patient care, research, and training activities. The hospital, designated by the National Cancer Institute, conducted over 130 clinical trials and received $80,000,000 in research grants in 2003. It has dedicated patient care units with 125 beds primarily for cancer treatment and research, including a radiation oncology department and specialized emergency services for oncology patients. The hospital, recognized by the National Cancer Institute, is the focus of inpatient activities and holds the NCI comprehensive cancer designation. It has also received approval from the American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer. Payment classification amendments have been made to the Social Security Act. The Social Security Act now applies to cost reporting periods starting from January 1, 2005. Hospitals meeting specific criteria can resubmit their 2005 Medicare cost report with a cancer hospital sub-provider number and use the Medicare ratio-of-cost-to-charge settlement method for outpatient cancer services. The PPS cancer exemption is applicable for the first cost reporting period after January 1, 2005. The allowable operating costs of inpatient hospital services for reporting periods starting on or after January 1, 2005 must be used for the first cost reporting period. Payments owed to hospitals must be made within 1 year of the enactment of the Act. Hospitals meeting criteria can maintain their PPS cancer-exempt status as long as the center remains a comprehensive cancer center."
