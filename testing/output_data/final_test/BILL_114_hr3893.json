Qualified Areawide Integrated Pest Management Projects are outlined in the Act. The Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act of 1998 is amended to include qualified areawide integrated pest management projects under subsections (a) and (b). The Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act of 1998 is amended to include qualified areawide integrated pest management projects under subsections (a) and (b). Grants providing funding for these projects require submission of an application to the Secretary with specified information. The Secretary may require detailed information on the goals, individuals involved, projected benefits, committee membership, project sustainability, and return on investment for grant-funded projects. Requests for applications are developed in consultation with the integrated pest management committee. The integrated pest management committee, along with relevant stakeholders, develop requests for applications for qualified areawide integrated pest management projects. The Secretary solicits proposals annually and may not select new projects if there is insufficient funding available. The Secretary selects qualified areawide integrated pest management projects through a peer-review process. The lead entity for the project is designated as the college or university submitting the application. Grants are provided as a condition for funding qualified projects. The funding for a qualified areawide integrated pest management project requires collaboration with the Agricultural Research Service and other entities such as colleges, universities, state departments of agriculture, or other federal agencies. The recipient of funding for an integrated pest management project must collaborate with various entities, including federal agencies, state departments of natural resources, and nongovernmental organizations. They must ensure funds are transferred appropriately, coordinate efforts with the Secretary, and submit regular reports. The recipient of funding for an integrated pest management project must collaborate with various entities to prevent the spread of pests and invasive species on a landscape scale. The project includes educational programs on best practices, pest control methods, and management strategies. Annual and final reports must be submitted to the Secretary. The qualified areawide integrated pest management project aims to manage pests and invasive species using biologically-based or chemical controls. It provides significant benefits for pest prevention, eradication, and management, as well as economic and environmental benefits to agriculture, individuals, wildlife, and the environment. The project addresses annual priorities established by the integrated pest management committee. The qualified areawide integrated pest management project under section 1408C has a projected duration of not more than 5 years. It establishes a regional advisory committee for oversight and involves cooperative extension services to translate research results into practical information for farmers, foresters, and producers. The Areawide Integrated Pest Management Act of 2015 exempts certain grants related to integrated agricultural research from specific requirements. Additionally, a new section is added to the National Agricultural Research, Extension, and Teaching Policy Act of 1977 regarding the Areawide Integrated Pest Management Committee.

The committee will consider stakeholder feedback and set priorities for these programs. Non-Advisory Board members can be appointed to the committee, which will have a specific composition. The committee overseeing pest management programs will consist of three ex officio members and nine voting members representing stakeholder groups with experience in areawide research programs. Members of the Advisory Board appointed by the Secretary may serve without compensation, except for those on the integrated pest management committee who may receive compensation. They are also allowed travel expenses while away from their homes for committee services. Members of the Advisory Board appointed by the Secretary may serve without compensation but can receive travel expenses, including per diem, for services under this title.
