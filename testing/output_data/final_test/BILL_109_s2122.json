    "content": "The \"Date Certain Tax Code Replacement Act\" sets a specific date for replacing the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 with a simpler and fairer alternative. The \"Date Certain Tax Code Replacement Act\" terminates the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 after December 31, 2008, except for specific taxes. It also establishes a National Commission on Tax Reform and Simplification. The Congress finds that the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is overly complex, burdensome, and in need of reform and simplification to alleviate problems faced by taxpayers and the IRS. Previous reform efforts have failed due to lack of broad support. The establishment of a National Commission on Tax Reform and Simplification is proposed. The National Commission on Tax Reform and Simplification is established within the legislative branch with 15 members, including representation from small businesses. Members are appointed by the President, Senate majority leader, and Senate minority leader. The National Commission on Tax Reform and Simplification has 15 members appointed by various leaders. The Commission elects a Chair from its members and requires nine members for a quorum. The Commission requires a quorum of members to conduct meetings, and vacancies are filled in the same manner as the original appointment. Meetings can be held in executive session if deemed appropriate by the Chair or majority of members. If a member appointed by a specific position no longer holds that position, or if a member appointed as a Member of Congress ceases to be one, their membership may continue until the Commission's report is submitted. The Commission members can continue serving for up to 30 days after leaving their position or becoming a government officer/employee. It is recommended that members be appointed within 60 days of the Act's enactment. The Commission, once eight or more members are appointed after 60 days, can select a Chair to begin operations, including hiring staff. The Commission's functions include conducting a review for up to 18 months and submitting a report to Congress with reform recommendations for the Internal Revenue Service. The Commission will conduct a review of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, focusing on its impact on the economy, families, compliance costs, and the IRS's ability. The Commission will review the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, considering the efficiency of tax systems in other countries, potential replacement options like a flat tax or national sales tax, simplification of the current tax system, and transition costs associated with any changes. The Commission has the power to hold hearings, take testimony, receive evidence, administer oaths, and enter into contracts to carry out its duties under this section. The Commission can obtain information from federal agencies and offices to fulfill its duties. The Commission can request information, estimates, and statistics from federal agencies. The Treasury Department, General Services Administration, and Joint Committee on Taxation can provide administrative support and services to the Commission as needed. The Joint Committee on Taxation can provide legal, economic, and policy analysis to the Commission. Other departments and agencies can also offer services, funds, and support as needed. The Commission is allowed to use postal services and accept gifts. The Commission can accept gifts, donations, and appoint staff without following certain regulations. The Commission can procure expert services and consultants at rates not exceeding those of level IV of the Executive Schedule. Federal Government employees can be detailed to the Commission without reimbursement and retain their employment rights. Compensation and travel expenses are regulated, with daily rates not exceeding those of level V of the Executive Schedule. Members of the Commission may be compensated at a daily rate not exceeding level IV of the Executive Schedule, except for government officials or Members of Congress who receive no additional pay. Travel expenses are also regulated, with daily rates not exceeding level V of the Executive Schedule. Members of the Commission are allowed travel expenses, including per diem, similar to government employees. The Commission must submit a report to Congress within 18 months, detailing its review and recommendations for reform. The Commission is tasked with recommending fundamental reform and simplification of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, describing the expected economic impact using static and dynamic scoring models. The Commission and its authorities will terminate 90 days after submitting the required report, using this period for concluding activities such as testifying before Congress and disseminating the report. Authorization of Appropriations: Such sums as necessary are authorized for the Commission's activities. $2,000,000 from fiscal year 2006 funds appropriated to the Treasury Department will be available until expended. The Congress declares that any new Federal tax system must be approved in its final form by July 4, 2008. Failure to do so will require a vote to reauthorize the Internal Revenue Code of 1986."
