    "content": "The \"Sports Relocation Reform Act of 1996\" may be cited as the Act. It addresses the relocation of certain sports teams. The \"Sports Relocation Reform Act of 1996\" defines terms such as 'home territory' and 'interested party' for member teams, including political subdivisions providing financial assistance for team facilities. The \"Sports Relocation Reform Act of 1996\" defines terms such as 'member team' as a professional sports team organized to play football, basketball, or hockey, and 'professional sports league' as an association regulating contests and exhibitions of member teams. The Act also includes definitions for 'person' as any individual, partnership, corporation, or association, and 'affected party' as determined by the sports league. The \"Sports Relocation Reform Act of 1996\" allows professional sports leagues to establish rules for team relocations, requiring approval from the league for any changes in home territory. The Act defines terms like 'member team' as a professional sports team and 'stadium' as the main facility for home games. The \"Sports Relocation Reform Act of 1996\" allows professional sports leagues to establish rules for team relocations, requiring approval from the league for any changes in home territory. Requests for approval must be submitted in writing to the appropriate professional sports league at least 210 days before the season starts. The antitrust laws do not apply to the enforcement of these rules. Requests for approval of team relocations must be in writing, delivered to interested parties within 30 days, made available to the news media, published in newspapers, and include the proposed location and reasons for the move. Professional sports leagues must establish rules and procedures for approving or disapproving requests for team relocations. These rules should include criteria to be considered and the effective date of the proposed change. Criteria for team relocations should include fan loyalty, support, attendance, negotiations for playing terms. The criteria for team relocations should consider ownership contributions, public financial support, and special benefits received by the member team. The criteria for team relocations include the adequacy of the stadium, financial viability of the team, location of other teams in the same league, and proposals by the member team. The professional sports league considers various criteria for team relocations, including the team's proposal, opposition from the stadium authority, impact on contracts, and any other relevant factors. In deciding on relocation requests, the league holds hearings to approve or disapprove them. The professional sports league conducts hearings for team relocation requests, allowing interested parties to submit testimony and exhibits. A written record is kept of the hearing. Judicial review of the league's decision can only be done through a civil action filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. An action under this subsection for team relocation must be filed within 14 days of the league's vote, with judicial review possible in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York if the team's home territory is within a 50-mile radius of the District of Columbia. The district court will issue an order regarding the action filed within 14 days of the league's vote on team relocation. Judicial review is limited to determining if the professional sports league complied with the section and if their decision was arbitrary or capricious. If the court finds a violation, relief may be granted. The court may remand the matter for further consideration by the professional sports league and enjoin any relocation of the member team until the league has reconsidered the matter. The court is limited to granting relief by enjoining or approving enforcement of the league's decision on team relocation requests. Multiple lawsuits by others are prohibited. An interested party can intervene in a civil action but cannot file an additional lawsuit after the initial one has been filed. Multiple lawsuits by others are prohibited."
