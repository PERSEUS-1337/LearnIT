Section 2681 of title 28, United States Code, addresses human experimentation without informed consent, while section 2682 excludes claims related to nuclear weapons facility operations. The production of nuclear weapons falls under the authority of the Secretary of Energy or any predecessor with such authority. The table of contents for chapter 171 is amended to include sections on human experimentation and nuclear weapons facility operations. District courts are granted exclusive jurisdiction over civil actions for money damages based on constitutional torts. A new chapter 172 is added to Title 28, focusing on constitutional torts procedures. The definitions in this chapter and related sections clarify the terms 'Federal agency' and 'employee of the Government' to encompass various entities and individuals acting on behalf of the United States. The term 'constitutional tort' refers to a violation of the Constitution or human rights by a Federal agency or employee of the Government. The head of each Federal agency can compromise and settle claims according to regulations set by the Attorney General. The Attorney General can settle claims for constitutional torts for up to $25,000 without approval, with finality unless fraud is involved. Payments are made similar to judgments, using available funds. Claimants accepting settlements must adhere to the terms. The United States is liable for compensatory damages for constitutional torts, with a limit of $25,000 or nominal damages of $25,000 or $500 per violation. Acceptance of any award or settlement under this section is final and releases any claim against the United States or the government employee involved. The United States may be liable for compensatory damages for constitutional torts, with a limit of $25,000 or $500 per violation. Exemplary damages may be awarded for willful or reckless conduct.

Prior presentation of the claim to the appropriate Federal agency is required before filing a claim for money damages based on a constitutional tort. An action under this section can be filed for compensatory damages for constitutional torts, with a limit of $25,000 or $500 per violation. The claim must be presented to the Federal agency before filing for money damages. If the agency fails to make a final decision within 6 months, it is considered a denial. The amount of the claim presented to the agency sets the limit for damages sought, unless new evidence is discovered. The section discusses the process for presenting a claim for money damages based on a constitutional tort, including the requirement to present the claim to the Federal agency and the possibility of new evidence affecting the amount of the claim. It also addresses the option for a jury trial, the effect of a judgment as a bar to future claims for the same constitutional violation, and the Attorney General's authority to compromise or settle claims after legal action has commenced. The section discusses attorney fees and penalties for claimants awarded judgments under specific sections, allowing for reasonable attorney fees and litigation costs. The attorney's fee cannot exceed a certain percentage of the judgment or settlement, with exceptions approved by the court. Section 2692 imposes fines or imprisonment on attorneys who overcharge for services related to judgments. Section 2699 states that federal agencies cannot be sued for constitutional tort claims under certain circumstances, with exclusive remedies provided.

It also specifies that this provision does not apply to civil actions against employees for actions outside their official duties or for violations of statutes. This chapter is limited to constitutional tort claims against federal agencies or employees. The chapter specifies that constitutional tort claims against Federal agencies or employees are exclusive of other civil actions. The Attorney General will defend civil actions against government employees for money damages based on constitutional torts. Upon certification by the Attorney General, civil actions against government employees for constitutional torts in a United States district court will be deemed as actions against the United States, with the United States substituted as the party defendant. Upon certification by the Attorney General, civil actions in State courts against government employees will be removed to a US district court, with the United States substituted as the party defendant. The Attorney General's certification establishes the scope of office or employment for removal purposes. The employee can petition the court to certify that they were acting within the scope of their office or employment before trial. Upon court certification, the action will be treated as brought against the United States, with the United States substituted as the defendant. The petition must be served on the United States, and if filed in a State court, the action may be removed to a US district court by the Attorney General. Upon certification, any action subject to paragraphs (1), (2), or (3) shall proceed as if brought against the United States, with the United States as the defendant. If a claim was not presented timely, it will be deemed presented under section 2401(b)(2) if the action is dismissed. Upon dismissal of a civil action, a claim can be deemed timely under section 2401(b)(2) if it would have been timely when the action commenced and is presented to the Federal agency within 60 days. The Attorney General has the authority to settle claims in civil actions as per section 2697. In cases of judgments or settlements against the United States in constitutional tort actions, the Attorney General must refer the matter to the relevant Federal agency. The employee may be subject to further administrative investigation or disciplinary action by the agency where the alleged act occurred. The employee can defend themselves by claiming a reasonable good-faith belief in the lawfulness of their conduct. SEC. 203. STATUTE OF LIMITATION, TECHNICAL AND CONFORMING AMENDMENTS.
