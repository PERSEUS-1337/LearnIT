    "content": "SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS. The Act is named the \"Christopher Bryski Student Loan Protection Act\" or \"Christopher's Law.\" Congress finds that private educational lenders' promissory notes lack clear descriptions of borrower and cosigner responsibilities in case of disability or death. Additionally, statistics show a high incidence of traumatic brain and spinal cord injuries. In the United States, there are approximately 40 cases of traumatic brain and spinal cord injuries per 1,000,000 people each year, leading to permanent disability or loss of movement. In 2007-2008, 13% of students at public institutions and 26.2% at private institutions borrowed from private lenders. By 2009, the percentage of cosigned private education loans increased from 66% to 84%. SEC. 2. ADDITIONAL STUDENT LOAN PROTECTIONS. The Truth in Lending Act is amended to include additional protections for cosigners of private education loans, requiring lenders to clearly describe cosigners' obligations in case of death, disability, or inability to work. The Truth in Lending Act is amended to include protections for cosigners of private education loans, with lenders required to provide a model form describing a cosigner's obligations in case of death, disability, or inability to work. The Truth in Lending Act is amended to include protections for cosigners of private education loans, defining a cosigner as an individual liable for another's obligation without compensation. The Truth in Lending Act now protects cosigners of private education loans, excluding spouses whose signature is required for the loan's security interest. SEC. 3. FEDERAL STUDENT LOANS. Section 485(l)(2) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to include information on loan discharge due to death, disability, or inability to work, especially for private education loans where the borrower, estate, and cosigner may still be obligated to repay the full amount. The borrower's disability or any condition described in section 437(a) may lead to loan discharge."
