    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 1997\". Congress finds that too many law enforcement officers die from gunshot wounds, with a significant number being killed by firearms. The introduction of modern bulletproof materials has helped decrease the number of officers killed, with studies showing that bullet-resistant materials have saved the lives of over 2,000 officers between 1985 and 1994. The purpose of this Act is to save lives of law enforcement officers by providing them with armor vests. SEC. 3. PROGRAM AUTHORIZED. The Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance is authorized to grant funds to States or local governments for purchasing armor vests for law enforcement officers. Grants are to be used for buying one vest per police officer, with preference given to jurisdictions with the highest need based on officer access, mandatory wear policies, and high violent crime rates. The Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance authorizes grants for purchasing armor vests for law enforcement officers. States or local governments with high violent crime rates may receive funding. Qualifying entities must receive a minimum of 0.25% and a maximum of 5% of the total grant amount allocated each fiscal year. Matching funds for a program cannot exceed 50% unless approved by the Director. The Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance can waive the non-Federal contribution requirement for programs in cases of fiscal hardship. At least half of the funds awarded must go to local governments with fewer than 100,000 residents. SEC. 4. APPLICATIONS. To apply for a grant under this Act, the chief executive of a State or unit of local government must submit an application to the Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance, signed by the appropriate official, containing required information. Grants can be renewed every 3 years, and regulations must be established within 90 days of the Act's enactment. The Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance will establish regulations for grant applications under this Act, including required information and submission requirements for States and local governments. SEC. 5 prohibits the purchase of equipment or products made using prison inmate labor for entities receiving financial assistance from this Act. SEC. 6 provides definitions. The term \"armor vest\" under this Act refers to body armor that complies with NIJ Standard 0101.03 or exceeds its specifications with permission from the officer's department. The term \"State\" includes all 50 states and various territories. The term \"qualifying State or unit of local government\" refers to any State or unit of local government that has submitted a grant application meeting specified requirements. Authorization for appropriations of $25,000,000 annually is granted for the program. The Congress recommends that entities use these funds to purchase American-made equipment and products."
