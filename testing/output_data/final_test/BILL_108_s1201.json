    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"YMCA Healthy Teen Act\". The findings by Congress highlight the importance of promoting good physical health in adolescence, as behaviors during this time often carry over into adulthood. Many American teenagers exhibit behaviors that compromise their present and future health, such as lack of physical activity and unhealthy diets. These factors contribute to obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and other health issues. Additionally, other risk factors for teens include tobacco, drug and alcohol use, mental health problems, and dangerous behaviors. It is evident that the health of youth is at risk. The YMCA movement is uniquely positioned to address public health issues, especially among adolescents. Research shows that YMCA programs positively impact adolescent behavior by preventing problem behaviors and promoting positive attitudes. The Teen Action Agenda aims to expand teen programs nationwide. YMCAs across the US offer safe, educational, and recreational activities for teens of all backgrounds. The YMCA serves people of all faiths, races, abilities, ages, and incomes. They partner with juvenile courts, public housing developments, elementary schools, and high schools to reach at-risk teens. The Act defines terms like \"local YMCA\" as one of the 2,400 YMCAs in the US, \"teen\" as individuals aged 11-19, and \"Secretary\" as the Secretary of Health and Human Services. It also mentions \"YMCA of the USA\" as the national organization. Grants are provided to promote healthy living among teens. SEC. 4.
