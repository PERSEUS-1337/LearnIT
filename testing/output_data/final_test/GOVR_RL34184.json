    "content": "A brownfield is a commercial or industrial site that is abandoned or underutilized due to hazardous substances, with estimated 500,000 to 1 million sites in the US. The EPA suggests that 70% of these sites may require cleanup, with lower risks and costs compared to Superfund sites. Total expenditures for cleanup are also estimated by the EPA. Total expenditures for cleanup at state sites, excluding those on the Superfund National Priorities List, have been estimated at about $1 billion annually. Cleanup has been completed at approximately 5,000 state and private party sites per year, with a projected cost of $30 billion over the next 30 years. Congress has enacted various programs and incentives to address this issue, including the brownfields program, \"brightfields\" demonstration program, tax-exempt facility bonds, and brownfield tax incentives. The federal section 198 brownfields tax incentive, which expires on December 31, 2007, allows taxpayers to fully deduct environmental cleanup costs in the year they were incurred. Its purpose is to encourage developers to rehabilitate contaminated sites for productive use. Developers must obtain a statement from the state environmental agency to qualify for the incentive. The brownfields tax incentive requires developers to obtain a statement from the state environmental agency confirming the site as \"qualified contaminated.\" The incentive is subject to \"recapture,\" meaning any gain upon resale must be taxed as ordinary income. The value of the tax break depends on project costs, cleanup expenses, holding period, and individual tax situation. Repealing the recapture provision is supported by the Real Estate Roundtable. The Real Estate Roundtable and its partner associations support repealing the recapture provision in federal tax law, which requires deductions for property improvements to be spread over years. Deductions for cleaning up contaminated land are currently only allowed in the year the contamination occurred, but only for the polluter and without plans for new use. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 expanded benefits by allowing developers to deduct cleanup costs from their taxable income in the current year, rather than having to capitalize them. This helped in the redevelopment of contaminated land, including brownfield sites, by removing a major barrier to cleanup and reuse. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 allowed developers to deduct cleanup costs from their taxable income, aiding in the redevelopment of contaminated land, including brownfield sites. The law initially restricted the tax break to targeted areas but was later extended to all brownfields in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2001. The tax incentive has been in effect since 1997 and has been extended multiple times, most recently in the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006. EPA supports the extension of this tax incentive. The Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 made the brownfields tax incentive retroactive to December 31, 2005, broadening the definition of hazardous substances to include petroleum products. The IRS introduced Schedule M-3 in 2004 to track the use of the tax incentive by large and midsize businesses. Large and midsize businesses are required to file Schedule M-3 with their returns, which was introduced in 2004 to track the use of the brownfields tax incentive. In the first year of use, only some corporations were required to file it, with 110 corporations reporting section 198 remediation costs of $294,970,000. The response for 2004 was limited, excluding more than half of the corporations and all partnerships. The brownfields tax incentive was discretionary for corporations with assets over $10 million. Data on cleanup costs for 110 corporations were collected, but not specified for each brownfield. Schedule M-3 was required for partnerships with assets over $10 million starting in 2006. Results will be available in February 2009. The form will not apply to entities with assets under $10 million. CRS surveyed environmental agencies in 2003 and 2007 to track brownfield certifications. 27 states reported certifications since the provision enactment. In 2003, 27 states reported receiving 161 certification requests, with 147 approved and 14 denied. By 2007, 29 states received 175 requests, with 170 granted. Some states had no requests, while others saw an increase in approvals. The tax break for brownfield cleanups saw a significant increase in usage, but fell short of initial expectations. The budget impact was estimated to cost the Treasury $417 million over 5 years, with Congress considering making the incentive permanent. Treasury projected it would be used to clean up 18,000 brownfields over the next 10 years, resulting in a revenue loss of $600 million. The tax break for brownfield cleanups fell short of revenue expectations, with an estimated loss of $114 million over 5 years. CRS sought opinions from state agency representatives and private developers on why few developers were utilizing the incentive. Developers specializing in brownfields are limited, with projects typically ranging from one to a thousand acres. Projects typically range from one to a thousand acres, with 25 to 50 acres being common. Brownfield developments take longer to complete due to unpredictable environmental cleanup. Some developers find the federal incentive for brownfield cleanups not financially beneficial, especially with the recapture provision. State tax breaks and incentives may be more attractive. It is important to have the right circumstances to successfully utilize the incentive, and other tax strategies may be more advantageous depending on the project and investors' tax status. The federal incentive for brownfield cleanups may not always be financially beneficial due to the recapture provision. Uncertainty surrounding the extension of the provision creates planning challenges for developers, leading to potential forfeiture of benefits and decision-making difficulties. Lack of information about the incentive's availability adds to the uncertainty, making some hesitant to recommend it. Some critics blame the lack of information and EPA leadership for the low use of the brownfields tax incentive. States also admit their shortcomings in promoting it. Developers suggest better publicity and outreach programs to increase awareness. Many developers, especially smaller ones, may be unaware of the incentive's existence and eligibility criteria. The brownfields tax incentive allows developers to claim environmental cleanup costs on their tax returns. Some states suggest developers may use milestone letters for other purposes, and LLCs are sometimes created for brownfield projects. A bill in the 110th Congress, H.R. 1753, addresses section 198. H.R. 1753 in the 110th Congress makes the brownfields tax incentive permanent and repeals the recapture provision. The bill was introduced by Representatives Jerry Weller and Xavier Becerra on March 29, 2007, and referred to the Ways and Means Committee. The new IRS form, Schedule M-3, indicates that the brownfields tax incentive is being utilized by large and midsize businesses more than previously thought. The number of corporations taking advantage of this incentive is expected to increase as more corporations and partnerships file the M-3 form. Additionally, smaller businesses with assets under $10 million are likely to benefit from section 198 as well. The IRS form revealed that 110 corporations reported deductions for cleanup costs of $295 million in 2004, averaging $2.68 million per company. The provision aims to incentivize bringing contaminated lands back into productive use, with $295 million reported as a deduction item on Schedule M-3 for tax purposes by the private sector. This figure is from voluntary reporting by only a portion of the taxpayer universe. The tax incentive for brownfield cleanup has led to an increase in reporting by corporations and partnerships. It is difficult to measure the direct impact of the incentive on brownfield cleanups, but developers find it useful in certain situations. Supporters believe it has helped in cleaning up many brownfield sites in the US, including those owned by smaller firms. The brownfields tax incentive has led to more reporting by corporations and partnerships, with assets under $10 million. Some individuals may not be aware of the tax incentive and treat cleanup costs as normal expenses. The incentive is one of many tax benefits considered together, with some states reporting no applications for certification. For more details, refer to CRS Report RL32367. In 2003, seven states had 10 or more applications for certification, with Wisconsin leading at 20 applications. By 2007, six states had at least 10 applications, with Wisconsin again at the top with 19 applications. Some states reported no applications for certification despite efforts to publicize the incentive. Wisconsin had 19 applications for certification, Massachusetts had 16, Rhode Island had 15, Maryland and Texas had 12 each, and Pennsylvania had 10. Corporate and partnership taxpayers must file financial statements along with their income tax returns to show profitability and financial condition. Schedule M-1 reconciles differences between financial accounting and tax return purposes for over forty years. Schedule M-1, used to reconcile financial accounting and tax return purposes for over forty years, has become less useful as business environments evolved. To address this, Schedule M-3 was developed for large and midsize businesses, collecting more data points to help the IRS identify questionable tax practices and increase efficiency. The new Schedule M-3, designed for large and midsize businesses, aims to reduce tax burden, increase efficiency, and provide transparency for IRS investigations. It distinguishes between temporary and permanent differences in income recognition, offering valuable data for research and trend analysis. The Schedule M-3 distinguishes between temporary and permanent differences in income recognition, with permanent differences having a greater impact on reported earnings and audit risk compared to temporary differences. The Schedule M-3 was phased in for tax year 2004 for firms with total assets over $10 million filing Form 1120. It was optional for firms with assets under $10 million. Some firms did report an M-3. Certain return types were not required to use M-3. For those using M-3 in 2004, certain parts were optional, but the whole form was required in 2005 if assets exceeded $10 million. Different Form 1120 return types had phase-in years for M-3 implementation. For tax year 2004, there were 5,557,965 corporate taxpayers, with 35,929 filing Schedule M-3. Partnerships started using Schedule M-3 in 2006, with 2,546,877 partnership filers in 2004. Schedule M-1 is still used by corporations with assets under $10 million and does not include information on the section 198 brownfields tax incentive."
