    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Early Education Act of 2007\". Congress finds that all children should have access to high quality early education as it is crucial for brain development and academic achievement. Research shows that early education programs improve reading and math skills compared to children who do not participate. Quality early education programs have been shown to improve academic performance in reading and math, reduce the need for special education services, enhance learning retention, creativity, and social skills, and increase enthusiasm for school. Studies indicate that investing in early education can result in significant cost savings later on. Title X of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is amended to include an Early Education Program.
