    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Major Drug Trafficking Prosecution Act of 2009\". Congress finds that mandatory minimum sentencing for drug offenses has led to a significant increase in the Federal Bureau of Prisons budget, disproportionately impacts African Americans, and relies on substance weight as a determinant for sentencing. The United States Sentencing Commission found that mandatory penalty statutes disproportionately affect African American defendants, leading to a 20% higher likelihood of prison sentences compared to white defendants. Congress structured antidrug penalties in the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 to target high-level drug traffickers with long mandatory minimum sentences. Between 1994 and 2003, African Americans saw a 62% increase in the average time served for drug offenses, compared to a 17% increase among white defendants. This disparity is largely due to harsh penalties for crack cocaine. African Americans now serve nearly as much time for a drug offense as whites do for a violent offense. The link between drug quantity and punishment severity has disproportionately affected women, who are often involved in peripheral roles in drug enterprises. In 2003, states sentenced over 340,000 drug offenders to felony convictions, compared to 25,000 federal convictions. Federal drug enforcement resources are not properly focused, with only a small percentage of prosecutions targeting high-level traffickers. According to the Report to Congress, federal cocaine offenders mostly perform low-level functions. The Departments of Justice, Treasury, and Homeland Security have the capacity to target high-level drug trafficking organizations, but investigations and prosecutions of low-level offenders divert resources. Congress needs current information on high-level and low-level drug offender prosecutions to reauthorize Federal drug enforcement programs. The improper focus of Federal cocaine prosecutions has led to the majority of resources being directed towards low-level offenders. The majority of low-level federal crack cocaine offenders are black, leading to perceived racial disparities in sentencing. African Americans make up a disproportionate percentage of drug convictions despite being a minority in the population. Drug offenders sentenced before mandatory sentences served an average of 22 months in prison, while those sentenced after served 62 months. Time in prison does not impact recidivism rates. Drug use is consistent across racial groups, but blacks and Hispanics are disproportionately targeted in Federal narcotics cases. SEC. 3.
