The \"Equal Justice for Immigrants Act\" allows for the adjustment of status for eligible aliens to lawful permanent residents, with certain conditions and exceptions. The \"Equal Justice for Immigrants Act\" allows eligible aliens with certain orders to apply for adjustment of status under certain conditions, without needing to file a separate motion. If the application is denied, the original order remains enforceable. Eligible aliens present in the US by specified dates can apply for benefits under the settlement agreement in American Baptist Churches v. Thornburgh, or for asylum by certain deadlines. Eligible Haitian nationals in the US before specific dates can apply for benefits under the settlement agreement in American Baptist Churches v. Thornburgh, or for asylum if they meet certain criteria. The Attorney General allows aliens facing deportation to seek a stay of removal by filing an application. During certain proceedings, a final order of removal will not be issued if the alien raises eligibility for adjustment of status as a defense, unless the application has been denied. The Attorney General may also authorize work authorization. The Attorney General may authorize an alien to work in the US while their adjustment of status application is pending, and if the application exceeds 180 days without a denial, employment authorization must be granted.

The alien must be a national of El Salvador, Guatemala, or Haiti, be the spouse, child, or unmarried son or daughter of an alien with adjusted status, physically present in the US when applying for adjustment, and meet admissibility requirements excluding certain grounds for inadmissibility. The Attorney General will offer administrative review for status adjustment applicants. Applicants for adjustment of status under this section have the right to administrative review, similar to applicants under section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act or aliens in removal proceedings under section 240. The Attorney General's determination on status adjustment is subject to judicial review. The Secretary of State is not required to reduce the number of immigrant visas available when an alien is granted permanent residence under this section. The Immigration and Nationality Act provisions apply to the administration of status adjustment under this section. The Attorney General's authority in immigration enforcement is not affected by this section, and aliens can seek permanent residence status under other eligible provisions of the law.
