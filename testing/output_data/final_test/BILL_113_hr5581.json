The Committee for net benefit determination includes key members such as the Attorney General, Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of Labor, Secretary of the Treasury, United States Trade Representative, Secretary of Agriculture (if agriculture is affected), and Secretary of Health and Human Services (if public health is affected). The President must issue regulations within 180 days to implement section 721(o) of the Defense Production Act of 1950, defining a \"foreign government-influenced transaction\" as one where the foreign person involved is owned, controlled, or influenced by a foreign government."
