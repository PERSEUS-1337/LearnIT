    "content": "The \"Alien Children Protection Act of 2000\" requires appropriate facilities for the detention of alien children. The \"Alien Children Protection Act of 2000\" mandates that alien children under 18 without a guardian in the US be placed in a suitable facility within 72 hours. Exceptions include those engaged in delinquent behavior or with security needs beyond a children's facility. The term \"facility appropriate for children\" refers to private nonprofit organizations or local foster care/group homes. A \"facility appropriate for children\" must be operated by a private nonprofit organization or local governmental entity with expertise in meeting children's needs, excluding facilities primarily for adults or delinquent minors. SEC. 3. ADJUSTMENT TO PERMANENT RESIDENT STATUS. Section 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act is amended to allow the Attorney General to adjust the status of certain underage aliens to that of a lawful permanent resident if they meet specific criteria. The Attorney General can adjust the status of underage aliens to lawful permanent residents if returning them to their country of origin would result in abuse. The decision is based on input from qualified individuals not affiliated with the Service. Upon approval, the alien's lawful permanent residence is recorded, and the number of visas is reduced by one. The Secretary of State can reduce the number of visas issued for permanent resident status to 500 aliens in any fiscal year. SEC. 4. ASSIGNMENT OF GUARDIANS AD LITEM TO ALIEN CHILDREN. Assignment of Guardians Ad Litem to Alien Children: The Attorney General must assign a child welfare professional or qualified individual as a guardian to covered aliens in immigration proceedings. The guardian's responsibilities include promoting the alien's best interests and ensuring understanding of the proceedings. The Attorney General must notify the alien of all matters affecting their immigration status. The term \"covered alien\" refers to an alien under 18 years old with no lawful immigration status in the US and not in the custody of a parent or legal guardian. If returning the child to their country of origin would result in abuse, the Attorney General must assign a guardian to protect their best interests during immigration proceedings. Congress commends the Immigration and Naturalization Service for issuing guidelines for children's asylum claims and supports their implementation. The General Accounting Office will report to Congress on the reunification efforts of U.S. Embassy and consular officials for children in foreign countries with parents in the U.S."
