    "content": "The military construction appropriations bill, Public Law 105-237, was enacted on September 20, 1998. The conference report for H.R. 4059 recommended $8.450B, with an additional $666M added by the conference committee. Despite the extra funds, FY1999's total is $759M less than FY1998. Emergency supplemental appropriations were provided in October 1998 due to natural disasters, securing an additional $209 million for military construction projects. The Department of Defense manages a vast infrastructure valued at over $500 billion. The military construction appropriations bill funds construction projects and maintenance for the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and their reserve components. It also covers defense-wide construction, NATO Security Investment Program, military family housing, and Base Realignment and Closure account for base realignment and closure costs. This bill is part of annual legislation providing funding for national defense. The defense appropriations bill provides funds for military activities, while the national defense authorization bill authorizes appropriations for national defense. The energy and water development appropriations bill funds atomic energy defense activities and civil projects by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Other appropriations also include small amounts for national defense. Major debates over defense policy and funding issues, including military construction, are addressed in these bills. The report highlights key parts of the defense authorization bill and the military construction appropriations process. Military construction appropriations fund facility investments for military services and defense agencies, including real property maintenance and MWR facilities. Unlike other funds, military construction appropriations do not need to be obligated in the same fiscal year. For FY1999, the President requested $7.8 billion for military construction, 12% less than the $8.9 billion appropriated for FY1998. Military construction accounts received emergency supplemental appropriations for FY1999 in October 1998 due to natural disasters. The enactment of FY1999 military construction appropriations involves key legislative steps outlined in Table 1. The military construction appropriations bill, Public Law 105-237, received $209 million in funding. The conference report recommended $8.450B, with an additional $666M added by the conference committee. Despite the extra funds, the FY1999 total is $759M less than FY1998. The conference agreement included full funding for the chemical demilitarization program but reduced the DOD Family Housing Improvement Fund to $2M. The House bill reduced the DOD Family Housing Improvement Fund to $2M from $242M, prioritizing construction projects in traditional family housing accounts. The conference committee also noted excessive spending on consultant support and delays in family housing projects, urging DOD to provide a revised privatization plan by October 1, 1998. The conference committee urged DOD to provide a revised privatization plan by October 1, 1998. The Homeowners Assistance Fund had no funds appropriated by the conference, instead allowing the transfer of funds from the Base Realignment and Closure account. The Senate approved $8.484 billion for military construction, while the House approved $8.235 billion. The House and Senate passed bills for military construction appropriations in FY1999, with differing allocations for family housing, general military construction projects, and Base Realignment and Closure obligations. Both subcommittees rejected Administration proposals for advanced appropriations and other projects. The Southern Command Headquarters moved to Miami, Florida from Panama. The Army took over chemical demilitarization construction from the Office of the Secretary of Defense for national security reasons. Committees noted underfunding in military construction by the DOD. The House Appropriations Committee increased the budget for privatization projects in the Family Housing Construction Account to $242 million. The budget resolution for the appropriations process is still in progress. The House and Senate are still in conference deliberations for the FY1999 budget resolution. The Senate Appropriations Committee allocated $8.484 billion for military construction, an increase of 8.9% from the President's request. The House Appropriations Committee allocated $8.235 billion, a 5% increase. The House approved $8.2 billion for military construction in its FY1999 defense authorization bill, with $450 million more than the President's request. The House National Security Committee reported that 40% of the increase in the FY1999 budget is dedicated to quality of life enhancements, including family housing, troop housing, child development centers, and fitness centers. The Senate Armed Services Committee approved $500 million more than the Administration's budget, with $164 million designated for various facilities and $336 million for high-priority projects. The Senate passed the bill on June 25, adding $200 million for quality of life improvements. The Senate passed S. 2057 on June 25, adding $200 million for quality of life military construction projects. The Inhofe amendment makes it harder for DOD to close military bases, requiring congressional approval for closures affecting 225 jobs. Both the HNSC and SASC rejected the Administration's proposal for more base closure rounds and noted the low budget request compared to prior years. The Senate committees rejected the Administration's proposals for additional base closure rounds and acquiring a leased building in Miami for U.S. Southern Command Headquarters. They also opposed moving funding for chemical demilitarization construction from OSD to the Army, citing delays in project obligations and a trend of using prior year savings for military construction projects. The Senate cut $50 million from the program due to unobligated funds backlog. The FY1997-FY1999 military construction proposal was denied by the SASC, expecting full funding in future budgets. The FY1999 authorization bill became P.L. 105-261 on October 17, 1998. Congress has consistently added significant amounts to military construction budgets in recent years, citing chronic underfunding as a key reason. Military construction proponents argue that military facilities have been underfunded for many years, with DOD facility managers stating they have not met their goal of budgeting 3% of plant replacement value for annual construction and maintenance. Actual funding has typically been 1 to 2%, with the Air Force managing only 1%. Congressional additions are welcomed by facility proponents. Facility proponents welcome congressional additions, as Congress often has different priorities from the Administration regarding military construction projects. Congressional committees have historically reallocated funds from overseas construction to domestic projects, citing the need to reduce troop levels abroad and increase allied burden-sharing contributions. The congressional defense committees have reallocated funds from overseas to domestic projects, including quality of life improvements. Members of Congress criticize poor Pentagon planning for military construction projects, making it challenging to prioritize pressing needs within the Department of Defense's long-term financial plan. In the 1990s, congressional defense committees criticized the Pentagon's long-term planning for military construction, particularly for leaving out necessary projects for the National Guard and Reserve. Representative Ron Packard urged the Department of Defense to submit honest budgets reflecting real service priorities and to use the Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP) to set construction project priorities. In the 1990s, the Pentagon faced criticism for inadequate long-term planning for military construction, especially for neglecting projects for the National Guard and Reserve. DOD Comptroller John Hamre admitted the need for detailed planning and evaluation of military construction budgets. The House Appropriations Committee called for a Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP) at the project level, including Guard and Reserve requirements. The FY1999 military construction hearings focused on integrating Guard and Reserve needs into the budget request. The Army testified on their efforts to produce integrated military construction plans. Alma Moore, Principal Deputy Secretary of the Army for Installations, Logistics and Environment, testified that the military construction budget was based on the Army's one team, one fight concept, balancing resources among all components. Congressional debate has focused on prioritizing additional projects due to significant increases in military construction budgets over the last decade. Senator McCain objected to the amount of congressional additions to the budget in 1994. Senator McCain objected to substantial amounts for unrequested defense projects, labeling them as \"pork barrel\" spending. He pushed for criteria to prioritize critical yet unbudgeted projects, but his amendment was not included in the final bill, which allocated over $900 million for such projects. The National Defense Authorization Act for FY1995 included McCain's criteria as a sense of the Senate provision. The McCain criteria, included in the National Defense Authorization Act for FY1995, outline requirements for unrequested defense projects to be considered essential to national security, consistent with base closures, in the services' Future Years Defense Plans, executable in the authorized year, and offset by reductions in other defense accounts. While not legally binding, these criteria have been influential in Senate debates for FY1996 and FY1997, with a focus on justifying projects based on the first four criteria. Offset requirements have been largely ignored in practice. Since the 104th Congress, the House military construction committees have added projects to the budget based on criteria similar to the McCain criteria. Senator McCain challenged congressional add-ons in the FY1998 military construction appropriations conference report, noting 129 projects totaling $800 million, with $220 million going to the National Guard and Reserve. The added projects must meet criteria like being essential to the DOD mission, consistent with BRAC plans, in the Future Years Defense Plan, and executable in the coming fiscal year. Senator McCain listed the extra projects in various official documents and on his web page. The FY1998 Line Item Veto was used by the President to eliminate 38 military construction projects totaling $287 million in 24 states. The savings were directed towards deficit reduction instead of the Department of Defense, as the projects did not align with the Department's future plans. The criteria for vetoing these projects were similar to the McCain criteria and House committees' criteria for adding projects. The Clinton Administration vetoed 38 military construction projects totaling $287 million in 24 states for not meeting criteria related to future plans, design completion, and impact on troops' quality of life. However, data showed that many projects were in the Department of Defense's future plans, had design work in progress, and were executable in FY1998, contradicting the Administration's criteria. The White House vetoed 38 military construction projects in FY1998, questioning their quality of life merit. Most of the projects did not meet Administration criteria for inclusion on the veto list. A disapproval bill was passed by the House and Senate to overturn the veto, but the President vetoed it in November 1997. Erroneous data led to the cancellation of some projects, which were later restored by a veto override in February 1998. The debate highlights issues with adding projects to the military construction budget. The Budget Enforcement Act of 1997 set caps on budget authority and outlays for FY1998-FY2002. The President's FY1999 budget proposal for national defense equals the cap of $270.6 billion. Unless Congress revises the budget agreement, there would appear to be no room for Congress to add funding to the defense budget. This will be the first time in three years that Congress has not been able to add money to the defense budget. Despite budget constraints, the defense budget saw increases in military construction funding in FY1996, FY1997, and FY1998. The House and Senate committees added significant amounts to the President's request for military construction. Quality of life issues for servicemembers, such as family housing and child care facilities, were highlighted as important for recruitment and retention. The FY1999 Military Construction Appropriations Bill recommended an additional $666 million to the President's request. The Department of Defense found that two-thirds of military housing is substandard. In 1995, Defense Secretary Perry established committees to address quality of life issues for servicemembers. Two major housing initiatives were implemented, including private sector financing for family housing and a new barracks standard called \"1 + 1\". Congress has expressed concerns about the pace of these initiatives. The Congress gave the Pentagon new authorities for privatization of military family housing to address the housing problem. These authorities include guarantees, conveyance or lease of property, differential lease payments, investments, and direct loans. These new authorities can be used individually or in combination for various projects. John Goodman testified about these authorities to the Military Installations and Facilities Subcommittee in 1998. John Goodman testified to the Military Installations and Facilities Subcommittee about the new authorities for privatization of military family housing. Accomplishments include awarded Navy projects in TX and WA, Army and Air Force projects to be awarded soon, and RFPs for multiple projects across different branches. Start-up issues have delayed large-scale pursuit of privatization. The Department of Defense's Housing Revitalization Support Office (HRSO) is coordinating the implementation of new privatization authorities for military family housing. It took time for DOD to learn to work in the commercial real estate market, with rules not devised until June 1997. Representative Joel Hefley highlighted the challenges faced in translating loan concepts for private investment. The military housing privatization authorities are set to expire in September 2000 unless extended by Congress. Mr. Hefley expressed interest in extending the authorities but emphasized the need for better execution. The Senate is concerned about how housing privatization initiatives could impact future Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) rounds, particularly in terms of shifting financial risk to the government. Senator Stevens raised these concerns in a hearing on the FY1999 military construction budget. The FY1998 Senate Appropriations Committee report on Military Construction highlighted the need to improve barracks conditions by eliminating gang latrine barracks by FY2008. The Air Force will achieve this goal in FY1999, followed by the Marine Corps in FY2005, and the Army & Navy in FY2008. The implementation of the 1 + 1 standard for barracks housing will be completed by FY2020. Senator Stevens emphasized the importance of monitoring housing projects with guarantees to bases in future BRAC rounds. The House Appropriations Committee report noted timetables for meeting housing standards for different branches of the military. Legislation for more BRAC rounds would start in defense committees, with skepticism towards the Administration's request for two more rounds in FY2001 and FY2005. The Congress passed Section 2824 of the FY1998 National Defense Authorization Act, requiring the Pentagon to report on costs and savings from previous domestic military base closures. The report stated that the DOD has 23% excess base capacity and that two new BRAC rounds could save about $3 billion per year. Despite this, both defense authorizing committees rejected the Administration's proposal for more base closure rounds in May 1998. The Senate raises concerns about environmental clean-up costs and its impact on military functions. Senator Burns highlights that a significant portion of the Army's FY1999 BRAC funding is allocated for studies and restoration of BRAC facilities. The subcommittee will scrutinize the allocation of clean-up funds and the condition of military construction facilities when transferred to the private sector. Additionally, the Congress will review the Army's proposal to use advanced procurement procedures for military construction. The FY1999 Army military construction request proposes to use advanced procurement for some projects, deviating from the usual full funding practice for defense programs. This allows for funding of \"long-leadtime\" weapons components like nuclear-power plants for Navy warships. The FY1999 Army military construction request includes advanced procurement for several projects, totaling $555,050,000. This funding will cover projects such as the U.S. Disciplinary Barracks, Roi Namur Power Plant, Fort Hood Railhead facility, Cadet Physical Development Center, and Chemical Demilitarization projects. Congress approved advanced procurement to expedite these large military construction projects. The Congress approved advanced procurement for FY1999 Army military construction projects, including chemical demilitarization. The Pentagon transferred $125 million from the DOD budget to the Army for six chem demil projects. House and Senate committees rejected the transfer of chem demil responsibility to the Army, citing national importance and cut funding for the program. The Administration proposed significant reductions in military construction spending for FY1999, with a 12% reduction from the FY1998 approved amount. The military construction conference committee recommended $8.450B for FY1999, $666M more than the President's request. Tables show military construction funding since FY1995, FY1999 request breakdown, congressional actions on appropriations bills, and add-ons for Guard and Reserve projects. H.R. 3616 (Spence) was referred to the House Committee on National Security in April 1998. It was reported to the House, amended, and passed by the House in May 1998. The Senate then took up the bill, inserted the text of S. 2057, approved the bill as amended, and requested a conference in June 1998. The conference agreement was announced in September 1998, and the bill became P.L. 105-261 on October 17, 1998. S. 2057 (Thurmond) and S. 2160 (Burns) were reported to the Senate by Senators Thurmond and Burns, respectively. S. 2057 was considered on various dates in May and June 1998, while S. 2160 was laid before the Senate on June 25, 1998. The Senate passed companion measure H.R. 4059 instead of S. 2160 on the same day. The House Committee on Appropriations reported an original measure on June 16, 1998. The bill passed the House on June 22, 1998, and was later adopted as an amendment in the Senate on June 25, 1998. The conference report was filed in the House on July 24, 1998, and the bill became P.L. 105-237 on September 20, 1998. The FY 1999 data was requested from the Department of Defense, including financial summary tables and previous reports. Military construction appropriations by account for FY 1997-99 were detailed, along with congressional actions and additions to the Department of Defense budget requests for National Guard and Reserve military construction. Transfer authority and project inclusions were noted in the conference report. Annual Department of Defense Budget Requests for National Guard and Reserve Military Construction, FY1985-98 (current year dollars in thousands) were detailed in various reports by the Department of Defense and Congressional Research Service. The information can be found in CRS reports such as IB96022, 93-317, 98-205, 98-155, 94-515, and 91-669, as well as on the websites of the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations.
