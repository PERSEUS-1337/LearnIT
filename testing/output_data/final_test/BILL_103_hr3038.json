    "content": "The \"Executive Office Accountability Act of 1993\" establishes an Inspector General for the Executive Office of the President and outlines provisions concerning the appointment and duties of the Inspector General. The Inspector General Act of 1978 is amended to include special provisions concerning the Inspector General of the Executive Office of the President. The Inspector General of the Executive Office of the President is under the authority, direction, and control of the President for audits, investigations, and subpoenas related to criminal investigations, undercover operations, confidential sources, policy decisions, intelligence matters, and national security threats. The President may prohibit the Inspector General from conducting audits or investigations if the disclosure of information would interfere with the President's constitutional responsibilities and if the prohibition is necessary to prevent disclosure. The President can prohibit the Inspector General from audits or investigations if disclosure interferes with constitutional responsibilities. The President must notify the Inspector General and Congress within 30 days of making such a determination. The Inspector General must then report to relevant congressional committees. The Executive Office of the President must include in each semiannual report to the President a list of inspections, investigations, or audits conducted, status of corrective actions on previous recommendations, certification of full access to relevant information by the Inspector General, and descriptions of cases during the reporting period. The Inspector General must include in each semiannual report to Congress descriptions of cases where relevant documentary evidence could not be obtained due to a determination by the President, along with recommendations for legislation to promote efficiency and detect fraud in programs and operations of the Executive Office of the President. The President must transmit the semiannual report from the Inspector General of the Executive Office of the President to the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate, along with any comments deemed appropriate. SEC. 4 amends title 31, US Code to establish a Chief Financial Officer for the Executive Office of the President. The President must appoint the CFO within 90 days of the enactment of this Act. SEC. 5 addresses financial management activities within the Executive Office of the President. The Chief Financial Officer of the Executive Office of the President is directed by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to review and consolidate financial management activities within the office. The CFO must submit a reorganization proposal within 60 days of the review. The Chief Financial Officer must submit a proposal to reorganize the Executive Office of the President, detailing functions, personnel, and administrative structure within 30 days for review and approval. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget must approve or disapprove the Chief Financial Officer's proposal to reorganize the Executive Office of the President within 30 days. The approval is based on whether the proposal establishes a suitable financial management structure. The Director must notify the Chief Financial Officer, and provide a written notice to relevant congressional committees. Upon approval or disapproval by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Chief Financial Officer will implement the proposed reorganization of the Executive Office of the President."
