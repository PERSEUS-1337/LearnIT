    "content": "The report provides an overview of Supreme Court and Federal Circuit cases on patentable subject matter, including the recent Bilski v. Kappos decision. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issues patents after examiners approve applications with specifications and claims defining the invention's scope. Examiners ensure inventions meet statutory requirements like novelty before granting patents. The statutory requirements for patentability include novelty, nonobviousness, and usefulness. An invention must be different from prior art, not obvious to a person skilled in the relevant field, and provide a significant benefit to the public. According to the Patent Act, an invention must fall within the statutory categories of patent-eligible subject matter to qualify for patent protection. The scope of patentable subject matter is expansive under \u00a7 101 of the Patent Act. The U.S. Supreme Court has set limits on patentable subject matter, stating that \"laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas\" cannot be patented. This includes new minerals, plants, and scientific laws like E=mc^2 and the law of gravity. Process patents involve a series of steps to achieve a result. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit interprets the scope of patentable processes under the Patent Act. In the case of Gottschalk v. Benson, the Supreme Court ruled that a mathematical formula, even if novel and useful, cannot be patented. The Supreme Court ruled in Gottschalk v. Benson that patent claims for converting binary code to pure binary numbers would preempt mathematical formulas and algorithms. Six years later, in Parker v. Flook, the Court recognized the unclear line between patentable processes and unpatentable principles, rejecting claims for computing an \"alarm limit.\" The Court criticized the patent claims for an \"alarm limit\" in catalytic conversion processes, stating it lacked details on selecting safety margins, chemical processes, and alarm system operation. The Flook Court deemed claims for improved calculation methods unpatentable. In Diamond v. Chakrabarty, the Supreme Court allowed patenting genetically altered micro-organisms in 1980. The Chakrabarty Court allowed the patenting of genetically engineered bacterium capable of breaking down crude oil components, citing Congress's intent to permit a broad range of patentable subject matter. The bacterium was deemed a nonnaturally occurring manufacture or composition of matter, eligible for patenting. In Diamond v. Diehr, the Court examined a patent application for a process to produce cured synthetic rubber products. The Diehr Court upheld a process patent for producing cured synthetic rubber products, stating that it falls within patentable subject matter categories. The claims involved transforming raw, uncured synthetic rubber into a different state, which historically qualifies for patent protection. The use of a mathematical formula and a programmed digital computer in the process did not affect patent eligibility. The Diehr Court upheld a process patent for curing synthetic rubber, stating that it was eligible for patent protection. The use of a mathematical formula and a programmed digital computer did not hinder patent eligibility. Since Diehr, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals has also addressed patent-eligible subject matter in cases like In re Alappat in 1994. The Federal Circuit upheld the patentability of computer programs by stating that the claimed invention is a specific machine producing a tangible result, not just an abstract idea. In 1998, the Federal Circuit's decision in State Street Bank & Trust Co. v. Signature Financial Group opened doors to allowing process claims. The State Street Bank decision allowed patents on business methods in various fields like management, finance, legal, and e-commerce. It involved a data processing system for managing a stock mutual fund, deemed patentable by the Federal Circuit for transforming data into a final share price through mathematical calculations. The American Inventors Protection Act of 1999 was passed in response to the State Street Bank decision, allowing earlier inventors of business methods maintained as trade secrets to defend against patent infringement. This defense, known as \"prior user rights,\" aimed to protect companies and individuals from liability. In 2006, the Supreme Court revisited patentability in the Laboratory Corporation v. Metabolite Labs case involving a method of detecting a specific condition. The patent in the case of Corporation v. Metabolite Labs involves detecting deficiencies in B vitamins in the human body. The patented method requires measuring a body fluid for elevated levels of an amino acid and correlating it with a deficiency in the vitamins. The Supreme Court granted certiorari to determine if a method patent claiming a monopoly over a basic scientific relationship used in medical treatment is valid. The Supreme Court dismissed Laboratory Corporation v. Metabolite Labs case after hearing oral arguments, stating the writ of certiorari was improvidently granted. Three justices dissented, arguing that the patent claiming a monopoly over a basic scientific relationship used in medical treatment should be invalid. Justice Breyer criticized the Federal Circuit's State Street Bank decision for allowing patents on natural phenomena. Justice Breyer criticized the State Street Bank ruling for relying on the \"useful, concrete and tangible result\" test from In re Alappat. He also expressed concerns about the validity of business method patents in cases like eBay, Inc. v. MercExchange. The Bilski v. Kappos case involved a patent application related to hedging risk in commodities trading. The patent application in question involved a method for managing consumption risk costs in commodities trading by initiating transactions between commodity providers and consumers at fixed rates based on historical averages, and balancing the risk position through transactions with market participants. The application was rejected by the PTO examiner for not being directed to patent-eligible subject matter. The patent application for managing consumption risk costs in commodities trading was rejected for not being directed to patent-eligible subject matter. The Board upheld this decision, stating that the claimed process did not produce a useful, concrete, and tangible result. Bernard L. Bilski and Rand A. Warsaw appealed to the Federal Circuit, which affirmed the Board's decision. The appellate court's ruling clarified standards for patent eligibility. The appellate court's decision clarified standards for patent eligibility of process claims, expressly overruling prior decisions that relied on the \"useful, concrete and tangible result\" test. The court stated that while a process tied to a particular machine or transforming an article may produce a tangible result, this alone is not sufficient to determine patent eligibility under \u00a7 101. The Federal Circuit announced a new test for determining patent eligibility under \u00a7 101, drawing from the Diehr case. It distinguished between fundamental principles and applications of laws of nature or mathematical formulas, allowing patent protection for specific applications but not for claims that preempt all uses of a fundamental principle. The Federal Circuit established a \"machine-or-transformation\" test for determining patent eligibility under \u00a7 101, derived from the Benson opinion. This test requires a claimed process to be tied to a particular machine or apparatus, or to transform a particular article into a different state or thing. The Diehr Court reaffirmed this test, rejecting the argument that it was not intended to be the sole criteria for patent eligibility. The Supreme Court did not intend the \"machine-or-transformation\" test to be the sole governing test for patent eligibility under \u00a7 101. The test is considered a clue to determine if a claim is a statutory \"process,\" but not optional. The Federal Circuit stated that a process claim can satisfy \u00a7 101 by being tied to a machine or by transforming an article. Bilski's claims did not involve a specific machine, so the Federal Circuit left the issue for future cases. The Federal Circuit left the elaboration of the machine implementation part of the test for future cases. The Bilski opinion outlined principles for the \"machine-or-transformation\" test, stating that a specific machine or transformation must impose meaningful limits on the claim's scope for patent-eligibility. The involvement of the machine or transformation in the claimed process must be central to its purpose and not insignificant extra-solution activity. The transformation of an article into a different state must be central to the claimed process for it to be patent-eligible. The \"machine-or-transformation\" test requires a transformation of physical objects or data into a visual depiction to be patent-eligible. Legal obligations and business risks are considered abstract constructs and do not pass the test. Simply adding a data-gathering step to an algorithm is not enough for patent eligibility. In the case of Bilski, the process claim failed to transform any article into a different state. The \"machine-or-transformation\" test requires physical transformations for patent eligibility. Legal obligations and business risks are abstract and do not pass the test. The claim in Bilski failed the machine implementation part of the test and is not drawn to patent-eligible subject matter. The Supreme Court may alter the test to accommodate emerging technologies like computers and the Internet. The Federal Circuit's \"machine-or-transformation\" test for patent eligibility was challenged for limiting patent protection for business methods, which goes against congressional intent. The Supreme Court unanimously affirmed that Bilski's process was unpatentable but disagreed on the legal reasoning behind the decision. The Supreme Court unanimously affirmed that Bilski's process was unpatentable, with Justice Kennedy writing the majority opinion joined by Chief Justice Roberts, Justices Thomas, and Alito. Justice Scalia partially supported Kennedy's opinion. Justice Stevens filed a concurring opinion, joined by Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor. Justice Breyer also wrote a separate concurrence to identify points of agreement on patent law issues. Justice Kennedy identified three potential bases for rejecting Bilski's patent application: lack of machine tie, involvement in business methods, and being an abstract idea. He discussed the \"abstract idea\" test and the exceptions to patentable subject matter, emphasizing the need for processes to be new and useful. The Court rejected Bilski's patent application as it attempted to patent abstract ideas, specifically the concept of hedging. This would grant a monopoly over an abstract idea and pre-empt its use in all fields. Justice Kennedy explored the \"machine-or-transformation\" test and the exclusion of \"business methods\" from patent protection. The Supreme Court rejected Bilski's patent application for trying to patent abstract ideas, emphasizing the limitations imposed by the \"machine-or-transformation\" test and the exclusion of \"business methods\" from patent protection. Justice Kennedy highlighted the importance of interpreting words in their ordinary meaning but noted exceptions for laws of nature, physical phenomena, and abstract ideas. The Court held that while these exceptions exist, federal courts cannot impose limitations inconsistent with the Patent Act's purpose and design. The Supreme Court rejected Bilski's patent application for trying to patent abstract ideas, emphasizing the limitations imposed by the \"machine-or-transformation\" test. The Court held that the Federal Circuit's adoption of this test as the sole criteria for patentable processes violated the \"ordinary meaning\" rule of statutory construction. The Court determined that the test is not the exclusive criteria for process patent eligibility under \u00a7 101. The Supreme Court rejected Bilski's patent application for trying to patent abstract ideas, emphasizing the limitations of the \"machine-or-transformation\" test. The Court reversed the Federal Circuit's requirement that the test be the only standard for examining process patent eligibility under \u00a7 101. Justice Kennedy addressed whether business methods are categorically excluded from patent eligibility, stating that the term \"method\" may include some business methods based on the ordinary meaning rule. The Supreme Court rejected Bilski's patent application for trying to patent abstract ideas, emphasizing the limitations of the \"machine-or-transformation\" test. Justice Kennedy observed that federal law acknowledges the existence of some business method patents, as seen in the American Inventors Protection Act of 1999. This clarifies that business methods are eligible for patenting under certain circumstances, as stated in Section 273 of the Patent Act. The Supreme Court emphasized the importance of not interpreting a statutory provision in a way that would make another provision meaningless. Justice Kennedy stated that courts should adhere to the statutory definition of \"process\" under \u00a7 101 and follow previous Supreme Court cases. The Court did not endorse the Federal Circuit's past interpretations of \u00a7 101 but encouraged them to continue evaluating patentable processes within the statutory limits. Justice Kennedy encouraged the Federal Circuit to develop criteria that align with the Patent Act's purposes and are not limited to the \"machine-or-transformation\" test, which he expressed concerns about potentially hindering innovation in the Information Age. The Court's opinion, with Justice Scalia not joining two subparts, represents a plurality and is not controlling. The machine-or-transformation test could create uncertainty for patenting software, diagnostic techniques, and inventions like data compression. Justice Kennedy suggested new technologies may require different criteria than the test. He also noted concerns about business method patents and the need for limiting principles on abstract ideas in patent applications. Justice Stevens concurred with the Court's decision that the \"machine-or-transformation\" test is not the sole criteria for patentable processes. He disagreed with the Court's reliance on the ordinary meaning rule in the case of Bilski's patent claim. Justice Stevens criticized the Court's approach to interpreting the Patent Act's terms, stating that relying on the ordinary meaning rule could lead to absurd results and render \u00a7 101 almost comical. He pointed out the inconsistency of the Court in adhering to this approach for a statute with complex terms of art developed against a particular historical background. Justice Stevens criticized the Court's inconsistency in applying the \"ordinary, contemporary, common meaning\" rule to evaluate patent eligibility, particularly in the case of business methods. He argued that business methods do not qualify as a \"process\" eligible for patenting under \u00a7 101, citing historical evidence in patent case law and legislative history. Justice Stevens criticized the Court's inconsistency in applying the \"ordinary, contemporary, common meaning\" rule to evaluate patent eligibility, particularly in the case of business methods. He found \"strong historical evidence\" suggesting that business methods are not patentable, expressing concern that they may hinder technological progress and innovation. Stevens rejected the idea that anything with a \"useful, concrete and tangible result\" can be patented, disagreeing with the Court's reliance on \u00a7 273 of the Patent Act as evidence of Congress's intent. In 1999, Congress passed the 1999 Act, codified at 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 273, which provides a limited defense to claims of patent infringement regarding certain \"method[s] of doing or conducting business.\" Congress did not ratify the State Street decision but limited one potential effect of it, ensuring businesses were not suddenly liable for using methods they assumed could not be patented. The Act did not amend the limitations in \u00a7 101 on eligible patents. The 1999 Act limited the potential effect of the State Street decision, ensuring businesses were not suddenly liable for using unpatentable methods. Justice Breyer highlighted key points on patent law, including the broad but limited scope of \u00a7 101 and the importance of the \"machine-or-transformation\" test in identifying patentable processes. The Bilski decision did not ban business method patents but did not provide clear guidelines on what types of business methods could qualify for patent protection. Some parties hoped for a ban on business method patents, but the Court did not go that far. The Bilski decision did not ban business method patents but lacked clear guidelines on what qualifies for patent protection. Justice Stevens criticized the Court for not providing a satisfying account of what constitutes an unpatentable abstract idea. The decision may have led to the correct outcome but left many observers disappointed and sparked ongoing debate on the value of business method patents. The Bilski decision was criticized for being inconclusive on patent eligible subject matter, with some expressing relief at the ruling to avoid gutting the patent system. Former chief judge Paul R. Michel noted that the Supreme Court did not impose radical changes. The Bilski decision did not impose radical changes in patent eligibility jurisprudence, but it raised concerns about making litigation more difficult and outcomes less predictable. A process may be eligible for patenting if it goes beyond natural phenomena or abstract ideas and satisfies the \"machine-or-transformation\" test. However, the court also indicated that a process could still be eligible for patenting even if it does not meet this test. The Bilski decision raised concerns about patent eligibility for processes that do not meet the \"machine-or-transformation\" test. Justice Breyer suggested few patentable processes may fall outside this test. The Court did not directly address patent protection for software, medical diagnostics, and e-commerce techniques, but indicated they may qualify. The decision did not invalidate existing patents in financial services, biotechnology, and Internet fields. The Bilski decision requires a more flexible approach in determining patent eligibility for processes, rejecting the \"machine-or-transformation\" test as the exclusive standard. This may make patents obtained on business methods more easily challenged. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued guidelines for examiners to reject claims that do not meet the machine-or-transformation test under \u00a7 101. The Bilski decision raises questions about what constitutes an \"abstract idea\" and challenges the patent-eligibility of process claims. District courts, PTO examiners, and the Federal Circuit will need to determine on a case-by-case basis if certain inventions are too abstract to be patented."
