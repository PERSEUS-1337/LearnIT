The \"Interstate Doxxing Prevention Act\" defines personally identifiable information as data that can trace an individual's identity, including sensitive private information like gender identity and sexual orientation. The \"Interstate Doxxing Prevention Act\" defines 'immediate family member' as spouse, parent, sibling, or child, and 'intimate partner' as someone in a romantic or intimate relationship with the subject of the publication. The term 'sexually explicit visual depiction' includes depictions of the exhibition of certain body parts, sexual acts, bestiality, or sadistic conduct. Attempting or conspiring to violate this section is punishable similarly to a completed violation. The section does not prohibit authorized investigative, protective, or intelligence activities of law enforcement agencies at various levels. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections in the United States Code. Publication of personally identifiable information with the intent to cause harm is addressed in section 881 of the United States Code."
