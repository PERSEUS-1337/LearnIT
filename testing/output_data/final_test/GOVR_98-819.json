Citizenship relates to political rights like voting and holding office, while nationality involves allegiance and protection under international law. In the U.S., all citizens are nationals, but not all nationals are citizens. Nationals can be citizens by birth or have a different status. In the U.S., citizenship and nationality are different concepts. Citizenship includes political rights like voting, while nationality involves allegiance and international protection. Dual citizenship can arise through naturalization or jus soli, where a person acquires citizenship by birth in a nation or its territories. Loss of nationality is often understood as loss of citizenship as well. In the U.S., citizenship can be acquired through birth (jus soli) or descent (jus sanguinis). Dual citizenship is possible by being born in the U.S. to foreign parents or abroad to U.S. parents. Naturalized citizens may retain citizenship in another country that does not require renunciation. Renouncing allegiance to other nations is a requirement for immigrants becoming U.S. citizens. In the U.S., citizenship can be acquired through birth or descent. Dual citizenship is possible for those born in the U.S. to foreign parents or abroad to U.S. parents. Naturalized citizens may retain citizenship in another country that does not require renunciation. Section 1481 of Title 8 of the U.S. Code lists actions that may result in the expatriation of a U.S. citizen, regardless of birth or naturalization. Section 1481 of Title 8 of the U.S. Code outlines acts that could lead to the denaturalization of a U.S. citizen, such as demonstrating allegiance to another nation through actions like naturalization in a foreign country or serving in the armed forces of a hostile foreign state. Section 1483 of Title 8 outlines conditions for expatriation, stating that a citizen cannot be expatriated while in the U.S. or its possessions, except for treason and formal renunciation in the U.S. Acts committed in the U.S. can be grounds for expatriation once the citizen leaves the country. Additionally, a citizen who asserts their claim to U.S. citizenship within six months of turning 18 shall not be considered expatriated for serving in a foreign state's armed forces or making a formal renunciation abroad. Treaty provisions ratified before December 25, 1952, supersede expatriation laws. The provisions on expatriation before December 25, 1952, supersede expatriation laws, except for cases involving marriage to an alien. Loss of citizenship now requires voluntary and intentional acts. Denationalization, different from expatriation, results from conduct against national interest. Conduct leading to denationalization must be voluntary. The United States Supreme Court has moved towards a stricter interpretation of expatriation over the years. Formerly, Congress had the power to denationalize a U.S. citizen, even a citizen by birth, but the Court reversed itself and found that the Fourteenth Amendment prevents Congress from legislating the automatic loss of citizenship based on certain conduct. The Supreme Court has ruled that Congress cannot automatically revoke U.S. citizenship based on certain conduct without the citizen's consent. Specific intent to renounce citizenship must be proven, and expatriation claims must be supported by evidence. Terrazas upheld the evidentiary standards for proving intent to relinquish U.S. citizenship, requiring a finding of intent that could be inferred from conduct inconsistent with allegiance to the U.S. Written relinquishment was not necessary, and intent could be proven by a preponderance of the evidence. The court found that signing an oath of allegiance to another country during naturalization does not automatically renounce U.S. citizenship without explicit renunciation. Explicit renunciation or an oath accompanied by it leads to expatriation. However, if a person signs naturalization papers that explicitly renounce U.S. citizenship unknowingly, the intent may not be proven. Economic duress argument was rejected by one court, while another emphasized voluntariness of actions. Economic duress may avoid expatriation, but the citizen's economic plight must be dire. Holding office in a foreign legislature does not constitute expatriation without specific intent to renounce U.S. citizenship. A plaintiff lost citizenship when foreign laws changed, despite attempting to retain office by renouncing U.S. citizenship. Retraction of renunciation was ineffective as it was deemed voluntary and effective. The State Department has a permissive stance on loss of citizenship upon committing an expatriating act. Taking an oath of allegiance to a foreign state is strong evidence but not conclusive of intent to relinquish U.S. citizenship. Conflicts between rights and obligations of dual citizenship may arise. Voting in a foreign election is no longer grounds for expatriation. Retaining U.S. citizenship while naturalizing in another country may require caution to avoid unintentional renunciation. Some East-European-American dual nationals have declined government positions in Eastern Europe to retain U.S. citizenship. For example, former Minnesota governor Rudy Perpich considered a position in Croatia but decided against it. Milan Panic, a naturalized U.S. citizen, served briefly as Prime Minister in his native country. Milan Panic, a naturalized U.S. citizen who briefly served as Prime Minister in Yugoslavia, received permission from the U.S. State Department to retain his U.S. citizenship while in office. U.S. citizenship was seen as incompatible with holding high government positions in foreign countries. Valdas Adamkus, the current President of Lithuania and a former U.S. citizen, renounced his U.S. citizenship after being elected in Lithuania. Valdas Adamkus, the current President of Lithuania, renounced his U.S. citizenship after being elected, despite the option to retain it under Lithuanian law. He fulfilled a campaign promise and visited the U.S. Embassy in Vilnius to formally renounce his citizenship and receive a diplomatic visa. This action was not legally required, as both Lithuanian and U.S. laws would have allowed him to keep his U.S. citizenship while serving as President. The expatriation provision states that serving in foreign armed forces, even as an officer in a friendly country, is considered an expatriating act. A multilateral Protocol allows individuals with dual nationality to be exempt from military obligations in one country if they habitually reside in and are most closely connected to another country. This exemption may result in the loss of non-dominant nationality. Article 1 of the Protocol states that an exemption from U.S. military service for obligations in another country could indicate an intent to relinquish U.S. citizenship. Dual citizens may face conflicting financial obligations and tax issues due to their dual nationality. Bilateral treaties between the U.S. and other countries aim to prevent double taxation but may not address the unique challenges of dual nationals. The tax laws of the U.S. provide for foreign tax credit and may differentiate between aliens and dual nationals in terms of repatriation of income and investments. Dual nationals may face restrictions on moving money out of the country due to their dual nationality. If there is no treaty between the U.S. and the particular nation involved, they can negotiate treaties to resolve conflicting issues. Dual nationals can resolve conflicting obligations through treaties related to naturalization, tax, or military obligations. Treaties of expatriation have historically addressed dual nationality issues with various countries. Recent changes in Mexico's constitution and federal statutes have garnered attention in the U.S. due to immigration law reforms. Israel, Ireland, and Colombia's citizenship and nationality laws will also be discussed. The discussion will focus on the citizenship and nationality laws of Israel, Ireland, and Colombia, excluding naturalization laws that could lead to dual citizenship. It is suggested that exercising rights of a prior nationality after naturalization in the U.S. may raise concerns about the citizen's oath of allegiance. Some foreign laws allow for reacquisition of native nationality. Recent changes in Mexican laws allow former Mexican citizens who are now naturalized U.S. citizens to retain or reclaim Mexican nationality for themselves and their U.S.-born children. Amendments to the Mexican constitution were passed in December 1996, with an effective date of March 20, 1998. The amendments to the Mexican constitution in 1996 allowed Mexicans with dual nationality to retain their Mexican nationality and pass it on to their children born outside Mexico. Dual nationals can hold passports, own property in restricted areas, but only Mexicans with no other nationality can hold certain public offices. Foreigners are restricted from owning land within 100 kilometers of borders and 50 kilometers of the coastline. Former Mexican nationals who have naturalized in another country have five years to reclaim their Mexican nationality. Mexican dual nationals who lost their nationality through naturalization in another country have until March 3, 2003, to initiate the procedure to recover their Mexican nationality. The law on dual nationality was passed in December 1997, effective from March 20, 1998. Dual nationals can live and own property in Mexico but are exempt from certain obligations and privileges, including holding certain public offices and serving in the armed forces. The new dual nationality laws in Mexico allow dual nationals to live and own property in Mexico, but they are exempt from certain obligations like serving in the armed forces and holding certain public offices. However, the right to vote has not been extended to dual nationals. It is estimated that 4 to 5.5 million current or former Mexican nationals could be affected by these laws, including U.S.-born children with Mexican parents who may be eligible for Mexican nationality. The Law of Return in Israel allows every Jew to immigrate and become an Israeli citizen, with exceptions for certain activities or criminal history. A \"Jew\" is defined as someone born to a Jewish mother or who has converted to Judaism. The right of return also extends to the offspring of intermarriage. The Irish nationality laws allow individuals born outside Ireland to acquire Irish citizenship through descent up to three generations down from the person born in Ireland. This includes automatic citizenship for those born outside Ireland with an Irish parent, and the option to register for citizenship for those with Irish grandparents or great-grandparents. Colombian nationality laws allow native Colombians to retain their nationality even if they acquire another nationality through naturalization. Naturalized Colombians are not required to renounce other nationalities. There are provisions for Colombians who lost their nationality through naturalization in another country to reacquire Colombian nationality. Some countries, like Korea and Germany, are under pressure to liberalize their nationality laws to allow dual nationality, but plans in Korea have been delayed due to concerns about split loyalties. In Germany, liberalizing nationality laws has become a contentious issue in the elections, with most political parties supporting it. However, one conservative party is opposed, and another is split on the issue. In the 105th Congress, there has been limited legislation on dual citizenship, but there is interest in revisiting the issue in light of global trends towards liberalization of dual nationality laws. The global trend towards liberalization of dual nationality laws is impacting the United States, a nation traditionally seen as a land of immigrants. Concerns about split loyalties and national security have led to some federal policies restricting dual citizenship. However, others view dual nationality as natural for a diverse immigrant nation. The opinion on dual nationality in the United States varies, with some embracing it as natural for a nation of immigrants, while others see no particular threat or benefit. A recent criminal case highlighted the challenges of dual nationality, where an American man claimed U.S.-Israeli dual nationality to avoid extradition for a homicide in Maryland. This case has led to legal delays due to Israeli extradition laws. The curr_chunk discusses various bilateral treaties and agreements related to nationality and military obligations between the United States and other countries, including Bulgaria, Finland, and France. The curr_chunk provides information on treaties between the United States and Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland regarding exemption from military service for individuals with dual nationality."
