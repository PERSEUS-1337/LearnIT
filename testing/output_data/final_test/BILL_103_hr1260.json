    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"National Aeronautical Research and Competitiveness Act of 1993\". The Congress recognizes the significant impact of aircraft production on the economy, with international shipments leading to job creation and economic growth. Advanced aircraft technologies developed by NASA and the Department of Defense benefit both civil and military aircraft production. Decreases in military aviation programs could negatively affect civil aviation programs. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration needs to enhance its capabilities for coordinating long-term US aeronautical research efforts. Research programs at NASA have applications in both military and civil aviation, including wind tunnels, high-speed research technology, rotorcraft technology, high performance aircraft technology, and supersonic technology. Joint technology development programs involving the Department of Defense, NASA, and industry can facilitate the transfer of skills and technologies between defense and civilian aerospace sectors. Joint technology development programs involving the Department of Defense, NASA, and industry can facilitate the transfer of skills and technologies between defense and civilian aerospace sectors, allowing for a phased transition over 5 years. SEC. 3. JOINT AERONAUTICAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM. The Administrator and the Secretary will establish a joint program for researching aeronautical technologies applicable to military and civil aircraft to enhance US competitiveness. Research areas include next-generation wind tunnel technology, advanced engine materials, high-performance aircraft, advanced rotorcraft, hypersonic aeronautical research, environmentally friendly technologies, and human factors. The joint program established by the Administrator and the Secretary focuses on researching aeronautical technologies for military and civil aircraft to boost US competitiveness. Contracts and grants under this program will be administered using procedures developed jointly, including scientific peer review and an integrated acquisition policy. The aeronautical research plan outlined in Section 4 focuses on advancing technologies for military and civil aircraft to enhance US competitiveness. Within 180 days of the enactment of this Act, the Administrator and the Secretary, with input from the advisory committee, must submit a national aeronautical research plan to Congress outlining research and development goals for the next 5 years starting in fiscal year 1993. The plan aims to enhance public and private aeronautical technology development, involve private defense contractors in transitioning to the civilian sector, and transfer government-developed technologies to the private sector to boost economic strength and competitiveness. The national aeronautical research plan, to be submitted to Congress within 180 days of the Act's enactment, includes detailed objectives, cost estimates, manpower levels, and project descriptions for the first year. It also outlines total costs for major projects in the following years, a 5-year schedule for decreasing Federal contributions, and the Federal agency contributions. The plan must be updated annually. The national aeronautical research plan must be updated annually to reflect changes in global aviation technologies and US competitiveness. SEC. 5. ADVISORY COMMITTEE. Within 90 days of enactment, an Aeronautical Research Advisory Committee will be established by the Administrator and the Secretary. The committee's purposes include providing advice on the aeronautical research program, advising on research plans, and evaluating technologies for dual-use development. The Aeronautical Research Advisory Committee will consist of up to 20 members appointed by the Administrator and the Secretary, who are not affiliated with NASA or the Department of Defense. Members will be selected based on their qualifications and expertise, representing universities, corporations, associations, industry, and other federal agencies. The committee's responsibilities include developing dual-use technologies, making recommendations for future technology needs, proposing long-term research requirements, and assessing international competition. The Aeronautical Research Advisory Committee consists of industry representatives appointed by the Administrator and the Secretary. The chairperson must have expertise in military and civil aeronautical research. Subordinate committees can be established for specific research areas. The Administrator provides support staff and necessary resources for the committee's operations. The Administrator appoints industry representatives to the Aeronautical Research Advisory Committee, with the chairperson having expertise in aeronautical research. Subordinate committees can be formed for specific research areas, and the Administrator provides necessary support for the committee's operations. The advisory committee is exempt from termination under the Federal Advisory Committee Act. SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS. The Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is referred to as the \"Administrator\", the Aeronautical Research Advisory Committee established under section 5 is referred to as the \"advisory committee\", and the Secretary of Defense is referred to as the \"Secretary\"."
