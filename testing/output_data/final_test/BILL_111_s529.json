The Act defines CITES as the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, and conservation as methods necessary to ensure the long-term viability of rare felid or canid species in the wild. This includes maintenance, management, protection, and restoration of rare felid or rare canid habitat, research and monitoring, law enforcement, community outreach and education, conflict resolution initiatives, and strengthening the capacity of local communities, governmental agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and other institutions to implement conservation programs. The term \"Fund\" refers to the Great Cats and Rare Canids Conservation Fund established by section 4(a), and the term \"IUCN Red List\" refers to the IUCN Red List. The term \"IUCN Red List\" refers to the Red List of Threatened Species Maintained by the World Conservation Union.

The purpose of the project proposals is to conserve rare felids and canids by enhancing compliance with laws, developing scientific information on habitat and population trends, and monitoring ecological characteristics. The project proposals aim to conserve rare felids and canids by promoting cooperative projects, ensuring long-term conservation, and giving preference to projects with matching funds. Each recipient of assistance for a project must submit periodic reports to the Secretary, containing necessary information for evaluating progress and success.
