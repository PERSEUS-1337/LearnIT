    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Consumers' Home Improvement Protection Act\" and aims to prevent fraud in rehabilitation loan programs. Section 203(k) of the National Housing Act is amended to prevent fraud in loan insurance programs by prohibiting any identity-of-interest between parties involved in the loan, including the borrower, lender, consultants, real estate agents, property inspectors, and appraisers. The Secretary will set standards for nonprofit organizations to participate in the program, including disclosing their taxpayer ID and proof of being a tax-exempt 501(c) organization with a board of directors who do not receive compensation or have personal financial interests. The organization participating in the rehabilitation project must have no personal financial interest, submit financial statements for the past 2 years prepared by an independent party, limit the number of insured loans to 10 per organization, and post a bond. The organization involved in the rehabilitation project must post a completion insurance bond and be certified by the Secretary to participate in the program. Lenders are prohibited from disbursing the final loan payment without written affirmation from the borrower. The Secretary requires consultants involved in loan activities to be certified as trained and competent. Contractors working on loans over $25,000 must meet qualification standards set by the Secretary. Contractors or individuals performing rehabilitation activities financed by loans over $25,000 must be certified by a nationally recognized organization, licensed by the state or local government, or bonded as required by the Secretary. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development must submit a report to Congress within 60 days on nonprofit organizations participating in the rehabilitation loan program. The report will assess their involvement, analyze the impact of their exclusion from the program, and explore alternative financing options. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development must issue final regulations and administrative orders within 120 days to implement the provisions of this Act and its amendments."
