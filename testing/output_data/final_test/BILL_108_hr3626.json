Congress authorizes the establishment of the trail on publicly owned lands, with administration based on trail-related resources meeting specified criteria. Congress authorizes the establishment of El Camino Real de los Tejas national historic trail on privately owned lands with the owner's voluntary consent through certification agreements. Certification agreements for the El Camino Real de los Tejas national historic trail are not legally binding and can be terminated at any time. If land ownership changes at a certified site, the certification becomes invalid unless the new owner agrees to a new agreement.
