CREDIT TO HOLDERS OF QUALIFIED BROWNFIELDS CLEANUP BONDS\" is added to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, providing a credit to holders of qualified brownfields cleanup bonds. The new section \"SEC. 30B. CREDIT TO HOLDERS OF QUALIFIED BROWNFIELDS CLEANUP BONDS\" in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows taxpayers holding qualified brownfields cleanup bonds to receive a credit against their tax liability. The credit amount is 25 percent of the annual credit determined for the bond, based on the applicable credit rate. The applicable credit rate for qualified brownfields cleanup bonds is determined based on the average market yield on long-term corporate debt obligations. If a bond is issued within a 3-month period ending on a credit allowance date, the credit amount is prorated for that period. A qualified brownfields cleanup bond is defined as a bond issued with 95% or more of the proceeds used for hazardous substance abatement at a contaminated site, issued by a State or local government within the site's jurisdiction, designated for this purpose, and with a term not exceeding 15 years. The maximum aggregate face amount of bonds issued in a calendar year for brownfields cleanup is limited to $100,000,000 for 2002 and $150,000,000 for 2003. The allocation of this limitation among states is determined by the Secretary of the Treasury. Unused limitation can be carried over to the following year. The limitation amount for brownfields cleanup bonds issued in a calendar year is allocated among states by the Secretary of the Treasury. Any unused limitation can be carried over to the following year. If the allocated amount exceeds the bonds issued, the limitation amount for the state in the next year is increased by the excess. A bond must reserve any increase in real property tax revenues for debt service on the bond to be considered a qualified brownfields cleanup bond. The credit allowed under subsection (a) for any taxable year is limited by the sum of the regular tax liability plus the tax imposed by section 55, minus the credits allowable under part IV of subchapter A. Any excess credit can be carried over to the following year. The excess credit for a taxable year can be carried over to the next year and added to the credit allowable under subsection (a). Definitions for terms like 'credit allowance date', 'bond', 'State', and 'qualified contaminated site' are provided in this section. The Environmental Protection Agency administrator defines 'hazardous substance' and outlines provisions for gross income inclusion of credits allowed under this section. Qualified brownfields cleanup bonds held by regulated investment companies can allow shareholders to claim the credit. Ownership separation of qualified brownfields cleanup bonds may be permitted under regulations. Ownership separation of qualified brownfields cleanup bonds allows for the transfer of entitlement to the credit under this section.

Reporting to corporations is required for such interest, with specific subsections applied. The Secretary may prescribe necessary regulations for this purpose.
