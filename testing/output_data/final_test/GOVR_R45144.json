    "content": "Many public transportation agencies in the United States are experiencing a decline in ridership, except for the New York area. Despite investments in transit infrastructure, factors like low gas prices and the popularity of telework and ridesourcing services are contributing to this trend. Future technological advancements like autonomous vehicles could further impact transportation mobility. The federal government supports public transportation through funding and grants for capital projects. Recent trends show a decline in national transit ridership, except for a modest increase in the New York City region. This has implications for future federal policy on transportation. National transit ridership has declined over the past 10 years, with the New York region accounting for about 40% of ridership. Excluding New York, national ridership decreased by 7%. Major urban areas like Los Angeles, Washington, DC, Miami, and Atlanta saw lower ridership in 2016 compared to 2006. Los Angeles and New York accounted for significant ridership losses during the period analyzed. Between 2006 and 2016, national transit ridership declined, with New York accounting for 40% of the losses. Other major cities like Los Angeles, Washington, DC, Chicago, Miami, Philadelphia, and Boston also experienced decreases in ridership. Buses were the main mode of transit in 2016, providing over half of all trips. While bus ridership declined, rail ridership, especially in the New York region, saw growth. Excluding New York, buses provided twice as many trips as rail services. The increase in rail ridership was attributed to the opening of new rail systems and lines, although this did not necessarily boost overall transit ridership. The building of new rail systems, often targeting wealthier riders, can harm lower-income bus-dependent populations. Restructuring bus routes for new rail lines and raising bus fares may lead to decreased ridership. National transit ridership declined between 2006 and 2016, with New York accounting for a significant portion of the losses. Public transportation ridership in the United States is relatively low compared to European countries due to the cheap cost of owning and operating a personal vehicle. Factors such as the price of gasoline also impact transit ridership changes. Research shows that gasoline prices are a key factor influencing transit ridership, with a drop in gasoline prices leading to a decrease in ridership. The availability of personal vehicles also plays a role, with a greater share of households owning a vehicle resulting in less demand for public transportation. The share of households without a car has decreased over the years, while the number of vehicles per household has increased. A survey by the U.S. Department of Transportation showed a decline in car-less households from 21% to 9% between 1969 and 2009, with the average number of vehicles per household rising from 1.16 to 1.86. In southern California, vehicle access has grown significantly, particularly among groups like foreign-born households, potentially impacting transit ridership. Recent data suggests a possible increase in car-less households. The share of carless households has slightly increased over the years, with a survey by DOT showing an increase from 8.1% to 8.7% between 2001 and 2009. More recent data suggests that carless households averaged 9.1% between 2011 and 2015. Factors contributing to this trend include a drop in driver licensing among younger age groups and the rise of shared-use mobility like bikesharing and ridesourcing. The impact of ridesourcing on transit ridership is uncertain, as it may complement or substitute for transit in different ways. Ridesourcing companies provide first mile/last mile service for transit users and complement public transit by filling gaps in service. Surveys in San Francisco and other major cities show that ridesourcing both substitutes for and complements transit, with some evidence of a 6% drop in transit use among ridesourcing users. The rise of ridesourcing complements public transit by providing trips in underserved areas and allowing urban dwellers to live without a personal vehicle. Changes in travel behavior include a shift towards ridesourcing in cities like New York and Philadelphia, potentially impacting transit ridership. Additionally, the increase in telecommuting and the growth of public bikesharing schemes are influencing transportation choices. The rise of public bikesharing schemes and private bicycling, along with improved infrastructure like bike lanes, have influenced transportation choices. While some individuals may opt for biking over transit, bikesharing also facilitates access to transit stations. Studies show mixed results on the impact of bikesharing on public transit usage, with some cities like Minneapolis seeing an increase in transit use among bikeshare users. Many transit systems now offer bike racks on buses for a multimodal commute option. Service supply variables, such as fares, service frequency, and safety, play a significant role in public transportation ridership. The factors influencing public transportation ridership include fares, service frequency, safety, and geographic coverage. Studies suggest that increasing service frequencies can attract more riders than improving access to stations. Fares also play a role, with higher-income residents considering cost compared to other travel options, while lower-income residents may choose slower modes if prices are too high. The supply of public transportation services, including capacity and fares, has shown mixed evidence of general problems. Nationally, transit service supply has increased over time, with capacity-adjusted vehicle miles growing for buses and rail. Public transportation fares per trip have generally risen faster than inflation. Service supply problems have contributed to declines in ridership in some areas, with safety and operational deficiencies being key factors. Service supply problems, including safety and operational deficiencies, have led to service disruptions at the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, impacting subway service. This has resulted in a decline in ridership, with bus ridership decreasing by 6% and rail ridership by 20%. Similar infrastructure-related disruptions in New York have also contributed to a recent decline in ridership. Failure to adjust service in response to changing travel patterns has been blamed for these declines. The decline in transit ridership during good economic times can be attributed to the perception that transit is inferior to driving, as household incomes increase and car ownership becomes more manageable. Evidence shows that restructuring bus routes in cities like Houston and Seattle has led to ridership increases. Additionally, higher residential and employment density is associated with higher transit ridership. Some communities promote transit-oriented development to support transit ridership, but urban density changes slowly and may not reverse recent declines. The relationship between density and transit use is complex, influenced by factors like household income and vehicle availability. While some areas see inner-city population growth, overall transit ridership decline persists. The inner-city population growth in metropolitan areas like New York, Washington, DC, and San Francisco has been significant. Cities grew faster than suburbs between 2010 and 2015, but this trend may have ended in 2016. Job growth in cities outpaced suburbs between 2007 and 2011, but it is uncertain if this trend will continue. Factors like race, ethnicity, age, and immigrant status impact transit ridership, with recent immigrants using transit more than native-born individuals, although this usage decreases over time. The decline in transit ridership in Los Angeles and nationwide may be linked to the decrease in new lawful permanent residents and unauthorized immigrants between 2006 and 2016. Factors affecting transit demand include population growth, public commitment to transit, gas prices, highway congestion, parking costs, and fuel taxes. The success of public transportation relies on factors like fares, speed, reliability, and coverage, with funding from federal, state, and local sources playing a crucial role. Service improvements can be achieved by reconfiguring bus routes, increasing frequency, and implementing dedicated bus lanes and technology for faster travel. The U.S. resident population is expected to increase by 26 million in the next 10 years and 48 million in the next 20 years. Southern and western cities like Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, and Phoenix are projected to rise in urban area rankings. Small and medium-sized places in the South and West with low transit use are expected to be the fastest-growing urban areas. Job dispersion across suburbs with low employment density continues despite some major employers seeking locations well served by transit. The growth of low-density employment may limit population growth's impact on transit ridership. Ridesourcing companies are currently subsidizing their services, potentially affecting demand for public transportation. Transit agencies cooperating with ridesourcing companies for first mile/last mile trips may face challenges if prices increase in the future. The introduction of driverless vehicle technology could have significant implications. The introduction of driverless vehicle technology is a major unknown factor for future public transportation ridership. Estimates vary on when fully autonomous vehicles will be in urban use, but it may take decades for them to become widespread. Driverless taxis could offer cheaper service by eliminating labor costs, benefiting those unable to drive like children, the elderly, and the disabled. The deployment of autonomous vehicles and driverless taxis may increase vehicle trips and reduce traditional transit ridership. While autonomous vehicles could improve road efficiency and safety, their widespread use might worsen traffic congestion in large cities, leading to a need for shared-ride services. Traditional transit buses could adopt driverless technology for cost savings, with on-demand microtransit services likely to be provided by small buses and vans. Pilot projects for microtransit are already underway in various cities, along with ridesourcing companies experimenting with shared-ride services. Companies are experimenting with shared-ride services as road space is limited in dense cities. Autonomous vehicles may make accessing rail service easier and cheaper. Overall, autonomous vehicles will reduce travel costs, shifting demand from rail to road. Travel time may become less of a concern for motorists with autonomous vehicles allowing for other activities while traveling. This could make living in low-density areas more attractive in transportation terms, impacting the thriving of transit, especially rail transit, in such places. The federal government is involved in public transportation provision in two main ways. The federal government provides funding for public transportation and plays a significant role in building new transit systems through the Capital Investment Grant program. The future of public transportation ridership is tied to federal funding levels, with less funding leading to reduced service and lower ridership. The federal government's funding for public transportation is crucial for maintaining ridership levels. Currently, most federal funding is distributed based on formulas loosely related to ridership, but an alternative approach could tie funding to changes in ridership or productivity, incentivizing transit agencies to improve. Federal funding for public transportation is crucial for maintaining ridership levels. An alternative approach could tie funding to changes in ridership or productivity, incentivizing transit agencies to improve their performance and innovate. However, there are concerns that focusing exclusively on ridership may neglect serving isolated areas with transit-dependent populations. Small transit agencies receive federal operating assistance, but larger urbanized areas can only use federal funds for capital expenses or maintenance. Greater federal support for transit operations could expand ridership and improve service, productivity, and asset condition. Operating support in the 1970s allowed transit agencies to maintain higher service levels but caused productivity decline, mainly due to increased costs. Productivity issues also stem from providing service in low-demand areas, which could be addressed with incentives funding. The impact of operating support on asset condition is unclear, with potential for a faster decline in capital assets due to agencies prioritizing day-to-day needs over asset renewal. The uncertainty surrounding the introduction of autonomous vehicles has made it challenging to forecast ridership for rail systems designed to operate for many years. The use of autonomous vehicles could either increase demand for rail transit by shuttling passengers to and from stations in low-density areas or decrease demand by making it more convenient for people in high-density areas to travel by car. The outcome may depend on government measures to regulate autonomous vehicle use. The uncertainty surrounding autonomous vehicles may impact transit systems' long-term capital investments and federal funding programs. The focus of future federal funding may shift towards buses, which are more flexible than rail systems. If demand for traditional transit service declines, there may be pressure to shift towards other shared-ride services. There may be pressure to shift public subsidies from traditional transit services to on-demand shared autonomous vehicle services, which could help mitigate congestion and emissions. Subsidizing autonomous vehicle services for specific groups with limited mobility, such as the disabled, elderly, and low-income populations, could reduce the need for expensive transit services like paratransit. Federal funding of on-demand shared-ride services, whether publicly or privately operated, raises issues of competition, access by disadvantaged groups, and operating support. Federal support for privately operated shared-mobility services is currently allowed in certain circumstances. Federal funding for on-demand shared autonomous vehicle services is currently limited but could be expanded to include tax-subsidized commuter benefits. The Capital Investment Grant (CIG) program supports the construction and expansion of fixed-guideway transit systems, including transit rail, bus rapid transit, and ferry systems. Funding for the program comes from the U.S. Treasury's general fund and is essential for transit agencies to undertake major capital projects that would otherwise be unfeasible for local governments and transit agencies to finance alone. Supporters argue that the growing demand for CIG funds shows its success, while critics believe it leads to building expensive fixed-guideway infrastructure instead of improving bus service. There have been no comprehensive benefit-cost studies of completed CIG projects to evaluate the program. Research shows varying benefit/cost ratios among systems, with some rail transit lines built with federal support having low ridership. A study identified subway systems in San Francisco and New York City as having the largest net benefits, while systems in Buffalo and operated by New Jersey Transit have high net costs. If the full promise of autonomous vehicles is realized, the benefits of rail in smaller cities may decline. One policy option is to redirect CIG funding to larger cities like New York, Chicago, and Washington, DC, to increase ridership. This could lead to a substantial increase in national transit ridership in the short to medium term. The cost of car ownership in the US is low compared to other countries. The cost of car ownership and use in the United States is low compared to other highly developed countries. Highway user fees cover about 60% of the cost of highway infrastructure, with the rest coming from general funds and other sources. Economists suggest that raising user fees on automobiles could make public transit more attractive due to external costs of driving like congestion and air pollution. Raising user fees on automobiles, such as vehicle registration fees and parking charges, could make public transit more appealing. Options at the federal level include raising the federal fuels tax, implementing a mileage-based user charge, and promoting tolling, including congestion pricing."
