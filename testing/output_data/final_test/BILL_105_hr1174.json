    "content": "The Act titled \"United States Efficient Currency Act of 1997\" includes findings. The Government's inventory of Susan B. Anthony $1 coins has declined significantly, demonstrating the need for a dollar coin in various industries. The design of the Susan B. Anthony coin is not well-suited due to its similarity to the quarter dollar. The Secretary of the Treasury is required to mint Susan B. Anthony dollar coins to meet commerce demands. To combat counterfeiting, a program to redesign all US currency is underway, with new design Federal reserve notes being issued at intervals. The $1 Federal reserve notes are rarely counterfeited and will cost over 4 cents each to print, lasting only about 17 months. In contrast, newly designed $1 coins will cost around 8 cents each and last at least 30 years. Over the next 30 years, replacing $1 bills with coins will save taxpayers billions in costs. The $1 bill has the same purchasing power as a quarter did in 1970. The $1 coins will cost around 8 cents each and last at least 30 years, saving taxpayers billions in costs over the next 30 years. The dollar coin will be golden in color, have distinctive features, be minted in the US, and have anti-counterfeiting properties similar to current US coins. The Secretary of the Treasury will choose designs for both sides of the coin. Before the Government's current inventory of $1 coins bearing the likeness of Susan B. Anthony is depleted, the Secretary of the Treasury will circulate new $1 coins with approved designs. The Secretary may also include these coins in numismatic sets produced by the United States Mint. Additionally, the Secretary will increase capacity at US Mint facilities. The Secretary of the Treasury will increase capacity at United States Mint facilities to replace $1 Federal reserve notes.
