    "content": "The Administrative Procedure Act of 1946 established standards for formal and informal rulemaking procedures. Informal rulemaking, also known as \"notice and comment\" rulemaking, is the most common type. Agencies must publish a notice of proposed rulemaking, take comments, publish a final rule, and provide a 30-day waiting period. Agencies can bypass these requirements for good cause. The APA established rulemaking procedures including notice-and-comment requirements. Additional requirements include the Paperwork Reduction Act, Regulatory Flexibility Act, Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, and Congressional Review Act. The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to overturn federal regulations, while the Information Quality Act (IQA) requires agencies to ensure the quality of disseminated information. Executive orders and OMB guidelines also provide requirements for agencies in the rulemaking process. Regulatory actions at proposed and final rule stages require agencies to assess costs and benefits, including economically significant regulations. Agencies must justify the benefits of a rule with its costs, following OMB Circular A-4 guidelines. Executive orders and OMB directives provide further guidance for agencies in issuing regulations. The RAA would change or enact into law various requirements agencies must follow when issuing regulations, including those outlined in executive orders, OMB directives, and agency statutes. The bill would also impact existing rulemaking requirements and case law. The report will analyze the main provisions of the RAA and compare them to current requirements and case law. The bill uses the APA's definition of an agency. The RAA uses the APA's definition of an agency and imposes additional requirements on independent regulatory agencies. While some parts of E.O. 12866 do not apply to independent regulatory agencies, others such as preparing an agenda of regulations and a Regulatory Plan do apply. This lack of requirement for review provides independence from presidential control. The RAA imposes additional requirements on independent regulatory agencies, providing independence from presidential control. Independent agencies like the Social Security Administration are included in OIRA's review processes under E.O. 12866. Certain statutes exempt independent regulatory agencies from specific rulemaking requirements. The RAA does not extend UMRA's application to independent agencies, but similar requirements in the RAA would apply if enacted. The Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA) would impose additional procedures on \"major\" rules issued by independent regulatory agencies, including advance notices of proposed rulemaking, longer comment periods, retrospective review requirements, and specific timeframes for rulemaking proceedings. These requirements differ from the procedures for other rules under the APA. The Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA) imposes additional procedures on \"major\" rules issued by independent regulatory agencies, including advance notices of proposed rulemaking and specific criteria for defining a \"major rule.\" The Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA) defines a \"major rule\" based on an annual cost of $100 million or more, adjusted for inflation, with additional criteria similar to the Congressional Review Act (CRA). The RAA includes rules likely to impose significant costs on multiple sectors of the economy, expanding the scope compared to the CRA. Determinations of \"major rules\" under both acts are made by the OIRA Administrator, with CRA determinations not subject to judicial review, while the RAA is silent on this aspect. The RAA is silent on judicial review of determinations by the OIRA Administrator. The definition of a \"major rule\" in the RAA is similar to E.O. 12866, including actions likely to have significant economic effects. E.O. 12866 considers factors like the environment and public health, not included in the RAA or CRA. The RAA introduces the concept of \"high-impact\" rules, defined as those likely to impose an annual cost on the economy of $1,000,000,000 or more. It is unclear if determinations by the OIRA Administrator are subject to judicial review. High-impact rules require additional procedures compared to non-high-impact rules, including ANPRM issuance, retrospective review, and formal rulemaking procedures. The RAA defines guidance documents as agency statements that set forth policies on statutory or regulatory issues. Formal rulemaking procedures are rarely used and only required when Congress mandates a rulemaking \"on the record.\" The RAA defines \"major guidance\" as any guidance likely to have significant economic costs, adverse effects on competition, employment, innovation, or multiple sectors of the economy. The RAA defines \"major guidance\" as any guidance likely to have significant economic costs and impacts on multiple sectors of the economy, focusing on annual costs of $100 million or more and major increases in costs or prices for various groups. The OMB Bulletin defines \"significant guidance documents\" as those with potential annual economic effects of $100 million or more or significant impacts on the economy, sectors, productivity, competition, jobs, environment, public health, safety, or governments. Economically significant guidance documents must be issued in draft form for public comment, with exceptions. The RAA also considers factors like economic impacts and effects on various sectors when defining \"major guidance.\" Subsection (C) in the RAA includes factors like employment, investment, innovation, and competitiveness of US enterprises, excluding environment, public health, or safety. Subsection (D) in the RAA covers rules with significant impacts on multiple sectors of the economy, without a clear definition of \"significant.\" Both RAA and OMB Bulletin require additional procedures for major or significant guidance documents, including cost-benefit analysis and consideration of alternatives. The RAA would require agencies to follow new steps in the rulemaking process, perform cost-benefit analyses, and examine regulatory alternatives. It includes procedures for major guidance documents, agency approval, public access, and comment. The RAA is unclear on judicial review of determinations by the OIRA Administrator. The RAA introduces new requirements for agencies in the rulemaking process, including cost-benefit analyses and consideration of regulatory alternatives. It also mandates specific \"Rule Making Considerations\" for agencies to follow. The RAA introduces new requirements for agencies in the rulemaking process, including cost-benefit analyses and consideration of regulatory alternatives. It compares the \"Rule Making Considerations\" of the proposed RAA with the \"Principles of Regulation\" from E.O. 12866. The RAA would require agencies to consider the legal authority under which a rule may be proposed. The RAA introduces new requirements for agencies in the rulemaking process, including cost-benefit analyses and consideration of regulatory alternatives. Agencies must consider their legal authority for rulemaking, which may be based on a general grant of authority from Congress or a specific statutory requirement. The RAA also mandates agencies to consider other statutory considerations in initiating a rulemaking. The RAA introduces new requirements for agencies in the rulemaking process, including considering statutory considerations for proposing a rule or taking other agency action. This could include directives, advisory opinions, or appropriations riders. E.O. 12866 also outlines principles for agencies to follow in regulation, including seeking views and minimizing burdens on state, local, and tribal entities. The proposed RAA introduces new requirements for agencies in the rulemaking process, emphasizing the need to consider the specific nature and significance of the problem a rule intends to address. This aligns with E.O. 12866's principles of minimizing burdens on state, local, and tribal governments and seeking to harmonize federal regulations with state and local laws. The RAA introduces new requirements for agencies in the rulemaking process, emphasizing the need to consider the problem a rule aims to address and potential alternatives, in alignment with E.O. 12866's principles. The RAA introduces new requirements for agencies in the rulemaking process, emphasizing the need to consider alternatives forms of regulation, specify performance objectives, and provide economic incentives to encourage desired behavior. This aligns with E.O. 12866's principles of identifying and assessing available alternatives to direct regulation. Under the RAA, agencies must consider alternatives to direct regulation and assess the costs and benefits of potential rules, including impacts on jobs, economic growth, innovation, and competitiveness. They should also aim to increase cost-effectiveness, incentivize innovation, and improve consistency and predictability in enforcement and compliance. The proposed RAA emphasizes the importance of designing regulations in a cost-effective manner, considering incentives for innovation, consistency, predictability, enforcement and compliance costs, flexibility, distributive impacts, and equity. It also requires agencies to assess both the costs and benefits of regulations before implementation. The RAA emphasizes designing cost-effective regulations, considering innovation incentives, predictability, and compliance costs. It requires agencies to assess costs and benefits before implementation, unlike current executive orders. The RAA emphasizes cost-effective regulations and innovation incentives, unlike current executive orders. OMB Circular A-4 highlights the importance of considering distributive impacts and equity in regulatory actions. The RAA would introduce new considerations to the regulatory process, potentially impacting how agencies assess distributional effects of rules. Independent regulatory agencies may have their own requirements for considerations in their establishing statutes. The RAA would add an ANPRM requirement for major rules. The Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA) would introduce new requirements for agencies to issue Advance Notices of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRMs) for major rules, high-impact rules, and rules involving novel legal or policy issues arising from statutory mandates. The RAA does not provide a clear definition of what constitutes a novel legal or policy issue, potentially leading to broad application. ANPRMs for such rules would need to identify the reasons for adopting a novel legal or policy position. There is uncertainty whether agencies with separate ANPRM requirements would have to comply with both sets of rules under the RAA. The Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA) introduces new requirements for agencies to issue Advance Notices of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRMs) for major, high-impact, or novel legal or policy issue rules. ANPRMs must be published in the Federal Register at least 90 days before the agency publishes a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), with a minimum 60-day comment period. The RAA outlines specific requirements for ANPRMs, including a statement of the problem, data and evidence, and legal authority for the rule. The Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA) introduces new requirements for agencies to issue Advance Notices of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRMs) for major, high-impact, or novel legal or policy issue rules. ANPRMs must be published in the Federal Register at least 90 days before the agency publishes a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), with a minimum 60-day comment period. The RAA expands and changes the notice and comment procedures currently found in the APA, stating that agencies shall publish ANPRMs but does not specifically require the publication of NPRMs in the Federal Register. The Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA) requires agencies to issue Advance Notices of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRMs) for major, high-impact, or novel legal or policy issue rules. ANPRMs must be published in the Federal Register at least 90 days before the agency publishes a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), with a minimum 60-day comment period. The RAA does not specify where the agency should publish its NPRM, but requires consultation with the OIRA Administrator before issuing a proposed rule. Under E.O. 12866, agencies must submit \"significant\" proposed rules and final rules to OIRA, along with a cost-benefit assessment. The Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA) requires regulatory actions with significant economic impact or legal/policy issues to be submitted to OIRA. If enacted, the RAA would change the current submission requirements in three ways. The Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA) would change submission requirements by requiring consultation with OIRA for all rules, not just significant ones, and by including all agencies, including independent regulatory agencies. The interpretation of the requirement to consult with OIRA is unclear, as agencies currently send rules and analyses for review and compliance with suggested changes by OIRA. The Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA) may issue a \"return letter\" to agencies, halting rulemaking proceedings. This could increase presidential control over agency rulemaking and impact independent regulatory agencies not currently covered by OIRA review requirements. The Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA) could decrease agency independence by giving OIRA the authority to halt rulemaking proceedings. The RAA's proposed requirements for NPRM notices align with APA standards, mandating inclusion of rule details. The Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA) requires NPRM notices to include a description of information known to the agency on the subject and issues of the proposed rule, as well as a reasoned preliminary determination of the need for the rule. This description must cover four types of information, including a summary of information known to the agency, additional information obtained from interested persons, preliminary risk assessments, and data identification. The Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA) expands requirements for agencies to publish a summary of regulatory impact analysis, including data, studies, and evidence used in proposing a rule. It also extends cost-benefit analysis requirements to all rules, not just \"significant\" ones, and to independent regulatory agencies. The Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA) extends cost-benefit analysis requirements to independent regulatory agencies, which are not currently covered under E.O. 12866. The RAA specifies that agencies must justify the costs of proposed rules by demonstrating that the benefits meet statutory objectives. Section 6(a)(3)(B) of E.O. 12866 requires agencies to assess costs and benefits for \"significant\" regulatory actions, providing a general assessment to OIRA. For \"economically significant\" rules, a full cost-benefit analysis is required, including an assessment of anticipated benefits such as promoting economic efficiency, enhancing health and safety, and protecting the environment. The curr_chunk discusses the assessment of costs and benefits for regulatory actions, including quantification of benefits and costs, analysis of alternatives, and consideration of impacts on the economy, private markets, health, safety, and the environment. The curr_chunk explains the requirements for regulatory impact analyses, including assessing impacts on small entities like small businesses and governmental jurisdictions under the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to assess the economic impact on small entities when formulating proposed rules. Agencies must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis if a rule is expected to significantly affect a substantial number of small entities. This analysis must be published in the Federal Register. Additionally, agencies must publish impact statements for proposed rules that may result in expenditures of $100 million or more by the private sector or governments. The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to assess the economic impact on small entities when formulating proposed rules. Agencies must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis if a rule is expected to significantly affect a substantial number of small entities. This analysis must be published in the Federal Register. Additionally, agencies must publish impact statements for proposed rules that may result in expenditures of $100 million or more by the private sector or governments. UMRA requires agencies to prepare a written statement containing a qualitative and quantitative assessment of anticipated costs and benefits, as well as the effect of the Federal mandate on health, safety, and the natural environment. If enacted, the RAA would require agencies to include in their notice of proposed rulemaking a detailed discussion of the alternatives to the proposed rule, including costs and benefits, statutory objectives, and reasons for not selecting alternatives. The RAA provision would require agencies to provide more detailed information on alternative regulatory options than current requirements under E.O. 12866. This includes assessing costs and benefits of feasible alternatives and explaining why the planned regulatory action is preferred. The RAA provision mandates agencies to consider significant alternatives to proposed rules that minimize economic impact on small entities. UMRA requires agencies to identify and select the least costly regulatory alternative that achieves the rule's objectives. The Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA) would require agencies to assess if existing rules contribute to the problem being addressed and explain any proposed changes. This differs from Executive Order 12866, which lacks a similar requirement for publication of a statement with proposed rules. The RAA also aims to change disclosure procedures for information on consultations between OIRA and agencies. The Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA) requires OIRA to disclose information about regulatory reviews, meetings, and communications. It also mandates transparency from agencies, including making cost-benefit information public and identifying rule changes. The RAA would make all information used in formulating the NPRM public, but gives discretion to the President and OIRA Administrator on consultation information. The Regulatory Accountability Act mandates transparency by requiring agencies to disclose all documents and information prepared during the rulemaking process. The OIRA Administrator has discretion over what information is included in the docket for proposed rules. The OIRA Administrator has discretion over what to include in the docket for communications between OIRA and the agency, which could impact transparency in the rulemaking process. The RAA requires agencies to publish a \"notice of determination of other agency course\" if they choose not to issue an NPRM, including information on costs and benefits and the alternative response chosen by the agency. The RAA requires agencies to publish a \"notice of determination of other agency course\" if they choose not to issue an NPRM. This notice includes information on costs, benefits, and the alternative response chosen by the agency. The RAA mandates agencies to disclose information used in their decision-making process, including communications with OIRA. Even if a rule is not pursued, all information considered must be published. The RAA also sets minimum comment periods of 120 days for major rules and 60 days for others, a departure from the APA. The APA does not have a minimum time period for comments, but individual statutes and Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 recommend a comment period of at least 60 days. Agencies have discretion on whether to include oral presentations during the comment period. The RAA allows the public to petition for a hearing if evidence used by the agency fails to comply with the Information Quality Act. The agency must grant a petition presenting evidence that fails to comply with the Information Quality Act and hold a hearing within 30 days. The RAA requires offering oral presentations for comments during the hearing for high-impact rules. Formal rulemaking requirements apply when rules are required to be made on the record after an agency hearing. Formal rulemaking procedures require agencies to conduct trial-like proceedings, allowing parties to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. These proceedings must be overseen by an agency official or Administrative Law Judge, who can administer oaths and issue subpoenas. Ex parte communications are prohibited, and rules must be supported by substantial evidence. Rules issued through formal rulemaking are exempt from Executive Order 12866 requirements. The Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA) excludes rules issued under formal rulemaking proceedings from its requirements. If formal rulemaking is required by a statute or chosen by the agency, procedures for a petition for an IQA hearing would not apply. High-impact rule hearings would also not require comments outside of formal rulemaking procedures. A high-impact rule hearing under the RAA is limited to specific issues of fact. The IQA requires federal agencies to establish administrative mechanisms for correcting information that does not comply with OMB guidelines. APA public comment procedures can be used to address information quality complaints. The OMB memorandum advises agencies to respond promptly to information quality complaints and issue a written response within 60 days. The IQA does not mention judicial review, and the RAA proposes allowing petitions under APA hearing requirements to address non-compliant information in proposed rules. The RAA proposes three options for agencies responding to petitions regarding non-compliant information in proposed rules: exclude the information, grant the petition if a prima facie case is presented, or deny the petition. If granted, a hearing must be held within 30 days, with a decision made within 60 days. The agency must also publish a notice in the Federal Register at least 15 days before the hearing. The RAA proposes a 60-day decision timeframe for complaints and appeals, similar to OMB's suggested response time. It allows for judicial review of agency dispositions on issues considered and decided, but not until after judicial review of the agency's final action. There is no judicial review if a proposed rule is withdrawn based on a petition. If an individual does not petition for an IQA hearing, judicial review is not precluded for any claim based on the IQA. The APA does not define \"high-impact\" rules, so no specific hearing requirements exist for such rules. The RAA would create new hearing requirements for high-impact rules, based on existing APA formal rulemaking requirements. Agencies must hold a hearing after an NPRM, comments receipt, and IQA hearing, unless waived by all participants except the agency. Notice of the hearing must be published 45 days in advance, limited to six issues of fact. Participants may waive determination of issues such as the agency's factual support for a rule, cost-effectiveness of alternatives, meeting statutory objectives, additional benefits versus costs, compliance with IQA, and other relevant rulemaking issues. The Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA) would require agencies to consult with the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) before adopting a final rule, expanding the requirements for OIRA review for all agencies, including independent regulatory agencies. The Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA) would extend the consultation requirement to all agency rules, not just \"significant\" rules, and mandate that agencies base their decisions on the best scientific, technical, economic, and other evidence available. This aligns with the principles of E.O. 12866 and E.O. 13563, emphasizing the importance of using the best scientific information in regulatory decision-making. The Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA) would require agencies to adopt the \"least costly\" rule that meets \"relevant statutory objectives\" based on the best available science. Agencies may only adopt a more costly rule if the additional benefits justify the costs and are in the interests of public health, safety, or welfare. The Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA) directs agencies to choose the least costly option for meeting \"relevant statutory objectives\" based on the best available science. Agencies can deviate from this presumption but must justify the deviation. The decision rule allows for discretion in determining statutory objectives, with unclear guidance on how agencies would use this discretion. E.O. 12866 calls for regulations to impose the least burden on society while maximizing net benefits. The Regulatory Accountability Act directs agencies to choose the least costly option for meeting statutory objectives based on the best available science. This would shift the current presumption that agencies are required to select regulatory alternatives that maximize net benefits to primarily considering costs. The Regulatory Accountability Act would require agencies to include detailed explanations with final rules in the Federal Register, including a concise statement of the rule's basis and purpose, an explanation of the need for the rule, and a summary of any risk assessment or impact analysis. The Regulatory Accountability Act would mandate agencies to provide detailed explanations with final rules in the Federal Register, including a concise statement of the rule's basis and purpose, an explanation of the need for the rule, and a summary of any risk assessment or impact analysis. Additionally, agencies must justify the benefits meeting statutory objectives, discuss alternative options considered, address existing rules on the topic, and ensure evidence and information comply with the Information Quality Act. Under the Regulatory Accountability Act, agencies would be required to publish detailed explanations with final rules in the Federal Register, including a concise statement of the rule's basis and purpose, an explanation of the need for the rule, and a summary of any risk assessment or impact analysis. Additionally, agencies must justify the benefits meeting statutory objectives, discuss alternative options considered, address existing rules on the topic, and ensure evidence and information comply with the Information Quality Act. The RAA also mandates agencies to publish a plan for retrospective review of major or high-impact rules every ten years to determine their necessity, effectiveness, and cost-benefit analysis. Under the Regulatory Accountability Act, agencies must publish detailed explanations with final rules in the Federal Register, including a concise statement of the rule's basis and purpose, justification of benefits meeting statutory objectives, discussion of alternative options, and compliance with the Information Quality Act. The RAA also requires agencies to publish plans for retrospective reviews of major rules every ten years to assess their necessity, effectiveness, and cost-benefit analysis. Executive Orders 12866, 13563, and 13579 also implemented a general requirement for government-wide retrospective reviews to ensure the necessity and cost-effectiveness of existing rules. The Regulatory Accountability Act modifies exceptions to the APA's notice and comment procedures for interpretative rules, policy statements, and agency rules. The RAA exempts certain rules from ANPRM, NPRM, and high-impact rule hearing requirements, as well as final rule requirements like consultation with the OIRA Administrator. The Regulatory Accountability Act modifies exceptions to the APA's notice and comment procedures for interpretative rules, policy statements, and agency rules. The RAA exempts certain rules from ANPRM, NPRM, and high-impact rule hearing requirements, as well as final rule requirements like consultation with the OIRA Administrator. Additionally, the APA contains a good cause exception that allows an agency to issue a rule without notice and comment. The good cause exception allows agencies to issue rules without notice and comment, especially for interim rules under the APA. The RAA also includes a modified good cause exception for certain rule requirements. The Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA) introduces new procedures for exceptions like \"good cause\" for issuing rules without notice and comment. It includes exceptions for impracticability, public interest, national security, and unnecessary rules. Judicial review is available immediately upon publication of an interim rule, with the court considering all relevant documents and information. The RAA introduces new requirements for agencies' use of interim final rules. Agencies must comply with NPRM requirements, hearings for high-impact rules, and final determinations immediately upon publication of the interim rule. If these steps are not completed within specified timeframes, the interim rule will cease to have the effect of law. The RAA introduces new requirements for agencies' use of interim final rules, including compliance with NPRM requirements, hearings for high-impact rules, and immediate final determinations upon publication. If these steps are not completed within specified timeframes, the interim rule will cease to have the effect of law. The RAA also codifies examples of a good cause finding that notice and comment are \"unnecessary,\" and includes a modified version of \"direct final\" rulemaking for routine or noncontroversial rules. The RAA allows agencies to publish a final rule without notice and comment if no significant adverse comments are received within 60 days. If significant adverse comments are received, the final rule would be treated as a proposed rule and subject to additional requirements. The RAA requires formal rulemaking procedures for high-impact rule hearings and final rule determinations, including compliance with 5 U.S.C. Sections 556 and 557. It also maintains the APA's 30-day publication requirement for final rules to allow affected parties time to prepare. Exceptions to the 30-day rule include substantive rules, interpretative rules, and statements of policy. The RAA includes provisions for formal rulemaking procedures, exemptions from the 30-day waiting period for certain rules, and guidelines for cost-benefit analysis. OIRA is granted authority to issue guidance on assessing costs and benefits, with the analysis required to align with the economic impact of the rule. This could give OIRA significant discretion in implementation. OIRA could use substantial discretion in defining and applying the term \"rigor\" under the RAA. The OMB Circular A-4 provides best practices for agencies on economic analyses of rules. The RAA would make OIRA's guidelines into law and require agencies to comply with them, with judicial deference to OIRA's determinations. The RAA would require OIRA to issue guidelines on various topics, including coordination of rules to avoid inconsistencies, and how agencies should conduct rulemakings under the RAA's procedures. This provision would impact hybrid rulemaking statutes and ensure that rulemakings conform to other statutory requirements to the fullest extent allowed. The RAA would require OIRA to issue guidelines for IQA hearings and high-impact rule hearings, as well as guidelines for informal and formal rulemakings. Section 553(l) of the RAA mandates agencies to provide all information used in rulemaking proceedings in the rulemaking docket. The legislation would give OIRA and the President discretion over the materials included in the docket from their communications with the agency. The RAA would exempt rules concerning monetary policy from certain cost-benefit requirements, unlike the APA which does not have such an exemption. This exemption would include considerations for costs and benefits, cost-effectiveness, innovation, consistency, predictability, enforcement costs, and flexibility. The Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA) includes provisions for lower enforcement costs, compliance flexibility, and hearings for high-impact rules. It requires agencies to justify the benefits of proposed rules, consider alternatives, and adopt the least costly rule unless the additional benefits of a more costly rule are clearly justified. Monetary policy rules are exempt from certain cost-benefit requirements under the RAA. The Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA) exempts monetary policy rules from certain cost-benefit requirements, including justifying benefits, considering alternatives, and adopting the least costly rule unless additional benefits justify a more costly rule. The RAA also aims to incorporate guidance documents into the APA and create specific statutory provisions. The Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA) would incorporate guidance documents into the APA, requiring \"major guidance\" and guidance on novel legal or policy issues to follow specific requirements before issuance. Current APA procedures do not apply to interpretive rules or general statements of policy. The Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA) would require major guidance and guidance on novel legal or policy issues to undergo new procedures before issuance, as outlined in OMB's Final Bulletin on Agency Good Guidance Practices. The procedures include notice and comment for economically significant guidance documents, agency approval, restrictions on mandatory language, and provisions for public access and comment. The Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA) would require major guidance and guidance on novel legal or policy issues to undergo new procedures before issuance. The agency must make a reasoned determination, summarize evidence and data, identify costs and benefits, describe alternatives, and publish documentation electronically. OMB's Bulletin discusses consultations with the OIRA Administrator in exempting significant guidance documents. The Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA) would introduce new procedures for major guidance documents, including a consultation requirement with the OIRA Administrator to ensure guidance is reasonable, consistent with statutory provisions, and does not produce unjustified costs. The RAA also addresses public comments on economically significant guidance documents and emphasizes the importance of costs and benefits in issuing guidance. Legal concepts regarding guidance are also outlined in the RAA. The RAA introduces new procedures for major guidance documents, including consultation with the OIRA Administrator to ensure reasonableness and consistency with statutory provisions. Courts will determine if a general statement of policy is a legislative rule requiring APA notice-and-comment procedures on a case-by-case basis. OIRA is recognized as an expert on regulatory issues, although there is no specific authority for issuing guidelines on guidance documents. The RAA grants the OIRA Administrator authority to issue guidelines on agencies' major and other guidance documents, ensuring consistency with the law and regulations of other Federal agencies. The RAA requires agencies to issue guidance that is clear and minimizes uncertainty and litigation. It aligns with E.O. 12866's principles of regulation. The RAA also proposes changes to the hearing process for greater public access and transparency. The Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA) aims to increase transparency and public access in agency hearings. It would make transcripts and requests available electronically to parties and the public. Additionally, the RAA requires the inclusion of information from IQA and high-impact rule hearings in the decision record. Under the Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA), agencies must follow specific rulemaking requirements, including conducting formal hearings and considering costs and benefits. If a person petitions for a hearing on a major rule, the agency must grant the petition unless it would unreasonably delay the rulemaking process. The Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA) requires agencies to follow rulemaking requirements, including granting petitions for hearings on major rules unless it would unreasonably delay the process. The RAA exempts rules concerning monetary policy proposed or implemented by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee from this provision. The APA provides for judicial review of administrative action. The APA allows for judicial review of administrative action, including final agency actions subject to review. H.R. 3010 proposes modifications to the APA's provision on judicial review, specifying what constitutes a \"final agency action\" under the IQA for judicial review. This includes denials of correction requests, denials of appeals, and an agency's failure to grant requests. H.R. 3010 and S. 1606 propose modifications to the APA for judicial review, including defining \"final agency action\" under the IQA. They allow for immediate judicial review of interim rules without certain requirements, and codify judicial review of agency good cause determinations. S. 1606 and H.R. 3010 propose changes to the APA for judicial review, including prohibiting judicial review of agency determinations of good cause based on national security interests. S. 1606 also limits judicial review for rules other than major or high-impact rules, addressing the scope of review for agency actions. S. 1606 proposes changes to the APA for judicial review, including limiting judicial review for rules other than major or high-impact rules. It also requires a \"reasoned preliminary determination\" for proposed rules and discussion of alternatives in an NPRM. S. 1606 proposes changes to the APA for judicial review, including limiting judicial review for rules other than major or high-impact rules. It requires a \"reasoned preliminary determination\" for proposed rules and discussion of alternatives in an NPRM. The bill also allows judicial review of determinations regarding high-impact rules. The Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA) would modify the APA's provision for judicial review by adding the Information Quality Act. It would also make agency denials of information correction requests final agency actions, allowing for judicial review. The RAA would prohibit judicial deference to several agency actions under the APA. The Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA) would impact judicial deference to agency interpretations and determinations under the APA, prohibiting deference if agencies did not comply with rulemaking procedures. It would also address agency denials of petitions for extending issues in rule hearings and formal rulemaking provisions for abuse of discretion. The Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA) would impact judicial deference to agency interpretations under the APA, prohibiting deference if agencies did not comply with rulemaking procedures. Auer deference, which gives substantial deference to agency interpretations of their own ambiguous regulations, may not apply if the agency's interpretation merely parrots the statute. The RAA's prohibition on judicial deference to agency interpretations of agency rules without formal or informal rulemaking procedures could eliminate Auer deference. The Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA) would impact judicial deference to agency interpretations under the APA, prohibiting deference if agencies did not comply with rulemaking procedures. The RAA would eliminate Auer deference for agency interpretations that do not follow formal or informal rulemaking procedures. Additionally, courts could not defer to agency cost-benefit determinations or other economic assessments if the agency failed to conform to OIRA-established guidelines. This could lead to courts performing their own assessments if agencies do not comply with OIRA guidance. Furthermore, courts could not defer to agency determinations made in the adoption of an interim rule, potentially conflicting with proposed amendments to the APA's provision on reviewable agency actions. The proposed amendment to the APA's provision on reviewable agency actions would limit immediate judicial review to whether the agency abused its discretion in adopting an interim rule without compliance with specific sections. The Regulatory Accountability Act would eliminate judicial deference to agency guidance, potentially impacting courts' ability to consider an agency's expertise in interpreting statutes. In Mead Corporation v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc., the Court established a two-step test for judicial review of agency interpretations of statutes. If Congress has directly spoken to the issue, Chevron deference is not required, and the Court must follow Congress's intent. If Congress is silent or ambiguous, the Court defers to the agency's interpretation if it is reasonable. At Chevron step two, the Court defers to agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes if Congress is unclear. Mead Court specified that Chevron deference is warranted when Congress delegates authority to the agency to make rules with the force of law. This determination, known as Chevron step zero, involves assessing whether the agency has exercised its authority through notice-and-comment rulemaking or formal adjudication. The Court explained that agency interpretations may warrant Chevron deference if reached through formal means or indicated by congressional intent. In Barnhart v. Walton, Chevron deference was considered for longstanding agency interpretations based on factors like expertise, importance to statute administration, and careful consideration over time. Courts must determine the level of deference to give to informal agency procedures, based on whether they align more with Mead or Barnhart factors. If an agency's interpretation does not qualify for Chevron deference, it may still be respected to the extent it is persuasive under Skidmore v. Swift & Co. If Chevron deference does not apply, courts will still give some consideration to the agency's interpretation in certain cases. The Skidmore v. Swift & Co. case allows courts to give deference to agency interpretations based on their persuasive power. Courts consider factors like thoroughness, reasoning validity, and consistency in agency judgments. Agencies' specialized experience often leads to weight given to their interpretations. The APA lacks a definition for \"substantial evidence,\" which the Supreme Court has defined as relevant evidence. The RAA would define \"substantial evidence\" in a similar way to the Supreme Court, as relevant evidence that a reasonable mind would accept to support a conclusion. This definition would be added to chapter 7 of Title 5, United States Code, impacting APA standards for judicial review. The RAA would define \"substantial evidence\" as evidence that a reasonable mind would accept to support a conclusion, impacting APA standards for judicial review. The reviewing court would hold unlawful agency actions unsupported by substantial evidence in cases subject to specific statutes. The RAA's amendments would also allow for the evaluation of adjudications and formal rulemakings conducted under certain sections of the U.S. Code. The RAA would restrict its application to pending or completed rulemakings. Amendments under the RAA include changes to informal and formal rulemaking sections of the APA, definition of \"substantial evidence,\" limitations on court deference to agency determinations, and addition of court reviews for agency denials of petitions during high-impact rule hearings. The RAA would enact major changes to the current rulemaking process, including requiring agencies to adopt the \"least costly\" rule meeting \"relevant statutory objectives\" and adding court reviews for agency denials of petitions for hearings under the APA's formal rulemaking provisions. The Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA) would overhaul the current rulemaking process by adding judicial review for certain requirements, imposing new requirements on independent regulatory agencies, and impacting existing case law on judicial deference to agency interpretations. The Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA) would impose new requirements on rulemaking processes, including formal procedures for high-impact rules, ANPRMs for major rules, and cost-benefit analysis for guidance documents. It would also grant increased powers to the OIRA Administrator and enable IQA petitions to ensure compliance with the IQA. The Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA) would expand existing requirements in the rulemaking process, codify certain requirements from executive orders and OMB documents, and introduce new requirements. Supporters believe it would standardize the rulemaking process by enacting executive order requirements for OIRA review and cost-benefit analysis. Proponents also support expanding OIRA review and cost-benefit analyses to more rules and independent regulatory agencies for increased accountability. Opponents argue that the bill could make the rulemaking process more difficult to navigate and require more time. The Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA) would make the rulemaking process more difficult for agencies, requiring additional time to issue rules. New requirements such as hearings and longer comment periods would extend the process. The RAA would replace certain sections of the APA but not the requirements of the RFA or UMRA, adding more analyses for agencies to conduct. Increased judicial review could lead to more litigation. Enactment of the RAA could lead to uncertainty for regulators and regulated entities as courts interpret new provisions, potentially making it harder for agencies to meet deadlines and requiring more resources for additional cost-benefit analyses and rule reviews by OIRA. The Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA) could increase litigation and prolong rulemaking proceedings by requiring ANPRMs before NPRMs and longer comment periods. It may also impact the independence of regulatory agencies like the SEC and FCC. Independent regulatory agencies, such as the SEC, FCC, and Federal Reserve, have multi-member boards with regulatory authority vested in the board itself. The heads of these agencies can only be removed by the President for cause, providing insulation from presidential control. They also have structural elements like staggered terms and limits on political party representation to further prevent executive branch influence. These agencies are not subject to OIRA review and cost-benefit analysis requirements. The RAA would extend the major requirements of E.O. 12866 to independent regulatory agencies, requiring them to submit proposed and final rules to OIRA for review. This would align with the executive orders in place since 1981, allowing the President, through OMB, to have oversight over these agencies. Critics argue that OIRA consultation requirements could reduce agency independence, while supporters believe it would provide a necessary check on rulemaking. Independent regulatory agencies would be subject to cost-benefit analysis like other agencies under E.O. 12866, with 17 major rules issued in FY2010, mostly in the financial sector, lacking comprehensive cost-benefit assessments. OMB has encouraged independent regulatory agencies to use the best available techniques to quantify anticipated benefits and costs accurately. Critics argue that OIRA's examination of cost-benefit analyses may compromise agency independence, while supporters believe it would ensure accountability. Some critics argue that independent regulatory agencies should be held to the same cost-benefit analysis standards as other agencies, citing the Dodd-Frank Act as an example. Concerns have been raised about the RAA's requirement for agencies to choose the least costly regulatory option, which may conflict with existing laws allowing for decisions based on factors other than economic costs. The Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA) may conflict with existing laws by requiring agencies to choose the least costly regulatory option, potentially superseding other directives not to consider costs. This could change decision criteria for regulatory alternatives and create uncertainty about meeting relevant statutory objectives. The provision in the Regulatory Accountability Act may lead to uncertainty in defining \"relevant statutory objectives,\" which could be clarified through case law or congressional directives. For example, in the Food Safety Modernization Act, specific requirements were set for establishing science-based standards for safe production of certain fruits and vegetables. The proposed Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA) could increase OIRA's authority in the rulemaking process by requiring agency consultation and adding statutory functions. Supporters believe OIRA can check agencies, while critics fear politicization and increased presidential control. If enacted, agencies may opt for adjudication over informal rulemaking if not required by statute. The Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA) could lead agencies to choose adjudication over informal rulemaking to avoid procedural complexity, change policy faster, and avoid political conflicts. The Supreme Court allows agencies to decide between rulemaking and adjudication based on their discretion. The RAA would allow judicial review for agency determinations on IQA petitions, information correction requests, administrative appeals, and failure to respond within 90 days. It would also provide for judicial deference to OIRA Administrator's determinations on agency compliance with IQA guidelines in rulemakings. The RAA would not allow deference to agency interpretations or determinations if they do not comply with OIRA guidelines on costs and benefits. Changes to judicial deference and APA review provisions may result in longer court proceedings. Appendix A compares RAA provisions with relevant statutes, executive orders, and OMB documents. The text discusses the exclusion of certain components from the Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA) table, including government entities and specific statutes. It also mentions that the table includes broadly applicable rulemaking requirements and excludes agency-specific ones. Additionally, it refers to Appendices A and B for further details."
