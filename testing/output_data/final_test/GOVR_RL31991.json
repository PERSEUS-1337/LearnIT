    "content": "Legislation is pending in both the House of Representatives and the Senate to provide personnel flexibilities to NASA. Two bills were introduced in March 2003, with H.R. 1085, the NASA Flexibility Act of 2003, introduced by Representative Sherwood Boehlert. The bill was referred to House Committees on Government Reform and Science, with a hearing conducted on March 12, 2003. Subcommittee on Space and Aeronautics marked up the bill on June 26, 2003, and forwarded it to the full committee. Representative Bart Gordon opposed the bill, expressing disappointment in not waiting for the Columbia Accident Investigation Board's report before marking up NASA workforce legislation. Representative Bart Gordon opposed marking up NASA workforce legislation before the Columbia Accident Investigation Board's report is released. Admiral Gehman stated that the report will address issues related to NASA's personnel, contractors, and culture. Gordon urged waiting for the board's conclusions before adopting legislative provisions. Representative Gordon urged waiting for the Columbia Accident Investigation Board's report before adopting legislative provisions for NASA's workforce. He raised concerns about issues affecting all NASA employees, questioned the demonstration project authority requested by NASA, and emphasized the need to protect workers' rights. The House Committee on Science marked up the bill on July 22, 2003, with a 21-14 vote, agreeing to a manager's amendment that removed voluntary separation incentives, required NASA's workforce plan to address CAIB reforms, and mandated reporting of any modifications to the workforce. The House Committee on Science marked up the bill on July 22, 2003, with a 21-14 vote, agreeing to amendments that would establish eligibility requirements for a scholarship program, include safeguards in NASA's workforce plan, and express the need for minority group recruitment. Other amendments considered included removing a provision to increase covered employees and enhancing NASA's safety office.

Amendments considered included enhancing NASA's safety office and establishing goals for NASA's human spaceflight program. The House Committee on Science marked up the bill on July 22, 2003, with a 21-14 vote, agreeing to amendments that would establish eligibility requirements for a scholarship program, include safeguards in NASA's workforce plan, and express the need for minority group recruitment. Amendments considered included enhancing NASA's safety office and establishing goals for NASA's human spaceflight program. The bill, H.R. 1085, was reported on August 4, 2003, with an estimated cost of $70 million over the period FY2004 through FY2008 according to the Congressional Budget Office. The House Science Committee approved bill H.R. 1085 in FY2008. Chairman Representative Boehlert described it as a targeted approach to address NASA's problems. The Democratic Caucus opposed the bill, with Representative Ralph Hall criticizing the rushed process and lack of amendments. Senator George Voinovich introduced S. 610, the NASA Workforce Flexibility Act of 2003, which was referred to the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs. The committee conducted a hearing on human capital at NASA and marked up the bill with amendments. The changes included discussing the CAIB's workforce recommendations and modifying NASA's workforce plan. The NASA Workforce Flexibility Act of 2003, introduced by Senator George Voinovich, includes provisions to discuss CAIB's workforce recommendations, limit recruitment bonuses for supervisors, and restrict exchange assignments to scientific and technical positions. The estimated cost of the bill is $80 million over FY2004-FY2008. The Senate bill includes provisions for an exchange program between NASA and the private sector, which raised concerns about conflicts of interest. Senator Durbin and Senator Akaka emphasized the need for strong oversight over NASA's operational and safety challenges. Mr. Akaka believes that for the exchange program between NASA and the private sector to be effective, there must be transparent and accountable internal management. Safeguards are needed to prevent workforce shortfalls and controls should be in place to regulate the participation of private sector and NASA employees. Additional safeguards are necessary to prevent contractors from gaining a competitive advantage, such as implementing a cooling off period for contractors participating in the program. Senator Voinovich, along with Senator Carper, offered a substitute amendment to S. 610, which was agreed to by voice vote. The Senate then passed the bill, dropping provisions for exchange assignments between private-sector entities and NASA. Effective contract management at NASA is crucial due to heavy reliance on contract personnel. The Civil Service and National Security Personnel Improvement Act, introduced by Representative Tom Davis as H.R. 1836, includes provisions for personnel flexibilities for NASA similar to those in S. 610. The bill was referred to multiple House Committees and reported on May 19, 2003. The report compares H.R. 1085 and S. 610, both aiming to enhance human resources management at NASA by providing more flexibility in recruitment, relocation, and retention bonuses, allowing term appointments up to six years, and authorizing pay up to the Vice President's salary for critical personnel. Unlike S. 610, H.R. 1085 includes additional personnel management provisions. H.R. 1085 and S. 610 aim to improve human resources management at NASA by offering flexibility in recruitment and bonuses. H.R. 1085 allows a personnel management project covering up to 8,000 employees, and permits limited term appointees in career-reserved positions in the Senior Executive Service. NASA had 505 SES allocations as of June 30, 2002, with 330 being career-reserved positions. This provision would give the Administrator more flexibility in filling career reserved positions. H.R. 1085 offers flexibility in filling career-reserved positions at NASA by allowing the Administrator to appoint limited term appointees. This could expedite the process but may reduce opportunities for career appointees. Other agencies may also seek similar flexibility if this provision is enacted. H.R. 1085 proposes a new category of SES appointee for NASA, allowing temporary appointments for career-reserved positions that may be eliminated within two years. The bill is more restrictive than S. 610, with appointments limited to two years and a possible one-year extension. The enhanced IPA authority proposes extending assignments by four years instead of two years. NASA is seeking more generous policies for recruitment, relocation, and retention bonuses, as well as annual leave provisions. NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe testified about the reasons for seeking these human resources management flexibilities. NASA is seeking enhanced human resources management flexibilities, including extending assignments under the IPA authority to four years. This would allow for collaborations with industry to bring in new ideas and skills, as well as retain talented individuals from academia for long-term projects. The bill proposes enhanced recruitment, relocation, and retention bonuses based on locality pay salaries, with flexible payment options tailored to the situation. It also includes enhanced annual leave provisions for mid-career hires and allows term appointments to be extended up to six years for NASA programs and projects. The bill proposes enhanced recruitment, relocation, and retention bonuses based on locality pay salaries, with flexible payment options tailored to the situation. It also includes enhanced annual leave provisions for mid-career hires and allows term appointments to be extended up to six years for NASA programs and projects. Additionally, the bill seeks to make term appointments more attractive by allowing conversion to permanent positions without further competition, enhancing critical pay authority up to the Vice President's salary, and requesting higher buyout amounts for targeted attrition. The authority is requested to pay a higher buyout amount to entice highly paid NASA professionals to leave. The demonstration project authority sought would remove the coverage limit of 5,000 employees to allow testing of new ideas. The International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers endorses H.R. 1085 for its rigorous notification, planning, and monitoring provisions, along with financial incentives for recruitment and retention. The International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers (IFPTE) supports H.R. 1085 for its provisions on financial incentives for recruitment and retention of technical staff. IFPTE opposes the Industry Exchange Program in the bill, believing it compromises NASA's independence. The American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) also opposes human resources proposals in the legislation. Mr. Harnage opposes the proposed legislation, stating that it undermines merit system principles, exacerbates the federal government's \"humancapital\" crisis, and creates conflicts of interest. He believes the root causes of workforce problems are inadequate salaries, contracting out, privatization, and downsizing. AFGE strongly opposes changes to civil service laws on an agency-by-agency basis. [author name scrubbed] contributed information on the Senior Executive Service to the report."
