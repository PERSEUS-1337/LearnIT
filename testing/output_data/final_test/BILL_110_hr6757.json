    "content": "The Surface Transportation Safety Act of 2008 allows fire services personnel to wear high visibility apparel instead of ANSI/ISEA 107-2004 apparel. The Secretary of Transportation must update regulations to ensure protective measures separate workers from traffic in highway construction zones with no means of escape. Temporary barriers are required in stationary work zones lasting 2 weeks or more with a design speed of 45 mph or higher. The use of positive protective devices in highway construction projects is paid for on a unit pay basis, unless it conflicts with innovative contracting approaches like design-build or performance-based contracts. SEC. 4. Use of patented or proprietary items to further state strategic highway safety plans. Section 112 of title 23, United States Code, is amended to allow the use of patented or proprietary items in State strategic highway safety plans if certain criteria are met. This includes certification by the State transportation department that the item contributes to safety goals, has no equally suitable alternative, is clearly identified in bid documents, and is specified accordingly. The amendment to Section 112 of title 23 allows the use of patented or proprietary items in State highway safety plans if certified by the State transportation department and specified in bid documents. The Secretary of Transportation must establish a minimum level of retroreflectivity for pavement markings by October 1, 2010, applying to all public roads. Additionally, there will be revisions to the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for this purpose. The amendment to Section 148 of title 23, United States Code, includes the installation, replacement, and upgrade of highway signs and pavement markings to meet performance standards and regulations. Additionally, a minimum level of retroreflectivity for pavement markings must be established by October 1, 2010, with revisions to the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. The Secretary must establish a program by September 30, 2010, requiring each State to assess financial obligations of local governments for maintaining minimum retroreflectivity levels in traffic signs and markings. States must provide funds to local governments to cover at least 90% of these obligations. SEC. 7. Roadway safety improvement program for older drivers and pedestrians. The Secretary of Transportation will implement a program to enhance traffic signs and pavement markings nationwide, following guidelines for older drivers and pedestrians. Funds will be allocated to states annually based on a specified formula, with the federal share of project costs determined accordingly. Section 120 of title 23, United States Code authorizes $90,000,000 to be appropriated annually from the Highway Trust Fund for fiscal years 2010 through 2014. The funds can be used in the same manner as apportioned funds under title 23. SEC. 8. Railway-Highway Grade Crossings: States must make surveys and schedules of railway-highway grade crossings available to the public online. $220,000,000 is authorized annually from the Highway Trust Fund for fiscal years 2010 through 2014 for this purpose. Conforming amendments are made to section 130 of title 23, United States Code. \n\nSEC. 9. Review of Safety of Highway-Rail Grade Crossings. The Secretary of Transportation will review the safety of highway-rail grade crossings in the US, assessing factors like traffic, accidents, and potential safety improvements. A priority list of the top 10 crossings needing safety upgrades in each state will be compiled and submitted to Congress. The Secretary will update the national database on highway-rail grade crossings safety every 4 years and make the priority lists available to the public online. Data collected cannot be used in judicial proceedings. The report, review, survey, schedule, or data compiled for safety enhancement purposes at accident sites or railway-highway crossings is not admissible in court proceedings or for other purposes related to damage claims. The Secretary of Transportation will establish a national database for highway-rail grade crossing safety information, including accident reports filed with the Federal Railroad Administration."
