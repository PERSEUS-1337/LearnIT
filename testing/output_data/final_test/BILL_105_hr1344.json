    "content": "SECTION 1. ADMINISTRATOR. Section 1103 of the Panama Canal Act of 1979 is amended to allow the Administrator of the Panama Canal Commission to accept an appointment as Administrator of the Panama Canal Authority from the Government of Panama, with consent from Congress. The Administrator will serve without compensation, except for travel and entertainment expenses. The Administrator of the Panama Canal Commission, appointed by the Government of Panama as the Administrator of the Panama Canal Authority, is exempt from certain restrictions under US law. This includes exemption from the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938 and specific sections of title 18, United States Code. The Administrator of the Panama Canal Authority is exempt from certain US laws regarding official actions, disqualification, and compensation related to their position. This exemption includes sections of title 18, United States Code, and title 5, United States Code, Appendix. The Panama Canal Act of 1979 is amended to include a new section on transition separation incentive payment. The Panama Canal Act of 1979 is amended to allow the Commission to offer a transition separation incentive to employees in Panama for successful transfer of the Canal enterprise to Panama as required by the 1977 Treaty. The term 'employee' refers to individuals serving in Panama for at least 3 years under CSRS or FERS, excluding reemployed annuitants or employees with disabilities. Employees eligible for a separation incentive include those with a disability for retirement, those facing involuntary separation for misconduct, those qualifying for voluntary separation payment after additional service, those who previously received a separation payment and have not repaid it. Prior to obligating resources for transition separation incentive payments, the Commission must submit a strategic plan to relevant committees outlining the positions affected, number and amounts of payments, and how they will be utilized. Transition separation incentive payments are designed to facilitate the successful transfer of the Panama Canal to the Republic of Panama. These payments are made in a lump sum from the Panama Canal Revolving Fund and are limited to 50 percent of basic pay. Qualifying employees who voluntarily separate within 180 days of the enactment of this provision are eligible for these payments. The provision allows for transition separation incentive payments to be made to qualifying employees who voluntarily separate within 180 days of the enactment. These payments are not considered for other government benefits or severance pay calculations. The decision to offer these payments is not subject to challenge, and agencies must make additional contributions to the Retirement Fund. The Office of Personnel Management deposits 15 percent of an employee's final basic pay into the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund if they receive a transition separation incentive. Final basic pay is calculated based on the employee's final rate of basic pay for a year of service. An individual who receives a transition separation incentive payment and then works for the US government within 5 years must repay the entire incentive amount to the Treasury before starting their new job. Title III of the Panama Canal Act of 1979 is amended to include a new chapter on procurement. This chapter establishes a procurement system. The Panama Canal Acquisition Regulation, established by the Commission, preserves operating principles from the Federal Acquisition Regulation while preparing for the Canal's transfer to Panama's administration as per the 1977 treaty. It will be consulted with the Office of Federal Procurement Policy and include provisions required by US laws. The Commission shall determine laws inapplicable to itself, excluding those listed in subsection (b), with no waiver of civil rights, environmental, or labor standards laws for Federal contracts before December 31, 1999. The list takes effect from July 1, 1998, until noon on December 31, 1999. The regulations will be effective upon publication in the Federal Register by January 1, 1999. The Commission will still be governed by the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 and the Procurement Protest System. The Commission will be governed by the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 and the Procurement Protest System, as amended (31 U.S.C. 3551-3556) and the Procurement Integrity Act, as amended (41 U.S.C. 423). The Panama Canal Board of Contract Appeals is established under the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 and the Procurement Protest System. The Panama Canal Board of Contract Appeals, established under the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, consists of three full-time members, including one licensed to practice law in Panama. They have exclusive jurisdiction to decide on contract disputes. The Panama Canal Board of Contract Appeals has exclusive jurisdiction to decide appeals from contracting officer decisions and protests concerning procurement actions. It replaces the Comptroller General in certain instances under 31 U.S.C. 3551 through 3555. The Panama Canal Board of Contract Appeals has jurisdiction over appeals and protests related to procurement actions, with specific provisions outlined in 31 U.S.C. 3551 through 3555. The Board shall establish procedures for timely resolution of appeals and protests. The Panama Canal Board of Contract Appeals will start functioning once constituted and issuing procedures by January 1, 1999. Appeals and protests without valid notice or protest before this date will be subject to subsections (c) and (d) respectively. The Board may also handle other matters as determined by the Commission. SEC. 4. EXPEDITED IMPASSE PROCEDURES. Section 1271(a) of the Panama Canal Act of 1979 is amended to include expedited procedures for resolving bargaining impasses. The Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service must conclude its efforts within 30 days, and the Federal Service Impasses Panel must decide an impasse within 90 days. Failure to do so allows parties to mutually agree on a timeline. The FSIP must issue a decision within 90 days or the agreed time limit, without affecting the obligation to maintain the status quo. Retroactively, paragraph (4) applies to all collective bargaining matters after the effective date of this Act."
