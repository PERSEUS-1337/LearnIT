    "content": "The 1990 Clean Air Act amendments introduced the comprehensive permit program in Title V to improve compliance by outlining emission control requirements for each facility. Prior to this, pollution control obligations for industrial sources were scattered across state plans and federal regulations. The addition of Title V was controversial, and its implementation has sparked debates. Congress aimed to enhance law enforcement through the operating permits program. The operating permits program under the Title V of the 1990 Clean Air Act aimed to enforce emission control requirements for individual sources more clearly and expedite the implementation of new control measures. It was expected to clarify pollution control obligations, simplify procedures for modifying control requirements, augment state resources through permit fees, and enhance states' ability to administer other CAA responsibilities. The report describes the background of the Title V program, its implementation status, and regulatory actions by the EPA to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The Title V program under the 1990 Clean Air Act aimed to enforce emission control requirements for individual sources more clearly. It expanded the number of sources requiring federal permits, including major pollution sources, to ensure compliance with the CAA. Operating permits are now crucial for overall compliance and enforcement. The Title V program under the 1990 Clean Air Act expanded the number of sources requiring federal permits to ensure compliance with emission control requirements. These permits contain plans and schedules for sources to reach attainment with the act's provisions, emission limitations, and monitoring requirements. Nearly 15,500 industrial sources are subject to Title V, including major sources and those subject to acid rain provisions. EPA, states, or citizens can enforce compliance with permit terms. Permits under the Title V program of the 1990 Clean Air Act compile emission limitations, monitoring requirements, and compliance details for sources like those subject to NSPS, air toxics emissions regulations, and new source permits. These permits, issued for five-year periods, must be renewed and include elements such as emissions limits, monitoring, reporting, fees, and annual certification by a responsible official. Title V permits under the Clean Air Act are issued for five-year periods and must be renewed. The program is primarily state-run, with agencies able to use permit fees for program costs. EPA steps in if a state fails to implement a program. States often delegate permit program implementation to local authorities. Permitting agencies must collect fees to cover program costs. The Clean Air Act requires fees for administering the permit program, collecting at least $25 per ton of regulated pollutants. EPA issued regulations in 1992 and 1996 for state and federal permit programs. The Clean Air Act mandates an approvable Title V program overseen by EPA, with state and local agencies implementing it. Tension exists over permit flexibility for industrial changes in emissions. Public involvement is crucial, with citizens able to comment and request hearings on permits. EPA can be petitioned to object to permit issuance. Since 1994, EPA has worked with states, industry, and environmentalists to revise Part 70 regulations, addressing permit issues. Proposed changes in 1994 were not widely accepted, leading to additional steps to streamline permit programs. Major modifications to Part 70 have not been finalized, with focus on consensus-building efforts. The focus of efforts to revise Part 70 regulations has been on streamlining permit modifications and revisions. Concerns have been raised about the lack of flexibility in the current rules, particularly regarding public review for minor emissions source modifications. EPA is working on defining criteria for facility changes that require varying levels of review. In 2009, the Obama Administration finalized the Flexible Air Permit rule, clarifying regulations for industry facility changes without obtaining a new permit. EPA issued white papers addressing implementation issues during consideration of Part 70 rule changes. The EPA issued white papers in 1995 and 1996 to streamline permit processes and address federal-state requirements. A third white paper on operational flexibility was drafted in 2000 but not issued. States were required to submit operating permit programs by 1993, with EPA approval and issuance deadlines. By June 1997, EPA had approved permit programs for all states. As of June 1997, EPA approved permit programs for all 114 submissions by states, local agencies, and territories. State and local agencies were slow to issue Title V permits, with only about 2,100 permits issued by early 1998 out of an estimated 11,000. EPA aimed to resolve the permit backlog by the end of 2000 but fell short, with only 57% issued by March 2001. There were potential consequences for permitting authorities not receiving program approval by EPA, but no penalties for industrial sources without Title V permits. The delay in issuing Title V permits by state and local agencies had consequences, including not achieving the policy objectives set by Congress. A 2002 EPA Inspector General report criticized the agencies for the delays, citing factors such as insufficient resources and conflicting priorities. As of January 2008, 99% of permits had been issued, 12 years after the program's inception. As of January 2008, 99% of original permits required for Title V sources had been issued, with ongoing tasks of permit reissuance and modification becoming the focus. About 100 new sources annually need initial permits, while 3,000 sources require renewal permits. In 2010, EPA took regulatory actions to limit greenhouse gas emissions, following an endangerment finding in 2009 allowing EPA to regulate pollutants for their greenhouse effects. EPA finalized GHG emission standards for new cars and light trucks in April. EPA finalized GHG emission standards for new cars and light trucks on April 1, 2010, triggering CAA permitting requirements and technology-based control requirements for major stationary sources of GHGs starting in January 2011. This includes state determinations of Best Available Control Technology (BACT) for limiting GHG emissions and incorporating GHG control requirements in Title V permits for major stationary sources emitting more than 100 tons per year of any regulated air pollutant. The EPA established a Title V permitting threshold of 100,000 tons per year for carbon dioxide-equivalent GHG emissions to reduce the regulatory burden on sources and permitting agencies. This rule affects a large number of small sources and existing facilities subject to Title V will need to comply with GHG requirements when permits are renewed or revised. The EPA established a Title V permitting threshold of 100,000 tons per year for carbon dioxide-equivalent GHG emissions to reduce the regulatory burden on sources and permitting agencies. An additional 550 sources would require new Title V permits based solely on their GHG emissions. The Tailoring Rule took effect on July 1, 2011, imposing costs on permitting authorities totaling about $8 million per year more than the previous program. EPA estimated that without the Tailoring Rule, Title V permitting authorities would face administrative costs of $21 billion per year. Industrial sources would incur costs of about $46,000 to prepare a Title V application and receive the permit. Commercial or residential sources would also incur similar costs. The EPA's regulatory actions on GHG emissions have faced challenges in federal courts, but in 2012, a court upheld the program. The Supreme Court's 2014 decision limited the sources required to obtain Title V and PSD permits, stating that permits cannot be based solely on potential GHG emissions. The Court upheld EPA's authority to require compliance with BACT requirements for sources needing permits for non-GHG pollutants. Commercial or residential sources would incur costs of about $23,000 for Title V permitting. EPA issued a memorandum confirming that Title V and PSD permits will no longer be required for sources if greenhouse gases are the only pollutant triggering the requirements. The agency announced a rulemaking to revise federal regulations governing Title V and PSD permitting in light of the Court's decision. Regulatory actions by EPA on GHG emissions have been controversial with Members of Congress, leading to debates on legislation to delay or halt the agency's initiatives. Legislators are debating legislation to delay or stop the EPA's greenhouse gas (GHG) initiatives, with focus on the impacts of PSD provisions rather than Title V. Stakeholders agree that objectives of the Title V program have been achieved, consolidating requirements and providing resources to permit programs. Compliance assurance systems have been strengthened. The Title V program has seen improvements in compliance certification, penalty enforcement, and public participation. However, there is widespread dissatisfaction due to program complexity, confusion about requirements, and criticism of costs. While some believe it has clarified regulatory treatment, others argue permits are too lengthy and complex. Benefits are more likely in states without prior permit programs, with mixed views on the overall impact of Title V. The Title V program has faced criticism for its complexity and costs, with mixed views on its overall impact. Some major sources have voluntarily reduced emissions to comply with regulatory thresholds. Critiques of the program are reflected in reports by the EPA Inspector General and a Task Force on Title V Implementation Experience. Beginning in 2003, EPA regional offices conducted audits of state permitting programs to identify areas for improvement. Evaluations highlighted issues like timely permit issuance, public participation, staffing needs, and communication with EPA. Major sources of air pollution were not required to have operating permits before the Title V program. Consolidating existing requirements from the Clean Air Act into a single document has made permits lengthy and detailed, posing challenges for stakeholders in understanding and enforcing compliance. Issues include the level of detail in Title V permits, treatment of small emissions sources, and incorporation of new CAA requirements. Permitting agencies face challenges in adapting existing permits to meet evolving standards. The extent to which permitting agencies can update a source's requirements under Title V without exceeding its scope is a key issue. Stakeholders debate whether adding new monitoring or compliance methods constitutes creating new requirements. Another concern is whether Title V permits should include compliance schedules for facilities with violations. EPA regulations mandate compliance with specific requirements. The debate over compliance schedules in Title V permits continues, with environmentalists advocating for their inclusion to address alleged violations, while EPA, states, and industry argue that it goes beyond the permit's scope. Federal courts have conflicting views on the issue, and the Obama Administration supports including compliance schedules only when violations are clearly demonstrated. The EPA has been addressing the issue of operational flexibility in operating permits since the beginning of the program. They introduced regulations in 1992 and conducted a pilot program in 1993 to evaluate flexible permitting with industrial facilities. In 2009, the EPA finalized a Flexible Air Permit rule based on the assessment of the pilots, which clarified opportunities under existing regulations. EPA finalized a Flexible Air Permit rule in 2009 to allow industry to be market-responsive while ensuring environmental protection. The agency proposed rule changes in August 2016 to streamline the permit review and petition process due to lack of transparency and consistency. The EPA proposed rule changes in August 2016 to streamline the permit review and petition process. The agency noted that petitions have become more complex and resource-intensive, leading to a backlog of 149 pending petitions. Despite the requirement to grant or deny a petition within 60 days, 96% of petitions have been pending for more than 60 days, with 30% pending for over a decade. These concerns were also raised in the 2006 Title V Task Force report. The August 2016 proposal aims to streamline the Title V permit review process by specifying mandatory content and format for petitions, requiring written responses to major concerns, and encouraging electronic filing. The proposed changes intend to benefit permitting authorities, sources, and petitioners by establishing clearer procedural parameters and improving transparency in the petition process. EPA expects these changes to enhance its ability to review permits, respond to petitions, and meet statutory obligations. The regulatory burden and costs of the Title V program are believed to outweigh the benefits by industry groups. Costs include staffing, permit changes, report preparation, legal reviews, and compliance management. Some argue that program costs are not significant when viewed as a percentage of operating costs. State and local regulatory authorities are concerned about increasing paperwork requirements and permit fees. State environmental agencies struggle with funding due to declining EPA and state grant funding, Title V permit fees, and other fees. Many states are not collecting enough fees to cover costs, leading to issues in hiring staff and processing permits. In 2007, the Environmental Integrity Project reported on the insufficient resources for necessary permitting activities. The Environmental Integrity Project released a report on states with fee structures below federal standards for emissions fees. Raising fees to the federal minimum could provide funding for air quality programs, but additional funding is still needed. EPA should evaluate if low fees are impacting the permit program and enforcement. The CAA permit program is not being weakened by fees. Some states are considering returning their delegated CAA permitting programs to EPA due to budget constraints, unless they can raise permit fees or find other sources of revenue. The number of Title V sources has decreased, with about 15,500 facilities subject to Title V regulations. The majority of permitting authorities struggle with fee structures based on emissions, leading to decreasing revenues as sources implement tighter emission controls. State legislatures find it politically difficult to approve fee increases to address the issue of sources lawfully avoiding Title V coverage. This poses a challenge for permitting agencies in terms of regulatory workload and funding coverage. Revenues decrease over time as sources implement tighter emission controls or close, leading to a strain on permitting authorities' ability to cover program costs. Concerns about the adequacy of permit fee revenues have been raised in EPA evaluations, with reports highlighting insufficient resources causing delays in issuing Title V permits. A 2014 EPA IG report noted declining state permitting revenues and a shortfall in funding for program operations. The EPA Inspector General criticized the agency for a $69 million shortfall in expenses between 2008 and 2012 related to Title V permits. The IG identified factors such as lack of oversight strategy, outdated guidance on fee collection, and insufficient accounting expertise. Recommendations were made to improve the program, but EPA stated that most actions won't be completed until the end of FY2017. The IG report highlighted weaknesses in revenue sufficiency and accounting practices, jeopardizing state and local Title V program implementation. Critiques of the Title V program, including reports from the EPA Inspector General and the Title V Task Force, point out inadequate EPA guidance as a major issue. The IG's 2005 report found varying permit clarity among states, with requirements often vaguely stated or referenced without detail. Lack of EPA guidance on key issues leads to permitting inconsistencies and delays, affecting sources, agencies, and the public. The EPA Inspector General recommended nationwide guidance on various topics to improve consistency in Title V permits. EPA has issued limited formal guidance in recent years, relying on citizen petitions and letters for flexibility. Stakeholders are concerned about the lack of rule-making or national guidance on Title V issues. The EPA is using the petition process to create new laws instead of issuing national rules or guidance. This change was prompted by a court decision that vacated a 1998 EPA guidance document. The lack of national guidance has led to issues with incorporating monitoring requirements in permits, a contentious topic in Title V implementation. EPA's limited formal guidance has raised concerns among stakeholders about consistency in Title V permits. The 1992 Part 70 rules required permits to include monitoring and test methods from underlying requirements. The 2005 EPA IG report highlighted inconsistencies in monitoring requirements in permits, leading to calls for more EPA guidance. Litigation has challenged EPA interpretations of Title V monitoring rules, particularly regarding \"periodic monitoring.\" In 2008, a federal appeals court vacated a 2006 rule as inconsistent with the Clean Air Act, which stated that state and local authorities could not require supplemental monitoring when existing monitoring is inadequate. Stakeholders disagree on whether permitting authorities can specify new emissions monitoring requirements in permits. EPA officials mentioned developing a revised periodic monitoring rule, but none has been proposed yet. The Title V Task Force noted in 2006 that much about Title V remains unsettled and subject to debate in legal and policy arenas. Steps were urged to reduce transaction costs and bring certainty to program implementation. EPA officials identified priorities and next steps in response, including working with states to identify best practices and reviewing existing guidance for permit revision and reopening. EPA has yet to propose a revised periodic monitoring rule. In response to the Title V Task Force report, EPA planned rulemakings to address concerns like exempting insignificant activities from permits and improving public notice requirements. Little follow-up activity has occurred since 2008, despite plans for a proposed rule and guidance document. The streamlining proposal was expected to address issues like emission units in permits, but only a small percentage of the Task Force's recommendations were included. The EPA planned rulemakings to address concerns about emission units in permits, public notice requirements, and permit complexity. Despite plans for a proposed rule in 2009 and guidance in 2012, no proposals have been issued. Congressional oversight has been limited to hearings by a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee. The Title V program has had limited congressional hearings, with no statutory changes considered so far. Clean Air Act issues, including EPA's regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, have been a focus during the 114th Congress, but Title V has not been included in this scrutiny."
