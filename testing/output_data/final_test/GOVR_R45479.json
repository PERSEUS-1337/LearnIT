    "content": "The trials of Sheldon Silver and Dean Skelos highlight ongoing concerns about corruption among high-profile public officials in the United States. Congress has enacted criminal provisions to hold corrupt officials accountable, but there is contention over the interpretation of mail and wire fraud statutes in combating corruption. The Supreme Court and lower federal courts have limited the scope of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346 due to concerns about vagueness and federalism. This report provides an overview of honest services fraud and legal issues for Congress to consider. Chapter 63 of Title 18 criminalizes schemes to defraud using the mails or wires. Misrepresentations or omissions that harm victims are a key focus of these fraud statutes. Fraud statutes address misrepresentations or omissions that result in the loss of money or property for victims. This includes schemes to defraud or deprive others of their intangible right to honest services. Section 1346 expands the scope of mail and wire fraud statutes to cover conduct that causes harm to victims. The Supreme Court limited the scope of honest services fraud in mail and wire fraud prosecutions to only include offenders who violate a fiduciary duty by participating in bribery or kickback schemes, following considerable confusion in lower federal courts. This clarification was made in Skilling v. United States to avoid the statute being deemed unconstitutionally vague. The Skilling case clarified the scope of honest services fraud in mail and wire fraud prosecutions, focusing on violations of fiduciary duties through bribery or kickback schemes. This report outlines the development of the \"honest services\" theory of fraud, its codification in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346, and subsequent judicial interpretations post-Skilling. Congress may consider altering the scope of honest services fraud through legislation. The federal crimes of mail fraud and wire fraud involve executing schemes to defraud using various forms of communication. To secure a conviction, the government must prove a scheme involving deception and foreseeability. These crimes are closely related and share similar elements, with interpretations of one statute typically applying to the other. The federal crimes of mail fraud and wire fraud involve a scheme to defraud using communication methods like mail, private carriers, or wire communication. The scheme must involve material deception, intent to defraud, and conduct reasonably calculated to deceive. The deception must be material and have the potential to influence. The government does not need to prove the success of the scheme, only that it was intended to defraud. The second element of mail or wire fraud requires proof that the defendant used the U.S. mail, private carriers, or wire communication in interstate or foreign commerce. The use of mails or wires must be for the purpose of executing the scheme to defraud, and does not have to be inherently criminal or essential to the scheme. The government must prove that the defendant in a mail or wire fraud prosecution had the intent to defraud, meaning the specific intent to deceive or cheat for financial gain or causing financial loss to another. Intent can be proven through circumstantial evidence, such as attempts to conceal the truth. The mail and wire fraud statutes focus on schemes aimed at obtaining victims' money or property, including intangible interests like confidential business information. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346 also includes a scheme to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services. The history and interpretation of this provision are the main focus of this report. The mail and wire fraud statutes were enacted to prevent schemes aimed at obtaining money or property through false pretenses. However, by the 1980s, courts interpreted the statutes to also cover deprivations of intangible rights, particularly in cases involving public officials abusing their positions for personal gain. The \"honest services\" doctrine focused on the deprivation of intangible rights, extending to public officials and private employees breaching fiduciary duties. It encompassed bribery, kickbacks, and self-dealing, such as concealing conflicts of interest, leading to mail and wire fraud prosecutions. In 1987, the Supreme Court's decision in McNally v. United States halted the development of the intangible-rights doctrine in mail and wire fraud prosecutions. The case involved a scheme in Kentucky where public officials and a private individual funneled kickbacks from an insurance company to companies they owned. The Supreme Court reversed the conviction of public officials in a mail fraud case, ruling that the mail fraud statute only protects property rights, not intangible rights like honest and impartial government. This decision was driven by constitutional concerns regarding the scope of criminal statutes violating Due Process Clauses. The Supreme Court reversed the conviction of public officials in a mail fraud case, citing constitutional concerns about vague statutes and federalism principles. The Court highlighted the need for clarity in statutes to avoid violating Due Process Clauses and emphasized the importance of respecting state powers in criminal matters. Congress responded to the Supreme Court's concerns about vague statutes by passing legislation codified at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346, clarifying that \"scheme or artifice to defraud\" includes depriving another of honest services. This legislation aimed to overturn the McNally decision and restore pre-McNally case law on mail and wire fraud statutes, although it may not have fully reinstated all previous interpretations of \"intangible rights.\" Prior to McNally, courts recognized deprivations of intangible rights like privacy and honest elections. Congress limited 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346 to cover only the \"right of honest services,\" which lower courts had protected under \u00a7 1341. Despite concerns about federalism and overbreadth, courts applied mail and wire fraud statutes to cases involving bribery or failure to disclose conflicts of interest for personal gain. The Supreme Court in McNally recognized the need for a limiting principle in cases involving an honest services theory of fraud. Lower courts struggled to agree on the substance and scope of this principle, with some requiring conduct that violated state law for a defendant to be guilty of mail or wire fraud. Concerns were raised about federal judges defining ethical duties under the mail and wire fraud statutes. Several courts debated the state-law limitation on honest services fraud, with some requiring proof of a \"foreseeable harm\" in these cases. The Sixth Circuit ruled that defendants must have foreseen economic harm to the victim due to their breach of fiduciary duty. In Frost, university professors were found guilty of honest services fraud for submitting plagiarized dissertations, as they could have reasonably anticipated harm to the university. Courts debated the foreseeable harm requirement in honest services fraud cases, with some requiring proof of economic harm to the victim. The requirement focused on employee intent and limited the scope of harm under \u00a7 1346. However, some courts refused to apply this limitation, viewing it as unnecessary. Courts debated the foreseeable harm requirement in honest services fraud cases, with some requiring proof of economic harm to the victim. The \"materiality test\" was proposed as a less stringent alternative, emphasizing the misrepresentation's influence on the employer's behavior. This test allowed for cases of non-economic harm in the private sphere. However, proponents of the foreseeable harm requirement argued that the materiality test could lead to overreactions or unnecessary changes in business practices. The Seventh Circuit established a private gain limitation for scheme participants to avoid creating federal common law crimes. Other circuits criticized this limitation as ambiguous and not justified by fraud statutes. Some courts rejected reliance on judicially crafted tests in honest services cases. In honest services cases, courts did not establish special tests or limiting principles, relying on existing elements like specific intent to defraud. Justice Scalia criticized the lack of a coherent limiting principle, warning of potential abuse by prosecutors. The Supreme Court later granted certiorari in cases aiming to settle these issues. The Supreme Court granted certiorari in three cases to settle disagreements among federal appellate courts over requirements for honest services fraud. Cases involved a state legislator not disclosing a conflict of interest and corporate executives transferring money fraudulently. The Supreme Court addressed disagreements among federal appellate courts over requirements for honest services fraud, including cases involving a state legislator not disclosing a conflict of interest and a former Enron executive convicted of participating in a conspiracy to boost the company's stock price. The Court did not expressly endorse any limiting principles proposed by the courts of appeals. The Supreme Court addressed disagreements among federal appellate courts over requirements for honest services fraud, including cases involving a state legislator not disclosing a conflict of interest and a former Enron executive convicted of participating in a conspiracy to boost the company's stock price. The Court did not expressly endorse any limiting principles proposed by the courts of appeals. In Weyhrauch, Black, and Skilling, the Court limited the scope of honest services fraud by upholding Skilling's conviction for wire fraud, despite his argument that his conduct was in the corporate interest and not self-dealing. Skilling also argued that Section 1346 should be struck down as unconstitutionally vague, a point the Supreme Court agreed with. The Supreme Court narrowly construed Section 1346 to avoid vagueness concerns, limiting it to cases involving offenders who violated a fiduciary duty through bribery or kickback schemes. The Court referenced pre-McNally honest-services case law to define the statute's scope. The Supreme Court narrowly interpreted Section 1346 to focus on bribery and kickback cases, drawing from existing federal statutes for definitions. The Court clarified that the statute would still be relevant for state, local, and private-sector corruption cases, despite overlapping with other federal laws. The Supreme Court in Skilling rejected the government's argument to extend Section 1346 to include undisclosed self-dealing by public officials or private employees. The Court viewed this category of honest services fraud as \"amorphous\" and refused to adopt a less constrained construction without clear instruction from Congress. The Supreme Court in Skilling rejected extending Section 1346 to cover undisclosed self-dealing by public officials or private employees. The Court emphasized the need for clear legislative guidance to criminalize such conduct, highlighting the importance of specific standards to address due process concerns. Justice Scalia raised concerns about the proposed formulation, citing unanswered questions regarding conflicting interests, the extent of official action, and disclosure requirements. Justice Scalia in Skilling believed Section 1346 was unconstitutionally vague, as it did not clearly define the nature and source of fiduciary duties. The Court's limiting construction was deemed insufficient, as it failed to address concerns about the broad interpretation of the statute beyond bribery and kickbacks. In bribe and kickback cases, debates over the source and scope of fiduciary duties were rare, with the existence of a fiduciary relationship usually beyond dispute. The Court provided examples of such relationships, including public officials and the public, employees and employers, and union officials and members. The Supreme Court's decisions in Skilling, Weyhrauch, and Black regarding honest services cases were anticlimactic, with Weyhrauch being vacated and remanded for further consideration in light of Skilling, and the Court ruling in Black that jury instructions were incorrect. The Supreme Court's decision in Skilling clarified that honest services fraud must involve offenders violating a fiduciary duty in bribery or kickback schemes. Lower courts have had to reconsider limiting principles, fiduciary duties, and the definitions of bribery and kickbacks. The impact of Skilling on disputes among courts of appeals remains unclear. The impact of the Skilling decision on disputes among courts of appeals was not immediately clear. Justice Scalia criticized the Court for not addressing the fundamental indeterminacy of fiduciary obligations. Skilling indirectly validated the Seventh Circuit's \"private gain\" limitation by limiting honest services fraud to bribery or kickback schemes. After the Skilling decision, criminal liability for honest services fraud now requires actual or contemplated private gain, with the \"foreseeable harm\" limitation being questioned. The theory targets corruption even if no money or property is lost, focusing on the denial of the right to honest services. An example given was a mayor accepting a bribe. The Skilling decision changed the requirements for criminal liability in honest services fraud cases to include actual or contemplated private gain. The theory focuses on corruption even without monetary loss, emphasizing the denial of honest services. One district court rejected the argument that economic loss is necessary for honest services fraud, while the Seventh Circuit ruled that tangible harm is not required. The Skilling decision altered the criteria for criminal liability in honest services fraud cases, emphasizing corruption without requiring actual or intended tangible harm. The Ninth Circuit rejected the need for foreseeable economic loss in public official cases but left open the question for private-sector cases. The Skilling Court's discussion on fiduciary duties may challenge the state law limitation adopted by the Third and Fifth Circuits. The Skilling decision changed the criteria for criminal liability in honest services fraud cases, focusing on corruption without requiring tangible harm. The Ninth Circuit did not require foreseeable economic loss in public official cases but left the question open for private-sector cases. The endorsement of broad fiduciary relationships in honest services fraud cases has led to confusion among lower courts. The requirement of a fiduciary duty in these cases has divided federal courts, with questions arising about the types of relationships that potentially give rise to such duties. The Skilling decision changed the criteria for criminal liability in honest services fraud cases, focusing on corruption without requiring tangible harm. Courts have recognized various fiduciary relationships that can support an honest-services fraud prosecution, beyond the examples provided in the Skilling footnote. One appellate court has determined that the term \"fiduciary\" may encompass even \"informal\" relationships of trust where \"one party acts for the benefit of another and induces the trusting party to relax the care and vigilance which it would ordinarily exercise.\" Courts have different views on the sources of fiduciary duty, with some looking to various sources including state, federal, and common law, while others require it to be derived from state or federal law. State law is considered a sufficient but not necessary basis for a fiduciary relationship. Some courts consider state law as a sufficient basis for a fiduciary duty, while others may rely on various sources such as common-law principles or inherent duties from the relationship. The existence of a relationship is sometimes equated with a fiduciary duty without analyzing the duty's source. It is unclear how courts relying on multiple sources differ from those applying a federal standard. Post-Skilling jurisprudence on state-law duties is ambiguous, with a 2012 Fifth Circuit panel stating that Skilling did not eliminate the requirement for a state official to owe a state-law duty when prosecuted under \u00a7 1346. The legal basis for the relationship that must exist and the obligation it creates remain unclear, especially regarding the nature and scope of the requisite fiduciary duty. Some courts consider state law sufficient for a fiduciary duty, while others rely on common-law principles or inherent duties from the relationship. The outcome will likely depend on the source of authority relied upon and how it is framed. Some courts view an employment relationship as indicative of breaching a fiduciary duty in honest services fraud cases. The Supreme Court in Skilling referenced federal statutes on bribery and kickbacks to define the prohibition. Courts post-Skilling have looked to federal anti-bribery and anti-kickback statutes to define honest-services fraud. Bribery requires a quid pro quo, distinguishing it from a gratuity. Payment or receipt of a mere gratuity does not constitute bribery under federal statutes. While bribery requires a quid pro quo, the payment or receipt of a mere gratuity does not constitute honest services fraud. An explicit quid pro quo may be necessary in cases involving political contributions. Proof of a \"stream of benefits\" coinciding with official acts is sufficient for bribery convictions. There is no requirement for a meeting of the minds between the bribe payor and payee. A bribe offeror can be convicted even if the offer is rejected, and a bribe recipient can be prosecuted for honest services fraud. In 2016, the Supreme Court narrowed the scope of conduct for honest services fraud by construing the definition of an \"official act\" supporting bribery. In McDonnell v. United States, the former governor of Virginia was charged with accepting benefits in exchange for influence in organizing university studies. The parties agreed that bribery for honest services fraud should be defined by specific statutes requiring an intent to influence official acts. The Supreme Court in McDonnell v. United States narrowly defined an \"official act\" for bribery, requiring a concrete matter involving governmental power and an agreement to take action. Simply setting up a meeting or talking to another official is not enough. The Supreme Court's decision in McDonnell v. United States narrowed the definition of an \"official act\" for bribery, requiring a concrete matter involving governmental power and an agreement to take action. Speculation exists regarding the \"stream of benefits\" theory of bribery, but at least one court has held otherwise. The Court did not address whether an \"official act\" must be linked to specific payments. The Supreme Court's decision in McDonnell v. United States narrowed the definition of an \"official act\" for bribery, requiring a concrete matter involving governmental power and an agreement to take action. Speculation exists regarding the \"stream of benefits\" theory of bribery, but at least one court has held otherwise. The Court did not address whether an \"official act\" must be linked to specific payments. In cases of honest services fraud based on bribery, McDonnell could potentially limit liability by defining the scope of bribery more narrowly. For example, the Second Circuit vacated a conviction in the prosecution of Sheldon Silver because the jury instructions captured conduct that would be lawful under McDonnell. \"A few honest services fraud prosecutions post-McDonnell have involved kickback schemes, where an employee steers business to a third party for a share of profits. Prosecutors have adapted by framing cases as traditional wire fraud to overcome limitations. Some circuits have considered a theory of intangible property, including the 'right to control' assets.\" The theory of intangible property includes a \"right to control\" assets, allowing prosecutors to use mail and wire fraud statutes in conflict-of-interest cases no longer viable under honest services theory. Congress has considered legislation to expand honest services fraud to cover conduct not included in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346, such as restoring undisclosed self-dealing as a basis for prosecution in public-sector cases. The legislation proposed in the 112th Congress aimed to expand honest services fraud liability in public-sector cases by including failure to disclose a material financial conflict of interest. It also sought to establish a broader definition of an \"official act\" than the one later announced by the Supreme Court in McDonnell. Ultimately, these bills did not pass. The bills introduced in the 112th Congress to expand honest services fraud liability did not become law. Some critics argue that the Supreme Court's decisions in Skilling and McDonnell weakened the fight against public corruption, while others believe the impact is exaggerated. Despite this, federal prosecutors still have legal avenues to combat corruption. Calls have been made for Congress to reconsider the scope of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346, taking into account the Court's concerns about vagueness and federalism. The Supreme Court's concerns about vagueness and federalism in limiting constructions of the statute may help prevent further judicial limitations. To address these concerns, proposed legislation should answer questions regarding conflicting financial interests, official acts, and disclosures to avoid criminal liability. This clarity could potentially alleviate the Court's articulated concerns."
