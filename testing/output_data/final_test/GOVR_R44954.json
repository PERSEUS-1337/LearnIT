    "content": "Congress has established administrative agencies with regulatory authority, granting them discretion to create regulations, conduct adjudications, issue licenses, and impose sanctions. The Administrative Procedure Act empowers federal courts to review agency actions and invalidate those that exceed statutory authority or violate the law. Agencies must interpret governing statutes in their decision-making processes. The agency administers laws broadly to agencies. Courts use Chevron framework to review agency interpretations of statutes. Step one looks for Congress's direct intent, step two defers to agency interpretation in case of ambiguity. The Chevron doctrine applies in specific circumstances, courts use the two steps of Chevron to interpret statutes, and criticisms of the doctrine are discussed. The Chevron case originated from a disagreement over the Clean Air Act, specifically regarding the definition of \"stationary source\" and allowing states to group emitting sources together. The Supreme Court upheld the EPA's definition of \"stationary source\" under the Clean Air Act, rejecting the NRDC's argument for a dual definition based on emissions levels. The Court determined that the EPA's interpretation was permissible and in line with the statute, emphasizing the importance of Congress's intent in statutory interpretation. The Supreme Court upheld the EPA's definition of \"stationary source\" under the Clean Air Act, emphasizing the importance of Congress's intent in statutory interpretation. The Court determined that the EPA's interpretation was permissible, considering the text and structure of the CAA and legislative history. The Supreme Court upheld the EPA's broad power to regulate specific sources under the Clean Air Act, citing the agency's reasonable explanation for its definition of \"source\" in line with the Act's policies. The Court deferred to the EPA based on congressional delegation, agency expertise, and political accountability. The Supreme Court upheld the EPA's authority to regulate specific sources under the Clean Air Act, citing congressional delegation and agency expertise. The Court deferred to the EPA's interpretation of the ambiguous term \"source\" as a reasonable exercise of its regulatory power. The Supreme Court upheld the EPA's authority to regulate specific sources under the Clean Air Act, citing congressional delegation and agency expertise. The Court deferred to the EPA's interpretation of the ambiguous term \"source\" as a reasonable exercise of its regulatory power, emphasizing the agency's superior subject matter expertise in making policy choices within a technical and complex regulatory scheme. The Court also considered concerns about the constitutional separation of powers, stating that it was appropriate for the political branch of the government to resolve competing interests left unresolved by Congress. The Chevron framework of review is limited to agencies' interpretations of statutes they administer. An agency's determination of the scope of its jurisdictional authority is entitled to Chevron deference. Congress must delegate authority to the agency to speak with the force of law for Chevron deference to apply. The Court may give weight to an agency's interpretation of a statute even if Chevron deference does not apply. The \"major questions\" doctrine has been invoked in cases of major economic and political significance, but its application within the Chevron framework is unclear. In United States v. Mead Corp., the Court explained that agency interpretations may still be considered under the Skidmore framework, especially in highly detailed regulatory schemes. When an agency interprets a statute in a highly detailed regulatory scheme, a court may give respect to the agency's interpretation based on its reasoning strength. However, if the agency is not resolving ambiguities or using its expertise, the court may not defer to its interpretation. Chevron deference applies when an agency's interpretation is examined to determine its level of deference. The level of deference given to an agency's interpretation depends on whether Congress delegated authority to the agency to speak with the force of law. Formal procedures indicate such delegation, as seen in the APA's requirements for different agency actions. Non-binding agency actions, like guidance documents, are exempt from formal procedures. In Christensen v. Harris County, the Court ruled that nonbinding interpretations in agency opinion letters are not entitled to deference. The Court does not give deference to non-binding agency actions like policy statements, agency manuals, and enforcement guidelines under Chevron. Formal procedures, such as formal adjudications and notice-and-comment rulemaking, indicate delegation of authority by Congress for interpretations to receive Chevron deference. In United States v. Mead Corp., tariff classification rulings by the U.S. Customs Service were not granted Chevron deference as there was no indication of Congress intending them to have the force of law. The Court stated that agency interpretations eligible for Chevron deference are those made under delegated authority to create rules with the force of law. The Court found no indication of congressional delegation of authority in the tariff classifications issued by the U.S. Customs Service, as they were not issued through formal procedures and did not bind third parties. Mead and Christensen suggest that agency interpretations eligible for Chevron deference are those reached through formal procedures like notice-and-comment rulemaking or formal adjudications. The Supreme Court has indicated that an agency's use of formal procedures in interpreting a statute is not a necessary condition for the application of Chevron deference. In Barnhart v. Walton, the Court deferred under Chevron to the Social Security Administration's interpretation of the Social Security Act's provisions regarding disability benefits, citing various factors in support of the agency's interpretation. The Supreme Court found Chevron deference applicable to the agency's long-standing interpretation, rejecting a formal procedures requirement. Factors like legal question complexity and agency expertise determine Chevron framework applicability. Some lower courts have applied Chevron deference to agency statutory interpretations reached informally, especially when the agency has expertise in implementing complex statutes. The Supreme Court has ruled that agency interpretations of its jurisdiction are eligible for deference, as seen in City of Arlington v. FCC. The Supreme Court examined the FCC's authority to adopt a binding interpretation of a statute regarding siting wireless telecommunications facilities within a reasonable time frame. The Court questioned whether Chevron deference should apply to the agency's determination of its own jurisdiction. The Supreme Court ruled that the Chevron doctrine applied to the FCC's authority to interpret a statute on siting wireless facilities. The Court rejected the idea of distinguishing between jurisdictional and nonjurisdictional power, emphasizing that the key question is whether the agency stayed within its statutory authority. The majority held that courts should not conduct de novo reviews on agency interpretive authority, but rather defer to the agency's expertise. The Supreme Court applied the Chevron doctrine to the FCC's authority to interpret the Telecommunications Act. The majority rejected the idea of a \"jurisdictional\" test at Chevron \"step zero\" and emphasized that courts should defer to the agency's expertise in interpreting statutes. The Court applied the Chevron two-step framework to determine if the agency reasonably interpreted its statutory authority. Congress delegated the agency the power to administer a statute with the force of law. The agency's determination of a \"reasonable period of time\" fell under Chevron's framework. The Court has not fully defined when the \"major questions doctrine\" applies. The \"major questions doctrine\" may displace Chevron deference when an agency interpretation involves a major question. The Court has used this concern to justify not deferring to agency interpretations in certain cases, such as FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. The Supreme Court invalidated FDA regulations on tobacco products, stating that Congress had not given the FDA authority to regulate tobacco. The Court found that Congress had directly addressed the issue and precluded the FDA's jurisdiction. Congress had enacted tobacco-specific legislation outside the FDCA, indicating the FDA's consistent lack of authority to regulate tobacco. The Supreme Court invalidated FDA regulations on tobacco products, stating that Congress had not given the FDA authority to regulate tobacco. The Court found that Congress had directly addressed the issue and precluded the FDA's jurisdiction. The Court articulated the major questions doctrine, emphasizing that in extraordinary cases, there may be reason to hesitate before concluding that Congress has intended an implicit delegation of authority to fill in statutory gaps. In this case, the Court believed that Congress could not have intended to delegate such significant decision-making power to the FDA in a vague manner. In Brown & Williamson, the Supreme Court invoked the major questions doctrine to support its conclusion that the FDCA precluded the FDA's interpretation. The Court has cited the importance of disputed questions to avoid deferring to an agency under Chevron in subsequent cases, but has not clearly explained when an agency interpretation raises a significant enough question to warrant non-deference. The major questions consideration was also used in Whitman v. American Trucking Ass'ns to analyze Chevron step one. The Court in a step one analysis found that the Clean Air Act did not give the EPA authority to consider costs when regulating air pollutants, emphasizing the Act's focus on promoting public health. The Court required a clear textual commitment of authority to consider costs, stating that Congress does not hide major details in vague terms. This decision was influenced by the major questions principle previously invoked in Gonzales v. Oregon. The U.S. Attorney General was not authorized by Congress to issue a rule on controlled substances in assisted suicides with the force of law. The Supreme Court did not apply the major question exception in a case involving the EPA's authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. The EPA argued that unless Congress specifically addressed climate change, it did not have the authority to regulate it. The Court rejected the claim that Congress needed to speak specifically on climate change for the EPA to regulate it. The EPA's authority to regulate greenhouse gases was supported by the statutory scheme and regulatory backdrop. The Chevron doctrine was applied in cases like Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA and King v. Burwell, where the Court found the EPA's interpretation of regulations on greenhouse gas emissions to be unreasonable. The Court rejected an unreasonable reading of the statute, stating that the EPA's claimed power was an expansive expansion without clear congressional authorization. In King v. Burwell, the Court declined to apply the Chevron framework to analyze the IRS's statutory interpretation, questioning Congress's implicit delegation of authority. The Court in King v. Burwell rejected the IRS's interpretation of the statute, questioning Congress's delegation of authority and emphasizing the economic and political significance of the issue. The decision marked a departure from previous major question cases, rendering the Chevron framework inapplicable. The major questions doctrine has the potential to alter Chevron deference by shifting interpretive power from agencies to courts. However, uncertainty about what constitutes a \"major question\" may lead courts to be reluctant to invoke the doctrine. In the two-step Chevron framework, the first inquiry involves statutory construction by the court to determine if Congress directly addressed the issue. If the statute is unambiguous, the court must follow congressional intent without deferring to the agency. Different theories of statutory interpretation exist, leading to debate on the tools to be used during Chevron's first step. When courts interpret statutes, they often start by analyzing the text to determine its natural meaning. This can involve consulting dictionaries and looking at the statutory context. They may also consider interpretive canons and legislative history to understand congressional intent. When interpreting statutes, courts analyze text, consult dictionaries, consider interpretive canons, and review legislative history to determine congressional intent. In Chevron step one, courts may also look at past agency practice and interpretations to determine if Congress has directly addressed the issue. There is debate on which methods constitute traditional tools in Chevron step one and whether a statute is clear enough to bypass Chevron analysis. Determining statutory ambiguity for Chevron step one requires clarity, with judges using various tools of interpretation. The Supreme Court's decisions sometimes blur the line between steps one and two, leading to confusion about when Chevron step two is triggered. The Court may find an agency's interpretation reasonable without clarifying if Congress unambiguously addressed the issue. At Chevron's second step, courts must defer to reasonable agency interpretations of a statute if Congress has delegated authority to fill in gaps. This may require courts to approve an agency's interpretation even if it differs from the court's preferred reading, as long as it is rationally related to the statute's goals. Courts defer to agency interpretations at Chevron's second step if rationally related to statute's goals. Permissible construction depends on context, with agencies having discretion to pursue various policy objectives within statutory delegation. Agencies can change interpretations. The Chevron framework allows agencies to change their interpretations of ambiguous statutes over time, reflecting altered circumstances or policy preferences. Agencies have the authority to determine the legal meaning of statutory ambiguities they administer, which can supersede a court's prior decision on the statute's meaning. The Supreme Court in National Cable & Telecommunications Association v. Brand X Internet Services clarified that only a judicial precedent can displace an agency's interpretation of a statute if it unambiguously forecloses the agency's discretion. Without such a finding, agencies are free to adopt reasonable interpretations of statutory ambiguities in the future. The courts struggle to define what constitutes a reasonable agency construction of a statute, with some courts deferring to agency interpretations without thorough analysis, while others scrutinize the sufficiency of the agency's reasoning. At step two, courts analyze the sufficiency of an agency's reasoning, which can overlap with \"hard look\" review. They may also use statutory construction tools at Chevron's second step to ensure the agency's interpretation aligns with the statute's purpose. Lower courts assess whether an agency's interpretation of a statutory ambiguity is in line with the statute's policy objectives. Various factors can be considered to evaluate the reasonableness of an agency's interpretation. At step two, courts assess the reasonableness of an agency's interpretation by considering if it serves the public interest and aligns with the statute's purpose. They use traditional tools of statutory interpretation to ensure consistency with other provisions and prior judicial precedents. Some courts apply a broader range of construction tools at Chevron's second step, including examining legislative history. Some courts examine legislative history at step two to assess agency compliance with Congress's goals. Agencies may have better success at Chevron's second step, leading to national uniformity in regulatory statutes implementation. Chevron deference may reduce circuit splits on ambiguous statutory provisions. The potential for Chevron deference to harmonize the administration of statutes might explain why the Supreme Court is less deferential than federal courts of appeals. Recent decisions suggest the Court applies Chevron's second step more strictly, as seen in the 2015 case of Michigan v. EPA where the Court rejected the EPA's interpretation of a Clean Air Act provision. The EPA did not consider industry costs when deciding to regulate, leading to a split decision in the Chevron framework case. Both majority and dissenting Justices agreed that not considering costs at all would be unreasonable, limiting agency discretion in interpreting the statute. The Court's decision in Chevron is foundational for understanding the modern administrative state, emphasizing deference to statutory ambiguity for politically accountable agencies. Despite criticism, recent skepticism from Justices like Thomas has raised concerns about separation of powers. Justice Thomas objects to Chevron's fiction that ambiguity in a statutory term delegates power to administrative agencies, arguing that it contradicts the Constitution's vestment of judicial power in Article III courts. He believes that agencies are using statutory ambiguity as an excuse to create binding rules based on their own policy judgments, rather than Congress. Thomas argues that granting agencies the power to make laws on matters where Congress did not intend violates Article I by allowing the executive branch to exercise legislative power. Justice Neil Gorsuch has criticized this doctrine, stating that deferring to agency interpretations under Chevron is an \"abdication of judicial duty\" and raises due process and equal protection concerns. He believes that regulated parties do not receive fair notice of legal requirements under Chevron, giving agency decisionmakers too much discretion. Judge Gorsuch questions the delegation of interpretive authority to federal agencies based on silence or ambiguity in statutes, arguing it contradicts the APA's mandate. He suggests Chevron deference may lead to an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority to the executive branch. Other judges have also raised concerns about Chevron deference, noting it encourages agencies to pursue policy goals aggressively rather than fairly interpreting statutes. Scholars and judges have criticized Chevron deference for potentially allowing agencies to pursue policy goals aggressively instead of fairly interpreting statutes. Concerns include the doctrine's historical foundations, theoretical basis, inconsistent application, and confusion regarding its framework. Despite these criticisms, Chevron deference remains firmly established at the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has established Chevron deference, but there are concerns about its limitations and application. Some Justices doubt its constitutionality, leading to potential disagreements on its scope. Achieving consensus on its applicability may be challenging, especially in areas where its appropriateness is not clear. Chevron deference, established by the Supreme Court, may see its scope expanded in future cases through \"doctrinal safety valves.\" The doctrine is based on the assumption that Congress would prefer agencies to interpret ambiguous statutes. Congress can control Chevron review by drafting statutes clearly or ambiguously to delegate interpretive authority to agencies. Congress has the authority to shape the standards used by courts to review agency actions, including outlining the standards in the APA. It can modify or displace the Chevron framework by amending the APA or prescribe different judicial review standards in specific statutes. For example, Congress did so with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform. The Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 instructs courts to review determinations made by the Comptroller of the Currency regarding preemption of State laws using the Skidmore standard, which is less deferential to agencies than the Chevron framework. The extent to which Congress could intervene to displace the Chevron framework remains unclear due to unsettled interpretations of congressional intent."
