Congress finds that childhood brain tumors are a significant health concern, being the leading cause of death from solid tumors in children. The causes of most childhood brain tumors are unknown, leading to substantial costs for affected children, their families, and society. Additionally, survivors of childhood brain tumors often face lasting adverse health effects due to the dismal prognosis and significant morbidity associated with these tumors. Childhood brain tumors often do not receive enough attention or research funding due to their low incidence. No single institution has enough patients to conduct comprehensive research on the causes of these tumors. Existing national clinical oncology groups focus on treatment options and prognosis rather than investigating the origins or risk factors of childhood brain tumors. Children with brain tumors are primarily treated by neurosurgeons, not oncologists who typically handle such cases. SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. Congress recognizes the need for a collaborative, multi-center research effort to study childhood brain tumors and identify risk factors. This includes gathering detailed information on environmental, nutritional, genetic, and developmental factors. The Director of the National Institutes of Health should coordinate national research efforts in this area. The curr_chunk discusses the efforts of governmental and nongovernmental entities regarding childhood brain tumors. Establishment of the National Childhood Brain Tumor Prevention Network under the Public Health Service Act. Establishment of the National Childhood Brain Tumor Prevention Network under the Public Health Service Act includes creating a network for research on childhood brain tumors and providing grants for research purposes. The National Childhood Brain Tumor Prevention Network will establish a panel of experts to guide research, develop common study designs, and standard protocols for collecting data from study participants. The National Childhood Brain Tumor Prevention Network will designate a central laboratory to collect, analyze, and aggregate biospecimens, histopathological and molecular data, clinical and radiological data, specific analytical methods, provisions for consensus review, and an integrated data collection network for research funded by the Network. The National Childhood Brain Tumor Prevention Network requires eligible consortia to enroll 100 individuals with childhood brain tumors annually from a designated catchment area, form a control group, and ensure no overlap in catchment areas. The National Childhood Brain Tumor Prevention Network requires eligible consortia to enroll individuals with childhood brain tumors annually from a designated catchment area, ensuring no overlap with existing grants. The Director of NIH must submit an annual report on funded research and grant recipients. $25,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year 2010-2014 for the Network. The Brain Tumor Epidemiology Consortium was formed in 2003 after a meeting sponsored by the National Cancer Institute. A catchment area is a defined area with available population data. The Brain Tumor Epidemiology Consortium was formed in 2003 after a meeting sponsored by the National Cancer Institute. A catchment area is a defined area for which population data are available. Childhood brain tumor is defined as an intracranial or spinal cord tumor in an individual under 20 years of age. The term \"consortium\" refers to a partnership of universities, health care organizations, or government agencies serving a designated catchment area. A technical correction was made to the Hematological Cancer Research Investment and Education Act of 2002."
