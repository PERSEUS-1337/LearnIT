    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Brittany Wilkinson Mitochondrial Disease Research and Treatment Enhancement Act\". Mitochondrial disease is a group of disorders that affect the mitochondria's ability to produce energy in cells, leading to cell dysfunction and death. There are over 40 types of mitochondrial diseases, first recognized in the late 1960s. These diseases can manifest at any age and have varying mortality rates, with the most severe cases causing progressive loss of neurological and liver function. Mitochondrial diseases can lead to progressive loss of neurological and liver function, with a high mortality rate, especially in children. These diseases are associated with various disorders, including neurological diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, as well as aging-related conditions like diabetes and cancer. Genetic mutations are the primary cause of mitochondrial diseases, although environmental factors can also play a role. Mitochondrial diseases are linked to genetic mutations and environmental factors that affect mitochondrial function. Research estimates that 1 in 4,000 children will develop a mitochondrial disease by age 10, with 1,000-2,000 new cases in the US annually. While some children are born with both normal and mutant mitochondrial DNA, it is unclear how many will develop the disease. Currently, there are no cures or specific treatments for mitochondrial diseases. Improving our understanding of mitochondria is crucial. The National Institutes of Health is focusing on mitochondrial disease research and has sponsored activities to advance mitochondrial medicine. The purpose of this Act is to promote research for better understanding of mitochondrial disease and dysfunction, as well as the development of treatments and cures. The Act aims to enhance research and treatment activities related to mitochondrial disease by establishing an Office of Mitochondrial Disease within the Public Health Service Act. The Office of Mitochondrial Disease is established within the NIH to coordinate research efforts and improve collaboration among national research institutes for mitochondrial disease. The Office of Mitochondrial Disease at NIH coordinates research efforts, collaborates with national research institutes, provides training to researchers, educates healthcare providers, ensures expertise in scientific review groups, and consults with other NIH directors. The curr_chunk lists various directors of different National Institutes under the Department of Health and Human Services. The Director of the National Institutes of Health updates a biennial plan and may award research grants for mitochondrial disease studies. Grants can also be given for establishing Mitochondrial Disease Centers of Excellence. The Mitochondrial Disease Centers of Excellence aim to promote interdisciplinary research and training related to mitochondrial disease. Funds awarded can be used for conducting research, facilitating training programs, and developing education materials for healthcare professionals. Additionally, a national registry and biorepository are established to support research efforts. The Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will establish a national registry and biorepository for medical information, tissues, and DNA from patients with mitochondrial disease for research purposes. Authorization of appropriations is provided for this purpose. The Director of the Office of Mitochondrial Disease will develop and release the required research plan within 180 days of the enactment of the Act."
