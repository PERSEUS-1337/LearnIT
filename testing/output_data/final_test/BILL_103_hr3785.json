    "content": "The \"Video Game Rating Act of 1994\" aims to provide parents with information about video games used in homes or public areas. It defines video games and the video game industry, and establishes the Interactive Entertainment Rating Commission. The Video Game Rating Act of 1994 establishes the Interactive Entertainment Rating Commission as an independent establishment in the executive branch. The Commission consists of 5 members appointed by the President, with no more than 3 members affiliated with any one political party. Members serve until the Commission's termination, and vacancies are filled in the same manner as the original appointment. The Video Game Rating Act of 1994 establishes the Interactive Entertainment Rating Commission with a Chairman and members appointed by the President. The Chairman can appoint an executive director and staff without following civil service laws, with compensation determined by the Chairman. The Interactive Entertainment Rating Commission can appoint an executive director and staff with compensation set by the Chairman, not bound by civil service laws. The Commission can also hire consultants through contracts and receive necessary funding through appropriations. The Commission can receive necessary funding to carry out its duties until December 31, 1996, or 90 days after submitting a determination to the President on voluntary standards for warning purchasers about violent or sexually explicit content in video games. The Commission is granted authority and functions to carry out its duties. The Commission is tasked with coordinating with the video game industry to develop voluntary standards for informing purchasers about the content of video games, particularly violence and sexually explicit material. After one year, the Commission will evaluate the adequacy of these standards in warning parents and users about the content. The Commission may regulate video game manufacturers and sellers to provide information on violence or sexually explicit content to users. If industry standards are deemed sufficient within a year, the Commission will report to the President and Congress and terminate its oversight. Antitrust laws do not apply to joint efforts in the video game industry to create voluntary guidelines for disclosing sex or violence content to consumers. This exemption does not cover actions leading to a boycott."
