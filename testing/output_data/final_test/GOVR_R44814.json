    "content": "The United States is a major producer and exporter of field crops like wheat, rice, corn, barley, soybeans, and cotton. Changes in crop production can impact market prices, leading to resource adjustments in the agricultural sector. To address market disruptions, a statistical bureau was established within the USDA in 1863, which later became the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) to provide reliable market information. The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) was created to provide market information for the agriculture industry. The report outlines NASS's origins, legislative authority, funding, survey methodology for crop production forecasts, and county-level estimates. It also discusses the evolution of survey methodology throughout the growing season and issues with low producer response rates. The report discusses NASS surveys for crop production forecasts, market price reactions, and the benefits of NASS data for the agriculture industry. NASS provides comprehensive and timely estimates that influence market analysis and USDA reports like the World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE). The Council on Food, Agricultural and Resource Economics recently reviewed the benefits of NASS data, emphasizing its importance in improving market efficiency for policymakers, marketers, and U.S. farm support programs. The reliability of USDA's crop supply and demand estimates is crucial for agricultural commodity supply chains, but declining grower response rates to NASS surveys have impacted the statistical reliability of estimates. Low response rates to NASS surveys have affected the statistical reliability of estimates, leading to concerns about the effectiveness of the new county-based revenue support program, ARC-CO. Lawmakers may need to address payment disparities in the next farm bill. NASS's mission is to provide accurate statistics for agriculture. NASS collects and publishes national, state, and county agricultural statistics, including the Census of Agriculture every five years. It is one of four agencies in USDA's agricultural research mission area, with headquarters in Washington, DC, and regional offices across the country. NASS survey data are used for forecasts and estimates of crop and livestock production. The National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) collects and publishes data on crop and livestock production, farm labor usage, land rental rates, and more. They issue hundreds of national reports annually and conduct the Census of Agriculture every five years. NASS also maintains a list of farms and ranches in the US and provides agricultural survey work for other agencies and organizations. The National Operations Division (NOD) of NASS handles critical survey support activities such as interviewer training, data collection via telephone interviewing, and processing of survey questionnaires. The Forms Processing Group at NOD processed over 436,000 forms in 2015 and also handles Objective Yield Samples collected by field personnel. NASS operations are guided by an Advisory Committee on Agriculture Statistics. The Advisory Committee on Agriculture Statistics advises the Secretary of Agriculture on surveys and censuses, recommends content for agriculture reports, and ensures confidentiality and objectivity in data analysis. NASS collaborates with other agencies to host an annual Data Users Meeting. At the annual Data Users Meeting, key data users including government and nongovernment representatives gather to discuss and provide feedback on the USDA statistics program, including NASS data products. The 2016 meeting in Chicago saw the Farm Service Agency (FSA) participating for the first time, addressing questions about NASS county-level data availability, specifically related to issues with payments under the ARC county-level program. NASS's responsibilities are authorized under the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 and the Census of Agriculture Act of 1997. NASS operates under the discretion of the Secretary to collect and disseminate data supporting the U.S. agricultural sector. Various laws grant the Secretary authority for data collection on specific commodities like apples, cotton, peanuts, and dairy products, as well as environmental and water quality data. Additional laws cover confidentiality, data security, and research. The Census of Agriculture Act of 1997 transferred responsibility for the Census of Agriculture (COA) from the Department of Commerce to NASS. The COA is conducted every five years and provides comprehensive information about the nation's agriculture down to the county level. The Census of Agriculture Act of 1997 transferred responsibility for the Census of Agriculture (COA) from the Department of Commerce to NASS. The COA provides detailed data on agriculture at the county level, including information on farms, production expenses, farm size, market value of agricultural production, major crops, livestock, poultry, and irrigation practices. NASS publishes numerous national and state agricultural statistical reports annually, covering a wide range of crops and livestock items. NASS provides forecasts and estimates for horticultural products, dairy, livestock, and poultry. They also offer technical expertise, conduct surveys for various organizations, and provide support for international statistical programs. Providing assistance benefits the United States by improving agricultural statistics systems, allowing for better assessment of world food production. Timely and accurate supply statistics are crucial in the global market. Building relationships with other statisticians worldwide helps NASS gather new ideas. Personal information collected is protected, and only aggregate data is released. Working for NASS requires signing a confidentiality form to protect confidential information. Offenders face jail time or fines. NASS's spending is controlled by annual appropriations acts, with $177 million allocated in FY2016. State offices, departments of agriculture, universities, and industries support NASS in conducting surveys and collecting detailed data on commodities. The National Association of State Departments of Agriculture (NASDA) partners with NASS to collect detailed data on commodities important to local economies. NASDA employs field and office enumerators for data collection, allowing NASS to focus on survey integrity and data analysis. NASS independently prepares U.S. crop production estimates using a transparent survey methodology, releasing results through periodic reports to inform commodity market participants and contribute to a stable market environment. The NASS survey methodology combines producer surveys and field observations to gather data for acreage estimates and yield forecasts in the U.S. agricultural sector. It uses a multiple-frame methodology to improve forecast accuracy by surveying large and small farms in an area-weighted probability sample. NASS makes statistical inferences for the total U.S. farm producer population through sample surveys with an effective sampling frame. The NASS sample survey design uses two sampling frames\u2014an area frame covering the entire U.S. land mass and a list frame. The area frame ensures complete coverage of the U.S. farm population with known chances of selection for every piece of land. It is established using aerial photography and satellite imagery, lasting 15 to 20 years before needing updating. The list frame is used for selecting three to four states annually to receive a new frame containing information on farm operators, ranchers, and agribusinesses. It includes names, addresses, and control data to determine the operation's size for sampling purposes. Maintaining an up-to-date list is costly, but it allows for efficient data collection methods like mail, email, or telephone. Multiple-frame sampling combines list and area frames to account for all land areas in the United States once. NASS releases an annual calendar in December showing the schedule for crop production reports. The reports are electronically released from USDA. NASS releases crop production reports electronically from USDA headquarters in Washington, DC. Production forecasts are based on grower survey responses and objective yield surveys for major crops. Crop progress and growing conditions are reported during the season using expert opinions and remote sensing technology. NASS production forecasts for major crops are based on harvested acres and yield per acre, varying with each crop's growth pattern. The largest summer crops include corn, soybeans, and cotton, while wheat has both fall and spring components. NASS conducts three acreage surveys for summer crops throughout the year, with the final survey published in January. The NASS conducts three acreage surveys for summer crops throughout the year, with the final survey published in January. Forecasts for yield and production are released in monthly Crop Production reports for various crops from May to November. Final estimates for summer crops like barley, durum, oats, rye, and wheat are published in the Small Grains Annual Summary in September and in the January Crop Production Annual Summary for all remaining crops. The Crop Production Annual Summary may be revised the following year based on new information, including data from other organizations like FSA program data. Farmers participating in USDA programs report acreage and yield data to FSA offices for payment eligibility. FSA data is used to verify NASS survey data and create commodity balance sheets. Market utilization data, including imports, exports, and industrial use, is evaluated monthly by ICECs under WAOB guidance. This information is crucial for determining total supply in the U.S. commodity market. The USDA utilizes FSA and NASS data to create commodity balance sheets, which are reviewed monthly by ICECs under WAOB guidance. The balance sheets include total supply calculations and are published in the monthly WASDE report. Revisions are made based on survey sampling errors to minimize discrepancies in the balance sheet. Additionally, final crop production estimates are synchronized with USDA's Census of Agriculture data to ensure accuracy. NASS conducts quarterly surveys of grain and soybeans stored on and off farms, releasing reports on stocks of various crops nationally and by state. The reports also include estimates of storage facilities capacities. The Rice Stocks report provides estimates of rough and milled rice stocks by position and grain classes for the nation and major producing states. The NASS data reports play a critical role in the marketing process for U.S. agriculture, making NASS's successful functioning a concern of Congress. Issues of declining survey response by farmers, increasing nonresponse at the county level, and the need for objective estimates to avoid market influence are of concern. The response rates for NASS surveys have declined to the 60% range since 2010, raising concerns about a long-term permanent change. This decline is worrisome for USDA and policymakers as NASS survey data are crucial for USDA farm programs, especially those relying on reliable county-level yield estimates. The quality of information from NASS data depends on high producer participation, which is decreasing. The decline in response rates for NASS surveys since 2010 is concerning for USDA and policymakers due to the importance of high producer participation for reliable data. Survey nonresponse can introduce bias and undermine the accuracy of estimates, especially as accessing households becomes more difficult. The decline in response rates for NASS surveys since 2010 is concerning for USDA and policymakers due to the importance of high producer participation for reliable data. Survey nonresponse can introduce bias and undermine the accuracy of estimates, especially for more localized estimates like county yield calculations. NASS tries to minimize nonresponse to ensure data accuracy. NASS implements strategies to minimize nonresponse in surveys by working with agricultural groups, providing enumerator training, and conducting follow-up attempts. The cost of contacts increases with each stage of the survey, with the highest cost for personal interviews. Early responses are more cost-effective for data collection. NASS implements strategies to address nonresponse in survey data by increasing sample size, reweighting estimates, drawing samples of nonrespondents, and imputing missing data when necessary. The importance of NASS county-level area and yield estimates has grown in recent years, with various government agencies, including USDA's FSA and RMA, using the data for producer payments, crop loss insurance, actuarial processes, county prices, disaster assistance programs, and research purposes. NASS conducts a County Agricultural Production Survey (CAPS) in 44 states to provide data for county-level estimation of crop acreage, production, and livestock inventories. The survey is conducted annually at the end of the harvest season, with some states conducting two surveys. The County Agricultural Production Survey (CAPS) is conducted annually in 44 states at the end of the harvest season. Some states conduct two surveys, one in late summer for early harvested crops and another in late fall for row crops, hay, and livestock. The target population is all farms and ranches in each state, with special sampling considerations to ensure representation of all counties and commodities. Each state develops its own data collection strategy, often using mail surveys with follow-ups to ensure adequate coverage. Operations already participating in other NASS surveys are excused from CAPS, but their responses are merged into county summaries. Farms not responding for several years may be added to the sample for updated information. In October 2015, FSA announced the first ARC-CO payments under the 2014 farm bill, revealing wide discrepancies in county yields and payments to farmers. Particularly in North Dakota, county-level ARC-CO corn payments varied significantly, with some farmers receiving no payments while others received $20 to $60 per acre. Similar disparities were observed for the 2015 crop year. The ARC-CO program provides revenue guarantees triggered by crop revenue losses at the county level, with payments ranging from $20 to $60 per acre. Discrepancies in payments among counties are attributed to FSA's use of a \"cascading policy\" for determining county yield estimates. The ARC-CO program provides revenue guarantees triggered by crop revenue losses at the county level, with payments ranging from $20 to $60 per acre. FSA's policy requires the use of NASS yield estimates, but if there are not enough responses, RMA's crop insurance data is used. RMA yields may differ from NASS estimates, potentially inflating county revenue and leading to lower ARC-CO payments. The FSA state committee may determine county yield using \"best available data\" if NASS or RMA yield data are unavailable. This could involve data from neighboring counties or higher aggregated levels. Even a small change in the yield estimate can significantly impact the ARC-CO payment rate. Commodity groups argue that FSA is not legally required to use RMA yield data. Commodity groups argue that FSA is not legally required to use RMA yield data and have proposed alternatives, such as using NASS data from neighboring counties or implementing a nationwide pilot program to address county yield discrepancies. Senator Hoeven proposed an amendment to create this pilot program during the 114th Congress. USDA is not bound by legislative requirements for this policy. The 2014 farm bill gives the Secretary of Agriculture authority to choose county yield data for calculating crop revenue. The American Soybean Association reports that FSA has decided not to change its policy for the current farm bill period to avoid creating winners and losers or increasing program costs. There are concerns about potential attention to NASS and RMA if changes are made mid-bill, which may impact the ARC-CO program and farm revenue support programs in the next farm bill debate. The farm community is concerned about market power of large companies and hedge funds influencing USDA reports. NASS publishes Price Reactions After USDA Crop Reports in March to evaluate market responses to crop production forecasts. The USDA releases crop production estimates in the Crop Production Annual Summary, which includes initial and final estimates. NASS assesses market reactions for corn, soybeans, wheat, and cotton prices based on sales data. The NASS reports are released simultaneously with USDA's WASDE report, providing market information on supply and demand. The NASS reports do not solely impact commodity prices in the short term, as other market information also plays a role. Market reactions to NASS crop production forecasts for major crops show no bias or error. Positive and negative price reactions are nearly equal in number and magnitude. Visual data from 1987 to 2015 for corn, soybeans, wheat, and upland cotton confirms this. The study examined NASS production forecasts for corn and soybeans from 1970-2005, showing no trend in forecast errors over time. The objectivity and consistency of NASS forecasting procedures were confirmed by the data. The NASS production forecast errors showed no trend in size or direction over time, with the largest errors in August due to yield uncertainty. NASS, established in 1863, aimed to provide transparent data on commodity markets for fair price discovery. The Division of Statistics, established in 1866, began publishing annual statistics on U.S. crop production, livestock numbers, and farm prices. State statistical agents were hired for better coordination by 1898. In 1905, a scandal involving advance knowledge of crop forecasts led to the creation of the Crop Reporting Board, consisting of statisticians for independent review of survey data. The Crop Reporting Board, later renamed as the Agricultural Statistics Board (ASB), was established to provide independent review of survey data from NASS's regional offices. A secure \"lockup\" system was implemented to prevent early release of USDA's crop forecasts. NASS's reporting program has evolved over the years to meet the increased demand for agricultural information, including more frequent and detailed reports on crop progress during the growing season. The Agricultural Statistics Board provides frequent and detailed reports on crop progress, farm prices, and livestock. Sampling from the area frame involves classifying land into categories based on cultivation intensity and dividing it into smaller segments for data collection. The Agricultural Statistics Board provides reports on crop progress, farm prices, and livestock. Land is classified based on cultivation intensity for sampling, with segments representing cultivated areas selected at varying rates. Large farms are sampled at high rates based on specific criteria, while smaller farms are selected at lower rates. The Agricultural Statistics Board reports on crop progress, farm prices, and livestock. Land is classified based on cultivation intensity for sampling, with segments representing cultivated areas selected at varying rates. Smaller farms are chosen at rates of 1 out of 25 to 50. NASS conducts three major acreage surveys annually, including the Planting Intentions report in late March, the Acreage report in late June, and an end-of-year survey in early December. These surveys provide estimates for planted and harvested acres. The Prospective Plantings report is based on a survey of farm operators to determine spring planting intentions. Acreage estimates reflect grower intentions and provide an early indication of potential crop plantings for the year. State NASS offices review the data for accuracy, and published estimates are based on survey data with some judgment applied. Actual plantings may vary due to changes in weather or market conditions. The June Acreage Survey conducted by NASS is the largest annual survey, gathering data on crop acreages, grain stocks, and livestock inventories from over 125,000 farmers through telephone or in-person interviews. The sampled farmers are drawn from two sources - farms from a list frame and farms within selected area segments nationwide. Data from both surveys are combined to avoid double-counting acreage, with the sample size varying yearly and potentially representing up to 50,000 additional farm operators. NASS interviewers use maps and aerial photos to locate and interview farm operators, collecting data on crops planted, livestock inventory, and grain storage. Telephone interviewers gather most of the data, estimating total acres planted for various crops regardless of intended use. The ASB reviews survey data at state and national levels, including preliminary projections of acres to be harvested for grain or soybeans. The June Agricultural Survey provides preliminary projections of acres to be harvested for grain or soybeans, with revisions expected in the June Acreage report. Midyear estimates for harvested acreage are based on reported area for harvest from the June survey. The survey is subsampled for follow-up surveys in July, September, December, and March for livestock inventory, crop production, and quarterly stocks estimates. The final December Survey for Acreage and Yields is drawn from current field crop planting intentions for randomly selected farms. The December survey, based on current field crop planting intentions from randomly selected farm operators, provides final estimates for planted and harvested area, yield, and production for summer crops. Winter wheat acres planted are also estimated. The Winter Wheat Seedings report in early January and the Crop Production Annual Summary provide final estimates for all other crops. NASS uses grower-reported yields and objective-yield measurements to forecast crop yield. At NASS, statisticians review field measurements of fruit count and weight to estimate yield. Grower-reported yields are collected from a subsample of farmers to provide monthly crop yield projections. This data, along with objective yield measurements, is used to determine the official yield forecast. Objective-Yield Surveys involve trained enumerators conducting field observations during the growing season for major crops like corn, soybean, cotton, winter wheat, and potatoes in key producing states. This method provides data for forecasting crop yields based on weighted farm acreage. Objective-Yield Surveys involve trained enumerators collecting data from small plots in fields to forecast crop yields based on counts, measurements, and weights. Observations are made in randomly located plots with predetermined row spacing to determine yield per acre. Plant characteristics are used to predict gross yield components like fruit count and weight per fruit as the crop matures. The potential accuracy of monthly crop forecasts depends on crop maturity and future weather conditions. Forecasting involves collecting data from sample plots to estimate fruit weight and yield per acre. Variability in forecasts can occur when crop maturity lags normal patterns, leading to differences in expected and final fruit counts and weights. The primary source of forecast error in crop forecasting is the difference in final fruit weights from historical averages, as fruit weight is uncertain until the crop matures. Sample plots are revisited after harvest to estimate harvest loss, and data is collected to predict final fruit numbers and weights. Gross yield is calculated by multiplying these components and dividing by land area, but it overstates actual production due to harvesting loss. Gross yield overstates actual production as it includes harvesting loss. Harvesting loss is deducted to calculate net yield, with adjustments made for expected losses based on past averages. Harvest loss is estimated by picking up grain left on the ground in sample plots."
