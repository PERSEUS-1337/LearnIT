    "content": "The \"Financial Information Privacy Act of 1999\" defines terms like \"covered person\" and \"Federal financial regulatory authorities\" and addresses the privacy of confidential customer information. The Financial Information Privacy Act of 1999 mandates Federal financial regulatory authorities to issue rules protecting confidential customer information of covered persons within 270 days of enactment. The rules define confidential customer information and prohibit disclosure to affiliates. The rules mandate covered persons to not disclose confidential customer information to affiliates or agents unless the customer prohibits such sharing in writing. This applies to new customers at the start of the business relationship and annually, while existing customers must be given a reasonable opportunity to prohibit sharing and also annually thereafter. The rules require covered persons to obtain customer consent before disclosing confidential information to non-affiliates or agents. They must provide notices and consent acknowledgments in a clear and separate form. The rules require covered persons to provide notice to customers about the types of information that could be disclosed, allow customers access to review and correct their information, and restrict the use of confidential customer information obtained from third parties. The covered person must ensure that procedures similar to those described in paragraphs (2) through (6) are followed by the provider of financial information. They must also establish a method for examining compliance, enforcing rules, and resolving consumer complaints. The rules cannot prevent the release of confidential customer information essential for authorized financial transactions or to governmental, regulatory, or self-regulatory entities. The covered financial entity may disclose information to governmental, regulatory, or self-regulatory authorities, courts, consumer reporting agencies, or non-personally identifiable entities. This does not amend the Fair Credit Reporting Act."
