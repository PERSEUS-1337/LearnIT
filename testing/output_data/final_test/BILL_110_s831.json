    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Sudan Divestment Authorization Act of 2007\". Congress finds that the atrocities in Darfur, Sudan are genocide, as declared by resolutions and affirmed by President Bush. The Darfur Peace and Accountability Act of 2006 reaffirms the genocide characterized by acts of terrorism and atrocities committed by militias with the support of the Government of Sudan. Several States and governmental entities are taking measures to divest from companies operating in Sudan and to disassociate themselves from supporting the Darfur genocide. These efforts build upon the legacy of the anti-apartheid movement in the United States. The anti-apartheid movement in the United States contributed to the end of apartheid in South Africa and the holding of free elections in 1994. Declarations of genocide by Congress and the President justify divestment measures. Congress supports States and governmental entities divesting certain assets in opposition to Sudan's genocidal actions. Divestment measures are deemed constitutional and do not interfere with foreign affairs. In this Act, \"assets\" refer to public pension, retirement, annuity, or endowment funds managed by a State. \"Company\" includes various types of business entities. \"Company with a qualifying business relationship with Sudan\" is defined in the Act. \"A 'company with a qualifying business relationship with Sudan' is defined as a company managed or controlled by the Government of Sudan, established under Sudanese laws, with its domicile or principal place of business in Sudan, engaged in operations providing revenue to the Sudanese government, and owning or controlling property, assets, or equipment.\" The curr_chunk describes entities that control property, assets, equipment, facilities, personnel, or conduct commercial business in Sudan, including transactions, distribution agreements, and financial dealings with the Government of Sudan or companies based in Sudan. Entities subject to restrictions under this Act include those that invest in the Government of Sudan or companies based in Sudan, as well as those penalized by the Office of Foreign Assets Control for violating Sudan-related rules. Excluded are nongovernmental organizations with consultative status. Entities subject to restrictions under this Act include companies with consultative status with the United Nations or accredited by a UN department, companies operating in Sudan under US authority, and companies in Sudan providing goods and services for humanitarian purposes. The term \"Government of Sudan\" refers to the government in Khartoum led by the National Congress Party or any successor government formed after the enactment of this Act. The term \"State\" refers to various governmental entities within the United States, including states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and other territories. It does not include the regional Government of Southern Sudan. SEC. 5. Authorization for State divestment measures to prohibit investment in Sudan or companies with ties to Sudan during sanctions.
