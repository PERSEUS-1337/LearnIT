A novel algorithm using reservoir sampling maintains an external memory for deep reinforcement learning agents to preferentially remember useful states. This method allows for efficient online computation of gradient estimates in an online reinforcement learning setting. Incorporating external memory in recurrent neural networks for decision making in online reinforcement learning settings can be challenging due to the need to capture long-term dependencies. Truncating gradients in architectures with external memory may hinder the ability to retain important information for future decisions. This study explores methods to effectively add external memory to enhance decision-making processes. In this study, a method for adding external memory to a reinforcement learning architecture efficiently is explored, likened to episodic memory from psychology. The stored information consists of a finite set of past states experienced by the agent, providing context without the need for explicit backpropagation through time. If a stored state proves useful, the agent is trained accordingly. In this study, a method for adding external memory to a reinforcement learning architecture efficiently is explored. The approach involves storing a set of past states experienced by the agent, with a focus on training the agent to remember useful states for future reference. Reservoir sampling technique is introduced to draw from a distribution over all n-subsets of visited states without storing all states in memory. In this work, a new distribution and sampling procedure are defined for deep learning systems with external memory. Examples of such systems include those by Graves et al. (2014, 2016) using LSTM controllers. Training is done through backpropagation through time. Other related works include Zaremba & Sutskever (2015), Joulin & Mikolov (2015), Sukhbaatar et al. (2015), Gulcehre et al. (2017), and Kaiser et al. (2017). Additionally, the application of deep RL to non-markov tasks is explored by Oh et al. (2016). The curr_chunk discusses the application of deep RL to non-markov tasks, specifically using key-value memory and recurrent neural networks. The model is based on an advantage actor critic architecture with an external memory component. The memory stores past visited states with associated importance weights. This approach has been tested on problems in the Minecraft domain and could be a potential follow-up to previous work. Other examples of applying deep RL to non-markov tasks are also mentioned in the text. The curr_chunk discusses a model using key-value memory and recurrent neural networks for deep RL in non-markov tasks. It involves storing past states with importance weights, selecting a state from memory to condition the policy, and determining state retention based on a write network output. The model is trained using standard stochastic gradient descent on RL loss functions. The model is trained using standard stochastic gradient descent on RL loss functions. The value, policy, and query networks are trained using specific loss functions with gradients passed only through their respective networks. The write network's training method is the main innovation of this work, focusing on using weights generated by the network in a reservoir sampling algorithm. The model is trained using standard stochastic gradient descent on RL loss functions, with a focus on the write network's training method using weights generated by the network in a reservoir sampling algorithm. The sampling algorithm aims to have states present in memory based on their associated weights, allowing for gradient estimation of the return with respect to memory item weights for approximate gradient descent. The estimation procedure involves storing one state in memory, with weights associated with each state for gradient descent. The expected return is calculated using a distribution parameterized by the weights. Gradient estimation is performed using an actor critic method, with non-zero estimates only for the weights associated with the current state in memory. The algorithm involves storing one state in memory with associated weights for gradient descent. Gradients are propagated through the single stored state, allowing for online computation without the need to store every visited state. The policy gradient approach is used to estimate the gradient recursively, focusing on the first term for each visited state in the episodic case. The algorithm stores one state in memory with associated weights for gradient descent, allowing for online computation without storing every visited state. Gradients are estimated using the policy gradient approach, focusing on the first term for each visited state in the episodic case. The gradient estimator is used to compute gradients with respect to the weight stored in memory, emphasizing retention of states that improve the return. The algorithm stores one state in memory with associated weights for gradient descent, allowing for online computation without storing every visited state. Gradients are estimated using the policy gradient approach, focusing on the first term for each visited state in the episodic case. The distribution defined in equation 2 can be extended to select multiple elements from a set, leading to gradient estimates that are a generalization of the single-state memory case. The notation Z n is used to indicate the set of all n-subsets of Z, facilitating reasoning about sets of states. The algorithm allows for online computation by storing one state in memory with associated weights for gradient descent.

The distribution defined in equation 2 can be extended to select multiple elements from a set, leading to gradient estimates that generalize the single-state memory case. The notation Z n is used to facilitate reasoning about sets of states. The probability of querying a state given the memory set is defined, and an unbiased estimator is provided in the appendix. The algorithm allows for online computation by storing one state in memory with associated weights for gradient descent. Gradients are estimated using the policy gradient approach, focusing on the first term for each visited state in the episodic case. To improve scalability, an approximation is made to update only the queried item in memory, reducing computation time and credit assignment spread. The accuracy of this approximation depends on the query network's ability to select useful states effectively. In the previous section, a gradient estimator for the desired memory distribution was derived. In this section, a reservoir sampling algorithm for drawing a subset from a set of indices is introduced for online sampling. The algorithm aims to improve computational and sample efficiency by approximating the gradient estimate, which is used in experiments in section 4. The algorithm introduces a reservoir sampling procedure for online sampling from a set of indices. It aims to improve computational efficiency by approximating the gradient estimate derived in the previous section. The algorithm introduces a reservoir sampling procedure for online sampling from a set of indices to improve computational efficiency. Each time-step UPDATE moves throughT starting from index 0, choosing whether to swap the item and weight at each index with the ones in a buffer. The probability of swapping corrects the conditional probability of the item at each index. The necessary swap probabilities can be computed in O(n) time per time-step. The algorithm uses reservoir sampling for online sampling from a set of indices to improve efficiency. UPDATE moves through T from index 0, swapping items and weights with a buffer based on probabilities. The algorithm runs in O(n) time per time-step, producing valid samples from a distribution. Reservoir sampling affects the correlation between history and states. Reservoir sampling affects the correlation between history and states, but this is not accounted for in the work. The algorithm is tested on a problem called \"the secret informant problem\" which highlights sharp, long-term dependencies difficult for recurrent models. The problem requires the agent to remember specific past states for optimal behavior. In each training episode, a new random instance of the problem is created with fixed parameters. Experiments are run for 3 repetitions with error bars showing standard error. The architecture used has specific parameters for different networks and hidden layers. The policy network uses softmax, while the write network uses sigmoid with 10 units in each hidden layer. Training is done with stochastic gradient descent using a learning rate of 0.005. The secret informant problem involves 3 actions and 2 decision states, where the agent must choose the correct action sequence to receive a reward. The secret informant problem involves distinguishing informative states from uninformative states based on specific bit patterns. Informative states guide the agent towards the reward at the decision state, while uninformative states provide no indication of the correct action to take. The decision state identifiers provide information about the decision state and serve as identifiers for each decision state. Agents should take the action suggested by the informative state with matching values of bits 6 and 7. The final bit indicates whether all decisions made so far have been correct, necessary for learning in the system. Future work may explore eliminating the need for this information using multi-step updates or eligibility traces. The particular state shown above indicates the correct action for the second decision state will be the up action. Different versions of this problem can be created with variable length, number of actions, and decision states. A recurrent baseline with full backpropagation through time required more fine-tuning to train with online updates. Stochastic gradient descent alone gave poor results with the recurrent learner, so RMSProp was used instead. To improve results with the recurrent learner, a discount factor and entropy regularization were added. These were not needed for the episodic memory system. Learning rate and layer width were tuned for each environment, with training runs of 25000 episodes for one decision environment and 50000 episodes for two decision environment. Learning rate was selected from a specific range. For the 1 decision environment, the recurrent baseline was run for 3 repeats, while for the 2 decision environment it was run for 10 repeats. Results and descriptions of the experiments are shown in figures 3, 4, and 5, with the x-axis representing the number of training episodes. The episodic memory learner was able to learn a good query policy and drive the write weight of uninformative states to near 0. The algorithm integrates external memory with trainable reading and writing into a RL agent by focusing on past visited states to assign credit to useful information without backpropagation through time. The addition of redundant memory size may accelerate initial learning but has little effect on overall convergence time. The number of episodes to converge roughly doubles with the extra decision state, but training remains stable.

Lemma 2 states that T t+1 = T t \u222a {\u03c4 t,0 } and provides a proof by induction for swapping elements in T. Lemma 3 and Lemma 4 provide proofs by induction for updating memory configurations in the algorithm. The update process is detailed, showing how the algorithm assigns credit to useful information without backpropagation through time. The algorithm's efficiency in online RL settings is highlighted, along with its performance on a toy problem with long-term dependencies.

The process assigns credit without backpropagation through time, ensuring correct values at each time step. The algorithm efficiently updates memory configurations in online RL settings using Lemmas 3 and 4 for induction proofs. The proof serves as a base case for the rest of the process, showing that P t,i \u2265 0. The lemma demonstrates that the left side of the inequality must be greater than the right side, as each term on the right is present on the left with more repetitions. This validates P as a probability. The lemma proves that swapping according to algorithm 1 is valid, as P is a valid probability. It involves a proof by induction showing that elements of T have the desired probability conditioned on preceding elements. The lemma proves the validity of swapping according to algorithm 1 by showing that elements of T have the desired probability conditioned on preceding elements. An experiment with environment length 20 shows an increase in episodes to convergence from 50,000 to around 80,000. The experiment with environment length 20 resulted in an increase in episodes to convergence from 50,000 to around 80,000. The number of episodes needed for training remains stable despite doubling the environment length."
