    "content": "The federal crop insurance program offers risk management tools for farmers to address crop yield and revenue losses. Policies are available for a wide range of commodities, including specialty crops like fruits and vegetables. Legislative proposals aim to enhance crop insurance for specialty crop producers. The federal crop insurance program covers specialty and organic crops, with policies available for over 80 specialty crops. The program is authorized by the Federal Crop Insurance Act and operated by the USDA's Risk Management Agency. The 2008 farm bill revised the legislation to achieve budget savings and supplement crop insurance with a permanent disaster payment program. The federal crop insurance program is managed by a board of directors under the supervision of the Secretary of Agriculture. Policies are sold through private insurance companies, with agents receiving sales commissions. The government covers a portion of the premium, with higher coverage levels requiring higher producer payments. The government also reimburses insurance companies for losses and operating costs. Without subsidies, farmer participation in the program would be limited. The crop insurance program relies on subsidies to ensure farmer participation. Producers benefit from timely payments for crop losses. USDA decides on crop insurance availability based on factors like farmer demand and risk levels. RMA may expand coverage to counties without policies through pilot programs. Policies can be discontinued if they underperform. The Federal Crop Insurance Program was initially authorized as an experiment during the Great Depression to address crop losses. The program focused on major crops like wheat and expanded in 1980 to cover more crops and regions. Congress further enhanced the program in 1994 and 2000 with greater subsidy levels. In 1994 and 2000, the crop insurance program was further enhanced with greater subsidy levels to encourage participation and expand the role of the private sector. Banks now require farmers to purchase crop insurance when obtaining operating loans. By 1999, insurance policies covered 52 specialty crops with plans for 9 more, accounting for a majority of value. Expansion was slow due to USDA's deliberate process to assess risk and set premiums for actuarial soundness. The crop insurance program expanded in the subsequent decade, with insurance available for over 80 specialty crops by 2011 in major growing areas. The insured liability of specialty crops increased from less than $8 billion in 2000 to nearly $13 billion in 2009, reflecting growth in production and participation. Liability declined in recent years due to reduced nursery insurance after the housing market recession. USDA's noninsured crop disaster assistance program provides coverage when crop insurance is unavailable. The Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP) offers catastrophic coverage for yield losses exceeding 50% if purchased by the producer. NAP is administered by the Farm Service Agency and does not require premiums, only an administrative fee of $250 per crop. Producer interest in policy availability is channeled through RMA's regional offices, with established criteria such as cultivars, farming practices, markets, and perils. Significant producer demand is crucial for the success of new crop insurance programs developed under the Federal Crop Insurance Act. Products undergo a rigorous approval process that can take up to a year. Products developed under the Federal Crop Insurance Act undergo a rigorous approval process, including review by an external panel of experts and the FCIC board of directors. Approved products are tested as pilot programs in limited areas for effectiveness and financial exposure. Pilot programs typically run for four years and may be extended for further testing. The board decides whether to convert the pilot to a regular program or terminate it. Sometimes product development is suspended, as seen with the investigation of \"Named Peril Weather Insurance\" by RMA. Private industry, offering weather-based products, is failing to meet the needs of specialty crop producers. Federal crop insurance policies cover yield loss from various causes like drought, excess precipitation, and pests. Revenue-based policies protect against revenue loss from yield or price declines, while whole-farm insurance covers overall farm revenue. Quarantine-related losses can be protected against with an available endorsement. Specialty crop producers can purchase yield-based insurance policies like actual production history (APH) and dollar plans. APH policies provide coverage for crop losses exceeding a selected threshold, with catastrophic (CAT) coverage offering basic protection subsidized by the federal government. Farmers pay an administrative fee and can receive a payment on losses in excess of 50% of normal yield. Specialty crop producers can purchase yield-based insurance policies like actual production history (APH) and dollar plans. APH policies offer coverage levels higher than CAT, allowing producers to \"buy up\" coverage to 75/100 or even 85/100 of normal crop yield. The dollar plan provides protection against declining value due to damage, guaranteeing a specific dollar amount of coverage based on the cost of growing a crop in a specific area. Revenue insurance is available for farm program crops like wheat and corn, while specialty crop producers can opt for yield-based insurance policies such as actual production history (APH) and dollar plans. Dollar plan insurance guarantees a specific dollar amount of coverage based on the cost of growing a crop in a specific area. Specialty crops face challenges in designing revenue products due to the lack of centralized price discovery mechanisms. Revenue insurance for specialty crops faces challenges in designing revenue products due to data challenges. The actual revenue history (ARH) plan insures historical revenues using historical prices, with a focus on crops like navel oranges and cherries. Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) and AGR-Lite policies insure the entire farm's revenue rather than individual crops, with AGR-Lite offering higher coverage levels for producers. Developing revenue coverage for additional specialty crops remains a high priority according to the Risk Management Agency. AGR-Lite offers higher coverage levels for producers with multiple commodities, using a producer's historical farm average revenue to provide guaranteed revenue for the insurance period. Coverage levels range from 65% to 80% of historical revenue. AGR and AGR-Lite are designed to protect specialty crops and commodities not covered by individual policies, but participation in whole-farm insurance has been limited. The AGR products offer higher coverage levels for producers with multiple commodities, but participation has been limited. A quarantine endorsement is available for California avocado and citrus to insure against losses associated with a quarantine. The quarantine is established to control a specific pest that affects insured crops, preventing their harvest, sale, or transport. The FCIC reported that over 7 million acres of specialty crops were enrolled in federal crop insurance in 2009, with an average participation rate of 75%. Specialty crop states like California, Florida, and Washington have high insured acreage compared to total crop area. The USDA report provides detailed acreage data for specialty crop states like California, Florida, and Washington, as well as Northern Plains states like Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota. Other states with specialty crop production include Michigan, New York, and Oregon. Crop insurance premiums increase with higher coverage levels, with catastrophic coverage (losses over 50%) fully subsidized by the federal government. Farmers pay an administrative fee for catastrophic coverage. The USDA report provides detailed acreage data for specialty crop states like California, Florida, and Washington, as well as Northern Plains states like Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, and South Dakota. Other states with specialty crop production include Michigan, New York, and Oregon. Crop insurance premiums increase with higher coverage levels, with catastrophic coverage (losses over 50%) fully subsidized by the federal government. Farmers pay an administrative fee for catastrophic coverage. In return, producers can receive indemnity on losses exceeding 50% of normal yield, equal to 55% of the estimated market price of the crop. Producers can also opt for \"buy-up\" coverage for greater financial protection, with subsidies ranging from 67% to 38%. Premiums for crop insurance only reflect policy risk costs, with administrative and operating costs covered by government reimbursements to insurance companies. Specialty crops have lower acreage participation compared to program crops, resulting in lower producer subsidies for crop insurance premiums. In 2011, producer subsidies for federal crop insurance premiums totaled $438 million for specialty crops and $6.9 billion for program crops. In 2011, premiums totaled $438 million for specialty crops and $6.9 billion for program crops, making a combined total of $7.3 billion. Specialty crops received 6% of premium subsidies but accounted for 31% of total crop value, while program crops received 94% of premium subsidies but represented 69% of total crop value. The ratio of premium subsidies to crop value was 0.7% for specialty crops and 5.1% for program crops, showing that specialty crops are subsidized at lower levels compared to program crops due to factors like acreage participation. The difference between program and specialty crops in subsidy amounts is influenced by factors such as acreage participation, crop insurance availability, and coverage levels purchased. Specialty crops, like fruits and nuts, have lower coverage levels and lower participation in higher coverage levels compared to program crops. USDA reports an increase in organic crop insurance participation, with nearly 35% of organic crop varieties insured in recent years. Prior to 2000, organic crop insurance required a written agreement for coverage determination. The Agricultural Risk Protection Act (ARPA) changed this by allowing organic production to be covered under standard crop insurance policies without the need for a written agreement. Federal crop insurance now covers certified organic acreage, transitional acreage, and buffer zone acreage to support organic farmers. Federal crop insurance now covers certified organic acreage, transitional acreage, and buffer zone acreage to support organic farmers. Producers must have a current organic plan and certification from a certifying agent for certified organic acreage. Separate yield history is maintained for conventional, transitional, and certified organic acreage. Indemnities are only provided if planned controls or practices were ineffective. A 5% surcharge is typically charged for insuring organic crops, but premium adjustments can be made based on insurance experience. For the 2011 crop year, no additional charge was required for organic crops like figs, Florida citrus fruit, and Texas citrus trees. Some insurance plans do not have a 5% surcharge for organic production. Pricing for organic crops is criticized for not being different from conventional crops. In 2011, USDA started using separate organic price data for cotton, corn, soybeans, and processing tomatoes in response to criticism from organic producers. Despite increased adoption of federal insurance policies for specialty crops, challenges remain in developing new insurance policies for uncovered crops due to small market size and sales incentives for insurance companies. The small market size for insurance policies on uncovered crops leads to higher costs for companies and difficulties in setting appropriate price guarantees. This can result in adverse selection if prices are too high or insufficient coverage if prices are too low. Specialty crops face challenges due to the multitude of crop varieties and production practices, adding complexity to insurance policy development. Understanding how these factors affect yields is crucial for determining insurable practices and setting underwriting standards. Variation across crops and within crop types further complicates the process. Several bills in the 112th Congress aim to enhance crop insurance for specialty crops by improving product development to cover more commodities, expand whole farm insurance, and offer organic insurance. The Local Farms, Food, and Jobs Act of 2011 (H.R. 3286/S. 1773) introduced by Representative Pingree and Senator Brown would require the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation to offer a whole-farm revenue risk plan in all states and counties. The bill introduced by Representative Pingree and Senator Brown aims to enhance crop insurance for specialty crops by offering a whole-farm revenue risk plan in all states and counties. Producers of any agricultural commodity would qualify for an indemnity if their actual gross farm revenue falls below 85% of the average. The bill also includes provisions for organic crops, eliminating premium surcharges and requiring insurance to be offered at actual price levels received by growers. Additionally, the bill would allow FCIC to conduct its own insurance product research and submit an annual report to Congress summarizing the varieties of organic crops insured. The Specialty Crop Insurance Act of 2011 by Senator Gillibrand aims to waive the 50% cap on advance payments for research and development of new insurance plans, specifically for specialty crop coverage in underserved regions. The bill also allows FCIC to conduct research on existing or new policies. The Farm and Ranch Sustainability and Hunger (REFRESH) Act of 2011 proposes changes to U.S. farm policy, including expanding whole-farm insurance. The bill would remove restrictions on FCIC conducting insurance product research. Similar provisions for specialty crops are included in the Senate-passed farm bill and House committee-reported farm bill, requiring USDA to conduct more research on whole farm revenue insurance. The Farm and Ranch Sustainability and Hunger (REFRESH) Act of 2011 proposes changes to U.S. farm policy, including expanding whole-farm insurance. It requires USDA to conduct more research on whole farm revenue insurance with higher coverage levels, enhance the Noninsured Crop Assistance Program (NAP), allow producers to purchase a second crop insurance policy called \"Supplemental Coverage Option\" (SCO), revise the value of crop insurance for all organic crops, and subsidize the purchase of existing policies.

Additionally, the Act subsidizes the purchase of existing private-sector index-based weather insurance, which insures against specific weather events."
