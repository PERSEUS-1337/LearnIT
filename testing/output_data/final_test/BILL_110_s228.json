    "content": "The \"Small Business Child Care Act\" is the short title of the Act. It establishes the Small Business Child Care Grant Program. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will establish a program to award grants to States for employer-operated child care programs. States must submit an application to receive a grant, with the amount determined based on the State's population. Grants will be provided for a period of 3 years. A State awarded a grant for a 3-year period must use the funds to assist small businesses in establishing and operating child care programs, including providing technical assistance, startup costs, training for providers, scholarships for low-income earners, and services for sick or school-aged children. The State provides assistance to small businesses for establishing and operating child care programs, including contracts with local organizations, care for children with disabilities, facility expenses, and other approved activities through an application process. The State gives priority to applicants forming a consortium to provide child care in underserved areas. Consortiums must include small businesses and may include other entities. States cannot provide more than $500,000 in assistance to a single applicant. To be eligible for a grant under this section, a State must ensure that a covered entity will provide non-Federal contributions equal to a certain percentage of costs incurred in carrying out activities. The percentage required increases in the second fiscal year of receiving assistance. To be eligible for assistance under a grant, child care providers must comply with state and local licensing requirements and health and safety standards. States are limited in retaining more than 3% of funds allocated. State-Level Activities: A State may retain up to 3% of funds for administration. States are responsible for administering grants and monitoring covered entities. Covered entities must conduct annual audits, and misuse of funds may require repayment. The Secretary may seek repayment from a covered entity if misuse of assistance is detected. An appeals process for repayments will be provided by regulation. Additionally, a 2-year study will be conducted by the Secretary to determine certain aspects related to the grants awarded under this section. The Secretary will conduct a study to determine the capacity of covered entities to meet child care needs, types of consortia formed at the local level for child care programs, and the demographics of program users. A report will be submitted to Congress within 28 months of awarding grants under this section. The Secretary will conduct a 4-year study to determine the number of child care facilities funded through grants awarded under this section and their effectiveness in meeting child care needs. A report will be submitted to Congress within 52 months of awarding grants. The Secretary will submit a report to Congress on the results of a study conducted to determine the effectiveness of child care facilities funded through grants awarded under this section. Definitions include terms like \"covered entity\" referring to small businesses or consortia, \"Indian community\" as a community served by an Indian tribe or tribal organization, \"Indian tribe\" and \"tribal organization\" as defined in the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990, and \"small business\" as defined in the section. The term \"small business\" is defined as an employer with 2 to 50 employees. The term \"State\" includes Indian tribes and tribal organizations. Authorization of Appropriations: $50,000,000 is authorized for State-level activities from 2008 to 2012. Not more than $2,500,000 can be used for studies and administration. The program established under subsection (a) will terminate on September 30, 2012."
