A decade later, it is unclear if lending to small businesses has increased, with some firms able to access credit while others still face constraints or are discouraged from applying. During the Great Recession, lending to small businesses declined as firms scaled down operations and lenders tightened standards. A decade later, it is unclear if lending to small businesses has increased, with some firms able to access credit while others may be discouraged. Congress has a continued interest in small business loans, focusing on credit access and fair lending rates. Market failures may impede small business access to credit, prompting policymakers to consider interventions. Market failures can impede credit allocation to small businesses, as lenders may be reluctant to lend to businesses with hard-to-liquidate collateral assets. Small loans may not generate enough returns to justify origination costs, leading to noncompetitive lending rates for borrowers. Start-ups and niche businesses often rely on alternative financing sources due to challenges in pricing loans. Obtaining conclusive evidence on small business lending performance is difficult. Determining small business lending performance is challenging due to the lack of consensus on what constitutes a small business, the absence of comprehensive data on financing activities, and the varying risks small business owners take. Without standardized benchmark prices, assessing the competitiveness of small business loan prices is difficult. The Small Business Administration (SBA) and legislation like the Community Reinvestment Act and Dodd-Frank Act aim to address small business lending challenges by providing support and encouraging banks to meet credit demands in low-income communities. The CFPB has not yet implemented the requirement to collect data from small business lenders. Various bills in the 116th Congress address the small business lending market, including H.Res. 370 expressing the rights of small business owners seeking financing and H.R. 3374 amending the Equal Credit Opportunity Act to collect data on LGBTQ-owned businesses. The report examines the challenges in assessing market failures in the small business lending market, focusing on defining small businesses and types of lenders. It also attempts to identify credit shortages in segments like small loans and loans for businesses with risky collateral. The report discusses challenges in defining small businesses for data collection in the small business lending market. It also explores credit shortages in segments like small loans and loans for businesses with risky collateral. Additionally, it briefly mentions the Dodd-Frank Act requirement for the CFPB to collect data on SBL market activity. The SBA defines small businesses using size standards based on annual receipts or number of employees. Different SBA programs have alternative size standards based on net worth and income. Academic research often uses 500 employees as a proxy for a small business. A microbusiness is defined as a firm with one owner, five employees or fewer, and annual sales/assets under $250,000. Small business definitions vary, with the IRS setting different size standards for tax purposes. The ACA defines a small business as having fewer than 50 full-time employees to avoid certain provisions. According to a FDIC survey, small and large banks have different definitions of a small business. Small banks see a small business as one where the owner performs multiple tasks, while large banks define it based on revenues and sales. Small businesses rely on various credit sources, including personal credit, family, friends, and financial institutions. Financial institutions have different regulations, business models, loan offerings, and target small businesses at different growth stages. Some lenders use business credit scores to assess creditworthiness for Small Business Loans (SBLs), leading to denials for those with poor or no credit history. The SBA also considers credit scores for its 7(a) loan program. Many businesses are unaware of their business credit scores. Banks historically dominate commercial lending, impacting credit availability trends. Nonbank lenders are also evaluated in this context. Nonbank financial institutions, including credit unions and fintech lenders, are important sources of small business loans. Smaller firms are more likely to apply to nonbank lenders for credit. Bank size definitions range from small community banks with total assets of $1 billion or less to large banks with assets exceeding $10 billion. The number of community banks holding small business loans is declining, while large banks with assets over $10 billion are increasing. This shift has led to a decrease in the number of FDIC-insured institutions overall. Community banks historically provided significant funding for small businesses, but their market share has decreased significantly. In 2015, the Federal Reserve noted a decline in community banks' small business loan portfolios under $100,000, indicating reduced lending to small businesses. The Credit Union Membership Access Act of 1998 established rules for credit union member business loans, limiting aggregate business loans to 15% for one member or group. The Credit Union Membership Access Act of 1998 limited credit union member business loans to 15% of net worth or $100,000, with exceptions for certain credit unions. Credit unions' MBL lending volume is small compared to banks, accounting for about 1.4% of commercial lending as of September 30, 2015. Credit unions' commercial lending accounts for 1.4% of the banking system. Larger credit unions operate similarly to small community or midsize regional banks in the commercial loan market, with 85% of loans secured by real estate. Some credit unions focus heavily on agricultural loans. Despite competition with banks in certain areas, credit unions have a smaller presence in the commercial lending market. The share of small business loans originated by nonbank fintech lenders is increasing. The fintech lending model has gained a competitive edge by streamlining the traditional underwriting process through online applications and AI. Marketplace lending serves as both a substitute and complement to the banking system, providing credit in underserved markets and partnering with banks. The relationship between small business growth stages and credit access is explained. Start-ups and established firms may have different experiences obtaining loans, influenced by underwriting requirements and loan customization. Funding options for lenders can also impact underwriting practices and loan types offered. During the initial start-up stage, small businesses often struggle to access credit due to lack of collateral, limited financial history, and uncertain creditworthiness. As a result, they rely on personal funds from friends, family, and consumer credit products rather than traditional commercial loans. Small business owners with $1 million or less in annual revenue often use personal credit scores to secure loans, with low business credit scores being a common reason for credit rejections. Economic downturns affecting consumer credit availability can also impact small businesses' access to credit. Tighter lending standards during the 2007-2009 recession, including declines in home equity credit and increased credit card rates, have affected small businesses with large debt balances. During economic downturns, small businesses with large debt balances may face higher borrowing costs due to changes in consumer credit availability and pricing. As businesses progress to a more advanced growth stage, they may qualify for loans secured by assets, credit, and earnings histories. Relationship lending remains a common way for small firms to access credit, with more mature businesses having greater access to Small Business Loans (SBLs). Relationship lending involves developing close familiarity with customers and providing financial services within a specific geographical area. This approach allows for pricing lending risks that are unique, infrequent, and localized, often requiring a more labor-intensive underwriting process compared to transactional lending used by larger institutions. Transactional lending offers a comparative advantage for loan pricing when borrowers face conventional business risks, relying on financial metrics and documentation. Lenders do not need to be near borrowers for monitoring, and credit requests are often denied due to weak business performance, insufficient collateral, or excessive existing debt. The lender's underwriting model influences how small businesses are defined, with community banks often describing them as businesses whose owners multitask. Community banks define small businesses as those whose owners multitask, performing multiple tasks instead of relying on full-time employees. These businesses often lack the metrics needed for automated underwriting and are manually underwritten for credit requests. Relationship lending allows for tailored loans to meet small firms' unique needs, while large banks categorize small businesses based on annual sales revenues. Automated underwriting is more favorable for businesses with good credit scores and timely financial documentation. Banks may offer unsecured credit card loans to firms with reliable financial records, reducing monitoring costs. Standardized financials allow for faster and competitively priced loans, with lower origination costs as loan volume increases. Lenders with transactional models benefit from economies of scale, catering to borrowers with quantifiable risks. Start-ups and established firms rely on different types of credit. This section explores evidence of market failures in the lending industry that may require policy interventions, focusing on the availability of small loans for small businesses and potential issues faced by certain small businesses. The FDIC examines the availability of small loans for small businesses, potential collateral issues, credit insufficiency in low- and moderate-income communities, and the affordability of credit for small businesses. Various size definitions of small business loans are considered, with the FDIC's 2018 Small Business Lending Survey focusing on loans under $1 million. The FDIC's 2018 Small Business Lending Survey of 1,200 banks uses a C&I loan size limit of $1 million as a proxy for small business lending. The decline of community banks' business loans under $100,000 was highlighted by the Federal Reserve in 2015. The current low-interest-rate environment may lead lenders to increase loan sizes to cover costs and generate more revenue. This shift from smaller to larger loans could be temporary if interest rates rise in the future. The shift from smaller to larger loans in the current low-interest-rate environment may be temporary if interest rates rise in the future. Denials of SBL requests due to lenders preferring larger loans may indicate a market failure. Finding a proxy for market failure by examining the availability of SBLs of $100,000 or any size threshold is challenging. The average business loan size at small domestic banks was $117,000, while at large domestic banks it was $578,000. Despite a 51.7% increase in average C&I loan size for all domestic commercial banks, the average C&I loan size for small commercial banks increased by only 5.13%. The shift from smaller to larger loans in the low-interest-rate environment may be temporary. Denials of SBL requests due to lenders preferring larger loans may indicate a market failure. Some small business loans (SBLs) may be secured by residential real estate and counted as mortgages, potentially overstating the number of SBLs to small businesses. Data on bank C&I loans do not specifically report on loans to small firms, leading to an overstatement of SBL amounts. The demand for $100,000 SBLs from community banks may have decreased, with technology firms relying on personal savings and credit cards for financing. Conversely, the demand for larger loans may have increased. The demand for larger loans may have increased in the current low-interest-rate environment, with some firms preferring to secure larger-size loans now rather than face higher lending rates in the future. Fintech lenders, who are not required to hold capital against their loans, may be filling the gap in small business lending left by community banks, as they can take advantage of lending opportunities that may not be profitable for traditional banks. The focus on loan size or lender type may be too narrow for evaluating performance in the small business lending market. Market failure may occur if lenders are unwilling to provide loans backed by illiquid collateral, disproportionately affecting certain small businesses. Banks and credit unions provide business loans through asset-based lending guidelines requiring firms to pledge assets like cash, receivables, and inventory. For ABL purposes, small businesses can pledge assets as collateral for loans, with banks offering fully collateralized short-term loans based on performance records. Credit unions can also provide MBLs following NCUA's ABL guidelines. Some firms may have inventory that is not suitable for ABL due to difficulties in liquidation without losing value. The SBA administers programs to facilitate small business credit access for financially healthy firms with collateral or inventory less likely to satisfy ABL requirements. Borrowers must demonstrate the ability to repay with minimum business credit score, management experience, cash flow, collateral, and personal guarantees. The SBA may retain credit risk for small business loans, allowing lenders to align incentives during underwriting. SBA-guaranteed loans have higher rates due to guarantee and servicing fees, compensating for the agency retaining default risk and illiquid collateral. The SBA has reported an increase in guaranteed lending post-recession, potentially mitigating market failures. Government intervention through SBA-guaranteed loans is debated, as it may require additional appropriations if borrowers default. Repayment of SBA loans could indicate market correction, while defaults suggest no initial market failure. The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (CRA; P.L. 95-128) encourages banking institutions to meet the credit needs of their entire communities, especially in low- and moderate-income areas. The federal banking regulatory agencies implement the CRA by issuing credits for compliance. The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) encourages banks to meet the credit needs of low- and moderate-income areas by issuing credits for qualifying activities. Banks receive performance ratings based on these credits, which are considered for various banking applications. Small business loans that meet size and purpose tests can also receive CRA credit if they promote community and economic development. Small business loans under $1 million must promote community and economic development to qualify for CRA credit. Distribution of these loans across income categories shows 5.2% in low-income tracts, 16.7% in moderate-income tracts, 40% in middle-income tracts, and 37.9% in upper-income tracts. Loans exceeding $1 million may also receive CRA credit. The data in the figure show lending activity in LMI tracts, with approximately 20% of loans in these areas being small business loans. It is challenging to determine if credit accessibility is an issue for small businesses in LMI areas due to factors like lower demand for credit and fewer lending opportunities in these areas. The data on SBLs awarded CRA credit do not provide a way to measure the demand for SBLs in LMI areas. Congress has called for the collection of data from small business lenders to evaluate the small business credit market's performance, including the pricing of SBLs. Determining if small business loans (SBLs) are competitively priced is challenging due to imperfect information and information assymetry in the market. Competitive pricing is when loan prices are not substantially higher than the risks posed by borrowers and costs to acquire funds. This can lead to inefficient outcomes in the small business credit market. Relationship lending and disclosure laws can help alleviate market failures in the small business credit market by providing lenders with more information about borrowers' financial behaviors, leading to less stringent collateral requirements and greater access to credit at a lower price over time. Disclosure laws, like the Truth-In-Lending Act of 1968, require lenders to disclose credit costs to consumers, aiming to make borrowers aware of loan expenses and prevent excessive rates and fees. These disclosures can reduce lenders' incentives to charge high markups and result in lower loan prices. However, TILA only applies to mortgage and consumer loans, not business loans, prompting legislative proposals to extend its coverage. Legislative proposals in Congress aim to extend TILA disclosures to small firms, like H.R. 5660, the Small Business Credit Card Act of 2018, for businesses with 50 or fewer employees. It is uncertain if TILA protections for business credit would lead to more competitive loan terms. Evidence suggests that TILA protections may not prompt small businesses to seek lower borrowing rates, as some already use credit options covered by TILA, such as personal credit cards and home equity loans. The Dodd-Frank Act mandates financial institutions to report credit application data from women-owned, minority-owned, and small businesses to facilitate fair lending enforcement and identify development needs. The CFPB is authorized to collect various data on small business credit applications, including application details and outcomes. The CFPB is seeking public comment on small business financing market data, including business lending data and costs. They are requesting information on small business definition, data points, financial institutions engaged in business lending, access to credit, and privacy concerns. The CFPB is seeking feedback on small business lending data and costs, including what data financial institutions should collect and report. They are also evaluating the performance of the small business lending market and the challenges of collecting complete data. The CFPB is facing challenges in implementing a rule for small business lending data reporting, including the need for digital conversion and potential impact on institutions offering tailored financial products. Financial institutions may adjust loan amounts to cover reporting costs, affecting market performance. The ability to evaluate the performance of small business lending market segments is challenging, with policymakers interested in addressing market failures that impede small business access to capital. Better data on the market, including information on businesses applying for loans and types of lenders, is needed to make more definitive conclusions about small business loans availability and costs. Collecting data on small business loans, including loan products requested, lenders applied to, and application outcomes, poses legal and cost challenges."
