    "content": "The \"Home Energy Assistance Act of 2005\" is a tax credit against residential heating costs under section 25E of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Home Energy Assistance Act of 2005\" provides a tax credit for residential heating costs. The credit is limited to $500 per year for individuals and is subject to income limitations. The tax credit for residential heating costs is subject to income limitations based on the taxpayer's adjusted gross income. Threshold amounts are set at $80,000 for joint returns, $65,000 for heads of households, and $40,000 for others. The phaseout amount for the tax credit is $20,000 for joint returns or heads of households, and $10,000 for others. The maximum credit per household is allowed for the individual who contributes the largest portion of maintaining the household. The tax credit for increased residential heating costs can be carried back or forward if it exceeds the limitation for the current taxable year. The tax credit for increased residential heating costs can be carried forward to future taxable years, subject to limitations. Definitions for residential heating costs and principal residence are provided. The tax credit for increased residential heating costs does not require ownership of the principal residence and must be used by the taxpayer as their residence during the taxable year. Married individuals must file a joint return to qualify for the credit. If a dependent's expenses are deducted by another taxpayer, the individual cannot claim the credit for their own taxable year. The tax credit for increased residential heating costs applies to individuals for their taxable year. Homeowners associations and cooperative housing corporation members can also benefit from the credit. The section is applicable for taxable years between December 31, 2005, and January 1, 2007. The Secretary of the Treasury can reduce withholding. The Secretary of the Treasury can educate taxpayers on adjusting withholding to reflect anticipated tax credits under section 25E of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Wage withholding tables may be adjusted to account for the credit. A clerical amendment is made to the table of sections for subpart A of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The amendments made by section 25E apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2005. Large integrated oil companies are disallowed from using the LIFO method of accounting for the last taxable year ending before October 1, 2005. An applicable integrated oil company must use the FIFO method of accounting for crude oil inventories for the taxable year ending on or before September 30, 2005. This requirement is not considered a change in accounting method and does not affect future taxable years. An integrated oil company with gross receipts over $1 billion for the taxable year ending on or before September 30, 2005, must use the FIFO method for accounting for crude oil inventories, instead of the LIFO method. All persons treated as a single employer under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 are considered as one entity for this purpose."
