    "content": "The VCCR is a multilateral agreement governing consular practices, including legal rights and duties of signatory States. The United States ratified the VCCR in 1969 and also joined the Optional Protocol for dispute resolution through the International Court of Justice. However, on March 7, 2005, the United States withdrew from the Optional Protocol, no longer recognizing the ICJ's jurisdiction over VCCR claims. The VCCR Article 36 requires signatory States to inform detained foreign nationals of their right to have their consulate notified, providing potential benefits such as diplomatic assistance and legal representation. The United States no longer recognizes the ICJ's jurisdiction over VCCR claims. Despite regulations in place for federal law enforcement, there is no federal mechanism to ensure state and local adherence to consular notification obligations under the VCCR Article 36. The State Department provides informational materials, but foreign nationals detained by state and local authorities may not always receive consular information. Procedural default rules could hinder foreign nationals from seeking remedies for violations of Article 36. Foreign nationals may face challenges in seeking remedies for violations of consular notification requirements under the VCCR Article 36 due to procedural default rules that prevent reopening cases. Lower federal courts have limited jurisdiction to review state criminal convictions, requiring claims to be raised in state court first for federal habeas relief. The Supreme Court granted certiorari in two cases concerning Article 36 violations, Moises Sanchez-Llamas v. Oregon and Bustillo v. Johnson, involving state convictions of foreign nationals not informed of their consular rights. Recent legal developments raised questions about the precedential value of prior rulings on VCCR Article 36 enforcement. Recent legal developments have raised questions about the precedential value of prior rulings on VCCR Article 36 enforcement. Germany and Mexico brought claims before the ICJ against the United States for alleged Article 36 violations. The ICJ concluded that Article 36 provides covered individuals with a right to consular notification, and a violation of that right may require review and reconsideration of a foreign national's sentence and conviction. The application of procedural default rules to bar the raising of Article 36 claims prevents \"full effect\" from being given to the intended rights. In Mexico v. United States of America, the ICJ reaffirmed U.S. obligations under VCCR Article 36. The United States recognized ICJ jurisdiction until withdrawing from the Optional Protocol. Petitioner Sanchez-Llamas, a Mexican national, was arrested for attempted murder in Oregon. Sanchez-Llamas was arrested and not informed of his right to have the Mexican consulate notified. He made incriminating statements during interrogation, leading to his conviction. The Oregon courts denied his motion to suppress the statements, stating that VCCR Article 36 does not guarantee consular access. Bustillo, a Honduran national, was convicted of murder in Virginia without being informed of his right to consulate notification. Bustillo, a Honduran national convicted of murder in Virginia, filed a habeas petition arguing his rights under Article 36 were violated. The Virginia Court of Appeals dismissed his claim as procedurally barred, upheld by the Virginia Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme Court, in an opinion by Chief Justice Roberts, denied petitioners' claims for relief, considering whether Article 36 creates a judicially-enforceable right to consular notification. In the Breard case, the Supreme Court did not definitively resolve whether Article 36 confers an individual right to consular assistance after arrest. The majority concluded that even if such a right existed, the petitioners were not entitled to the remedies they sought. Justice Breyer and others in dissent argued that Article 36 grants rights that can be invoked by a foreign national in a judicial proceeding. The exclusionary rule is used to suppress evidence gathered in violation of a defendant's constitutional rights, but the Court did not address whether this is an appropriate remedy for an Article 36 violation. The Supreme Court rejected suppression of evidence as a remedy for an Article 36 violation, emphasizing that the VCCR does not require it. The Court stated that the exclusionary rule is a U.S. legal creation and not universally accepted, making it unlikely for the VCCR to mandate evidence suppression. The Supreme Court rejected the argument for a judicial remedy to enforce Article 36 rights in state-court criminal proceedings, stating that the VCCR does not mandate such a remedy. The Court emphasized that it does not have supervisory power over state courts and cannot impose remedies not provided for in the treaty. The Court concluded that the exclusionary rule would not be an appropriate remedy for violations of Article 36 rights, as these rights differ from those traditionally protected by the rule. Article 36 only guarantees a foreign national the right to have their consulate informed of their arrest, not substantive consular intervention or a prohibition on police interrogation. Therefore, the Court deemed suppression as a disproportionate remedy for an Article 36 violation. The Court found that suppression would be a disproportionate remedy for an Article 36 violation, as the rights protected by Article 36 differ from those traditionally covered by the exclusionary rule. Other constitutional and statutory protections already safeguard the interests claimed under Article 36, such as the right to an attorney and protection against self-incrimination. The Court suggested alternative remedies for Article 36 violations, including diplomatic options and raising claims in judicial proceedings regarding the voluntariness of police interrogations. Justice Ginsburg concurred with the Court's decision, while Justice Breyer dissented, leaving open the possibility of suppression as a remedy in different circumstances. The dissenting justices, led by Justice Breyer, disagreed with the majority's stance on the proper remedy for Article 36 violations. They believed that suppression of evidence could be appropriate in cases where prejudice could only be cured by such a remedy. They suggested remanding the cases to state courts to consider suppression based on the specific circumstances. The Court also addressed whether state procedural default rules could prevent the raising of Article 36 claims in a timely manner, reaffirming previous decisions on the matter. The Court reaffirmed its decision in Breard regarding state procedural default rules applying to Article 36 claims, despite the ICJ's rulings in LaGrand and Avena. The Court emphasized that while the ICJ's interpretations deserve consideration, they are not binding on U.S. courts. The Supreme Court emphasized its duty to interpret federal law independently from the International Court of Justice (ICJ), especially regarding the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (VCCR) Article 36. Despite considering the ICJ's interpretation, the Court found it unpersuasive, particularly in relation to procedural default rules in the U.S. legal system. The ICJ's interpretation of Article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations suggested that it could potentially override procedural default rules in the U.S. legal system. The Court disposed of Bustillo's claim by comparing Article 36 to Miranda claims. The Court declined to provide an exception to procedural default rules for Article 36 claims, stating that the same principles apply to all rights, including fundamental constitutional protections. The Court emphasized that its decision does not diminish the importance of the Vienna Convention. In a concurring opinion, Justice Ginsburg agreed with the Court's judgment on procedural default rules but suggested leaving open the possibility of exceptions for Article 36 claims in certain circumstances. Justice Breyer, in dissent, argued that the ICJ's rulings in LaGrand and Avena did not require a broad exception to default rules, only an effective remedy for Article 36 violations. He emphasized the importance of respectful consideration of ICJ decisions on VCCR issues. The dissent in the present case argued for exceptions to procedural default rules for Article 36 claims when states fail to provide effective remedies. Despite previous Court decisions, unresolved issues remain regarding the interpretation and application of VCCR Article 36, including whether it confers an individually enforceable right and what judicial remedy may be available for violations. The unresolved issue concerns U.S. implementation of the ICJ's ruling in Avena regarding Mexican nationals' rights under the VCCR. The Supreme Court was set to rule on the enforceability of Avena in the case of Medellin v. Dretke, where a Mexican national argued for reconsideration of his conviction. President Bush issued a memorandum instructing state courts to give effect to the ICJ's ruling in Avena for Mexican nationals, leading to the dismissal of the Supreme Court's writ of certiorari in Medellin. The United States later withdrew from the Optional Protocol. The Supreme Court's decision in Sanchez-Llamas discusses the unresolved issue of whether the President can order state courts to provide a remedy for violations of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (VCCR). This raises constitutional questions about federalism and the Executive's foreign affairs power. The Court has previously ruled that executive agreements can preempt state laws, as seen in American Insurance Association v. Garamendi. In American Insurance Association v. Garamendi, the Supreme Court ruled that a California law requiring disclosure of Holocaust-era insurance policies conflicted with the President's foreign policy objectives. The President's memorandum ordering state courts to implement the ICJ's order may be treated differently, and the constitutional authority to direct state courts for foreign policy objectives is unclear. State law may be preempted in cases involving the VCCR, but the extent of the President's authority is uncertain. The Supreme Court has not dealt with situations where the federal government instructs state institutions to advance foreign policy interests. The extent of the Tenth Amendment's restriction on the federal government's treaty powers is unclear. The Texas Criminal Court of Appeals ruled in Ex Parte Medellin that state procedural default rules were not preempted by the Avena decision or the President's memorandum. The Texas state court rejected Medellin's petition for habeas relief, stating that Avena nor the President's memorandum preempted state procedural default rules. The court found that the ICJ's ruling in Avena was not binding federal law and that the President's memorandum violated the separation of powers doctrine. The court suggested that an executive agreement between Mexico and the United States might have preempted Texas's procedural bar. The Texas state court rejected Medellin's petition for habeas relief, stating that the President's memorandum did not constitute federal law and was not binding on state courts. The court's decision is potentially subject to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court."
