    "content": "Farmers and ranchers have adjusted to significant changes in the livestock and meat sectors, with consolidation in animal production, particularly in hog production, and beef and pork processing since 1980. The industry has become highly concentrated, with fewer firms dominating production and sales. Vertical coordination and integration have become more common, leading to concerns about the traditional U.S. system of smaller-scale, independent farms. The changes in the livestock and meat sectors have led to consolidation, creating closed markets with less transparency and lower prices for farmers. Some groups advocate for stronger enforcement of existing laws to prevent anti-competitive behavior, while others believe current competition and antitrust policies are sufficient. The structural changes are seen as a result of technological advancements, changing consumer demand, and international competition, bringing consumers a variety of high-quality, low-priced products. The 2008 omnibus farm bill includes provisions that may affect USDA regulation of livestock and poultry markets, such as changes to AFPA definitions and requirements for breach of contract. It also mandates USDA to issue an annual report on investigations under the Packers and Stockyards Act. The 2008 farm bill did not include certain provisions from the Senate-passed version, such as restrictions on large meat packers and changes to the Mandatory Livestock Price Reporting Program. Other provisions in the bill allow state-inspected meat to enter interstate commerce, bring catfish under USDA inspection, and modify country-of-origin labeling laws. Additionally, amendments aim to protect companion animals under the Animal Welfare Act. Market concentration in the cattle and hog sectors has increased sharply in the last two decades, with a few firms dominating each sector. The four-firm concentration ratio for cattle and hog slaughter has risen from 26% to 72% and from 33% to 66% respectively from 1963 to 2004. Market concentration in the cattle and hog sectors has increased sharply in the last two decades, with a few firms dominating each sector. The four-firm concentration ratio for cattle and hog slaughter has risen from 26% to 72% and from 33% to 66% respectively from 1963 to 2004. Continued consolidation and recent mergers could raise these concentration ratios even more, particularly in the beef sector. Individual production and marketing segments within the meat and poultry sectors differ in structure and function. The discussion focuses on the beef and pork industries, with limited information on poultry production, mostly on broiler meat. U.S. beef cattle are primarily raised on dispersed cow-calf operations, with calves sold at 6 to 12 months of age to feedlots or backgrounders. The trend in U.S. agriculture is towards fewer, larger farms, including in the beef industry where the number of operations has decreased. Despite this consolidation, small herd sizes still provide calves to feedlots. Cattle feeding has become more concentrated in larger feedlots and fewer states, with a small number of feedlots handling a significant portion of fed cattle. In 2008, the top 10 companies had the capacity to feed over 3.2 million cattle. In 2008, the top 10 companies had the capacity to feed more than 3.2 million cattle in 58 feedlots, representing about one-fourth of all cattle on feed. The top 30 operations at larger facilities account for nearly one-half of all cattle on feed. Cattle feeding is concentrated in the middle part of the country, with five states marketing 80% of all fed cattle. Meatpacking is more concentrated than the production phase, with a decrease in the number of meatpacking plants since the 1970s. In the meatpacking industry, there has been a significant decrease in the number of plants since the 1970s. Concentration has increased, with four firms slaughtering a large percentage of young cattle. The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index is used to measure industry concentration, with an HHI below 1,000 considered unconcentrated. The beef packing industry became highly concentrated by the mid-1990s with an HHI of 1,900 in 2004. Market concentration in the U.S. beef sector increased significantly after mergers and acquisitions starting in 2007, including JBS acquiring Swift & Co., National Beef Packing Company, and the Smithfield Beef Group. The U.S. Department of Justice and 13 states filed a complaint to block JBS's acquisition of National Beef Packing Company, citing concerns about consumer and producer prices. DOJ did not challenge JBS's acquisition of Smithfield Beef Group. If JBS acquires National Beef, its share of the U.S. cattle slaughter market could reach 30%. JBS became the largest cattle feeder in the U.S. after acquiring Five Rivers Ranch Cattle Feeding as part of the Smithfield deal. The acquisition of National Beef Packing Company by JBS was challenged by the U.S. Department of Justice and 13 states due to concerns about consumer and producer prices. However, JBS's acquisition of Smithfield Beef Group was not challenged, making JBS the largest cattle feeder in the U.S. This led to significant changes in hog production, with a drastic decline in the number of farms and an increase in farm size and specialization. Operations with at least 10,000 head now represent less than 1% of all producers but more than half of total U.S. production. The hog production segment of the industry has consolidated significantly, with about 30 key firms and several hundred \"significant\" operators. Vertical coordination methods drove consolidation in the 1990s, leading to a decline in small operators. Six large producers accounted for nearly 30% of U.S. hog production in 2003. In 2007, four firms slaughtered 64% of all U.S. hogs, compared to 32% in 1985. The industry became moderately concentrated in the 1990s. During the 1990s, the poultry meat sectors were highly concentrated due to vertically integrated production systems. Processing firms known as \"integrators\" owned hatcheries, processing plants, and feed mills, contracting with independent farmers to grow broiler chicks to market weight. This relationship was formalized under a production contract, where the integrator provided chicks, feed, and services, while the farmer provided labor and capital. Typically, birds were sent to slaughter after five to nine weeks on the farm, and the farmer was paid for their services. In the poultry industry, broiler production is highly concentrated in the southeastern United States, with top producing states including Georgia, Arkansas, and Alabama. The top four U.S. companies hold a significant market share in broiler processing. In the turkey meat sector, a few large companies dominate the industry. There is a trend towards vertical coordination in the red meat industry, with supply chains integrating production, processing, and marketing. The poultry industry pioneered a business model of supply chains with contractual arrangements to transform livestock into meat. Poultry producers led in delivering convenient products while controlling costs. The hog industry has followed suit with contract production arrangements with integrators. These arrangements involve agreements between farmers and buyers before harvest or livestock production. Contracts in the agricultural industry govern terms for transactions before harvest or livestock production stages, allowing farmers to shift financial risk to buyers. This shift has led to a growth in contracting at the expense of spot markets, providing buyers with a reliable supply and consumers with lower prices and higher quality products. Production contracts involve farmers providing services to contractors who own the commodity, with payment resembling a fee for service. In poultry production, processing companies provide chicks, feed, and services to farmers who raise the chicks in their facilities. Marketing contracts focus on the commodity's value, specifying price, quantity, and product attributes, with farmers retaining control until delivery. In 2005, contracts covered 50% of livestock production value, up from 33% in 1991-1993, compared to 30% of crop production in 2005 and 25% in 1991-1993. Production contracts in the hog industry increased sharply from 34% in 1996-1997 to 76% in 2005, while cattle production contracts remained constant at about 20%. Poultry and eggs are mainly raised under contract, with approximately 95% of production under contract. Dairy production saw over 50% produced under contract in 2005. Larger farms tend to use contracts more than smaller farms across all commodity types. USDA's GIPSA study outlines various alternative marketing arrangements in livestock transactions. The GIPSA study defines alternative marketing arrangements (AMAs) as alternatives to the cash market, including forward contracts, marketing agreements, procurement or marketing contracts, production contracts, packer ownership, custom feeding, and custom slaughter. AMAs accounted for 38% of fed beef cattle volume, 89% of finished hog volume, and 44% of lamb volume sold to packers between October 2002 and March 2005. In the beef sector, the 29 largest beef packing plants obtained 62% of their cattle on the cash market, 29% through marketing agreements, 4.5% through forward contracts, and 5% through packer ownership or other methods. The study found that packer ownership accounted for a small percentage of beef and lamb transactions but a significant portion of pork transactions. Concerns about market power led to the passage of antitrust laws in the early 1900s. Despite these laws, five large meat packers continued to control the industry through price agreements and territorial division. The Federal Trade Commission's 1917-1918 investigation found that the Big Five meat packers controlled a large portion of the cattle, calves, hogs, and sheep markets. In 1920, they agreed to a consent decree to limit their ownership in various sectors. Despite this, Congress passed the P&S Act in 1921 due to ongoing concerns about market performance. The Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921 prohibits discriminatory practices and activities that could harm competition in the meatpacking industry. The act also prohibits unfair, deceptive practices and the manipulation of prices to restrain commerce or create a monopoly. Regulatory responsibility for the act is assigned to the Department's Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration (GIPSA). Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration (GIPSA) enforces fair competition regulations in the livestock industry. GIPSA can investigate violations and issue \"cease and desist\" orders with civil fines. Serious violations may be referred to the Department of Justice for enforcement. Most violations are corrected voluntarily, with disciplinary action as a last resort. The enforcement of fair competition regulations in the livestock industry involves investigating violations and issuing \"cease and desist\" orders with civil fines. If serious violations persist, they may be referred to the Department of Justice for enforcement. Legal actions, such as mergers and acquisitions that may restrict market access or suppress competition, are regulated by laws like the Sherman Act, Clayton Act, and Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. Parties involved in such actions must file notifications to the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission for review within 30 days. The DOJ or FTC merger review aims to prevent anti-competitive conduct by assessing whether a merger would substantially lessen market competition, in violation of the Clayton Act. Pre-merger remedies may include legal action to stop the merger or conditioning approval on modifications to address antitrust concerns. Negotiating changes is preferred over going to court due to cost and risk. The Capper-Volstead Act provides limited exemption from antitrust liability to farmer cooperatives for their joint processing and marketing of commodities. Violations of antitrust laws can include collusion under Section 1 of the Sherman Act and monopolization under Section 2. Predatory practices and exclusionary conduct are examples of antitrust violations. The Capper-Volstead Act allows farmer cooperatives to collectively process and market agricultural products in interstate and foreign commerce. The USDA has the authority to address complaints against cooperatives that engage in monopolistic practices. The Antitrust Modernization Commission found that U.S. antitrust laws are generally effective but can be improved for better enforcement. The Antitrust Modernization Commission found that U.S. antitrust laws are generally effective but can be improved. It recommended changes to certain laws and policies, including the Agricultural Fair Practices Act to protect farmers from retaliation. The act allows farmers to file complaints with USDA if their rights are violated. Lawmakers may consider the impact of increased market concentration on livestock markets and farm prices. Congress in 1991 funded an extensive examination of meatpacking concentration through GIPSA, contracting projects to universities. Findings showed major cattle feeding states like Texas, Nebraska, and Kansas as core markets for fed cattle. Larger packers were passing efficiency gains to feeders with higher prices for larger sale lots. Research on meatpacking concentration has shown that larger packers pay higher prices for cattle closer to their plants and with higher slaughter capacities. Price impacts from packer concentration have been generally negative but small, with efficiency gains offsetting market power impacts. Captive supply methods have remained stable since the mid-1990s. The use of captive supply methods has remained stable since the mid-1990s, with evidence suggesting an increase in the last half of the decade. Larger plants strategically utilize captive supplies to maintain high plant utilization, especially as cash market prices and price variability rise. Price impacts from captive supplies have been generally negative but small, with conflicting research outcomes depending on assumptions and aspects of livestock marketing examined. The USDA official commented on the controversy surrounding livestock marketing arrangements, noting that contract prices are often tied to the spot market price. Research on the impact of these arrangements on market power has been mixed. Congress allocated $4.5 million for a study on packer ownership issues, with results expected within 24 months. GIPSA contracted RTI International to conduct a study on livestock and meat marketing practices. The final report, released in February 2007, highlighted the benefits of alternative marketing arrangements for packers and livestock producers, including cost management and product quality assurance. The report predicted that the use of alternative marketing arrangements (AMAs) is expected to increase moderately for lamb but very little or not at all for the beef and pork industries. Cash market transactions are important for small producers and packers, with reported cash prices frequently used as the base for pricing livestock and meat purchases. Small producers rely more on the cash market compared to large producers, and small packers use the cash/spot market more than large packers. The use of AMAs is associated with lower cash market prices, according to the RTI study. The RTI study found that the use of AMAs is linked to lower cash market prices, especially for finished hogs. However, restricting AMAs for livestock sales would have negative economic impacts on producers, packers, and consumers. The study noted unusual market conditions, such as high cattle prices and the discovery of BSE. Additionally, the USDA's Office of Inspector General reported that GIPSA had difficulties overseeing and managing investigative activities. The USDA's Office of Inspector General (OIG) found that investigations into anti-competitive practices were incomplete and broadly defined, with GIPSA failing to refer cases for administrative complaints since 1999. The OIG report was discussed at a hearing on GIPSA's management of the P&S Act in 2006, where it was noted that investigations lacked legal perspective and were conducted by economists without involvement of attorneys from USDA's Office of General Counsel. The USDA's Office of Inspector General (OIG) found that GIPSA's investigative practices were not suitable for complex competition-related concerns. The agency had not implemented 2000 GAO recommendations, such as integrating OGC attorneys into investigations and improving management procedures. GIPSA's incoming administrator stated that USDA was implementing OIG recommendations, including developing a management structure for policy issues and encouraging legal specialists to work with OGC. In 2006, the court declined to hear a landmark legal case under the P&S Act involving cattle feeders suing Tyson Fresh Meats for violating the act. The jury awarded over $1.2 billion in damages, but the verdict was set aside due to insufficient evidence. Appeals were rejected, upholding the lower judge's decision. The appeals court rejected the plaintiffs' argument of a violation of the P&S Act, stating that if a packer's business promotes efficiency and competition in the cattle market, it cannot adversely affect competition. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the case in 2006. Bills were introduced in Congress to address competition issues in livestock markets, with the 2008 farm bill containing provisions related to market competition. The 2008 farm bill introduces new provisions affecting USDA regulation of livestock and poultry markets, including changes to AFPA definitions, rules for breach of contract, and venue for litigation. It also mandates USDA to issue an annual report on investigations under the P&S Act. However, it did not include Senate-passed provisions aimed at more closely regulating livestock and poultry markets. The 2008 farm bill introduces new provisions affecting USDA regulation of livestock and poultry markets, including changes to AFPA definitions, rules for breach of contract, and venue for litigation. It also mandates USDA to issue an annual report on investigations under the P&S Act. The Pickett case and federal court rulings added impetus to efforts for a competition title in the farm bill during the 110th Congress. Senate Agriculture Chairman Harkin introduced a bill (S. 622) to strengthen antitrust authorities and provide new contract protections for farmers. Senator Harkin introduced bill S. 622 to develop a competition title in the new farm bill, replacing the 2002 farm bill. The bill included provisions not retained in the final version and addressed issues such as prohibiting meat packers from owning or feeding livestock and establishing a USDA Special Counsel for Competition Matters. Several provisions from these bills were included in the Senate-passed farm bill. In the legislative process leading to the 2002 farm bill, the Senate Agriculture Committee removed a competition title from the omnibus bill proposed by Chairman Harkin. However, some competition amendments were approved during floor action, including rights for producers to discuss contracts and extending protections to swine producers. The final bill also included a country-of-origin labeling program for red meat and other commodities, which has been implemented by USDA after some delays. Congress postponed mandatory meat COOL, now implemented by USDA. Representative Boswell introduced H.R. 2135 in the House, but only the arbitration provision was included in the draft bill. The provision was altered during committee markup to allow producers to seek relief in small claims court regardless of arbitration clauses. The House-passed bill did not contain other major competition language. The House-passed bill did not include major competition language. The Senate's farm bill had a new Livestock title based on Chairman Harkin's bill, while the House bill had a separate title on Horticulture and Organic Agriculture. The enacted bill included both titles, renaming the livestock title as \"Livestock.\" In the 110th Congress, a bill introduced by Senator Grassley (S. 305) aimed to prohibit meat packers from owning or controlling livestock, addressing concerns about \"captive supply\" and reduced transparency in the livestock market. The bill introduced by Senator Grassley in the 110th Congress aimed to prohibit meat packers from owning or controlling livestock, with exceptions for certain arrangements. Opponents argued that a ban could reverse efficiency gains in the livestock industry. The Senate-passed farm bill included a provision similar to the Grassley bill, prohibiting major packers from owning livestock more than 14 days before slaughter, with some exceptions. The ban applied to packers reporting prices under mandatory laws or slaughtering over 120,000 cattle annually. Exceptions included ownership arrangements made within 14 days of slaughter, cooperatives, packers not reporting to USDA, or those owning only one processing plant. The Senate-passed farm bill included a provision prohibiting major packers from owning livestock more than 14 days before slaughter, with exceptions for certain ownership arrangements. The 2008 farm bill deleted Senate language that would have restricted packer ownership, feeding, or control of livestock. Several bills in the 110th Congress aimed to address contracting inequities between agricultural producers and buyers. The Harkin bill (S. 622) and Grassley bill (S. 221) aimed to address contracting inequities in the agricultural industry by prohibiting confidentiality clauses, clarifying producer obligations, allowing arbitration with consent, and limiting a processor's contract termination rights. These amendments were deemed necessary due to agricultural consolidation leading to producers facing unfavorable contract terms from processor-buyers. In the 109th Congress, similar bills by Senator Enzi (S. 960) and Representative Pomeroy (H.R. 4257) were introduced. The bills introduced by Senator Enzi and Representative Pomeroy aimed to restrict packers from using formula pricing in forward contracts under the P&S Act. They also proposed limiting contract sizes and requiring public bidding for contracts. Supporters argued that these measures would prevent packers from manipulating prices, while opponents believed such contracts were necessary for ensuring a steady supply of livestock for high-capacity plants. The proposed bills aim to regulate pricing arrangements in the livestock industry, which opponents argue could harm producers who rely on contracts to manage price volatility and secure capital. Chairman Harkin's bill would expand regulations to cover crops similar to livestock under the P&S Act, prohibiting unfair or deceptive practices in marketing and contracting. The Senate-passed farm bill proposed changes to the Agricultural Fair Practices Act (AFPA), expanding definitions, broadening prohibited practices, and aligning enforcement provisions with the creation of a Special Counsel for Agricultural Competition. These changes aim to address concerns about the effectiveness of the AFPA in regulating unfair practices in the agricultural industry. The 2008 farm bill amended the Agricultural Fair Practices Act to include organizations exclusively for agricultural producers. It also allowed poultry or swine growers to cancel contracts within three days. The conference language in the contract now requires contractors to disclose the possibility of additional capital investments. Chairman Harkin's bill, S. 622, proposed the creation of a USDA Office of Special Counsel for Competition Matters. This bill also included provisions from Senator Grassley's bill, S. 1759, which aimed to establish a USDA Special Counsel for Competition Matters and other changes to address agricultural competition issues. S. 622 proposed amendments to the Packers and Stockyards Act to enhance producer rights and USDA enforcement. It included the creation of a Special Counsel for Agricultural Competition at USDA to investigate violations of competition laws. The bill aimed to address concerns about inadequate oversight and enforcement by GIPSA officials. The Senate proposed amendments to the Packers and Stockyards Act, including the creation of a Special Counsel for Agricultural Competition at USDA to investigate violations of competition laws and act as a liaison with other agencies. Provisions aimed to strengthen USDA enforcement authorities over live poultry dealers, allow contract growers to discuss terms with others, and provide remedies for violations, including litigation costs. The Senate provisions aim to protect contract producers by allowing them to cancel contracts within three days of execution and giving them 90 days to correct breaches before termination. Producers who invest $100,000 or more must be given time to rectify breaches. Packers, poultry dealers, and swine contractors are prohibited from requiring additional investments without agreement from the producer. The Senate bill aims to protect contract producers by allowing contract cancellation within three days and giving 90 days to correct breaches. Producers investing $100,000+ must be given time to rectify breaches. Prohibited are additional investments without producer agreement. The bill also allows for producer choice of jurisdiction and venue, and arbitration to settle disputes with written consent. Some proposals to make it easier for producers to prove unfair treatment under the P&S Act were not included in the bill. The Senate bill aims to protect contract producers by allowing contract cancellation within three days and giving 90 days to correct breaches. Producers investing $100,000+ must be given time to rectify breaches. Prohibited are additional investments without producer agreement. The bill also allows for producer choice of jurisdiction and venue, and arbitration to settle disputes with written consent. S.Amdt. 3666 was debated but voted against during the Senate floor debate. Other Senate amendments proposed changes to AFPA and P&S Act definitions, enforcement requirements, and packer ban requirements in the farm bill, but were not adopted. Initially, the House farm bill included a provision on arbitration clauses in livestock and poultry contracts. The House Agriculture Subcommittee on Dairy, Livestock, and Poultry altered the arbitration provision in H.R. 2135 during committee markup. Another related proposal, H.R. 2213, was not adopted in the House farm bill. The arbitration provision in the House bill directed USDA to establish regulatory standards for arbitration provisions in livestock and poultry contracts, allowing producers to seek relief in small claims court regardless of an arbitration clause. The House bill did not contain any other provisions amending the P&S Act. Several of these provisions were retained in the enacted 2008 farm bill. The enacted 2008 farm bill amended the P&S Act by adding provisions to give producers additional protections when disputing contract terms. Senate provisions to strengthen USDA's oversight and enforcement of the act were deleted, along with provisions to give USDA stronger enforcement authorities over live poultry dealers. A Senate provision to establish a new Special Counsel for Agricultural Competition was also removed, replaced with a requirement for an annual report on investigations into possible violations of the P&S Act. The 2008 farm bill amended the P&S Act to provide producers with additional protections in contract disputes, including the ability to cancel contracts within three business days, clear disclosure of cancellation terms, and provisions for dealing with contract disputes. The bill also requires USDA to issue rules on criteria such as the reasonable period of time for producers to remedy breaches before contract cancellation. One key issue in the 111th Congress is the USDA rulemaking related to alleged practices in the poultry and hog sectors. The 2008 farm bill amended the P&S Act to provide producers with additional protections in contract disputes, including the ability to cancel contracts within three business days and clear disclosure of cancellation terms. USDA must publish regulations within two years to establish criteria for determining violations related to undue preferences, notice of suspension, capital investments, and breach remedies in the poultry and hog sectors. The Livestock Mandatory Reporting Program (LMPR) was initially passed in 1999 to address concerns about low livestock prices and industry concentration. The program expired multiple times but was extended through legislation. In 2005, the program operated on a voluntary basis as Congress debated reauthorization and potential changes. In 2005, the House approved a bill (H.R. 3408) to extend LMPR for five years and amend hog reporting provisions. The Senate approved a one-year extension (S. 1613). In September 2006, the Senate cleared the House-passed version, which was signed into law (P.L. 109-296) on October 5, 2006. During the 110th Congress, there were discussions about further changes to LMPR, with the Senate proposing new mandatory daily product information reporting for dairy products and changes to swine reporting. The House version did not include any changes to the program. The 2008 farm bill did not make any changes to the current mandatory price reporting program. It requires USDA to study the economic impacts of requiring plants to report pork product sales and improve electronic reporting and publishing under the program."
