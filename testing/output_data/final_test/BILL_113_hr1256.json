    "content": "The \"Swap Jurisdiction Certainty Act\" is the short title of this Act. It involves joint rulemaking on cross-border swaps. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission must issue joint rules within 270 days of the Act's enactment, regarding the application of U.S. swaps requirements for cross-border swaps and security-based swaps involving U.S. or non-U.S. persons. The rules must be identical, with necessary accommodations. The Commissions will issue joint rules addressing the connections to the United States that require non-U.S. persons to register as swap dealers or participants, and which U.S. swaps requirements apply to non-U.S. persons' activities outside the United States. The Commissions will issue joint rules regarding the application of U.S. swaps requirements to non-U.S. persons, including exemptions for those complying with foreign regulatory requirements. No guidance or agreements can replace the requirement for a joint rule from the Commissions. The rules will apply to non-U.S. persons in countries with the nine largest swap and security-based swap markets. The largest swap and security-based swap markets by notional amount in the previous calendar year, or other foreign jurisdictions jointly determined by the Commissions, may be exempt from U.S. swaps requirements unless deemed not equivalent. The exemption applies to persons or transactions involving specified countries or regions. The Commissions will jointly determine exempt foreign jurisdictions for swap and security-based swap markets based on notional amount. Criteria for regulatory requirements will be established for countries or administrative regions. The Commissions will jointly determine the appropriate application of certain United States swap requirements to persons or transactions involving foreign jurisdictions based on criteria such as the scope and objectives of regulatory requirements, effectiveness of supervisory compliance programs, and enforcement authority. Beginning on the date of final rules issuance, the Commissions will jointly assess the regulatory requirements of foreign countries or regions to determine if they are equivalent to US swaps requirements. If a determination is made, a report will be submitted to Congress. The Commissions will assess foreign regulatory requirements to determine equivalence with US swaps requirements. If a determination is made that they are not equivalent, a written report will be submitted to Congress within 30 days. The definition of \"U.S. person\" is provided for the Act and related rules. The definition of \"U.S. person\" includes any individual, entity, or account based in the United States, as defined by the Commissions. It excludes international financial organizations like the IMF and IBRD.
