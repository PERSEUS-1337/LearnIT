    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Trade Complaint and Litigation Accountability Improvement Measures Act\" or the \"Trade CLAIM Act\". It involves the review of determinations made by the United States Trade Representative by the Court of International Trade. Section 1581 of title 28, United States Code is amended to give the Court of International Trade exclusive jurisdiction over civil actions requesting the United States Trade Representative to review determinations under the Trade Act of 1974. The United States Trade Representative considers petitions to enforce US trade rights. The United States Trade Representative amends Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 to remove specific direction from the President regarding actions. The United States Trade Representative may require a foreign country to eliminate certain acts, policies, or practices that restrict U.S. commerce. If the foreign country cannot achieve this, they may offer compensatory trade benefits equivalent to the restriction. In exceptional cases, the Trade Representative may take extraordinary actions. The Trade Representative may take extraordinary actions if the impact on the US economy outweighs the benefits or if it poses a serious threat to national security. The Trade Representative can take extraordinary actions under subsection (a) or (b) to relieve burdens on US commerce. Amendments are made to section 302 of the Trade Act of 1974 regarding the initiation of investigations based on alleged facts. Amendments are made to various sections of the Trade Act of 1974, including consultation procedures and implementation of actions. Monitoring of foreign compliance is also addressed in the amendments. Amendments to the Trade Act of 1974 include changes to monitoring foreign compliance and modification/termination of actions."
