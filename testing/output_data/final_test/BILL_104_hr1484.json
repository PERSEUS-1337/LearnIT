The Public Safety Employer-Employee Relations Act of 1995 emphasizes trust, mutual respect, and open communication in labor-management relationships. Dispute resolution procedures should be fair, fast, and inexpensive. The act aims to promote cooperation between labor and management to serve the public interest effectively. The Public Safety Employer-Employee Relations Act of 1995 promotes trust, mutual respect, and open communication in labor-management relationships. It emphasizes resolving issues through collective bargaining and utilizing governmental facilities for conciliation, mediation, and voluntary arbitration to reach agreements on pay, hours, and working conditions. Mediation and conciliation can help minimize controversies arising from collective bargaining agreements. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines the terms \"Director\" as the Director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, \"firefighter\" as an employee primarily involved in fire control and emergency medical care, and \"law enforcement officer\" as a member of a law enforcement agency in a law enforcement position. The term \"law enforcement officer\" refers to an individual serving in a law enforcement position with formal training and the power to make arrests. A \"law enforcement agency\" is a public agency responsible for preventing or investigating crimes. The term excludes management or supervisory employees. The terms \"employer\" and \"public safety employer\" refer to any State, political subdivision, the District of Columbia, or any territory under the provisions of chapter 8 of title 29, United States Code. SEC. 4. RIGHT OF FIREFIGHTERS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS TO ORGANIZE AND BARGAIN COLLECTIVELY. Firefighters and law enforcement officers have the right to self-organize, form labor organizations, bargain collectively, and engage in concerted activities for mutual aid or protection. This Act applies to states and political subdivisions without laws providing equal or greater protection for these rights. Employers and labor organizations can petition the Director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service for determination. The Director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service will determine compliance with ordinances, with enforcement power as in subsection (f). Regulations will be issued within a year to implement the Act. Existing collective bargaining units and agreements approved by public employee relations boards or commissions are not affected. The Act invalidates agreements made by management officials with any State or political subdivision. When an impasse is certified, the Director establishes a Board of Inquiry to investigate and resolve the dispute within 30 days. The Director establishes a Board of Inquiry to investigate and resolve disputes within 30 days. The written report contains findings and recommendations for a peaceful settlement. Board members without pecuniary interest serve without compensation. Government officials serving on the board established under this section may be reimbursed for necessary expenses. Members not covered by this provision may receive compensation at a rate set by the Director, not exceeding the daily rate for GS-15. After an impasse is certified, no changes can be made to the existing status quo without agreement from both parties. The Director can request the Attorney General to enforce the Act's provisions after an investigation. States are not immune from legal action for violations. In legal actions against a State for violating the Act, remedies are available to the same extent as in actions against other entities. SEC. 5 prohibits strikes and lockouts for public safety employers and employees. SEC. 6 addresses suits involving labor organizations. Suits for violation of contracts between public safety employer and labor organization can be brought in any US district court regardless of amount or citizenship. Labor organizations are bound by agent acts, can sue or be sued as an entity, and money judgments are enforceable against the organization. For actions and proceedings involving labor organizations in US district courts, jurisdiction is established based on where the organization's principal office is located or where its authorized officers or agents represent employee members. Service of legal process on an officer or agent of a labor organization is considered service on the organization itself. In determining agency for legal purposes, authorization or ratification of specific acts is not the sole factor considered. Authorization of appropriations is granted to carry out the provisions of this Act. The Act will become effective 60 days after its enactment."
