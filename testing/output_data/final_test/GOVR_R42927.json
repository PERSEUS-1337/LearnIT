The U.S. defers taxing this income until it is repatriated, leading to issues like profit shifting and tax avoidance. This report focuses on the profit shifting aspect of international business. The report analyzes profit shifting behavior of American companies with overseas operations, showing disproportionate profits in tax haven countries compared to traditional economies. Profits exceed national output in some cases, indicating a trend of increasing profit shifting over time. The economic research shows American companies are shifting profits to reduce tax liabilities, costing the government billions in lost revenue. Estimates range from $57 billion to $90 billion in 2008. Media reports suggest companies like Apple, Cisco, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft are involved in profit shifting. Companies like Apple, Cisco, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft are using tax planning techniques to shift profits to low tax countries and reduce their U.S. tax liabilities. Policymakers are aware of this profit shifting behavior, with hearings held by the Senate Subcommittee on Investigations and bills introduced in Congress to address the issue. Foreign policymakers, including Prime Minister David Cameron, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, and British Chancellor George Osborne, are concerned about tax avoidance by American companies operating abroad. They have called for coordinated efforts among G20 countries to prevent profit shifting and protect the global corporate tax base. The Bureau of Economic Analysis collects data on where American companies report profits from foreign markets. American companies operating in foreign markets, known as U.S. multinational companies (MNCs), report profits and business information. The Bureau of Economic Analysis analyzes data to determine if U.S. MNCs are shifting profits, focusing on 10 countries including tax preferred or tax haven countries. Foreign policymakers are concerned about tax avoidance by American companies and call for coordinated efforts to prevent profit shifting. The study analyzes profits reported by U.S. multinational companies in tax preferred countries like Bermuda, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, compared to more traditional economies like Australia, Canada, Germany, Mexico, and the United Kingdom. The analysis includes comparing profits with the companies' real economic presence in each country group based on foreign affiliate employment. The study compares profits reported by U.S. multinational companies in tax preferred countries with more traditional economies based on foreign affiliate employment and capital expenditures. GDP is used to measure the size of the economies analyzed. The analysis focused on U.S. multinational companies' profits in foreign countries, adjusting GDP figures for purchasing power parity. Only nonbank parent companies with majority-owned nonbank foreign affiliates were considered due to data limitations. In 2008, majority-owned foreign affiliates accounted for 94% of affiliates. American MNCs reported earning 43% of their overseas profits in tax preferred countries like Bermuda, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. In 2008, American MNCs reported earning 14% of all profits abroad in Australia, Canada, Germany, Mexico, and the United Kingdom. The share of profits reported in traditional economies has declined over the last decade, accounting for 35% in 1999. Profits in these countries have decreased by approximately 60% over the sample period, possibly due to shifts in real production and business activities. This trend could indicate profit shifting. The data analysis shows a significant difference in investment and hiring patterns between traditional economies and tax preferred countries. American companies predominantly hire workers and make investments in traditional economies like Australia, Canada, Germany, Mexico, and the United Kingdom, indicating a potential disconnect between reported profits and actual business activities. American companies are reducing their presence in traditional economies like Australia, Canada, Germany, Mexico, and the United Kingdom, with a decline in employment and investment. This has led to a decrease in profits reported in these countries. In contrast, employment and investment have remained stable in tax preferred countries like Bermuda, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. In tax preferred countries, reported profits have increased significantly without a corresponding rise in employment or investment, suggesting profit shifting. Figure 3 illustrates the discrepancy in reported profits relative to investment and employment between traditional and tax preferred economies. In tax preferred countries, American companies reported significantly higher profits per employee compared to traditional economies. The ratio of profits reported per investment in tax preferred countries was also much higher than in traditional economies, indicating potential profit shifting. The return on investment in tax preferred countries is higher than in traditional economies, suggesting profit shifting by American MNCs. Despite the rise in profits, there is no increase in employment or investment in countries like Bermuda, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. This supports the hypothesis that American MNCs are engaged in profit shifting. American MNCs are reporting increasing profits as a percentage of GDP in tax preferred countries, with profits reaching 33% in 2008. The weighted averages in Figure 4 mask the significant increase in profits reported by U.S. MNCs affiliates in individual tax preferred countries, such as Bermuda and Luxembourg. For example, in Bermuda, profits increased from 260% of GDP in 1999 to over 1000% in 2008, while in Luxembourg, profits went from 19% of GDP in 1999 to 208% in 2008. American companies are reporting increasing profits in tax preferred countries, with profits reaching 33% of GDP in 2008. Bermuda and Luxembourg saw significant increases in profits, with Bermuda's profits increasing from 260% of GDP in 1999 to over 1000% in 2008, and Luxembourg's profits increasing from 19% to 208% in the same period. Other countries like Ireland, the Netherlands, and Switzerland also saw notable increases in profits as a share of GDP. There is a caveat to the analysis of MNC profits, as some argue that income from equity investments may lead to double counting. Kimberly Clausing addresses this issue using alternative data series produced by the BEA. Kimberly Clausing finds similar results using alternative BEA data, despite its own problems. The debate over taxing American MNCs involves policy considerations, such as limiting tax strategies and profit shifting. Congress debates how profit shifting would be affected by different tax systems. The debate over taxing American MNCs involves discussions on changing tax systems, reducing corporate tax rates, and adopting formula apportionment. There are concerns about profit shifting and its impact on investment financing. If the U.S. taxes income earned by foreign subsidiaries, the cost of capital would increase. Anti-abuse provisions could focus on operations in tax havens or preferred countries. Congress has enacted provisions like subpart F to prevent income shifting to tax havens. An exception exists for \"active financing income.\" The active financing exception to subpart F income is set to expire in 2013. This exception allows American corporations operating banking, financing, and insurance abroad to defer taxes on their income until repatriated. There are arguments for and against keeping this exception, with some believing it is used for tax avoidance rather than financing real operations. Congress may choose to modify or let the exception expire. One option to address concerns about the active financing exception is to impose a minimum tax on income earned in countries with low tax rates. This tax would apply to deferred income from countries with rates below a certain threshold, such as 20%. Income from countries with rates below 20% would face a 20% U.S. tax, while income from countries with higher rates would be exempt. Some worry about the complexity of implementing this minimum tax and the potential for firms to shift investments to countries just above the threshold. The U.S. currently taxes multinational corporations worldwide but there is interest in switching to a territorial tax system. This system would exempt income earned outside the U.S., potentially enhancing the competitiveness of American firms in foreign markets. Switching to a territorial tax system may not necessarily increase the competitiveness of U.S. firms, as the current system allows for tax planning to lower the effective tax rate on foreign earned income. Adopting a system like Japan's could actually result in higher taxes on foreign income if the foreign country's tax rate is below 20%. Anti-abuse provisions would be necessary to prevent exploitation of the system. Reducing the 35% top statutory corporate tax rate could decrease profit shifting incentives under a territorial system. Anti-abuse provisions, especially regarding the transfer of intangible assets, are crucial in curbing profit shifting. For more details on profit shifting under a territorial system, refer to CRS Report R42624. Reducing the U.S. tax rate could decrease profit shifting incentives to low-tax countries. However, even with a reduced rate, the U.S. would still be considered a high tax country compared to tax havens. Combining a rate reduction with a broadening of the tax base could help offset any revenue loss. This reduction is crucial in international tax policy debates, affecting American companies' competitiveness in the global market. The adoption of a formula apportionment approach to taxation has been suggested to reduce profit shifting by American companies. This method would pool income earned worldwide and allow countries to tax a share of total profits based on real business activity conducted in each country. For example, a U.S. company with 60% of its employees in the U.S. and 40% in Canada would be taxed accordingly on income earned in each country. The formula apportionment approach to taxation is suggested to reduce profit shifting by American companies. This method would allow countries to tax a share of total profits based on real business activity conducted in each country, considering factors like employee location, assets, and sales. Coordination with countries worldwide would be necessary for formula apportionment. Other large economies are also concerned about profit shifting and open to coordinated efforts to address it, as indicated by German Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble and British Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne. The U.S. Treasury has discussed coordination on tax avoidance with European and Asian leaders, suggesting that coordination on corporate tax avoidance is plausible. Coordination on corporate tax avoidance is plausible and may be mutually beneficial given budget shortfalls in the U.S. and Europe. This effort may require renegotiating existing tax treaties."
