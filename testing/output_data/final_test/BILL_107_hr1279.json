    "content": "The \"Annual Assay Commission Act\" may be cited as the short title. The findings section is included in the Act. The Congress finds that it is important for citizens and buyers of US Mint products to know that gold, silver, and platinum coins meet legal standards. An assay commission ensured this from 1792 to 1977, and since then, the US Mint has produced bullion coins of specified purity levels. The United States Mint produces gold and silver commemorative coins worth over $1 billion since 1982. Numismatists play a role in marketing and merchandising coins, with an annual assay being important. An annual ceremony is needed to ensure coins meet statutory requirements and involve the public in the assay process. SEC. 3. ANNUAL ASSAY REQUIRED. Annual assay is required to ensure conformity in the composition and weight of minor coinage, subsidiary denominations, dollar coins, and coins struck in precious metals. An assay commission appointed by the President conducts the annual assay to test the fineness and weight of reserved coins. The assay commission, composed of numismatists, is appointed annually by the President to test the fineness and weight of reserved coins. Members serve for one year without pay and must wait at least 5 years before re-appointment. The assay commission, composed of numismatists, is appointed annually by the President to test the fineness and weight of reserved coins. Members serve for one year without pay and must wait at least 5 years before re-appointment.

The assay commission, appointed annually by the President, tests coin fineness and weight. Members serve for one year without pay and meet on the second Wednesday in February at a US mint or in Washington, DC. Expenses are paid by the Secretary from the US Mint Public Enterprise Fund. Superintendents select and transfer coins according to Treasury regulations. The United States mint selects and transfers specimens of coins for assay at the Office of the Director of the Mint in Washington, D.C. Specimen coins for special assay and testing are taken at random for each issue of circulating coins, with specific quantities required based on the denomination. Coins not described in the previous paragraphs are also subject to similar testing procedures. The United States mint selects and transfers specimens of coins for assay at the Office of the Director of the Mint in Washington, D.C. Specimen coins for special assay and testing are taken at random for each issue of circulating coins, with specific quantities required based on the denomination. Other coins, including bullion and special numismatic coins, are also subject to similar testing procedures where specimen coins are selected in specific quantities by the Secretary of the Treasury. The assay commission selects and tests coins for fineness and weight. If the coins meet the standard regulations, the trial is considered satisfactory. The assay commission certifies any coin deviations to the Director of the Mint and the Secretary of the Treasury for appropriate action. Specimen coins may undergo laboratory testing for composition and weight conformity. The Director of the Mint is required to submit an annual report. The Director of the Mint prepares an annual report containing the assay commission's report and laboratory test results, which is then submitted to Congress. The Director of the Mint may produce assay commission medals for members, with bronze copies available for sale to the public."
