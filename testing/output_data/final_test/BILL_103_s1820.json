    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Computer Equipment and Technology Export Control Reform Act\". Annual review of controls on computers is required. The Export Administration Act of 1979 is amended to include a new subsection requiring periodic reviews of export controls on computer equipment and technology to remove outdated requirements for licenses. The Secretary must conduct these reviews within specific timeframes to ensure controls align with current objectives. The Secretary must conduct periodic reviews of export controls on computer equipment and technology to remove outdated license requirements. The reviews must identify specific objectives and expected outcomes for each country requiring a validated license. The Secretary must estimate the quantity and performance of computer systems needed by countries with validated license requirements to defeat export control objectives. Evaluation of export controls effectiveness includes assessing availability of computer equipment to controlled destinations. The Secretary must estimate the quantity and performance of computer systems needed by countries with validated license requirements to defeat export control objectives. Evaluation of export controls effectiveness includes assessing availability of computer equipment to controlled destinations, including computer communications, networking equipment, software, and related technology subject to export controls. This includes items sourced from countries without export controls, potential diversion over international networks, export license authorizations from non-US countries, and indigenous production. The Secretary evaluates the economic impact of export controls on companies, including lost sales and administrative overhead. After each review, the Secretary may increase export thresholds based on findings. The review findings warrant the establishment of export control thresholds for computer systems based on performance levels. These thresholds determine eligibility for delivery under distribution licenses, shipment under general licenses to non-controlled countries, defining 'supercomputers', and the need for validated licenses for exports to controlled countries. The Secretary must provide specific rationale for any recommended increase in computer system performance levels. If a review is not completed by the deadline, performance levels will double after 90 days without requiring regulatory changes. The Secretary must report to Congress and the Computer Systems Technical Advisory Committee. The Computer Systems Technical Advisory Committee must review the Secretary's report and provide a concise statement to Congress within 60 days, stating their agreement or disagreement with the findings. Public hearings must be conducted annually to gather input on the reviews conducted under this subsection. SEC. 3. De minimus decontrol of computer systems. Section 4 of the Export Administration Act of 1979 is amended to remove the requirement of a validated license for exporting digital computers valued at less than $5,000 to controlled countries. There is no limit on the quantity of computer systems that can be exported at any one time. The Export Administration Act of 1979 is amended to remove the requirement of a validated license for exporting digital computers valued at less than $5,000 to controlled countries. There is no limit on the quantity of computer systems that can be exported at any one time or on the number of shipments to controlled countries. SEC. 4. DECONTROL OF MASS-MARKET COMPUTER EQUIPMENT. Section 4 of the Export Administration Act of 1979 is amended to include a new subsection (j) regarding the removal of controls on mass-market computer equipment. Mass-market computer equipment is defined as any computer system, networking equipment, or peripherals on which export controls are in effect and will be installed for end-use outside the US in quantities exceeding 100,000 units over a 12-month period. The Secretary, in consultation with relevant committees and industry groups, will identify computer systems to be exported in quantities exceeding 100,000 units every 6 months to 1 year. Estimates will be based on reliable information from producers. The Secretary will take action within 30 days of determining mass-market computer equipment, either eliminating export controls and publishing a notice in the Federal Register, or proposing control elimination in accordance with export control regime procedures. SEC. 5. IDENTIFICATION OF PROLIFERATION END-USERS. Section 4 of the Export Administration Act of 1979 is amended to define 'proliferation enduser' as entities involved in the production of weapons in non-agreement countries. The Secretary must publish a list of these endusers within 10 days of denying an export license. The Export Administration Act of 1979 defines 'proliferation enduser' as entities involved in weapons production in non-agreement countries. The Secretary must publish a list of these endusers within 10 days of denying an export license, and if not published, the entity will not be considered a proliferation enduser for export purposes."
