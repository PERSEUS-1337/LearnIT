    "content": "The Geothermal Production Expansion Act of 2013 allows for noncompetitive leasing of adjoining areas for the development of geothermal resources. The Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 is amended to include definitions for \"fair market value per acre\" in relation to adjoining land for geothermal resource development. The Secretary determines lease terms within 180 days of receiving an application, with minimum payments set at 4 times the median amount per acre or $50. The term 'industry standards' refers to the criteria used by qualified geothermal professionals to assess the feasibility of energy production from geothermal resources. 'Qualified Federal land' is land eligible for leasing under this Act. A 'qualified geothermal professional' is an expert in geothermal energy assessment. The term 'qualified geothermal professional' refers to an individual with at least 5 years of experience in geothermal exploration, development, or project assessment. A 'qualified lessee' is a person eligible to hold a geothermal lease, and a 'valid discovery' is a confirmed geothermal resource found through drilling. The text chunk discusses the availability of noncompetitive leases for qualified lessees on qualified Federal land for geothermal resource development, meeting industry standards for temperature and permeability. The land must be between 1 and 640 acres and not already leased or nominated for leasing. The text chunk outlines the requirements for a qualified lessee to receive a noncompetitive lease for geothermal resource development on Federal land, including the submission of geological and technical data indicating a valid discovery of geothermal resources. The Secretary determines fair market value for leasing land for geothermal resource development in accordance with specified procedures. The Secretary determines fair market value for leasing land for geothermal resource development according to regulations. The process includes providing proposed determinations to qualified lessees for public comment, allowing appeals on final determinations. The Secretary determines fair market value for leasing land for geothermal resource development in an administrative proceeding before the Federal land management agency. After publication of a notice to lease land, the Secretary may not accept any nomination for leasing unless the request has been denied or withdrawn. A lease awarded under this paragraph is considered a lease awarded for annual rental purposes. The Geothermal Production Expansion Act of 2013 requires regulations to be established within 270 days after enactment for leases awarded in competitive lease sales. The Geothermal Production Expansion Act of 2013 mandates the issuance of regulations within 270 days for leases from competitive lease sales. The Secretary will issue regulations to implement this requirement."
