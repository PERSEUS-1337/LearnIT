    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Mercury Reduction and Energy Security Act of 2010\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings section. The EPA was required to determine regulation of mercury from electric utility steam generating units under the Clean Air Act. In 2000, the EPA found regulation necessary, but in 2005, they withdrew this in favor of the Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR), which was later challenged by 17 States. The United States Court of Appeals vacated a rule in 2008, stating that the EPA must proceed with Maximum Achievable Control Technology regulations for mercury emissions from coal-fired electric utility steam generating units unless they delist the source category. The purpose of the Act is to reduce mercury emissions from these units to protect public health and the environment. The Clean Air Act is amended to include Title VII - Mercury Reductions, with definitions provided. The Clean Air Act's Title VII defines terms like 'affected unit' and 'cogeneration unit' related to coal-fired electric steam generating units. The Clean Air Act's Title VII defines terms related to coal-fired electric steam generating units, including requirements for topping-cycle and bottoming-cycle cogeneration units. Topping-cycle units must have useful thermal energy of at least 5% of total energy output and useful power of at least 42.5-45% of total energy input. Bottoming-cycle units have similar requirements. For a bottoming-cycle cogeneration unit, useful power must be at least 45% of total energy input. Inlet mercury refers to the amount of mercury in the coal used by the unit. \"Section 702 establishes a mercury reduction program.\" The mercury reduction program under Section 702 imposes annual emission limitations on affected units for mercury capture and emission rates. For calendar years 2012-2014, the limitations are 80% capture of inlet mercury and 1.60 pounds of mercury per trillion British thermal units of input coal. From 2015 onwards, the limitations continue on a one-year rolling average basis. The annual emission limitations for mercury reduction program include 90% capture of inlet mercury and an emission rate of 0.80 pounds of mercury per trillion British thermal units of input coal. Compliance can be demonstrated by averaging emissions from all affected units at a facility or within a state, weighted by total input coal British thermal units. The owner or operator of an affected unit must allocate generation to each entity if the unit is owned or operated by multiple entities. Reference methods for measuring mercury emissions include ASTM D6784-02. The EPA lists permitted methods for measuring mercury emissions from coal-fired electric steam generating units, which may be revised to reflect advancements in measurement techniques. The EPA requires owners or operators of coal-fired electric steam generating units to install and operate continuous emissions monitoring systems to measure mercury emissions. Various approved monitoring systems can be used for compliance. The EPA may update the list of approved monitoring systems for mercury emissions reduction. Owners of units emitting excess mercury will face penalties based on the amount emitted above limits. Effective January 1, 2015, best practices for compliance will be enforced. Effective January 1, 2015, owners or operators failing to meet emission limits can request alternate mercury emissions limits by submitting data from compliant monitoring systems. The EPA may establish new limits based on optimal control technology performance by April 1, 2016. The EPA may impose more stringent mercury emissions limitations for affected units based on new data on control technology capabilities. Owners or operators failing to meet emission limits can request alternate limits and be considered in compliance if they notify the Administrator. The EPA may impose stricter mercury emissions limits for affected units. Owners or operators can request alternate limits to comply with regulations. Failure to comply may result in excess emissions penalties. Compliance is determined by the Administrator based on good air pollution control practices. The EPA can impose stricter mercury emissions limits on affected units. Owners or operators may request alternate limits for compliance. Failure to comply may lead to excess emissions penalties of $50,000 for each pound of mercury emitted above the alternate limit. This penalty is the sole limitation on mercury emissions under the Act. The EPA can impose stricter mercury emissions limits on electric utility steam generating units. States can enforce additional requirements for mercury emission control, but not less stringent than the standards set in this Act."
