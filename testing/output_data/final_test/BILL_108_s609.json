    "content": "The Act titled \"Restoration of Freedom of Information Act of 2003\" protects voluntarily furnished confidential information under the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The term 'critical infrastructure' is defined in this section as per the USA PATRIOT ACT of 2001. 'Furnished voluntarily' refers to submitting a record to the Department without being required to do so by the Department and not to meet any legal obligation or obtain any benefit. In general, records regarding critical infrastructure vulnerabilities and threats voluntarily provided to the Department will be kept confidential and not disclosed to the public if the provider does not typically make them public and certifies them as confidential. Records shared with other agencies that were voluntarily provided to the Department will not be made available to the public. Instead, the agency receiving the record must refer any requests for the record to the Department for processing and response. Any segregable portion of the record can be provided to the requester after removing any confidential information. The Department may disclose records independently received, regardless of similarity to its own records. Providers can withdraw confidential designation of voluntarily furnished records. The Secretary will establish procedures for acknowledging receipt of such records. The section outlines procedures for handling voluntarily furnished records, including acknowledgment of receipt, designation as confidential, storage, protection of confidentiality, and withdrawal of confidential designation. It also clarifies that state and local laws regarding information disclosure are not preempted. Additionally, a report is required within 18 months. The Comptroller General of the United States must submit a report to Congress within 18 months on the implementation and use of the section, including the number of private sector and state/local agencies providing records, requests for record access, and recommendations for improving sensitive information collection and analysis. The Comptroller General of the United States must submit a report to Congress within 18 months on the implementation and use of the section, including information held by private sector and state/local agencies regarding vulnerabilities and threats to critical infrastructure. The report will be submitted in unclassified form, with the possibility of a classified annex. Congress committees specified for review are the Committees on the Judiciary and Governmental Affairs of the Senate, and the Committees on the Judiciary and Government Reform and Oversight of the House of Representatives. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 is amended to include a new section on the Protection of Voluntarily Furnished Confidential Information."
