    "content": "The Act is titled the \"High Plains Aquifer Conservation, Monitoring, and Coordination Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings and purposes section. Congress finds that a reliable source of groundwater is essential for the economy of High Plains communities, with the High Plains Aquifer, mainly the Ogallala Aquifer, experiencing a significant decline in water levels. The Southern Ogallala Aquifer in states like Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas has seen declines of over 100 feet from 1950 to 1997, with some areas showing a saturated thickness reduction of over 50 percent. The High Plains Aquifer, particularly the Ogallala Aquifer, has experienced a decline in water levels, with a saturated thickness reduction from 54 percent to 51 percent between 1980 and 1997. Concerns about the sustainability of irrigated agriculture in the region have been raised due to decreased water levels and higher pumping costs. Groundwater modeling by the US Geological Survey suggests that reducing pumping at the farm or local level has limited impact on conserving the water table, creating a disincentive for water conservation investments. Incentives are needed to promote conservation efforts. Incentives are necessary for regional groundwater conservation on the High Plains to sustain agriculture. Reliable information on aquifer recharge rates, extraction rates, and water levels is crucial for water conservation efforts. Coordination between Federal, State, and local entities in mapping, modeling, and monitoring the High Plains Aquifer is essential to address its decline. The purpose of this Act is to facilitate these conservation efforts. The purpose of this Act is to enhance mapping, modeling, and monitoring of the High Plains Aquifer and improve coordination for conserving its groundwater resources. The Act defines key terms related to the High Plains Aquifer, including its boundaries and the states involved. It also establishes the role of the Secretary of the Interior in hydrogeologic mapping, modeling, and monitoring of the aquifer. The Secretary, in cooperation with State Geologists, will develop a comprehensive hydrogeologic mapping program for the High Plains Aquifer, including county-level maps and analysis of groundwater withdrawal, recharge rates, water migration, and saturated thickness loss. The Secretary will allocate funds to High Plains States for implementing the aquifer program. An annual report on the aquifer's status will be submitted to relevant committees and governors. SEC. 5. HIGH PLAINS AQUIFER COORDINATION COUNCIL. The Secretary, with the Secretary of Agriculture, establishes a High Plains Aquifer Coordination Council to ensure mapping, monitoring, and coordination of groundwater resources in the High Plains Aquifer region. The High Plains Aquifer Coordination Council evaluates Federal and State programs addressing groundwater issues and provides recommendations to relevant authorities. Members include representatives from the Secretary of the Interior, Bureau of Reclamation, U.S. Geological Survey, and the Secretary of Agriculture. The High Plains Aquifer Coordination Council includes representatives from the Secretary of Agriculture, selected from candidates provided by the Secretary, Governors of High Plains Aquifer States, state employees selected by Governors, irrigation production agriculture representatives, and municipal and industrial water user community representatives. The High Plains Aquifer Coordination Council members are selected by the Secretary of Agriculture, Governors of High Plains Aquifer States, state employees, irrigation production agriculture representatives, municipal and industrial water user community representatives, conservation community representatives, and Indian Tribe representatives. Members serve for four years and receive reimbursement for expenses. Financial and administrative services are provided by the Secretary. The High Plains Aquifer Coordination Council, appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture, is required to submit a report every two years to relevant Senate and House committees, containing findings and recommendations on specified matters. SEC. 6. HIGH PLAINS AQUIFER EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE.\n\nFinancial assistance will be provided to High Plains Aquifer States for educational programs related to the Act, including water conservation workshops, training for field staff, and public education. States can collaborate with universities and private organizations for program administration.\n\nSEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. Authorization of appropriations for various purposes under the Act includes $10 million annually for section 4, $2 million annually for section 5, and $3 million annually for section 6 from 2002 to 2011."
