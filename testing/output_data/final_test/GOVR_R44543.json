    "content": "Given the significant impact of economic growth on living standards, economists have extensively researched the determinants of growth. In the short term, the U.S. economy's growth is influenced by the business cycle, which fluctuates between periods of high and low growth. This cycle affects growth through changes in total spending, with recessions occurring when spending falls below the economy's capacity and expansions reaching \"full employment\" when spending matches capacity. External shocks also play a significant role in short-term growth fluctuations. In the long run, economic growth depends on increases in physical capital, labor quality, and knowledge. Unemployment rate has decreased since 2013, nearing full employment. Short-term business cycle fluctuations smooth out to reveal long-term trends. The link between factors like physical capital, human capital, and productivity and long-term growth is discussed. Research shows that these factors contribute differently to growth over time. Analyzing the U.S. growth record since World War II, data on GDP, GDP per capita, and labor productivity are examined. The average annual growth rate of U.S. GDP, GDP per capita, and output per hour has declined since the late 1990s, persisting even after the financial crisis. Recent economic performance remains below average, with growth rates comparable to slow periods in 1956 and 1981. The economy's performance from 1948 to 2015 is analyzed across distinct time periods, with recent data divided into shorter periods to focus on slow growth since 2008. Some recent periods may be too short to smooth out business cycle effects, unlike earlier periods spanning multiple cycles. The economy's performance from 1948 to 2015 is analyzed across distinct time periods. Average growth was high from 1948 to 1973, low from 1974 to 1995, high again from 1995 to 2000, and lower since 2008. The Great Depression was the worst economic downturn in U.S. history, followed by a period of fast growth between 1948 and 1973. Between 1948 and 1973, the U.S. experienced rapid economic growth with output per hour increasing by 2.8% annually, higher than the average rate. GDP and GDP per capita also grew at above-average rates of 3.9% and 2.4% respectively. This growth was driven by new technologies, production processes, and increased labor force participation. However, the oil crisis in the early 1970s led to a period of below-average economic growth from 1974 to 1995, with contractionary pressure and slow growth persisting. Between 1974 and 1995, there was a significant slowdown in economic and productivity growth in the U.S. due to high and persistent inflation. This trend continued until 1996 when the computer age sparked faster economic growth, with output per hour growing at 2.3% annually on average between 1996 and 2000. GDP and GDP per capita also grew above average during this period. Between 1996 and 2000, firms significantly increased investment in new information technology, leading to above-average economic growth. However, by 2001, GDP and GDP per capita growth slowed to 2.3% and 1.5% respectively, with productivity growth decreasing to 2.2%. Various hypotheses exist for this slowdown in growth. The period following the growth acceleration in the late 1990s saw a slowdown in economic growth, with competing hypotheses including decreasing returns to investment in information technology, structural characteristics of the economy, or a return to normal after the burst of the speculative bubble in 2000. The relative performance of productivity diverged from GDP and GDP per capita during this period, making it challenging to determine if it belongs with the growth acceleration period or the current slowdown. The financial crisis of 2007-2008 led to the deepest and longest recession in U.S. history since the Great Depression. The 2007-2008 recession in the U.S. was caused by a burst housing bubble, leading to a decrease in asset values and a decline in investment and consumption spending. This resulted in a significant drop in real GDP growth, with the economy showing deceleration in economic and productivity growth post-crisis. GDP grew at an average rate of 1.2% per year between 2008 and 2015, significantly lower than the historical average. The current economic slowdown in the United States has not shown sustained acceleration, with GDP growth remaining below 3% and GDP per capita growing at a pace of 0.5% annually on average. Output per hour also fell to an annual growth rate of 1.1% on average between 2008 and 2015. This slowdown is not unique to the US, as most advanced economies have struggled to return to pre-crisis growth rates. The US has remained in the middle of the pack compared to other advanced economies in terms of GDP and GDP per capita growth. Japan's economic performance from 1990 onwards saw a significant decline after a housing and stock market bubble burst in 1990, leading to lower growth and price deflation. This period, known as the \"lost decade,\" serves as a cautionary tale for economies facing large disruptions. Japan has experienced a \"lost decade\" of low growth and deflation for over 20 years, with little improvement. Policy errors and the financial crisis have contributed to the slow growth, with GDP growing at a slower-than-average pace of 1.7% between 2010 and 2015. The Great Recession in the U.S. has not seen the usual rapid growth period after a recession, leading to concerns about long-term low growth or lasting damage to the economy. This contrasts with previous periods of rapid growth following recessions. Economists offer various explanations for the slow recovery from the Great Recession, including deleveraging, financial disruptions, hysteresis, headwinds, and secular stagnation. These factors may be temporarily holding back growth, but should not affect long-term growth rates. The sources of long-term growth are structural factors, suggesting a permanent slowdown as temporary factors become less compelling. Explanations for slow growth early in the recovery focused on contraction. The global slowdown dampens demand for U.S. exports, making it harder for the economy to escape its own slowdown. The contraction in credit following the financial crisis led to slow growth early in the recovery. Recessions caused by financial crises are typically deeper and take longer to recover from. Deleveraging, the decline in debt, may improve long-term economic growth but can be disruptive in the short run. Businesses and households rely on credit for spending, and deleveraging ended in 2011 for nonfinancial businesses, 2012 for households, and 2013 for financial firms. Aggregate debt levels have not grown as rapidly post-crisis compared to before. The decline in debt can be due to reduced credit supply or demand. Factors affecting credit supply include disruptions from the financial crisis and long-lasting changes like risk aversion and regulatory adjustments. On the demand side, changes in borrowing behavior and regulatory costs can impact credit demand. The recent decline in debt levels post-crisis could be attributed to credit market disruptions or borrowers' desire to reduce debt. Factors such as speculation during the housing bubble and asset price fluctuations have led to a need for households and investors to deleverage. This has resulted in a decrease in average household net housing wealth. The decline in debt growth post-crisis may be driven by credit market disruptions or borrowers' desire to deleverage. Some households face involuntary debt reduction due to liquidity constraints, such as being rejected for mortgages or credit cards. The housing bubble, in addition to causing the financial crisis, may have contributed to a growth slowdown. Residential investment, like house building, plays a smaller role in promoting growth compared to business investment. The bubble led to overinvestment in housing, resulting in a temporary growth slowdown. The housing bubble led to overinvestment in housing, crowding out productive business investment and reducing growth. Labor shifted to a low productivity sector, causing a temporary growth slowdown. Recovery from a financial crisis may take longer, but growth should resume once financial linkages are repaired and debt levels rebalanced. The effects of the financial crisis on the economy have led to a growth slowdown, with rising debt levels suggesting that much of the rebalancing has already occurred. Economists are considering the theory of \"hysteresis,\" which suggests that deep recessions can have a long-term impact on output and employment. The theory of \"hysteresis\" suggests that deep recessions can have a long-term impact on output and employment. This idea was first raised in relation to the labor market in Western Europe in the 1980s, where unemployment did not fall back down to pre-recession rates during the subsequent expansion. The lower labor force participation rate since the financial crisis provides evidence of labor market hysteresis in the United States. Many economists now believe that output might also suffer from hysteresis. Many economists believe that a significant amount of potential output was lost due to the financial crisis, leading to a permanent alteration in output growth. The theory of hysteresis suggests that deep recessions can have a long-term impact on output, as seen in the lower labor force participation rate since the crisis. The Great Recession may have been the only recession deep enough to trigger hysteresis effects. The Congressional Budget Office's projection in January 2007 compared to the current outlook shows that in 2015, actual GDP was 2.2% below potential GDP, with potential GDP 8.7% lower than projected before the financial crisis. This suggests that 2.2% of GDP could still be recovered as the economy returns to full employment, while 8.7% has been permanently lost. Hysteresis following the financial crisis may have negatively affected labor supply, physical capital, and productivity, leading to an elevated percentage of underemployed or discouraged workers leaving the labor market. The crisis could lead to a permanent decline in labor supply if discouraged workers do not return, impacting GDP and human capital. It may also cause a temporary decrease in private investment due to various factors. If lost investment is not recovered in the future, it could hinder economic growth. The financial crisis could lead to a permanent decline in labor supply and a temporary decrease in private investment, impacting GDP and human capital. If lost investment is not recovered in the future, it could hinder economic growth and productivity growth may also be affected. Hysteresis effects could result in a permanently lower level of the capital stock, but not necessarily a permanent decline in the rate of long-term growth. Larry Summers has proposed the concept of \"secular stagnation\" as an explanation for the growth slowdown since 2008. This theory suggests that if growth remains persistently low, other factors beyond hysteresis may be at play. Secular stagnation is described as a problem of longer-lasting low economic growth, low inflation, low investment, negative real interest rates, and difficulty achieving full employment. Despite a decrease in unemployment since 2013, the concept of secular stagnation still raises questions about the economy's ability to return to full employment amidst slow growth. Secular stagnation is a problem caused by the inability of real interest rates to fall low enough for investment demand to match available savings, leading to a liquidity trap. This situation hinders economic growth and makes it challenging to achieve healthy growth rates and return to potential GDP using conventional monetary policy. Some economists believe this issue is more of a global phenomenon, holding back U.S. and world growth. The secular stagnation argument suggests a prolonged period of lower growth rates due to structural factors, not predicting deflation or a liquidity trap. It contrasts with the hysteresis debate, which explains a permanent output level decrease post-financial crisis. Some attribute the lower growth to temporary \"headwinds\" rather than a fundamental economic shift. The expansion faced headwinds such as rising commodity prices, the European economic crisis, financial instability in emerging markets, fiscal contraction, and policy uncertainty, which hindered U.S. growth from 2009 to 2015. The text discusses the impact of various events on financial market volatility and consumer confidence, including the 2011 debt limit impasse, the \"fiscal cliff\" in 2012, and the 2013 debt limit impasse/government shutdown. It also mentions the effects of business and household deleveraging. The argument suggests that economic growth would have been healthier in recent years if these events had been avoided. Critics argue that this explanation is based on post-hoc reasoning and lacks a systematic approach to identifying potential obstacles or positive factors that could offset them. The economy has faced continuous headwinds, leading to a prolonged period of bad luck. Temporary explanations for the decline in growth rates are becoming less convincing, prompting a shift towards long-term structural explanations. A key factor in long-term growth decline could be a decrease in the growth of labor, fixed capital investment, or productivity. The focus is on multifactor productivity (MFP), which measures growth not attributed to capital or labor. The growth rate of structural factors like labor, human capital, and productivity has declined in the 2008-2015 period. The key question is whether this decline is due to long-term structural factors or the financial crisis. This section will discuss supply-side explanations for the decline in growth rates. The growth rate of labor supply has declined, with annual hours worked growth falling to 0.1% from 2008 to 2015. This decline is attributed to changes in the labor supply, including the aging population and a decrease in labor-force participation since the mid-1990s. The aging population and retirement of baby-boomers have led to a decline in the growth rate of the labor supply. Immigration could potentially offset this slowdown, but would require higher levels than currently seen. Speculation exists on whether the aging population could impact productivity, but this relationship is uncertain. The decline in labor force participation rate is partially attributed to the aging population, but other factors also contribute. The Great Recession has had lasting effects on the labor market. Human capital growth has not significantly declined since 2008, with the U.S. population being more educated than ever before. In 1940, 75% of the population 25 and older did not have a high school degree, compared to 12% in 2014. The share of college graduates has been increasing over time, although some economists predict a potential slowdown in human capital growth. The rise in education has slowed since 1950, with the average years of schooling completed by cohorts born in 1950 and 1980 being around 13 and 14 years respectively. There is a finite potential for workers to move into more skilled jobs in the future. The growth in multifactor productivity (MFP) has slowed down, with manufacturing playing a significant role in the past but facing challenges in recent years. The shift from manufacturing to services may be a factor in the slowdown, as manufacturing MFP growth was mainly concentrated in computers and electronics. Despite anecdotal examples of rapid changes, overall productivity growth has been negative from 2007 to 2013. The slowdown in productivity growth is debated in terms of the economic impact of recent technological innovations like smartphones. There is concern that as time passes, it may become more difficult to make significant inventions or discoveries. Investment in physical capital stock grew at a slower rate from 2008 to 2015 compared to previous periods since 1948. Nonresidential fixed investment by businesses in plant and equipment directly increases output, while government investment can indirectly boost private output by lowering production costs. Residential investment is more similar to consumption in its impact on generating output. Investment in physical capital stock declined significantly during the Great Recession, reaching a low of just under 18% in 2009 and 2010. Nonresidential fixed investment and residential investment have shown improvement in recent years but remain below historical averages. Government investment did not decline during the recession due to fiscal stimulus but has tapered off since. The slowdown in private investment growth is often attributed to long-term factors like labor and productivity. The slowdown in private investment growth is often attributed to long-term factors like labor and productivity, which could reduce opportunities for new profitable fixed investment. The mainstream growth model predicts that growth in the capital stock declines to zero without MFP or labor supply growth. A high-tech economy based on the service sector may require less fixed investment than one based on manufacturing. Slower population growth may reduce total consumption growth, necessitating a slower growth rate of capital investment. The reduction in government investment is a policy choice that may be altered by future decisions. The slowdown in private investment growth is often attributed to long-term factors like labor and productivity. Growth in output per hour was strong before the crisis, but has since decreased. Economic growth has been markedly slower since 2008 compared to previous growth episodes. It is uncertain if the slowdown will persist without policy changes. The current growth slowdown is attributed to various factors, making it difficult to pinpoint a single cause. The worldwide nature of the slowdown suggests that some factors are beyond U.S. control. Additionally, certain causes like the aging population are hard for policymakers to influence in the short run, limiting the potential impact of government policy to reverse the slowdown. The longer growth record indicates that growth remains relatively steady over time despite changes in policy, society, and the economy. Productivity growth is a key driver of long-term changes, but it is difficult for policymakers to predict or influence. Efficient fiscal policies, stable monetary policies, and an innovative environment are crucial for sustainable economic growth. Physical capital, such as machines and infrastructure, increases workers' productivity and the economy's capacity. The United States has seen a significant increase in physical capital per worker since 1950, leading to higher worker productivity and GDP per capita post-World War II. Investment in capital stock is crucial for economic growth as it increases productivity and GDP per capita. However, this comes at a cost as resources are diverted from current consumption to build capital. Investment in capital stock is essential for economic growth, leading to increased productivity and GDP per capita. However, this comes at the expense of current consumption, with the return on investment not realized immediately. As the capital stock grows, the impact of investment on long-run growth diminishes due to diminishing returns. Additional investment may yield smaller returns as worker productivity increases less with each addition to physical capital. Investment in human capital, through education and skill development, can increase workforce productivity and overall economic potential. This complements physical capital and new technologies, leading to long-term growth. Investment in human capital, through education and skill development, can increase workforce productivity and overall economic potential. Human capital, similar to physical capital, is produced by diverting resources from the production of goods for current consumption. Accumulating human capital is a form of investment that requires a trade-off between immediate consumption and skill development. Investment in human capital, like physical capital, involves a trade-off between current consumption and future production potential. The accumulation of human capital is subject to diminishing returns, where the increase in productive abilities from schooling or training decreases as more is acquired. Human capital and workforce size are crucial for economic growth. Productivity, measured by multifactor productivity, shows how efficiently resources are used in production. Increases in productivity come from new technologies, processes, and ideas. Productivity is influenced by various factors, including technological advancements. Technological knowledge is a key driver of productivity growth as it is non-rivalrous, unlike physical inputs like capital and labor. This allows for widespread adoption and utilization of new ideas without diminishing their availability for others. The non-rivalrous nature of ideas allows for continuous generation and utilization of new knowledge, unlike physical inputs like capital and labor which eventually face diminishing returns. Governments can grant exclusive rights to non-rivalrous goods through patents, enabling ongoing growth in the economy's stock of ideas. The constant generation of ideas can lead to sustainable growth, but there is debate among economists about the rate of future idea discovery. If steady idea discovery is not expected, growth prospects may be diminished."
