    "content": "The \"Enhanced Border Security Act\" is the short title of this legislation, with the purpose stated in Section 2. The purpose of the \"Enhanced Border Security Act\" is to protect US citizens from external threats by implementing counterinsurgency tactics to combat terrorist insurgency in Mexico. This includes securing the US-Mexico border, cutting off funding for criminal organizations in US cities, and assisting the Mexican government in reducing violence, corruption, and improving cooperation between military and law enforcement. Mexican drug cartels have evolved into transnational criminal organizations, engaging in various illicit activities such as human smuggling, stolen oil trafficking, weapons smuggling, extortion, kidnapping, and cybercrime. They have increased profits through these activities, with estimates of stolen oil proceeds ranging from $2 billion to $4 billion annually. Additionally, approximately $6.6 billion is generated annually from human smuggling from Latin America to the United States. Transnational criminal organizations have expanded and matured, posing a threat according to a July 2011 White House report. Criminal organizations, including Mexican-based transnational groups, pose a security threat to citizens and governments in the region, with implications for the United States. A foiled terrorist plot in 2011 highlighted the danger posed by Mexican drug cartel members at the US-Mexico border. The Merida Initiative, led by the Department of State, has not effectively addressed the evolving drug trafficking situation. The Merida Initiative has faced challenges and delays in addressing the evolution of drug trafficking organizations into transnational criminal organizations. Counterinsurgency tactics will focus on isolating these criminal groups from their sources of power while addressing military and non-military aspects. The coordinated strategy aims to address military and non-military conditions sustaining insurgency, including corruption, infighting, financing, and human support. The end goal is to protect US citizens by empowering a competent government that can secure itself from internal and external threats within international laws and regulations. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, \"terrorist insurgency\" refers to the prolonged use of irregular warfare by transnational criminal organizations to influence public opinion and undermine government control. A \"transnational criminal organization\" is a group of individuals operating internationally to gain power or monetary benefits through illegal means. Terrorist insurgency can occur through corruption, violence, or a transnational organizational structure exploiting commerce or communication. SEC. 5. COUNTERINSURGENCY STRATEGY AND CONDITIONALITY. The Secretary of State, along with other key officials, must submit a counterinsurgency strategy to Congress within 90 days. The strategy should define transnational criminal organizations in Mexico, assess their capabilities and areas of influence, and analyze the terrain and activities they utilize. The strategy must assess Mexico's federal law enforcement, military forces, state and local government institutions, and other critical elements to counter transnational criminal organizations. It also describes the operations of these organizations within the United States, at international borders, and includes information on trafficking activities, financial networks, and technological advancements. The strategy utilizes information to coordinate with relevant agencies to combat transnational criminal organizations in the US, Mexico, and at the border. It includes a plan to combat their operations, financial networks, and money laundering techniques, such as increasing the number of traffickers on the Specially Designated Nationals list. The strategy includes a report by the Office of Foreign Assets Control detailing progress in designating individuals and entities supporting criminal organizations, increasing cooperation between law enforcement agencies, and developing accounting procedures. The curr_chunk discusses a standardized accounting procedure for tracking Federal grant assistance to State and local law enforcement agencies for border security, along with a plan to enhance border security at the United States-Mexico border. This includes doubling the number of Border Patrol agents. The curr_chunk focuses on enhancing border security by developing a plan for additional infrastructure, technology, and resources to support Border Patrol activities along the border. This includes determining the technology needed to reduce unlawful movement of goods and people, such as cameras, radars, and sensors. The curr_chunk outlines measures to enhance border security, including implementing cameras, radars, sensors, and unmanned aerial vehicles, standardizing prosecution thresholds for border-related offenses, developing a joint US-Mexico intelligence program, and increasing the use of Border Patrol Special Response Teams to address high-priority threats. The curr_chunk focuses on developing a multi-agency action plan within Mexico, in coordination with the Government of Mexico, to enhance security by increasing coordination among military and law enforcement agencies and establishing secure areas around key population centers. The curr_chunk emphasizes the importance of incorporating military and law enforcement lessons learned globally in counterinsurgency training programs and strengthening governance to diminish support for transnational criminal organizations. The curr_chunk focuses on promoting a culture of lawfulness, enhancing youth programs and anti-drug coalitions, public education, and economic development in Mexico to create safe communities for families and youth. The curr_chunk focuses on neutralizing transnational criminal organizations in Mexico by re-evaluating threats, assigning specialized task forces, and requesting support from United States military advisors. The curr_chunk discusses supporting Mexican law enforcement operations, providing intelligence to regional task forces, and reporting on extradition requests and extraditions. The Office of Foreign Assets Control will provide quarterly updates to congressional committees. The Secretary of State must provide quarterly updates on the counterinsurgency strategy to congressional committees. If the strategy is not submitted as required, 20 percent of funds for the Department of State in fiscal year 2012 will be withheld until the strategy is submitted. Funds for the Merida Initiative can be used to develop and implement the required counterinsurgency strategy under section 5(a)."
