Digital currencies like cryptocurrencies offer alternative options with a high degree of independence from traditional systems. Cash remains important in the United States, but electronic payment systems are becoming more effective and inexpensive for businesses. Some U.S. businesses are opting not to accept cash, following a trend seen in countries like Sweden. Central banks are considering digital currencies. The decline of cash in the payment system may continue, with proponents arguing for benefits like improved efficiency and reduced crime. The report discusses the potential consequences of reducing cash usage in favor of electronic payment systems. Proponents argue that maintaining cash is important for financial inclusion, cybersecurity, and personal privacy. The first part analyzes cash and electronic payment systems, while the second part examines the possible outcomes of displacing cash as a common form of payment. Part I of the report delves into electronic payment systems, including cryptocurrencies and central bank digital currencies, analyzing their advantages, costs, and potential obstacles to adoption. Part II explores the implications of reduced cash usage in the economy, discussing benefits, costs, and risks. Additionally, the report includes international case studies on the expansion of noncash payment systems, comparing cash, traditional noncash systems, and potential alternatives. The report discusses electronic payment systems, cryptocurrencies, and central bank digital currencies, analyzing their advantages, costs, and adoption obstacles. It also explores the implications of reduced cash usage, including benefits, costs, and risks. The characteristics of money in a payment system are examined, focusing on its role as a medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value. Cash continues to serve these functions well in a physical payment system. In the United States, paper currency and coins are produced by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP) and the United States Mint, both under the Department of the Treasury. The Federal Reserve distributes cash to banks, which then make it available to customers. The demand for cash is examined, along with the government's revenues and costs from this system. The demand for cash in the United States has continued to grow despite new payment services. Fed data shows steady increase in currency circulation over the past 20 years, with over $1.67 trillion worth of bills in circulation as of December 31, 2018. The growth in demand is expected due to economic growth, population increase, and price levels. Additionally, some individuals are using cash as a store of value or safe investment. The demand for cash in the United States has grown despite new payment services, with over $1.67 trillion worth of bills in circulation as of December 31, 2018. People may be using cash more as a store of value or safe investment rather than for purchases. Cash transactions in the U.S. have decreased from 40.7% in 2012 to 32.5% in 2015, indicating a shift towards using cash less frequently for payments. The decline in cash transactions in the U.S. may not accurately reflect changes in consumer preferences. Economists adjusted for factors and found that the actual decline in cash transactions was roughly half of the initial estimate. Americans used cash for 31% of transactions in 2016, with a preference for small, in-person transactions. Cash is valued for its simplicity and robustness, requiring no additional technologies for payment validation and settlement. Cash provides security against disruptions to electronic payment systems, acts as a safe asset for savings, offers privacy, and psychological benefits to consumers. However, using and accepting cash involve costs such as ATM fees. Banks with over $1 billion in assets reported $1.9 billion in ATM fees in 2018. Businesses incur costs for cash management services like armored truck deliveries and security systems to prevent theft. U.S. businesses lose around $40 billion annually to employee cash thefts. Quantifying all cash-related costs for businesses is challenging due to various factors. Cash has significant impacts on consumers, businesses, and government revenues. It affects government revenues through seigniorage, Federal Reserve remittances, and tax evasion. Seigniorage generates profit for the government by producing cash, with the value of currency exceeding production costs. This profit decreases if demand for cash decreases. In FY2017, the U.S. Mint generated $391.5 million in net income from circulating coins and the U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing generated revenues $693 million greater than expenses. The second source of cash-generating revenue is remittances from the Fed to the U.S. Treasury, amounting to $80.6 billion in 2017. The Fed's expenses include $28.9 billion in interest payments on depository institutions' deposits, but currency, a Fed liability, accrues no interest. The Fed does not pay interest on currency in circulation, which can increase its remittances to the Treasury. If all currency were bank reserves at the Fed, it could cost the government over $40 billion annually. Cash allows for tax evasion as it leaves no electronic record, enabling underreporting of income. Cash payments enable businesses to underreport their income, leading to a tax gap of $387 billion annually. This underreporting is facilitated by cash transactions, with some businesses refusing high-denomination bills. Retail businesses are increasingly accepting cash despite these challenges. Retail businesses are increasingly deciding not to accept cash due to high transaction costs, especially for small dollar amount transactions. This trend could have various effects on consumers, businesses, and society. Non-acceptance of cash may marginalize those with limited access to the financial system or mobile devices. If cash declines as a payment system, traditional noncash electronic payment systems like debit cards, credit cards, or mobile apps would likely replace it. Participants hold money in accounts at financial intermediaries, who maintain accurate ledgers. Payments are made by instructing the intermediary to transfer money to the recipient's account. Intermediaries validate transactions and ensure sufficient funds for payments. Electronic payments involve validating transactions, ensuring sufficient funds, deducting from the payer's account, and adding to the payee's account. This process is similar to physical currency but with digital entries in account ledgers that can easily be traded and serve as units of account. Instructions to change ledger entries can be sent over a network, making the transfer of value efficient. According to the Federal Reserve Payment Study, noncash payments in the U.S. totaled over 144 billion transactions worth nearly $178 trillion in 2015. This included debit card, credit card, ACH, and check payments. Electronic systems like debit and credit cards saw growth in transactions and values, while check payments declined. In 2015, noncash payments in the U.S. totaled over 144 billion transactions worth nearly $178 trillion. Debit and credit card transactions grew, while check payments declined. In 2017, electronic payments increased, and check payments decreased. Physical currency has limitations that can be addressed by ledger-based payment systems. Ledger-based payment systems offer a secure and convenient alternative to physical currency. Electronic payments have become widespread, reducing the need for cash transactions. Services like Venmo, Apple Pay, and Google Pay have made noncash payments nearly ubiquitous. Retail establishments that once rejected card payments now commonly accept them. Electronic payment options like Venmo, Apple Pay, and Google Pay, along with card-reading devices from companies like Square, have made it easier for individuals to accept electronic payments. Trust in banks and intermediaries is crucial for the accuracy and security of these systems. Banks have strong incentives to maintain accurate ledgers, ensuring trust and reliability in electronic transactions. Banks and financial intermediaries have a strong incentive to be accurate in processing transactions to maintain trust with customers. Governments impose laws and regulations to ensure banks are well-run and secure. Intermediaries must provide protections to consumers in electronic transactions to prevent unauthorized transfers. Laws like the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and Fair Credit Billing Act limit consumer liability and require corrections for billing errors. The Electronic Fund Transfer Act and Fair Credit Billing Act require companies to correct billing errors and disclose costs to consumers. Electronic money transfer systems require significant infrastructure to ensure integrity and performance. Intermediaries store and protect data, incurring regulatory compliance costs that are recouped through fees. Traditional noncash payment systems involve regulations and fees charged to users for services like card transactions and checking account fees. The costs of these systems are often passed on to consumers and businesses, with some fees being high enough to raise concerns among policymakers. For example, Congress included Section 1075 in the Dodd-Frank Act to address claims of market power abuse by Visa and MasterCard in setting debit card swipe fees. Section 1075 of the Dodd-Frank Act limits debit card swipe fees for banks with assets over $10 billion. Electronic payment systems, while protecting against physical theft, pose risks of cyber and identity theft. Successful hacks on banks highlight vulnerabilities in the system. Cyberattacks pose risks to financial institutions, as seen in the 2014 JPMorgan Chase data breach exposing millions of households' financial records. The effectiveness of current cybersecurity measures is uncertain, and reducing such incidents remains a challenge. For more details on cybersecurity in financial institutions, refer to CRS Report R44429, Financial Services and Cybersecurity: The Federal Role by N. Eric Weiss and M. Maureen Murphy. Settlement delays in banking transactions can lead to costly consequences for consumers, such as overdraft fees or late payment penalties. It can take up to two business days for deposited funds to be fully available, causing individuals to face financial dilemmas when trying to pay bills on time. Settlement delays in banking transactions can result in costly consequences for consumers, such as overdraft fees or late payment penalties. Faster payment processing could help reduce these costs for low- or moderate-income individuals with low bank balances. Efforts are being made to increase system speed and move towards real-time payments in the United States. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are seen as potential dominant payment systems of the future due to the costly consequences of settlement delays in banking transactions, such as overdraft fees or late payment penalties. Efforts are being made to achieve faster or real-time payments to reduce costs for low- or moderate-income individuals with low bank balances. Updating legacy systems is expensive for banks, and they currently generate revenue through overdraft fees. Traditional noncash payment systems may replace cash payments if cash usage declines significantly, but alternative electronic payment systems are also being considered. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are potential dominant payment systems due to costly settlement delays in banking transactions. Central banks are exploring creating digital currencies to avoid being bypassed in the future. Alternative electronic payment systems are being considered for their advantages and costs. The section discusses alternative electronic payment systems, including potential advantages, costs, and obstacles to adoption. Private electronic payment systems using distributed ledgers allow individuals to establish accounts with unique identifiers for transactions. Transactions involve transferring digital currency between accounts using private keys. In blockchain-enabled systems, users transfer digital currency between accounts using private keys. Transactions are validated on a public ledger by a decentralized network and cryptographic protocols, allowing parties to exchange value without needing to trust each other directly. Cryptocurrency platforms offer user-friendly interfaces for transactions. Blockchain enables transfers of digital currency between accounts using private keys and protocols to prevent unauthorized changes to the ledger. Transfers using blockchain do not require a centralized intermediary like a bank. Digital currencies are decentralized, making industry-wide analysis challenging due to their proliferation. Bitcoin, the most well-known cryptocurrency, accounts for over half of the industry's value and is used as an illustrative example in this report. The price of Bitcoin experienced significant volatility, reaching a peak of $19,650 in December 2017 before dropping to $3,860 in March 2018. Despite fluctuations, the price rebounded to $5,948 in May 2019. While price data reflects public interest, Bitcoin is primarily used as an investment rather than for transactions. The number of Bitcoin transactions may provide a better indicator of its use as a currency. Bitcoin transactions serve as a flawed indicator of its use as a payment system, with only about 310,000 transactions per day globally in 2019. This is significantly lower than traditional noncash payments, with more than 144 billion in the US alone in 2015. The count of Bitcoin transactions includes exchanges between parties, not necessarily purchases, as some transactions are driven by investors buying and holding Bitcoin as an investment. Advocates of cryptocurrency believe that a decentralized payment system using distributed ledgers could be more cost-effective than traditional systems. This system would eliminate the need for intermediaries like central banks and financial institutions, reducing fees and transaction times. However, the actual realization of these efficiencies remains uncertain. Opening a bank account or using traditional electronic payment systems requires divulging personal information to financial institutions, which may be vulnerable to hackers. Some individuals opt for alternative digital currency systems for increased privacy. Despite low inflation, some believe nontraditional digital money may hold its value better. Some individuals believe nontraditional digital money may maintain value better than government-backed fiat money due to historical incidents of hyperinflation. They trust decentralized networks with cryptographic protocols to stabilize the value of money. Obstacles to widespread adoption of private payment systems using distributed ledgers exist. Cryptocurrency faces challenges in becoming widely accepted as a medium of exchange due to factors such as limited understanding, lack of legal tender status, and high price volatility. This hinders its ability to function effectively as money in a payment system. Cryptocurrencies face challenges in becoming widely accepted as a medium of exchange due to factors like high price volatility and scalability concerns. The energy consumption required to run cryptocurrency systems is significant, making them not costless. Cryptocurrencies, while facing challenges in becoming widely accepted as a medium of exchange, also come with economic costs such as energy consumption, computer hardware, and fees. Critics fear that the decentralized nature of digital currency systems may enable criminal activities like money laundering and tax evasion. For example, Bitcoin was used on the illegal drug marketplace Silk Road, leading to government intervention. The government shut down a website and arrested individuals involved in running it, raising concerns about the lack of protection for digital currency users. Cryptocurrency exchanges may be subject to consumer protection laws, but some regulations may not apply, such as the Electronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978. The Electronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978 may not apply to digital currency transactions, as they do not involve centralized financial institutions. The effectiveness of current regulations, originally designed for traditional money transmission, in regulating digital currencies is debated. The widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies could potentially impact the ability of central banks, like the Fed, to implement monetary policy. Central banks may face challenges in transmitting monetary policy if additional currencies beyond their control become prevalent. This could require larger adjustments to fiat currency or direct intervention in digital currency markets. To address these risks, some suggest central banks issuing their own digital currencies. Some suggest central banks should offer their own central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) to address risks posed by private digital currencies. No country has successfully created a CBDC for public use yet. The form and features of CBDCs could vary, but some central banks are exploring the idea for potential benefits and challenges. This report examines the potential advantages of a CBDC for retail payments, arguing for efficiency gains and a faster, less costly payment system. Advocates suggest that a CBDC could increase systemic stability by allowing individuals to hold accounts directly at the central bank, imposing discipline on commercial banks. Commercial banks would need to offer competitive interest rates and limit risks to attract deposits. CBDCs could increase government revenue through a seignoriage-like mechanism by offering low- or no-interest liabilities to individuals, funded by purchasing assets that earn a higher interest rate. The creation of CBDCs could potentially generate income through higher interest rates on assets compared to what the Fed pays on liabilities. Critics argue against CBDCs, stating that there is no urgent need for them as existing electronic payment systems are efficient. They also fear that CBDCs could reduce the role of private banks and increase government control over financial intermediation. Consumers may shift deposits from private banks to government-backed CBDCs, impacting private bank funding. Digital money, a safe government-backed asset, could lead to reduced lending by private banks. Critics argue that CBDCs may destabilize the system by enabling runs on private banks. There is uncertainty about the potential effects of CBDCs on monetary policy and central banks' abilities. Proponents argue that a central bank digital currency (CBDC) could allow for direct transmission of policy rates to the economy, bypassing the need to influence rates through banks. Eliminating the option to hold cash could also help central banks overcome the zero lower bound constraint. Critics, however, believe that central banks taking on such a direct role in financial markets is overly expansive and could lead to increased asset holdings. Central banks may need to increase asset holdings and support lending markets if cash usage declines. The reduced role of cash in the payment system could have both positive and negative effects on the economy and society. Reducing cash usage in the U.S. economy may lead to benefits such as improved payment efficiency, reduced criminal activity, and better monetary policy implementation by the Fed. However, there are also costs and drawbacks to consider, as proponents of noncash payment systems argue that the economic benefits of cash usage are outweighed by those of noncash systems. Proponents of cashless societies argue that the resources and labor involved in maintaining the cash system make it less efficient than noncash systems. Market forces may lead to the displacement of cash by other payment methods, potentially reducing crime by making illegal activities more difficult. The elimination of cash could reduce crime by making illegal activities more difficult and less profitable. Criminals often use cash to avoid detection and money laundering regulations. Studies show a correlation between cash prevalence and crime rates. Additionally, the excessive circulation of \"strong\" currencies suggests a shift towards noncash transactions may be beneficial. Proponents of a cashless society argue that reducing cash circulation could decrease crime by making illegal activities harder. While the $1.6 trillion in circulation in the U.S. equates to about $4,900 per person, some of this demand comes from criminals. However, the net benefit of going cashless should consider the impact on legitimate cash users and the potential reduction in crime. A cashless society could potentially reduce crime by making illegal activities more difficult, but criminals may find other ways to commit crimes. Economists also suggest that going cashless could allow central banks to implement negative interest rates to stimulate economic activity during recessions. The Fed's attempt to implement negative interest rates may be hindered by the availability of cash, as individuals can avoid negative rates by holding cash. Eliminating cash could make it easier to transmit negative interest rates to financial markets, but the cost to individual savers must be considered. Critics argue that cash serves important purposes and eliminating it could harm financially vulnerable groups. Moving towards a cashless society could pose challenges for financially vulnerable groups who lack access to electronic payment services, requiring accounts with financial institutions and internet-connected devices. This could eliminate a safety asset against cyber vulnerabilities and financial crises, reducing privacy and potentially harming certain segments of the population. In the United States, 9 million households were unbanked in 2015, with economic obstacles being the main reason for not having a bank account. Sweden is leading the move away from cash, but concerns have been raised about the impact on vulnerable groups like retirees. Many believe it would be beneficial to bring the unbanked into the banking system. Proponents of cash argue that a move to a cashless system could have detrimental outcomes for the unbanked if it leads to higher costs for financial access. They highlight the robustness of physical currency, which does not rely on financial institutions or IT networks. This group may benefit if a cashless system provides them with less costly financial access. The elimination of cash amplifies risks in the financial system as cash is a safe asset that is not reliant on financial institutions, making it desirable during financial turmoil. Holding cash provides a sense of security to risk-adverse individuals who may mistrust financial institutions. Opening a bank account or using traditional noncash payment systems requires divulging personal information to financial institutions, which store and may share this data. Concerns arise over data protection, as hackers have stolen personal information. Government can access this information under certain circumstances. Alternative payment systems may offer anonymity but still generate identifiable data. Cash offers anonymity and privacy for transactions, which some consumers prefer over electronic payment methods. Despite its advantages, the dominance of cash as a payment system is being challenged by the popularity of electronic payment systems. Cash usage and acceptance are declining, with Sweden as a case study where cash transactions have dropped significantly. Businesses are no longer accepting cash, and the central bank is exploring the implications of this trend. Policymakers may need to decide whether to impede or hasten the decline of cash in the economy. Sweden's central bank is considering creating registered accounts for electronic currency issuance, as cash transactions decline due to consumer preference. Swedes are comfortable with electronic payment methods, attributed to the country's tech-savvy nature and trust in institutions. Some concerns have been raised about financial access issues for certain groups like the elderly. In Sweden, the decline in cash use is linked to the transition to new banknotes and coins, leading to a shift towards electronic payment methods. In Kenya, the introduction of the mobile money service M-Pesa by Safaricom became popular as a general payment system, allowing users to transfer money using their phones. In Kenya, M-Pesa became popular as a general payment system due to lack of access to traditional banking services and the proliferation of mobile phones. Before M-Pesa, only 19% of Kenyans had bank accounts, but 54% had access to a mobile phone. Safaricom identified a profitable market in Kenya for mobile money services. The success of M-Pesa in Kenya has led financial institutions to focus on offering services to lower-income groups, increasing access to formal financial services from 27% in 2006 to 75% in 2017. Despite mobile money's growth, cash transactions still dominate, with 8 out of 10 transactions being in cash. Despite the success of M-Pesa in Kenya and the increased access to formal financial services, cash transactions still prevail with 8 out of 10 transactions being in cash due to Kenyans' preference for cash for small purchases and workers being paid in cash."
