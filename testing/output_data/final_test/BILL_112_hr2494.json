    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Former Soviet Union State Pension Fairness Act of 2011\". Congress finds that over 1.1 million immigrants from the former Soviet Union live in the United States, many of whom worked for state-run industries and earned government pensions in their countries of origin. A significant percentage of these immigrants are elderly, retired, and living below the poverty line, with many being Jews who fled religious persecution. The United States has negotiated totalization agreements with 24 countries to coordinate public pension coverage. These countries include Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Social Security benefits are not paid to noncitizens residing outside the United States. The United States has arrangements with 71 countries under section 202(t) of the Social Security Act, where the US pays foreign countries' citizens who earned Social Security while working in the US but now live abroad. The United States has agreements with 71 countries under section 202(t) of the Social Security Act to pay US citizens who earned pensions in those countries and have since moved abroad. The United States has agreements with 71 countries to pay US citizens who earned pensions in those countries and have since moved abroad. Not all persons from the former Soviet Union living in the US receive pensions they worked for. Efforts have been made to encourage these states to adopt policies allowing receipt of pensions for individuals who worked and earned a pension in any former Soviet state and now reside in the US. In June 2009, the House of Representatives adopted House Amendment 185 to H.R. 2410, stating that the US should work with former Soviet Union states to ensure pension payments for immigrants. In October 2009, Ukraine's Constitutional Court ruled against a law barring pension payments to residents in certain countries. This decision allowed Ukrainians in the US to receive their earned pensions. The Constitutional Court of Ukraine ruled that pensions earned by Ukrainians in the US must be implemented through legislation. The Secretary of State and the Commissioner of Social Security are directed to work with former Soviet Union states to enable individuals who worked there and now reside in the US to receive pensions. This is a priority in US foreign policy. The Secretary of State and the Commissioner of Social Security are required to submit an annual report to Congress on the progress of encouraging former Soviet Union states to adopt specific policies. The term \"states of the former Soviet Union\" includes Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan."
