    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2001\". Congress recognizes that violence motivated by factors such as race, religion, or gender is a serious national issue that disrupts communities and affects interstate commerce. Existing Federal law is insufficient to address this problem. Violence motivated by bias, including factors such as race, religion, or gender, can involve perpetrators crossing State lines, using interstate commerce, and committing acts with articles that have traveled across state lines. Federal intervention is necessary due to the seriousness, widespread nature, and interstate scope of the problem, especially in jurisdictions lacking laws addressing such violence. Some States have laws protecting victims based on factors like race, religion, or gender, while others offer limited protection based on these characteristics. The Act defines \"hate crime\" in alignment with the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. It also prohibits certain acts of violence. Section 245 of title 18, United States Code, is amended to include harsher penalties for causing bodily injury based on race, color, religion, or national origin. Penalties include imprisonment up to 10 years, or life if death results from the crime. The amended Section 245 of title 18, United States Code, imposes harsh penalties for causing bodily injury based on religion, gender, sexual orientation, or disability. The penalties include imprisonment up to 10 years, or life imprisonment if death results from the crime. The amended Section 245 of title 18, United States Code, imposes harsh penalties for acts involving kidnapping, aggravated sexual abuse, or attempted murder in connection with interstate or foreign commerce. The Federal Sentencing Commission will study adult recruitment of juveniles for hate crimes and may amend sentencing guidelines to enhance penalties for adults who recruit juveniles. The Commission will ensure consistency with other guidelines and avoid duplicate punishments. Additionally, there is a grant program established. SEC. 6. GRANT PROGRAM. The Administrator of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention shall make grants to combat hate crimes by juveniles. Authorization of appropriations is provided. SEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION FOR ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL TO ASSIST STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. Appropriations are authorized to increase personnel to prevent and respond to hate crime violations."
