    "title": "SB 1273",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. The Legislature acknowledges the urgent need for mental health crisis stabilization services in California, especially for those with serious mental illness. The Mental Health Services Act allows for the provision of prevention and early intervention services. This act clarifies that counties can use funds from the MHSA for crisis stabilization services, including colocation of voluntary and involuntary services. The state will distribute funds for voluntary mental health services to adults and seniors with severe illnesses, subject to availability of funds from the Mental Health Services Fund. This includes services provided at facilities where involuntary services are also offered. Funding will be provided to ensure counties can offer necessary mental health services to adults and seniors. The funding will cover costs not covered by other sources. County mental health programs must align services with the system of care for eligible individuals. Services should be planned in line with the Recovery Vision for mental health consumers. The Recovery Vision for mental health consumers aims to promote hope, empowerment, respect, social connections, self-responsibility, and self-determination. It also advocates for consumer-operated services, cultural diversity, and individualized planning for each consumer's needs. The county mental health program must ensure that adults and seniors with severe mental illness receive appropriate services based on available funds. Each county plan and annual update must consider providing services similar to those in the Mentally Ill Offender Crime Reduction Grant Program. Funds cannot be used for state prison inmates or parolees. Funds may be used for mental health services and voluntary outpatient crisis stabilization services in counties participating in the Assisted Outpatient Treatment Demonstration Project Act of 2002. The department will contract for services with county mental health programs, and grants mentioned in previous sections will now refer to these contracts. Employees covered under collective bargaining agreements are not to be displaced."
