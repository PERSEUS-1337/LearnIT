    "content": "The Act titled \"Federal Property Low Hanging Fruit Act\" allows executive departments to use funds from the disposal of federal real property uniformly. The Act allows executive departments to convey real property and retain proceeds for use in accordance with specified guidelines. Executive departments can incur necessary costs for property management activities, including acquisition and maintenance. They can enter agreements with the General Services Administration for assistance. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget will create regulations for this section, in consultation with the Administrator of General Services and the Secretary of Defense. Definitions include \"net proceeds\" as the sum received minus costs, and \"executive department\" as the governing body. The term \"executive department\" refers to an Executive department listed in section 101 of title 5, United States Code. SEC. 3. PUBLIC-PRIVATE AGREEMENT PILOT PROGRAM. The head of a covered agency must develop a plan to enter into agreements with nongovernmental entities to lease underutilized federal properties and develop facilities for the agency's benefit. At least 5 and up to 10 properties can be leased under these agreements. Each agreement entered into under this section aims to enhance the efficiency of Federal real property. Negotiations will follow procedures to promote competition and protect the public interest. The agreement will include a lease option for the United States to occupy the facilities but does not guarantee occupancy. It will outline consideration, duties, and terms. The agreement under this section aims to enhance Federal real property efficiency. It includes consideration, duties, and responsibilities for the United States and the nongovernmental person. The agreement may involve altering, repairing, or improving real property as part of the consideration. It also states that the United States is not liable for the actions or debts of the nongovernmental person. No one is authorized to create any indebtedness without proper authorization. The lease agreement must disclaim any liability of the United States and ensure that the United States' leasehold interests are senior to any lender. The nongovernmental person can still pledge their leasehold interest as collateral. This provision does not affect the ability to enter into a lease with the United States for real property. The head of a covered agency may lease real property to a nongovernmental person under certain conditions, with the lease period determined by the agency. The leased property is not considered unutilized for homeless assistance purposes and can be leased without regard to other laws. The agency can also provide services as needed. The head of a covered agency can provide services to a nongovernmental person under an agreement, and retain revenues for property management activities. Revenues from agreements shall be deposited into a specific fund. The plan of a covered agency required under subsection (a) shall identify Federal real properties to be made available under agreements with nongovernmental persons and include performance measures for the proposed projects. The head of a covered agency must consult with the Federal Real Property Council. The agency head must submit the required plan to Congress within 12 months and each agreement before implementation, including an explanation and relevant details. The head of a covered agency must submit all agreements under the plan to Congress within 3 years of the enactment of the Act, including details on nongovernmental parties, project factors, and projected economic performance. The head of a covered agency must describe the projected economic performance in the budget for each agreement entered into, with definitions provided for covered agency and head of a covered agency. The terms related to federal real property and entities involved in property transactions are defined, including \"Federal real property,\" \"excess,\" \"nongovernmental person,\" and \"executive agency.\" The Comptroller General of the United States will submit two reports to Congress on the effectiveness of the public-private agreement pilot program, with specific recommendations on using such agreements in all Federal agencies to improve real property management. The first report is due within 5 years of enactment, and the second report within 10 years."
