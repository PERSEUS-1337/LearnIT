    "content": "The \"Autofill Act of 2015\" is also known as the Automated Partially Pre-Populated Tax Returns Act. It adds a new section to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, allowing for automated partially pre-populated tax returns. The Secretary will establish a program for taxpayers to download pre-populated individual income tax forms with information reported under chapter 61 and section 232 of the Social Security Act. The return information must be available within 15 days in printable and computer-readable formats. The Secretary will establish standards for data download to tax preparation software and provide a secure function on the website for taxpayers to download pre-populated 1040, 1040A, and 1040EZ forms annually. The taxpayer is responsible for the accuracy of their tax return and must verify all information provided in downloadable forms. This section does not absolve the taxpayer from full responsibility for the completeness of their tax return. Information related to wage and self-employment income for the year 2015 is provided under this program. The Commissioner of Social Security must provide wage and self-employment income information for the year 2015 to the Secretary by January 31, 2016. For subsequent years, this information must be provided by January 31 of the following year. The deadline for filing information returns under part III of the Code is January 31 of the year following the calendar year to which the returns relate. This deadline also applies to providing wage and self-employment income information to the Commissioner of Social Security. The deadline for filing information returns under part III of the Code is January 31 of the year following the calendar year to which the returns relate. Additionally, a clerical amendment was made to the table of sections for chapter 77 of the Code. Effective Date: The amendments for automated partially pre-populated tax returns apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2014."
