    "content": "Section 1861(e)(9) and 1861(j)(15) of the Social Security Act are amended to include \"health, safety, and rights\" for hospitals and skilled nursing facilities. Section 1864(c) is also amended to include \"the health, safety, and rights of patients\". Additionally, new sections are added regarding the rights of patients in certain long-term care facilities. In section 1882, the Secretary prescribes standards for patient rights in facilities with over 30 days average stay. The governing board must establish policies consistent with patient rights, and the facility must make these policies available to the public, patients, and guardians. Facilities with over 30 days average stay must establish policies ensuring patient rights, including the right to be fully informed upon admission and during their stay. Staff must be trained and involved in implementing these policies. \"A patient has the right to be fully informed about services and charges, including any changes in availability or charges for services. They also have the right to be informed about their medical condition by a physician.\" \"A patient has the right to participate in medical treatment planning, refuse experimental research, and be transferred or discharged only for medical reasons or nonpayment, with advance notice and preparation provided.\" \"A patient has the right to file complaints, voice grievances, and manage personal financial affairs free from interference or discrimination.\" The patient has the right to manage personal financial affairs and receive itemized accounting of transactions. They also have the right to be free from abuse and restraints, except in authorized situations by a physician or in emergencies. A patient has the right to confidential treatment of personal and medical records, including the approval or refusal of their release outside the facility. They also have the right to be treated with consideration, respect, dignity, and privacy in treatment and personal care. A patient has the right to privacy in visits by their spouse, use personal possessions, participate in activities of choice, freedom of association, and not be required to perform services for the facility. The patient's right to privacy in visits by their spouse is ensured, and if both spouses are patients in the facility, they have the right to share the same room if desired. Patient rights devolve to their guardian or next of kin if adjudicated incompetent. The enforcement of patient's rights includes ensuring privacy in visits by their spouse and the right to share a room if both spouses are patients in the facility. Patient rights devolve to their guardian or next of kin if adjudicated incompetent. The Secretary will establish a schedule of civil penalties for violating patient rights, with a maximum penalty of $500 per violation, except for complaints filed free from interference, which can incur a $1,000 penalty. Patients can submit complaints for rights violations to the enforcing agency. Enforcing agencies must receive complaints within 180 days of the violation. Upon receiving a complaint, the agency notifies the facility, investigates confidentially, and provides a report within 30 days. The report, with identities deleted, is shared with the complainant. As a result of an investigation, if a facility is found to have violated patients' rights, the enforcing agency will work to address the violation through informal methods to prevent future similar violations. Information from these informal endeavors cannot be made public or used as evidence in a subsequent proceeding. The enforcing agency will assess a civil penalty against a facility if a conciliation agreement cannot be reached within 30 days. The penalty will be determined by a written order after providing notice and an opportunity for a hearing. The enforcing agency will assess civil penalties for violations of patient rights, with payments made promptly to patients or their heirs. These penalties will not affect eligibility for assistance programs based on income or resources. The enforcing agency may suspend an order of assessment against a facility if assurances are provided to prevent future violations. Judicial review is available for individuals affected by agency actions within 60 days. The enforcing agency may suspend an order of assessment against a facility if assurances are provided to prevent future violations. Judicial review is available for individuals affected by agency actions within 60 days. An aggrieved party is entitled to judicial review in the appropriate court. Legal fees and costs may be imposed on a patient or facility if their action is deemed harassment. If a penalty order is issued by an enforcing agency and not suspended, the facility must pay the penalty amount. The facility must pay the penalty amount to the enforcing agency within 60 days of the order becoming final or being reimposed. The agency will hold the payment in escrow and release it at the end of the 60-day period, except if judicial review is sought, in which case payment will be made after the review. Failure to pay the civil penalty on time will result in consequences. If a facility fails to pay a civil penalty on time, the enforcing agency will recover the amount in court with interest. The imposition of a civil penalty does not prevent patients or enforcing agencies from seeking other damages or relief. The term 'enforcing agency' refers to the entity responsible for enforcing violations in a state where the Secretary has an agreement. The Secretary shall make agreements with States for enforcing patients' rights under section 1883, with payment for services prescribed in subsection (b). The Secretary will make agreements with States to enforce patients' rights under section 1883, including private meetings between patients and survey personnel during certification surveys to discuss patients' experiences and compliance with standards. Accreditation surveys must also include private meetings for institutions to meet patients' rights standards. The Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare will publish proposed regulations for amendments made by this Act within six months of enactment. The regulations will become fully effective nine months after enactment."
