    "content": "After the 9/11 attacks, the 9/11 Commission Report recommended implementing biometric passports for all individuals entering the United States, including Americans, Canadians, and Mexicans. This led to the initiation of the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI) by Congress in 2004 to enhance security measures at borders. The Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, developed a plan to require a passport or other document for all travelers entering the United States. Tightened travel regulations were implemented in 2008, requiring U.S. and Canadian citizens to present proof of identity and citizenship to cross the border. Passports and passport cards are acceptable for U.S. citizens, while Canadians can use a government-issued passport. Travelers from Bermuda can enter the United States with a passport issued by the government of Bermuda or the United Kingdom. Mexican citizens need a passport and visa or border crossing card to enter the U.S. Passport fees increased by $3.00 in 2008. The total cost for a U.S. passport is $100 for adults and $85 for children under 16. Passport card fees are $20 for adults and $10 for children under 16. Since January 23, 2007, all travelers between the United States and Canada, Mexico, Bermuda, and the Caribbean must present a passport or valid travel document. Passport cards cost $20 for adults and $10 for children under 16, with an additional $25 execution fee for in-person applications. U.S. citizens traveling to U.S. territories like the Virgin Islands or Puerto Rico do not need a passport. The 2007 passport requirement change caused confusion due to poor communication, leading to unnecessary applications. The Department of State faced passport demand issues in 2007, leading to delays in processing applications. They hired contractors to help, with 60% of passport employees coming from private firms. Passport issuance returned to normal in 2008 and 2009. The final phase of passport requirements for land and sea travel to the US was fully implemented on June 1, 2009. The implementation of the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative (WHTI) was delayed until June 1, 2009, due to concerns from Congress and stakeholders. As of that date, travelers must have passports for all air, land, and sea crossings, with exceptions for U.S. or Canadian children under 16 who can present birth certificates or other proof of citizenship. The passport confusion in 2007 strained the Department of State's ability to issue passports in a timely manner, lengthening wait times to three or four months. Tips for getting passports include visiting the State Department's website for application information, checking application status online, and contacting the U.S. Postal Service for passport post office locations. To apply for a passport, visit the Postal Service website or call the National Passport Information Center. For WHTI passport policy information, visit the Department of Homeland Security website. The Department of Homeland Security and the Department of State have different roles in passport policy. Some question the effectiveness of having two departments handle passport policy, with concerns about confusion and costs. The $3 fee increase brings the total passport application cost to $100 for adults and $85 for children, potentially burdening American families. The Department of State defends the high passport costs due to background checks and technology. Accessibility to passport offices is a concern, with fewer offices in the middle of the country. Businesses fear profit loss due to recent passport requirements. Some Members of Congress want to delay these requirements to help businesses. Some Members of Congress want to postpone passport requirements to help businesses prepare and avoid profit loss. Senator Leahy believes the timing for stricter regulations is bad with a possible recession looming. Secretary of Homeland Security, Michael Chertoff, emphasizes the need for improved security measures in the face of terrorist threats."
