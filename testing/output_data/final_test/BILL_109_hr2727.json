    "content": "The \"Quality of Life for Women Act\" is the short title of this legislation. It includes findings related to women's quality of life. The Congress finds that women's pelvic floor disorders, including bladder and bowel dysfunction, pelvic organ prolapse, and urinary incontinence, are common conditions that cause disability and pain. These disorders are barriers to healthy living, often coexist, and affect a significant percentage of American women. Many women undergo surgery for urinary incontinence or pelvic organ prolapse, with a significant number requiring a second surgery. Non-surgical treatments are also common. Around 900,000 women develop urinary incontinence after vaginal deliveries in the US annually, leading to significant healthcare costs. Many healthcare providers lack knowledge about pelvic floor disorders and treatment options, highlighting the need for better education and awareness to address this public health issue. To address pelvic floor disorders, awareness and education programs are needed for the public and primary-care providers. Research on urinary incontinence and other pelvic floor disorders should be authorized to improve care and treatment for affected women. SEC. 399O. EDUCATION REGARDING WOMEN'S PELVIC FLOOR DISORDERS. This section amends the Public Health Service Act to include education programs on women's pelvic floor disorders. The Secretary will implement a program to educate on bladder and bowel dysfunction, pelvic organ prolapse, and pelvic floor disorders. This includes providing information on the prevalence of pelvic floor disorders in women and treatment options. The Secretary will ensure education on pelvic floor disorders includes treatment options and posting information on the CDC website. Congress suggests establishing a national registry for surgical treatments using new technology. SEC. 409J of the Public Health Service Act addresses women's pelvic floor disorders. SEC. 409J of the Public Health Service Act mandates the expansion of activities by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development regarding women's pelvic floor disorders. This includes independent research proposals and the continuation of the Urinary Incontinence Treatment Network. The Director shall ensure the operation of continence treatment centers and a Clinical Trials Network for Female Pelvic Disorders, with multiple sites and a coordinating committee. Additional centers may be established subject to appropriations Acts. The Director oversees clinical sites and a data coordinating committee for the Urinary Incontinence Treatment Network. Congress commends the financial support from various institutes for research on pelvic floor disorders. The Congress commends the financial support from various institutes for research on pelvic floor disorders and encourages increased funding for multidisciplinary research in women's health. The Congress encourages industry relationships in women's pelvic floor health research, recruits scientists from various fields to collaborate on urinary tract and incontinence research, increases funding for studies on bladder and urethral interactions, and supports the development of animal models for urinary incontinence. The Congress encourages industry relationships in women's pelvic floor health research, recruits scientists from various fields to collaborate on urinary tract and incontinence research, increases funding for studies on bladder and urethral interactions, and supports the development of animal models for urinary incontinence. They also aim to develop novel techniques for measuring pelvic floor health, identify risk factors for pelvic floor disorders and urinary incontinence, and develop preventive and therapeutic approaches sensitive to gender, race, and culture. The Congress aims to develop a national data registry and tissue bank for incontinence research, and study the relationship between pelvic organ prolapse and associated dysfunctions like voiding issues and incontinence. The Director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development will include women's pelvic floor health in the National Children's Study. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will consult with relevant organizations in carrying out this Act."
