Congress must decide on approving, rejecting, or modifying the Navy's acquisition strategies and funding requests for these large UVs. The Navy is seeking funding for Large Unmanned Surface Vehicles (LUSVs), Medium Unmanned Surface Vehicles (MUSVs), and Extra-large Unmanned Undersea Vehicles (XLUUVs) to shift to a new fleet architecture. Congress must decide on approving, rejecting, or modifying the Navy's acquisition strategies and funding requests for these large UVs, which pose oversight issues and could impact Navy capabilities and funding requirements. Additionally, the Navy is also interested in developing smaller USVs, UUVs, and UAVs, along with other U.S. military services pursuing their own UV programs. UVs are part of the Navy's efforts to address emerging military challenges, particularly from China, and can be equipped with various payloads and operated remotely, semi-autonomously, or autonomously. Unmanned Vehicles (UVs) are autonomously operated and can be more cost-effective than manned vehicles. They are suitable for missions that are long-duration, physically taxing, or high-risk for human operators. The Navy has been developing various types of UVs for years, with some transitioning into procurement programs. For example, the Navy's inventory included 99 UAVs at the end of FY2019 and is projected to include 45 at the end of FY2020. UVs are considered ideal for \"three D\" missions - dull, dirty, or dangerous. The Navy's inventory of unmanned vehicles (UVs) is projected to include 45 UAVs at the end of FY2020 and 57 UAVs at the end of FY2021. Some observers are dissatisfied with the Navy's slow pace in transitioning UV development efforts into procurement programs. The Navy organizes its UV acquisition programs into size-based categories, with large UVs falling into the top categories. The Navy is considering whether to include large unmanned vehicles (UVs) in the top-level count of ships. These UVs can be deployed directly from piers for missions typically assigned to manned ships and submarines. Navy officials have not yet decided on modifying the ship count to incorporate these large UVs. The Navy is considering incorporating large UVs into its fleet architecture, which would involve fewer large surface combatants and more small surface combatants. The new architecture aims to be more distributed and includes a significant number of large UVs. Figure 3 illustrates the comparison between the current \"ship centric force\" and the new \"distributed/nodal force\" for the surface combatant portion of the Navy. Each sphere in the figure represents a manned ship or USV. Under the more distributed architecture, manned ships would be smaller on average, with some weapons and sensors shifted to USVs. This shift would involve weapon-equipped LUSVs and sensor-equipped MUSVs contributing to the fleet's capabilities. The Navy's current surface combatant force architecture aims for a 2:1 ratio of LSCs to SSCs, with plans to achieve a 355-ship fleet. A shift towards a more distributed architecture would reverse this ratio to 1:2, with added LUSVs and MUSVs. The Navy is considering a smaller fleet size to adapt to a different future combat strategy. The Surface Warfare Director Rear Adm. Ronald Boxall highlighted the need for more small surface combatants in the force structure assessment. The Navy is considering a shift towards a more distributed architecture with a ratio of 1:2 LSCs to SSCs, incorporating LUSVs and MUSVs for a total of 100 surface combatant platforms. The Navy is considering a shift towards a more distributed architecture for the Future Surface Combatant Force (FSCF), incorporating LSCs, SSCs, LUSVs, and MUSVs. The current fleet architecture is seen as vulnerable to A2/AD capabilities, prompting the need for a more distributed approach. The platform ratios in Figure 3 are conceptual and not exact, but represent an evolution towards a more balanced fleet composition. The Navy is considering a shift towards a more distributed architecture for the Future Surface Combatant Force (FSCF) to counter A2/AD capabilities of potential adversaries, particularly China. This shift would complicate an adversary's targeting challenge, reduce loss in Navy capability, allow deployment of USVs and UUVs in wartime, and increase fleet adaptability to changing mission needs. Navy leaders have recently shifted their thinking to support this new approach. Navy officials now support a more distributed architecture for the Future Surface Combatant Force to counter A2/AD capabilities, particularly from China. This shift is seen as necessary to effectively respond to evolving threats and is technically feasible with advances in UV and networking technologies. The new architecture is believed to be cost-effective and may differ in details from previous proposals. The Navy is transitioning to a more distributed architecture called Distributed Maritime Operations (DMO) using large UVs as a key component. The FY2020 shipbuilding plan mentions this new operational concept, and the Navy is working on developing a comprehensive operational architecture to support DMO. Key enablers of DMO include MUSV and LUSV for forward deployment and teaming capabilities. The Navy is transitioning to Distributed Maritime Operations (DMO) using large Unmanned Vehicles (UVs) like MUSV and LUSV for forward deployment and teaming capabilities. The Navy aims to employ accelerated acquisition strategies to quickly field these UVs, reflecting the urgency to meet future military challenges, particularly from countries like China. The LUSV and MUSV programs are building on USV development work done by the Strategic Capabilities Office (SCO) within the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD). The Navy's Ghost Fleet initiative includes the development of Large Unmanned Surface Vessels (LUSVs) under the Overlord program. Autonomous technologies like artificial intelligence are crucial for underwater operations due to communication limitations. A surface development squadron has been established to work on operational concepts for LUSVs and Medium USVs (MUSVs), with plans to add more prototypes and vessels in the future. LUSVs are envisioned to be 200 to 300 feet in length. The Navy envisions Large Unmanned Surface Vessels (LUSVs) to be low-cost, high-endurance ships based on commercial designs, with a focus on carrying anti-surface warfare and strike payloads. They are intended to operate with human operators in the loop, semi-autonomously, or fully autonomously. The Navy's Large Unmanned Surface Vessels (LUSVs) are designed to operate with human operators in the loop, semi-autonomously, or fully autonomously. They may have a few onboard crew members initially as the Navy develops enabling technologies and operational concepts. LUSVs will feature built-in capabilities, accept modular payloads, and utilize existing Navy sensors and weapon launchers. Congressional defense committees have raised concerns about the Navy's accelerated acquisition strategies for large UVs, particularly the LUSV. The Senate Armed Services Committee and the Navy have expressed concerns about the budget request and acquisition strategies for Large Unmanned Surface Vessels (LUSVs), highlighting risks in design, technology development, integration, and unclear policy implications regarding LUSVs. The Senate Armed Services Committee and the Navy have raised concerns about the budget request and acquisition strategies for Large Unmanned Surface Vessels (LUSVs), emphasizing risks in design, technology development, integration, and policy implications. They recommend incorporating lessons learned from the current initiative before further procurement of LUSVs and suggest a more rigorous requirements definition process for the program. The Senate Armed Services Committee and the Navy have concerns about the acquisition strategy for Large Unmanned Surface Vessels (LUSVs), emphasizing risks in design, technology development, and integration. They recommend incorporating lessons learned before further procurement and suggest a more rigorous requirements definition process. The committee directs the Secretary of the Navy to submit a report on acquisition roadmaps for various unmanned systems to avoid excessive procurement before operational needs are met. The Senate Armed Services Committee and the Navy have concerns about the acquisition strategy for Large Unmanned Surface Vessels (LUSVs), emphasizing risks in design, technology development, and integration. They recommend a more rigorous requirements definition process and incorporating lessons learned before further procurement. The Assistant Secretary of the Navy is directed to submit acquisition roadmaps for unmanned systems to encourage industrial innovation and avoid excessive procurement before operational needs are met. The Committee supports investments in unmanned and autonomous technologies, including surface and sub-surface vessels. The Committee recommends adjustments to acquisition strategies for Large Unmanned Surface Vessels (LUSVs) and directs the Navy to comply with full funding policy for LUSVs. $50,000,000 is recommended for future LUSV design without vertical launch system capability in fiscal year 2020. Incremental upgrade capability for a vertical launch system may be addressed in the future. In response to congressional directives, the Navy's FY2021 budget proposes adjustments to the acquisition strategy for Large Unmanned Surface Vessels (LUSVs). The Navy plans to use research and development funding to acquire additional prototypes in FY2021 and FY2022 before transitioning to procurement funding in FY2023. No funds will be awarded for future LUSV conceptual design until the Assistant Secretary of the Navy briefs the congressional defense committees on the updated acquisition strategy. The Navy plans to use procurement funding for the procurement of deployable LUSVs at annual rates in FY2023-FY2025. Major changes in the LUSV program include awarding Conceptual Design contracts to multiple vendors in FY20 to refine a LUSV Performance Specification without the Vertical Launch System. The final specification will allow integration of various capabilities and payloads, with a delay in the award until early Q4 FY2020. The Navy plans to delay the award of the LUSV Detail Design and Construction (DD&C) contract from FY 2021 to FY 2022, resulting in a one-year delay. Additionally, they intend to procure up to two additional Overlord prototypes instead of awarding the LUSV DD&C contract in FY21. The Navy plans to transition the LUSV program to a program of record in FY 2023 and align procurement funding to the Shipbuilding and Conversion, Navy (SCN) account. The Navy plans to delay the award of the LUSV Detail Design and Construction (DD&C) contract from FY 2021 to FY 2022, resulting in a one-year delay. They also intend to procure up to two additional Overlord prototypes instead of awarding the LUSV DD&C contract in FY21. The Navy is pursuing the MUSV program as a rapid prototyping effort under Section 804 middle tier acquisition authority, with the first prototype funded in FY2019 and plans to fund the second prototype in FY2023. The MUSV program aims to develop low-cost, high-endurance, reconfigurable ships with initial payloads for intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and electronic warfare systems. The Navy's MUSV program involves the design, construction, and testing of the Sea Hunter medium displacement USV. The program also includes a fleet-ready command and control solution for USVs developed by the Strategic Capabilities Office. The XLUUV program, known as the Orca program, addresses a Joint Emergent Operational Need by developing UUVs too large to be launched from a manned Navy submarine. The Navy's XLUUV program, known as the Orca program, involves the development of unmanned underwater vehicles too large to be launched from a manned Navy submarine. XLUUVs will be transported to a forward operating port and launched from a pier, equipped with a modular payload bay for carrying mines and other payloads. Boeing was selected to fabricate, test, and deliver the first five XLUUVs, partnering with Huntington Ingalls Industries for construction. The Navy's XLUUV program, known as the Orca program, involves the development of unmanned underwater vehicles too large to be launched from a manned Navy submarine. Boeing's Orca XLUUV design will be funded starting in FY2023 through the Other Procurement, Navy account. The design is based on Boeing's Echo Voyager UUV, with a range of up to 6,500 nautical miles and a modular payload section up to 34 feet in length. The Navy's XLUUV program, known as the Orca program, involves developing unmanned underwater vehicles too large for manned Navy submarines. Boeing's Orca XLUUV design, based on the Echo Voyager UUV, will be funded from FY2023. It has a range of 6,500 nautical miles and a modular payload section providing 2,000 cubic feet of internal volume. The Navy's proposals for large UVs raise oversight issues for Congress, including the shift to a more distributed fleet architecture. Key questions for Congress include the analytical basis for this shift and the comparison of costs, capabilities, and risks between the current and proposed architectures. The Navy's proposed changes to the LUSV's accelerated acquisition strategy raise oversight questions for Congress regarding potential costs, benefits, and risks compared to a more traditional approach. Congress should also consider the impact of the international security environment shift on these strategies. The Navy's proposed changes to the LUSV's accelerated acquisition strategy raise oversight questions for Congress regarding technical, schedule, and cost risks. Congress should also consider the Navy's efforts to mitigate these risks while deploying the UVs on an accelerated timeline. The Navy's proposed changes to the LUSV's accelerated acquisition strategy raise oversight questions for Congress regarding technical, schedule, and cost risks, as well as the potential industrial base implications of large UV programs. Potential oversight questions for Congress include implications of a more distributed architecture for large and small surface combatants, the possibility of building or maintaining UVs outside of traditional shipyards, and the impact on Navy shipbuilding and maintenance workloads. Another concern is the potential implications of large UVs, particularly USVs, on the risk of miscalculation or escalation during Navy operations. The use of autonomous military craft near potential adversaries poses a risk of miscalculation or escalation during Navy operations. Unmanned systems are seen as expendable and may lower the threshold for military action, with serious implications in volatile regions like the South China Sea. The U.S. has recently confronted China and Russia in the South China Sea, where autonomous systems are proliferating. Military commanders may feel emboldened to strike these platforms, expecting lower repercussions by avoiding human casualties. Chinese naval personnel seized an unmanned American underwater glider in 2016, leading to diplomatic tensions. In the future, the Chinese military may intercept more American autonomous systems. China's navy may intercept American autonomous systems, such as the Sea Hunter prototype trimaran. Capturing these unmanned vessels could allow Chinese technicians to access communication codes, AI software, navigational data, and cyber vulnerabilities. In congested international sea lanes like the Singapore Strait, collisions and groundings are common. Updating naval conduct agreements to include guidelines for interactions between manned and autonomous vessels is crucial to avoid miscalculations and potential incidents. The potential implications of incorporating large UVs into the Navy's fleet architecture include personnel skills, training, and career paths. Congress should also consider the relationship between crewed ships and operators of large UVs, as well as the funding amounts requested for these programs in FY2021. Table 2 summarizes congressional action on the Navy's FY2021 funding request for the LUSV, MUSV, and XLUUV programs and their enabling technologies."
