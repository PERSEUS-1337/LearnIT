    "content": "Taxable income from investments, including capital gains, dividends, interest, and returns from depreciating assets, is not adjusted for inflation under the current system. While there is a consensus that inflation adjustment is necessary for measuring real income from capital assets, these types of income receive other tax benefits that offset the lack of inflation indexing. Capital gains represent the change in asset value, calculated as the sale price minus the basis, which is the cost of acquiring the asset adjusted for depreciation and improvements. Assets generating capital gains enjoy various tax benefits such as lower rates, tax deferral, and exclusion of gains. Tax rates on long-term capital gains and dividends range from 0% to 20%, depending on income levels. The recent tax revision did not change these rates, which are linked to prior-law income levels. Taxpayers in the 15% or lower tax bracket pay no tax on capital gains and dividends, while those in the 39.6% bracket pay a 20% tax rate. Married couples face the 15% rate at $156,150 of taxable income and the 20% rate at $480,050. Additionally, couples with over $250,000 of taxable income are subject to a 3.8% tax on passive income, including capital gains. Tax rates on long-term capital gains and dividends range from 0% to 20%, depending on income levels. The recent tax revision did not change these rates. Married couples with over $250,000 of taxable income are subject to a 3.8% tax on passive income, including capital gains. Corporations pay taxes on gains at ordinary rates, now 21%. Certain types of capital gains have special rules, with a $500,000 exclusion for a married couple and a $250,000 exclusion for a single person on the sale of a home. Capital gains receive two benefits not available to other forms of passive income. Tax is not paid on assets until they are sold, allowing for a delay in tax payments due to the time value of money. Assets held until death do not incur capital gains tax, with inheritances receiving a stepped-up basis. Evidence suggests that about half of capital gains are never taxed due to this provision. Capital gains on corporate stock held in retirement plans are effectively exempt from income tax. Two-thirds of American stocks are held in tax-exempt forms. The U.S. tax code limits losses to offset gains, with a $3,000 cap on offsetting ordinary income. Short-term losses can offset short-term gains dollar for dollar, providing a tax advantage. The limit on losses has not been adjusted for inflation since 1978. Dividends receive lower tax rates like capital gains and are often held in pension plans. Inflation indexing does not affect stocks as real gains are typically reinvested. Taxes on nominal interest are levied at ordinary rates, benefiting borrowers who can deduct nominal interest. This benefit outweighs the penalty for interest income due to a large share of interest-bearing assets in pension funds. Imposing indexing interest would increase the tax burden on interest financial assets. Some income from lending through bank accounts is never taxed as it is received as imputed income. The tax law prior to the 2017 revision also had higher tax rates for corporations and businesses. The tax revision in 2017 reduced tax rates on corporate and business incomes more than rates on individuals, potentially reversing the effect of higher tax rates for borrowers. Depreciation deductions are taken on the asset's original cost, with accelerated depreciation offsetting inflation effects. Many depreciable assets are expensed immediately, including investments in intangible assets and equipment up to $1 million for smaller businesses. Bonus depreciation of 50% has been available for all equipment since 2008. Under the 2017 tax revision, equipment can be expensed through 2022, with expensing then phased out by 20% per year. Last-in, first-out (LIFO) inventory methods can compensate for inflation but are not commonly used due to financial accounting implications. Indexing would increase the basis of the asset. Indexing increases the basis of assets by adjusting for changes in the price level between acquisition and sale. For example, with a 2% inflation rate and 7% real rate of return, a $100 asset would sell for $109.14 a year later. Without indexing, the gain would be $9.14, but with indexing, the gain would be $7.14, reflecting a 7% return on the adjusted basis of $102. Basis for common stock is the purchase price, while for depreciating assets, it's the purchase price minus depreciation plus improvements. Fully depreciated assets would face higher taxes with indexed basis due to recapture tax rates. Indexing the basis would increase taxes due to higher recapture tax rates on gains reflecting depreciation. The effect of inflation indexing depends on the measure used, such as the CPI-U, chained CPI-U, and GDP deflator. Different measures impact tax code elements like rate brackets and deductions. Chained CPI-U generally shows smaller inflation rates than standard CPI-U, while GDP deflator reflects changes in domestically produced goods and services. The GDP deflator is used for capital gains as it reflects changes in domestically produced goods and services. Partnerships accounted for the largest share of net gains in recent years, followed by corporate stock and unincorporated business interests. The indexing of assets for tax purposes depends on the assets included and the holding period. The largest share of net gains in recent years came from partnerships, corporate stock, and unincorporated business interests. Other significant categories included mutual funds, capital gains distributions, land, business real property, and residential rental property. Residences accounted for a small percentage due to a $500,000 exclusion for married couples ($250,000 for singles) set in 1997. Indexing for inflation could strengthen the case for including residences in capital gains calculations. In 2012, transactions yielded gains of $844 billion and losses of $204 billion, resulting in net gains of $640 billion. Short-term assets had gains of 11.6% and losses of 63.7%, with net gains of 3.9%. Long-term assets had varying holding periods, with gains from assets held for 20 years or more accounting for 36%. Corporate stock and real estate also showed similar holding patterns. Gains from assets held for 20 years or more accounted for 36%. A proposal can index gains regardless of the type of taxpayer, or it can exclude corporate gains. Current proposals do not specify what assets are to be affected or what measure of inflation to use. S. 2688 limits the application to assets held for more than three years and uses the implicit price deflator for GDP as the measure of inflation. The bill S. 2688 proposes indexing capital gains based on the change in the GDP deflator, applying to common stock in C corporations and tangible assets used in business. It does not apply to corporate capital gains, cannot create a loss, and covers past and future inflation. Special provisions are included for stock held in mutual funds and real estate investment trusts, with antiabuse provisions for hedging and short sales. The history of indexing capital gains is discussed, starting from the high inflation rates in the 1970s. The early 1990s saw discussions on indexing capital gains for inflation by regulation, with concerns dating back to 1918. In the 1970s, high inflation rates led to increased attention on indexing capital gains. Various proposals were made, including one in 1978 that increased the exclusion of gain from 50% to 60%. The Senate also considered indexing in 1982 but dropped the provision in conference. The original Treasury Study in 1986 proposed taxing capital gains. In 1986, the original Treasury Study proposed taxing capital gains at ordinary rates and indexing them for inflation. The 1986 act did not contain indexing and taxed capital gains at ordinary rates. In 1989, President George H. W. Bush proposed a top rate of 15% on capital gains, halving top rates. The Ways and Means Committee considered proposals for indexing capital gains and a 30% exclusion followed by inflation indexation. In 1991, President Bush proposed a 30% capital gains exclusion, which was not enacted into law. In 1992, he proposed a 45% exclusion, but the House adopted indexation for inflation for newly acquired assets instead. The Senate passed graduated rates on capital gains for moderate-income individuals, included in a vetoed bill. In 1994, the Republican \"Contract With America\" campaign proposed a 50% exclusion for capital gains and indexing the basis for inflation. In 1995, the Ways and Means Committee reported out H.R. 1215, which restricted inflation indexing to newly acquired assets, did not allow indexation to create losses, and provided a flat 25% tax rate for corporations. The 1995 reconciliation bill (H.R. 2491) included these revisions but delayed the indexation provision until 2002. President Clinton and the 105th Congress agreed to a tax cut in 1997 as part of the reconciliation (P.L. 105-34), which included a change in tax treatment of owner-occupied housing. The final law in 1997 included a reduction in capital gains rates, with a maximum tax of 20% on gains held for a year. Assets held for five years and acquired after 2000 would be taxed at a maximum rate of 18%. An 8% rate would apply to gains on assets held for five years and sold after 2000 in the 15% bracket and below. President Clinton vetoed capital gains indexing due to budget agreement violations. The 1999 House bill proposed cutting capital gains rates to 15% and 10%, but the final version reduced rates to 18% and 8%. Subsequent changes in 2003 included further rate reductions on a temporary basis, which were later made permanent except for very high incomes. Capital gains indexing was no longer part of the debate due to low inflation rates and lower tax rates. Indexing by regulation was introduced in January 1992 due to low inflation rates and lower tax rates. There was disagreement within the George H. W. Bush Administration, with Budget Director Richard Darman supporting regulatory indexing, while Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and White House Counsel C. Boyden Gray opposed it, arguing that the Administration lacked the authority. Congressional Research Service (CRS) report in March 1992 reviewed case law on the issue. The ability to index by regulation claim was supported by a study commissioned by the National Taxpayers Union Foundation and the National Chamber Foundation on August 17, 1992. The study was coauthored by Cooper, Carvin, and Colatriano and subsequently published in the Virginia Tax Review. A brief version of the argument was published in the Wall Street Journal on August 31, 1992. About the same time, the Department of the Treasury reportedly prepared an internal analysis (reached independently), which was referenced in a Justice Department memorandum that concurred with the Treasury's opinion. The Bush Administration considered indexing by regulation but dropped the idea after legal analyses. Attorney General Barr stated that indexing capital gains through administrative action was not feasible. Bob Dole expressed interest in indexing if elected. In 2012, interest in indexing capital gains was briefly revived, possibly due to the presidential election. Recent articles have addressed the issue, with legal experts debating the executive's authority to index. Some argue against it, suggesting possible challengers to any administrative decision. Treasury was concluded to lack the authority to index capital gains for inflation. The section discusses comparing capital gains indexing to alternative tax benefits using effective tax rates for different types of assets. Table 1 shows effective tax rates for investors subject to the maximum capital gains tax under present law with and without indexing for various asset types. The effective tax rates for different types of assets, including buildings and land, are influenced by factors such as depreciation and appreciation. Assets held for longer periods with all returns as gains have lower effective tax rates due to deferral benefits. Stock dividends result in smaller deferral benefits, while assets with no real gain are subject to capital gains tax on prior depreciation and inflation. Commercial buildings have an economic depreciation rate. In nonresidential buildings, economic depreciation rate is higher than inflation, causing nominal value decline. Residential buildings and land increase in value. Residential buildings have faster depreciation and favorable tax treatment compared to commercial buildings. Gain exclusion due to indexing varies by asset. Land gains are entirely due to inflation. The lower tax rates on gains, except for land, compensate for inflation. Indexing benefits land and commercial buildings the most due to real gain size relative to inflation. The real appreciation rate of different assets varies in relation to inflation. Assets like corporate stock with no dividends show the largest real appreciation rate, while land with no real appreciation reflects all gains as inflation. Tax depreciation for commercial and residential buildings affects the share of gains reflecting inflation over time. Indexing the basis for inflation reduces the effective tax rate by allowing a fixed exemption, but does not change the return variation rate. It increases return while reducing risk. However, it produces a more risky revenue stream compared to a lower tax rate or exclusion. The proposed legislation would lower tax rates on assets held for a shorter period and raise them on assets held for a longer period. It would benefit buildings sold more frequently, favor nonresidential over residential buildings, and give the greatest benefit to land that does not appreciate in real value. Residential buildings would receive less benefit compared to other real estate, and their benefit relative to stocks depends on how long they are held. Some past proposals provided more beneficial treatment to assets held longer. The proposed legislation aims to lower tax rates on assets held for a shorter period and raise them on assets held for a longer period, with some past proposals providing more beneficial treatment to assets held longer. Tax benefits for land would likely receive the largest relative tax cut on gains and be capitalized into the value. This section examines issues associated with providing tax benefits to capital gains through inflation indexing. Indexing capital gains could be a revenue-neutral substitute for existing rates, with implications for various assets and tax law elements. This includes indexing a broad range of capital assets, adjusting dividends in excess of earnings, and considering the true cost as determined by the tax code. Indexing capital gains could potentially have implications for various assets and tax law elements, such as adjusting dividends and considering the true cost as determined by the tax code. Concerns include tax sheltering through borrowing to invest in capital gains with indexing, and the question of why capital gains are singled out for indexation over other assets. If capital gains were indexed, a revenue loss could occur, estimated at around $27 billion in 2012. This loss could be smaller if losses couldn't be converted into gains, leading to potential revenue losses of $10-20 billion, or conservatively $102 billion over 10 years according to another estimate. The failure to index capital gains resulted in an additional $34 billion in taxes in FY2017, a quarter of the total collected. Estimates suggest that indexing for inflation could lead to a revenue loss of around $30 billion, depending on asset coverage and the ability to produce losses. Lower rates may reduce the lock-in effect and increase sales, potentially offsetting some of the revenue loss. Statistical studies suggest that indexing for inflation could offset increased sales by 20%. The lock-in effect is most significant for assets held longer with accumulated gains, but those assets receive smaller exclusions. Revenue losses could be minimized by indexing for future inflation or applying it only to newly acquired assets. Lowering taxes on capital gains through inflation indexing could potentially boost economic growth, but only if it is in addition to current tax benefits. Revenue loss from lack of indexing for capital gains was estimated at $34 billion for FY2017. The revenue loss from lack of indexing for capital gains was estimated at $34 billion for FY2017. Two methods are used to project the effects of indexation, resulting in modest effects on the cost of capital. These effects would be even smaller with more restrictive proposals. Unlike other tax cuts, indexing for capital gains may not draw capital from abroad. The potential effects of capital gains tax cuts at the firm level include drawing capital from abroad and increasing saving. However, capital gain effects are limited as savings are not very responsive to changes in rates of return. The increase in debt from crowding out could offset the effects and reduce the capital stock. Indexation to newly acquired assets could help retain larger effects per dollar of revenue loss. Inflation indexation would benefit higher-income individuals. According to the Tax Policy Center, a significant portion of capital gains taxes is paid by the top income earners, with the top 0.1% paying 60.4%, the top 1% paying 80.1%, and the top 5% paying 90.2%. The Penn Wharton Budget Model estimates that the majority of tax cuts from indexing would benefit the top income brackets, with the top 0.1% receiving 63.1%, the top 1% receiving 86.1%, and the top 5% receiving 95.0%. After-tax income increases are higher for the top income brackets, with the top 0.1% seeing a 1% increase, the top 1% seeing a 0.3% increase, and the bottom 95% experiencing virtually no change. The reduction in revenue from unlocking should not affect the estimate, as individuals benefit from tax reduction when selling assets. Relief for capital gains on corporate stocks and dividends is justified due to double taxation, which discourages investment in the corporate sector. Recent tax changes have lessened this concern. The tax rate for owner-occupied housing has declined, affecting the relative tax position of corporate and noncorporate businesses. Under the new law, the corporate tax rate is 21% plus 23.8% of the remaining 79%, totaling 39.8%. Passthrough businesses eligible for a 20% deduction see their top 37% rate reduced to 29.6%. With the 3.8% Medicare/net investment tax, the rates for passthrough businesses are 40.8% and 33.4%. Overall, the passthrough tax rate has decreased compared to the corporate tax rate. The passthrough tax rate has declined relative to the corporate rate, with rates for passthrough businesses at 40.8% and 33.4%. Corporate-sector investments have lower tax rates if capital gains are held until death, bringing the passthrough and corporate combined rates closer together. Corporate-sector investments also favor intangible and equipment investments over noncorporate-sector investments. The corporate sector was taxed similarly to the noncorporate sector before the change, with increased favorable treatment of equipment in the short term. The tax code favors equipment in the short term for the corporate sector. There is no need to further lower capital gains tax rates for corporations. Debt is favored over equity due to deductions on interest, leading to negative effective tax rates on debt-financed investments. Interest income is heavily taxed, but most of it goes untaxed in retirement plans or banking services. The tax code favors equipment in the short term for the corporate sector, but there is no need to lower capital gains tax rates further. Debt is preferred over equity due to interest deductions, resulting in negative tax rates on debt-financed investments. Interest income is heavily taxed, with most of it going untaxed in retirement plans or banking services. Capital gains benefit from being taxed only upon realization or not at all, leading to the retention of income in firms or stock buybacks instead of dividend payments. Inflation indexing for capital gains may distort portfolio choices and favor firms retaining earnings over those paying dividends. Concerns about speculation and short-term focus have led to proposals for change. Inflation indexing for capital gains may distort portfolio choices and favor firms retaining earnings over those paying dividends. Concerns about speculation and short-term focus have led to proposals for financial transaction taxes or capital gains benefits tied to asset holding periods. Speculators provide market liquidity, so intervening in markets for this reason may be questionable. Indexing capital gains for inflation would be complex due to different inflation adjustments needed for each investment vintage. Adjustments for dividend reinvestment plans can be complex, requiring multiple adjustments each year. This complexity is less of a concern now with improved computing facilities. Real estate investors and homeowners would need to adjust basis and acquisition costs annually. Mutual funds with covered and excluded assets would need to allocate basis for indexing. Compliance would be easier with future inflation adjustments. Complications could arise for partnerships with income allocation flexibility.
