The curr_chunk provides definitions for various healthcare professionals such as medical transcriptionists, pharmacists, suppliers of medical equipment, and home health care providers. It also defines health information technology as computer hardware and software that supports meaningful EHR use by eligible professionals. The curr_chunk discusses the use of health information technology in healthcare settings to enhance continuity of care for patients and improve communication between patients and healthcare providers. The curr_chunk focuses on the improvement of quality measurement by eligible professionals through the use of health information technology, enabling them to collect, store, measure, and report on individual and population performance and quality of care. It also mentions the enhancement of evidence-based decision support and consumer/patient empowerment. The technology discussed does not include financial management as its sole purpose. The curr_chunk defines terms like 'qualified eligible professional' and 'qualified medical transcriptionist' in the context of loan guarantees for small business concerns in healthcare. The Administrator may guarantee up to 90% of a loan for qualified eligible professionals to acquire health information technology, with a maximum guarantee amount of $350,000 per professional. The Administrator may impose guarantee and servicing fees on qualified eligible professionals for loans guaranteed under this section, with fees not exceeding 2% of the total guaranteed portion and 0.5% of the outstanding balance, respectively. No fees may be charged to a loan applicant by a lender for a loan guaranteed under this section. The loan must have a deferral period of 1 to 3 years, with the Administrator able to subsidize interest during this time. The Administrator cannot guarantee a loan until meaningful EHR use requirements are determined, and guarantees cannot be made after 7 years from this determination. The Secretary of Health and Human Services has determined the requirements. Appropriations are authorized for guaranteeing $10 billion in loans under this section, with the Administrator determining the cost separately from other programs."
