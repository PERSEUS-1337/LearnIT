    "content": "There is a growing momentum for reforming the interagency system to enhance the application of national power. One aspect of this reform is the proposal to create a community of national security professionals (NSPs) from various departments and agencies. NSPs would undergo shared education, training, and rotational tours to better understand each other's mandates, capabilities, and cultures. This preparation aims to improve collaboration in crafting strategy and executing national security missions, leading to broader organizational cultural change. The U.S. government agencies, as NSPs, are recommended to prioritize interagency collaboration in senior leadership positions. The National Security Professional Development (NSPD) program was initiated in 2007 by the Bush Administration and revised in 2011 by the Obama Administration to address deficiencies in integrating efforts. Members of Congress have also shown interest in enhancing the cultivation of national security professionals. Members of Congress have shown interest in cultivating national security professionals through hearings, studies, and legislation. The report discusses key issues for Congress to consider in NSP initiatives, including early proposals, experiences of the NSPD program, strategic guidance, and congressional initiatives. Calls for improving interagency integration through professional development have been ongoing since World War II. In the aftermath of World War II, there were calls to use professional development tools to improve the nation's ability to apply critical instruments of power effectively. A study commissioned by the War Department recommended the establishment of a National Security University to educate practitioners from various security-related agencies. The proposed institutions included the National War College, but only the National War College was established in 1976. In 1976, the National War College was established, and later merged with ICAF to form the National Defense University. The National Defense Panel recommended creating an interagency cadre for long-term career development in response to expanding U.S. government involvement in nation-building missions. The National Defense Panel recommended creating an interagency cadre for long-term career development in national security structures, similar to the \"joint\" experience envisioned by the 1986 Goldwater-Nichols Act. This cadre would include interagency slots within the national security community, supported by a national security curriculum combining course work at the National Defense University and the National Foreign Affairs Training Center. The Hart-Rudman Commission proposed the creation of the National Security Service Corps (NSSC) for developing leaders skilled at solving national security policy problems. The program would involve career development, rotational assignments, and professional education across various government departments. Military, intelligence, and Foreign Service personnel would be excluded from the proposals. The Hart-Rudman Commission recommended the creation of an \"interagency advisory group\" to integrate efforts by multiple agencies for the National Security Service Corps (NSSC). This group would ensure promotion rates comparable to the Civil Service, establish guidelines for rotational assignments, and professional education requirements. Legislative authority was deemed unnecessary. The Beyond Goldwater-Nichols project at CSIS also suggested a similar national security career path for professionals to seek interagency opportunities. The CSIS team proposed a national security career path with incentives for professionals to gain interagency experience, education, and training. They recommended a 10% personnel float for civilian agencies to participate in programs. The convergence of national and homeland security thinking emphasized the need for an interagency cadre of specialists to improve coordination in the future. In February 2006, Frances Fragos Townsend submitted a report to President Bush on the federal response to Hurricane Katrina, highlighting challenges in coordinating efforts and making 125 recommendations for change, including the creation of a comprehensive program for professional development and education. The Katrina Lessons Learned report recommended the creation of a comprehensive program for the professional development and education of homeland security personnel, aiming to build a joint team involving federal, state, local, and civilian entities. The program would involve various officials and emergency management personnel from different sectors, with a decentralized division of labor and limited centralized oversight. Each participating agency would determine the roles and preparation needed for their homeland security responsibilities. The Katrina Lessons Learned report recommended a professional development program for homeland security personnel, with agencies creating their own programs. The Department of Homeland Security would establish shared goals and standards for measuring progress. Interagency coordination for national security activities was found lacking in early operational experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan. In response to operational challenges in Iraq, the Office of the Coordinator for Reconstruction and Stabilization (S/CRS) was established in 2004 at the Department of State to improve integration of effort in planning and execution for future contingencies. Many senior military officers saw the need for closer integration of efforts across U.S. government agencies, drawing parallels to the military's experience with jointness under the Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986. Marine Corps General Peter Pace suggested a \"Goldwater-Nichols for the interagency\" in 2004, emphasizing the value of cross-agency collaboration and trust. Goldwater-Nichols is a significant reference point for military leaders, shaping their approach to joint operations. The Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986 aimed to reduce inter-Service rivalries and promote jointness among the military branches by defining the concept of \"joint\" and integrating land, sea, and air forces for national military strategy and planning. The Goldwater-Nichols Act and subsequent amendments to Title 10, U.S. Code established a professional development system for joint qualified officers, emphasizing career-long development and flexible options for meeting requirements. The John Warner National Defense Authorization Act of 2007 introduced a four-tiered system of joint qualification to ensure systematic, progressive development in joint matters for officers serving as general and flag officers. The Goldwater-Nichols Act and subsequent legislation established a system for joint qualified officers, ensuring career-long development in joint matters. Promotion to general or flag officer now requires serving in a joint duty assignment and achieving joint designation. The concept of a \"Goldwater-Nichols for the interagency\" was institutionalized in DOD strategic thinking in 2005 during the quadrennial defense review process. The QDR Report called for the creation of a National Security Officer corps to integrate and orchestrate government agencies for national security interests. This proposal invoked the joint duty assignment provisions of Goldwater-Nichols for senior military and civilian professionals. The QDR recommends creating incentives for senior personnel to develop skills suited to the integrated interagency environment. This aligns with efforts by the Bush and Obama Administrations to foster a community of national security professionals. Congressional support for an NSP community has also been evident through studies, hearings, and proposed legislation. These efforts were previously isolated but converged in May 2007. The National Security Professional Development (NSPD) program was launched in May 2007 to improve interagency collaboration among national security professionals. It was established through Executive Order 13434 without legislative mandate, aiming to cultivate a community of NSPs. The program was quietly initiated under the Bush Administration and later revised under the Obama Administration. The National Security Professional Development (NSPD) program, established in May 2007, aimed to enhance national security by providing opportunities in education, training, and professional experience. It was inspired by the Katrina Lessons Learned and the 2006 QDR, with a focus on preventing, protecting against, responding to, and recovering from disasters. The program faced challenges in defining its scope and participation parameters. The National Security Professional Development program aimed to define the scope of \"national security\" to include traditional and homeland security missions. It outlined various national strategies necessary for national security missions, such as the National Defense Strategy and the National Strategy for Homeland Security. The National Security Professional Development program struggled to determine participation categories without a clear definition of \"national security.\" The focus narrowed to the federal level, despite initial intent to include all levels of government. The program aimed to provide education and training in disaster preparedness and response across different government levels. The National Security Professional Development program focused on federal government employees in disaster preparedness, response, and recovery plans. Special conditions were created for military, Foreign Service, and intelligence community professionals. The E.O. aimed to incorporate three communities into the National Security Professional Development program, allowing them to contribute to the National Strategy while maintaining their own career development programs. Agency heads were tasked with coordinating professional development programs in line with the national strategy, with minimal oversight from the NSPD program governing hierarchy. Individual participation was determined by positions or billets. The National Security Professional Development program aimed to incorporate three communities, including national security professionals, into the program. Agencies were tasked with identifying NSP billets and individuals occupying those billets were automatically included in the program. However, there was a lack of mechanism to identify future NSPs and track their utilization after completing program requirements. The program estimated it would eventually include around 20,000 federal government employees, with some officials suggesting these numbers were low. The NSPD program aimed to include national security professionals, but lacked mechanisms to track future NSPs. The low numbers reported may be due to lack of resources for NSP education and training. Governance was decentralized, with leadership roles shifting. An Executive Steering Committee was created in May 2007 for senior-level oversight. The Executive Steering Committee (ESC) was established in May 2007 to provide senior-level oversight of the NSPD program. The ESC, chaired by the Director of OPM, had a broad membership from various government agencies. In late 2007, leadership of the ESC shifted from OPM to OMB under the direction of Deputy Director Clay Johnson. The Executive Steering Committee (ESC) was established in May 2007 to oversee the NSPD program. In late 2007, leadership of the ESC shifted to OMB under Deputy Director Clay Johnson. The ESC's mandate was to facilitate the implementation of the National Strategy, with agencies tasked to develop career initiatives under the NSPD umbrella. The National Strategy emphasized the need for integrated national security professional development programs among agencies. The NSPD Integration Office was established in early 2008 to coordinate activities and was led by retired Army Major General William Navas, Jr. The NSPD Integration Office, led by a senior executive from the CIA and staff from the Under Secretary of Defense, had limited resources and authority. It focused on conveying guidance, tracking agency implementation, and coordinating efforts among agencies. The office also oversaw the National Security Education and Training Consortium (NSETC), a network of institutions for national security education and training. The NSPD program focused on education, training, and rotational service in other agencies. The board included representatives from NSPD participating agencies and received support from the U.S. Institute of Peace. The program aimed to establish a broad interagency education system through the Education and Training Consortium. The ESC was tasked with inventorying existing programs, synchronizing curricula, enabling virtual connectivity, and considering various educational formats. The educational pillar of the NSPD program aimed to transform the National Defense University into a \"true National Security University\" tailored to support the broader U.S. national security profession. The educational pillar of the NSPD program aims to reshape the National Defense University to meet the broader U.S. national security profession's needs. Interagency participation will be increased, and the curriculum will be adjusted to align with a unified U.S. government approach to national security missions. Some JPME proponents expressed concerns about potential interference with military educational requirements. General Pace ensured that new interagency-focused initiatives at DOD schoolhouses would not disrupt existing military education. Instead of becoming a \"National Security University\" with physical facilities, the National Defense University (NDU) explored creating virtual communities with other U.S. government agencies like the Foreign Service Institute and the National Intelligence University. This approach, known as the National Security Education Consortium, addressed concerns about a defense-focused program. Under the NSPD program, NDU's efforts to expand interagency education were integrated, shifting from educator-led to human capital professional-led initiatives. Under the NSPD program, human capital professionals led educational initiatives at NDU. A pilot program in 2007-2008 aimed to produce professionals capable of analyzing strategic and operational capabilities. 38 students participated, including 11 military officers. In a pilot program in 2007-2008, 38 students, including 11 military officers, participated in the NSPD program at NDU. They took core curriculum courses and selected elective courses from special lists at NWC, ICAF, and JFSC. The program participants graduated on June 12, 2008. The pilot program participants graduated on June 12, 2008, receiving a designation in their personnel records for completing the NSPD education pillar. However, concerns were raised about the program's execution, with some observers questioning the difference between NSPD educational objectives and normal NDU programs. The NDU programs have been revised for greater adaptability, with some participants suggesting more flexibility in elective course selection. There were calls for a more robust NSPD educational program, including additional seminars and discussions on interagency issues. The NSPD educational pilot program was not continued, but the Department of State launched the National Security Executive Leadership Seminar (NSELS) at its Foreign Service Institute in 2007. The National Security Executive Leadership Seminar (NSELS) was developed as a replacement for a previous nine-month residential executive course. It focuses on national security and interagency concerns, with about half of the participants coming from agencies other than the State Department. NSELS students participate two days a month for five months, allowing them to continue their day jobs without a backfill. Some have questioned the educational value of short-form courses like NSELS. Some argue that short-form courses like NSELS should be considered \"training\" rather than education, based on content rather than length. The NSPD National Strategy defines education as enhancing critical thinking and understanding, while training focuses on applying knowledge and skills for national security missions. State's NSELS program allows participants to continue their current roles, similar to other programs in the DOD. The DOD's Executive Leadership Development Program (ELDP) allows participants to stay in their current roles while receiving deep exposure to DOD joint roles and missions. This format enables those who cannot leave their day jobs for an extended period to participate in educational opportunities and build in-person relationships. The National Strategy emphasizes ample training opportunities for refining skills through instruction, drills, and exercises. The National Strategy emphasized ample training opportunities for refining skills through instruction, drills, and exercises. The Strategy identified existing programs and institutions to support the NSPD program, with the NSETC Board of Directors recommending training and educational courses for inclusion. The ESC was tasked with promoting federal government training consortia to share best practices. The original NSPD program recognized the variation in roles and responsibilities of NSPs across the government. The National Strategy emphasized training opportunities for NSPs, recognizing the variation in roles and responsibilities. While education in strategic planning, problem-solving, and leadership may be suitable for all NSPs, training requirements are more specific and may vary significantly among NSPs. Initial NSPD training efforts focused on providing orientation for all participating NSPs. The National Strategy emphasized training opportunities for NSPs, with a focus on creating an appropriate orientation for all participants. The introductory training aimed to introduce participants to the full spectrum of NSPD agencies and concerns, with a bifurcation between homeland and traditional national security issues. FEMA unveiled an online orientation course titled \"National Response Framework: An Introduction\" on February 4, 2008, developed in response to lessons learned from Hurricane Katrina. The course covered the framework's purpose, response doctrine, roles and responsibilities of participating entities, and multi-agency coordination. The National Security Council staff developed an online training module for government executives, private-sector leaders, and emergency management practitioners. The course aimed to meet training requirements for the NSPD program and emphasized the integration of national security and homeland security missions. The NSPD program established professional experience as the third pillar, focusing on interagency rotation. This pillar was less developed initially due to the complexity of rotations. The program emphasized decentralized rotational opportunities and outlined tasks to support this pillar, such as designating interagency duty assignments and linking career advancement to participation in rotations. Relevant departments were responsible for implementing these initiatives. The NSPD program emphasized decentralized rotational opportunities for interagency rotation. In March 2008, the NSPD IO coordinated the compilation of a checklist of proposals for the ESC to decide on. The \"Action List\" recommended tasking individual agencies to develop criteria for acceptable mission-related experiences for NSP positions and to draft regulations for candidates for senior-level federal executive positions to have documented rotational or interagency experience. In November 2008, OPM, in coordination with the ESC, issued guidance to NSPD participating agencies, encouraging qualification requirements for specific NSP-designated SES positions based on interagency experience. The guidance defined \"interagency\" broadly to include various government entities, organizations, and academic institutions. The OPM guidance provided agencies flexibility in defining qualification requirements for NSP-designated SES positions, including internal rotations and interagency experience. The Obama Administration's approach to the NSPD program introduced uncertainty, with a \"strategic pause\" as leadership transitioned. During the \"strategic pause\" in the NSPD program, activities continued at a slower pace, with efforts to refine strategic direction. Agencies provided training opportunities for national security professionals, such as the State Department's NSELS course and the Department of Defense's National Security Professional Symposium in 2010. The Department of Defense (DOD) hosted a National Security Professional Symposium at the National Defense University, bringing together professionals from various agencies to collaborate. The event drew 266 participants from over a dozen federal agencies. In November 2010, the Department of Commerce hosted an \"NSPD Agency Awareness\" event for NSPs to network and learn about other departments. Despite the lack of program guidance, there was significant individual interest in participating in the NDU event. During the pause in program guidance, Ambassador Mary Carlin Yates took over policy responsibility for the NSPD program and established an Interagency Policy Committee to revise the National Strategy for the Development of Security Professionals. Substantial progress was made in updating the strategy for an updated executive order. Ambassador Yates' NSS team led an effort to craft and gain IPC approval of a revised list of desired \"shared capabilities\" for NSPD participating agencies. The revision effort stemmed from discussions at the August 2010 NSPD Symposium, resulting in a new document called \"Shared Capabilities\" that identified eight key qualities for interagency operations. The revised \"Shared Capabilities\" paper identified eight key qualities for interagency operations, refining descriptions of each quality. The shift away from using the word \"competencies\" was deliberate, as the list was broadly applicable to any contingency and did not specify the amount of each capability required. This change had significant implications from a human resources perspective. The NSPD officials in 2010 focused on a new, narrower emphasis on the \"interagency\" to improve program effectiveness and efficiency. This shift was reflected in the revised NSPD National Strategy and the \"Shared Capabilities\" paper, highlighting the need for a more appropriate scope in addressing national security threats and opportunities. In 2011, the Obama Administration launched a significant reorientation of the NSPD program, known as \"NSPD 2.0,\" with changes to structure, organization, and focus. Ambassador Yates transitioned to a new role on the NSS, and the Resilience Policy Directorate of the NSS assumed policy leadership in February 2011. NSPD 2.0, led by the Resilience Directorate, focuses on specific missions with tangible outcomes. The program's Executive Steering Committee does not seek additional authorities but emphasizes mission preparedness. The structure of NSPD 2.0 remains largely intact under OPM chairmanship. NSPD 2.0, under OPM chairmanship, preserved the Executive Steering Committee (ESC) structure largely intact. The new Charter includes the Department of Commerce as a participant, with agencies' chief human capital officers representing them at ESC sessions. The ESC met in this modified format on July 27, 2011. The NSPD Integration Office, led by Rear Admiral Gerald Talbot, continues to integrate agency efforts under OPM and the ESC. The Charter for NSPD 2.0, led by OPM and the ESC, focused on a pilot program in Emergency Management within the National Capital Region. DHS was designated as the lead agency for the pilot, limited to GS-13 to GS-15 employees. Agencies were tasked to identify positions and individuals for the program, with DHS developing core requirements and OPM creating a human capital plan. The refined NSPD program leveraged the implementation of Presidential Policy Directive-8 (PPD-8) on \"National Preparedness\" to develop a national preparedness goal and system. PPD-8 named DHS as the lead agency for coordinating with other agencies to achieve the goal. Agencies participating in the NSPD program and PPD-8 implementation utilized PPD-8 for planning, organizing, training, and conducting exercises. Officials note that participating in both the NSPD program and the implementation of PPD-8 allowed for the identification of positions and personnel. The reorientation of the NSPD program towards emergency management has sparked debate, with many agreeing that leveraging existing collaboration mechanisms and training programs has been beneficial. The Obama Administration has issued strategic guidance supporting interagency collaboration, including the NSPD program. The National Security Strategy emphasized strengthening national capacity through a whole-of-government approach. The Strategy emphasized improving integration of skills and capabilities in military and civilian institutions for seamless operation. It called for adapting education and training of national security professionals to meet modern challenges. The State Department's 2010 QDDR echoed the need for better interagency integration and pledged specific initiatives for whole-of-government solutions. The 2010 QDDR called for expanded training opportunities for State Department employees, increased interagency rotational assignments, and tying training to promotion decisions. It also emphasized working closely with DOD and other agencies for training opportunities and reinvigorating the NSPD program. The 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review emphasized the need for improved interagency cooperation and strategic planning within the Department of Defense. It also highlighted the importance of fully implementing the NSPD program to enhance cross-agency training and planning for future contingencies. The 2010 Quadrennial Homeland Security Review (QHSR) emphasized the need for a strong national security community with a professional development program. It called for unity of effort and highlighted the launch of the NSPD program to work together with national security partners. The QHSR also called for fostering a \"homeland security community of interest\" within the NSPD framework, including representatives from various government levels and federal agencies. The NSPD program, initiated in 2011, involved State, local, tribal, and territorial governments, DHS, and other Federal agencies. DHS highlighted the challenges faced by agencies with limited national security responsibilities and called for adequate resources. Congress has taken various NSP-related actions, including directing major studies. Congress directed major studies focusing on National Security Professionals (NSPs), including the creation of the National Security Professional Corps to enhance interagency cooperation. The Project on National Security Reform conducted a landmark study in 2008, advocating for a cadre of professionals with interagency experience. The National Security Professional Corps was created to improve interagency cooperation by identifying and assigning personnel for interagency positions. A study commissioned by Congress in the NDAA for FY 2010 called for the development of an Integrated National Security Professional System, which would provide training and rotational opportunities to enhance collaboration across agencies. The Power of People initiative aims to enhance collaboration across agency boundaries by providing training and opportunities for program participants to progress through levels of proficiency. Centralized management would oversee standards, qualifications, and appointments for practitioners across the federal government. The initiative calls for a deliberate four-stage approach to developing the National Security Professional community, with a focus on closer integration of effort within the interagency system. The National Security Professional community aims for closer integration within the interagency system. By stage four, NSPs would serve primarily at the interagency level, with responsibilities transitioning to integrated teams and task forces. The Government Accountability Office conducted a study on professional development activities for interagency collaboration in national security. The study conducted by the Government Accountability Office evaluated interagency collaboration initiatives, including interagency rotation programs. This evaluation was mandated by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011 to assess the current state of interagency national security knowledge and skills in Department of Defense personnel. The NDAA required the Secretary of Defense to submit a study on interagency national security knowledge and skills to congressional defense committees by December 1, 2011. The study considered training, education, rotational assignments, incentives, and integration with JPME. It aimed to assess the relationship between NSP initiatives and JPME. The Interagency National Security Professional Education, Administration, and Development System Act of 2010 aimed to create a system for \"interagency qualification\" based on education, training, and interagency exchange service. Sponsored by Representative Ike Skelton, the bill drew on the Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986 and the military's joint qualification system. The INSPEAD bill, introduced by Representative Davis in the 110th Congress, proposed a system for interagency qualification of national security professionals based on education, training, and rotational assignments. The purpose was to ensure career-long development of individuals for effective participation in interagency activities related to national security. Designated positions would be mapped to specific qualification levels to fill critical national security roles. The INSPEAD bill aimed to establish a system for interagency qualification of national security professionals, focusing on positions dealing with national security matters and requiring interagency engagement. It excluded political appointees but applied to the military's commissioned officer corps. The bill maintained an Executive Steering Committee format for organization. The INSPEAD bill advocated for stronger centralized management, relocating the Integration Office to the Executive Office of the President. It aimed to establish a career development system for national security professionals, while the Interagency Personnel Rotation Act focused on interagency collaboration through a program for rotations. The Rotation Act, sponsored by Senator Lieberman and Representative Geoff Davis, aims to create a streamlined mechanism for interagency rotations. It includes national and homeland security practitioners from GS-11 through GS-15 levels, with military officer participation at the discretion of the Secretary of Defense. The Act preserves the decentralized premise and organizational structure of the NSPD program, establishing a Committee on National Security Personnel within the Executive Office of the President. The Rotation Act, sponsored by Senator Lieberman and Representative Geoff Davis, aims to create interagency communities of interest under the NSP umbrella. It designates categories like emergency management and post-conflict reconstruction, mirroring the approach of NSPD 2.0 to limit costs and ensure matching between rotating personnel and host agency positions. The Rotation Act aims to create interagency communities of interest under the NSP umbrella, with a modest scope of participation initially. It mandates agencies to give preference to individuals who have completed interagency rotations in selecting senior-level positions in a given ICI. This echoes the INSPEAD provision for rotational service as a prerequisite for senior-level NSP positions. Members of Congress are weighing draft legislation and proposals to foster an interagency community of national security professionals. Members of Congress may wish to consider the purpose of the NSP initiative, whether to focus on changing individual practices or institutional cultures for better interagency collaboration. The original NSPD program aimed to create a cadre of interagency-qualified professionals, while the 2011 revised version focuses more explicitly on this goal. The 2011 revised version of the NSPD program emphasizes meeting current requirements through educational, training, and rotation opportunities to enhance NSPs' ability to execute missions effectively. Changing individual practices is seen as the most effective way to shift shared culture over time, similar to the military's joint qualification system that aims to achieve both individual skills and institutional culture change. The joint qualification system aims to develop senior leaders with joint mindsets, enhancing service cultures with joint culture. Integration among agencies can range from working together while representing their home agencies to being part of a fully integrated enterprise while still accessing resources from their home agencies. PNSR has advocated for an interagency cadre to articulate national priorities and missions, but concerns exist about losing ties to home agencies. In contrast, the U.S. military's jointness model emphasizes integration while allowing officers to maintain ties to their respective services. The jointness model in the U.S. military focuses on officers serving within their respective services but also undertaking joint duty assignments to foster a \"joint-minded\" total force. A key issue is determining the scope of inclusion for national security professional programs. The jointness model in the U.S. military emphasizes officers serving within their services and undertaking joint duty assignments. A key consideration is determining the scope of inclusion for national security professional programs, which involves balancing homeland and traditional national security concerns to meet strategic goals and protect resources. The Obama Administration has highlighted the interconnectedness of these categories, as providing homeland security may involve addressing challenges abroad. Providing security for the homeland may require addressing challenges that arise abroad. The decision for any NSP program involves determining which federal agencies should be included, with a wide range of participation from traditional and non-traditional national security agencies. Broadening the scope of participation is a key consideration to meet strategic goals and protect resources. Broadening participation in national security programs to include non-traditional agencies offers benefits like expertise and improved coordination, but may also create administrative burdens. Major agencies like DOD, State, and DHS could host activities to mitigate this issue. The question of participation by different professionals within agencies is a key consideration. The three major sub-categories of professionals within agencies - the uniformed military, the Foreign Service, and the intelligence community - initially opposed full inclusion in the NSPD program due to existing career development programs. The NSDP E.O. allowed them to participate voluntarily, without a formal mandate. The three major professional communities initially opposed full inclusion in the NSPD program due to existing career development programs, such as Joint Professional Military Education (JPME) for the military. Some suggest that requirements of JPME and other career programs could align with interagency NSP programs, offering joint and interagency experience. The NSPD program is for career professionals, not political appointees. The NSPD program was initially designed for career professionals, not political appointees. However, some experts suggest that political appointees could benefit from similar training and relationship-building in coordinating national security matters. Including political appointees in the NSPD program may be challenging due to constraints on the President's authority and the short tenure of appointees in government. Some experts suggest including political appointees in the NSPD program to benefit from training and relationship-building in national security coordination. Debate exists on whether criteria similar to career personnel should be applied in selecting political appointees for designated national security positions. The extent of involvement of state, local, and tribal officials in the program is also a topic of discussion. The initial NSPD E.O. opened the door for non-federal government participation in program activities. The NSPD program, through an Executive Order, allowed for participation in education, training, and professional opportunities across different levels of government. The program focused on national-level coordination and collaboration across the Federal Government. The NSPs would work with various entities including state, local, territorial, and tribal governments, the private sector, NGOs, and foreign governments. The argument for limiting the scope to the federal level is to avoid resource demands and logistics challenges. Some argue for a \"whole of nation\" approach to national security involving all levels of government. A \"whole of nation\" approach to national security involves all levels of government and relevant non-governmental actors for effective practice. Structuring initiatives for fostering a community of national security professionals requires consideration of different objectives and practical mechanisms. Crafting detailed mechanics to meet policy goals can be complex and require substantial human effort. The selection of individuals for participation in national security programs is a key consideration to meet security requirements while managing resource demands. Participants are expected to progress from \"seeking qualification\" to \"qualified\" in proposed formats for fostering national security professionals. Some suggest that an NSP program should identify a broader pool of individuals entitled to seek qualification and specify rules for individual progress. Billets can serve real-world requirements or help individuals gain program qualification, leading to potential confusion in a professional development program. An NSP program should clearly define the purpose of billets - whether they are meant to meet real-world needs, help grow qualified NSPs, or both. The military's joint qualification system allows all officers to seek joint qualification, with levels depending on individual choice and approval authorities' decisions. The John Warner NDAA for FY 2007 introduced a four-level qualification system for the military. The military's joint qualification system has a four-level qualification system for officers, with Level III designating them as Joint Qualified Officers (JQOs). Joint Duty Assignment List (JDAL) designates joint billets, with critical billets requiring JQOs who are trained and experienced in joint matters to support joint business. Standard billets help incumbents further improve. The NSPD program has struggled with defining the roles of individuals and billets. Originally, it used national security professional billets to define participants. In 2010, officials aimed to focus on interagency collaboration in national security matters. The new rules for the NSP program require designated positions to focus on national security issues and collaborate with other agencies. Some stakeholders prefer the billet-based approach for its simplicity, while others criticize it for being static and self-contained. The NSPD program did not establish an accession mechanism or utilize a broader pool of participants. It lacked a mechanism to increase interagency awareness in home agencies. Billets were used for both identifying participants and providing rotational opportunities. The Executive Steering Committee was tasked with developing a formal mechanism for national security professionals to participate in rotational assignments. The NSPD program lacked a mechanism for increasing interagency awareness in home agencies and did not establish an accession mechanism. The Executive Steering Committee was responsible for developing a formal mechanism for security professionals to participate in rotational assignments across different agencies. The approach towards using billets for rotational assignments differed from the military's approach. The NSPD program lacked a mechanism for increasing interagency awareness and did not establish an accession mechanism. The use of billets for rotational assignments differed from the military's centralized system, requiring strong centralized oversight for interagency rotational systems. The 2011 revision of the NSPD program distinguished between individuals and billets, with modalities for future accession and participation still to be determined. The NSPD program lacked a mechanism for increasing interagency awareness and did not establish an accession mechanism. The original NSPD program was quite de-centralized, with the Executive Steering Committee having weak coordination mandate. The ESC and Integration Office primarily coordinated agency programs and activities without formal tasking authority or control over resources. The NSPD program lacked a mechanism for increasing interagency awareness and did not establish an accession mechanism. The original ESC rarely had veto power over agency initiatives not aligned with NSPD intent. DOD funded the NSPD Integration Office to coordinate agency efforts, but some saw it as an attempt to steer the program. The 2011 revitalized NSPD program is de-centralized, with a weak mandate for coordination. In comparison, DOD's joint officer management program has stronger oversight. The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, establishes joint qualification levels for officers, career guidelines, and prerequisites for promotion to general or flag officer. A centralized system ensures policies and resources align with overall goals, while a decentralized approach may offer flexibility. A decentralized approach may better preserve flexibility for agencies with different missions and roles in national security. Effective integration relies on leadership and incentives for active participation in multi-agency programs. Agency incentives are influenced by available resources. In a program designed to foster interagency communities, resources are needed to support education and training programs, faculty, facilities, curriculum development, and tuition at non-government institutions. A centralized secretariat may also be necessary to coordinate program efforts. The main cost could be funding for maintaining personnel in civilian agencies while they participate in education programs or training. Non-DOD agencies often struggle with backfilling positions for personnel on rotational tours, as they lack the resources that the military has. The original NSPD program required agencies to reallocate resources to support participation, limiting their involvement. NSPD 2.0 aims to strictly limit program costs, potentially hindering robust resourcing for personnel \"floats\" and easing agency concerns about resource allocation. The NSPD 2.0 program aims to limit costs and address agency concerns about resource allocation by proposing ways to minimize the costs of an interagency community-building initiative. This includes structuring educational opportunities in limited, recurrent blocks of time and carefully engineering interagency rotational opportunities. The NSPD 2.0 program aims to minimize costs and address agency concerns about resource allocation by offering training opportunities to NSP participants from various agencies. Strong support from senior leadership, especially the President, is crucial for agencies to prioritize such initiatives. Lack of attention from leadership can lead to the program's downfall. Motivation for participation in interagency programs can stem from various incentives. The interagency community development program offers incentives like promotion potential, choice assignments, and stability in program rules. Advocates focus on linking program completion to senior-level service opportunities, similar to the military's joint qualification system. The Secretary of Defense, with advice from CJCS, oversees the program to ensure compliance with congressional mandates. The Secretary of Defense, with advice from CJCS, oversees the interagency community development program to ensure promotion rates support jointness goals. General Pace highlighted the importance of being joint for promotion. NSPD lacked a systemic mechanism for interagency qualification consideration in promotion decisions. Individual interest in interagency activities remains high. The interest in interagency activities, such as education and training courses, remains strong despite fluctuations in the NSPD program. Key events like Hurricane Katrina and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have highlighted the need for effective interagency integration. Some suggest that flexible recruitment tools could benefit the program. The NSPD National Strategy aims to reform employment practices for hiring personnel with diverse experiences. One proposed approach to improve the NSPD program is to develop college-level programs for national security studies and offer student internships in the field. Additionally, allowing mid-career recruitment of specialists from outside the government and facilitating job transfers could enhance effectiveness and efficiency. Bringing in experts at all career stages may bring valuable expertise and experience to the government. Potential drawbacks of utilizing flexible recruiting tools for national security professionals include higher costs to manage a complex human capital system and reduced incentives for agencies to offer NSP opportunities to their permanent personnel. Congress has the option to oversee initiatives aimed at fostering a community of interagency national security professionals. One option for oversight could be monitoring program implementation in individual agencies by their respective committees of jurisdiction. One option for oversight could be monitoring program implementation in individual agencies by their respective committees of jurisdiction. Another option might be oversight by the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, and the House Committee on Government Oversight and Reform. Some participants have suggested the creation of House and Senate Select Committees on National Security for holistic issues and initiatives that cross agency boundaries. Institutional resistance to changes in oversight responsibilities could be a challenge. Determining appropriate boundaries for \"national security\" may be challenging on the Hill due to institutional resistance to changes in oversight responsibilities."
