    "content": "The U.S. farm sector is diverse, including traditional field crops, livestock, poultry, fruits, nuts, and vegetables. Regional variations in production activities, market structure, and economic importance impact farm income and rural conditions. Annual U.S. net farm income is a key indicator of sector well-being, reflecting economic activity across production processes and marketing. The U.S. net farm income is forecasted at $66.3 billion in 2018, down 12% from the previous year. This includes the first round of payments under a trade aid package announced by USDA. The decline in income reflects continued economic weakness in the agriculture sector since 2013. The forecast for U.S. net farm income in 2018 is $66.3 billion, down 12% from the previous year. This decline is part of a general downward trend in farm income since 2013, with net farm income projected to be substantially below the 10-year average at $123.8 billion. Cash receipts for major field crops, oilseeds, and animal products have also declined since 2013-2014. Cash receipts for major animal products have declined since 2013-2014 as U.S. and global grain and oilseed stocks have rebuilt. Government payments in 2018 are projected to increase by 18% from 2017 to $13.6 billion, the highest since 2006. Total production expenses for 2018 are projected to increase by 4.2% from 2017, driven largely by feed, fuel, labor, and interest costs. Global demand for U.S. agricultural exports is projected at $141.5 billion. Farm asset values and debt levels are projected to reach record levels in 2018, with asset values at $3.0 trillion and farm debt at $410 billion. The debt-to-asset ratio is expected to reach 13.5%, the highest level since 2003. Winter wheat plantings in 2017 were at the lowest level since 1909 due to poor profitability compared to soybeans. U.S. soybean plantings have been expanding beyond the traditional Corn Belt. Heading into the 2018 spring planting period, dry conditions were reported across the southern United States and northern plains, raising concerns for producers without irrigation. The U.S. cattle sector, reliant on spring grazing and feed grains, was also affected. In contrast, the Corn Belt and Southeast experienced favorable weather, leading to forecasts of large harvests of corn, soybeans, rice, and cotton in 2018. USDA forecasts large harvests of corn, soybeans, rice, and cotton in 2018 due to abundant rainfall in primary crop-growing zones. Wet conditions delayed harvest in major crop-producing states. U.S. corn and soybean crops have shown remarkable growth in productivity and output, leading to stockpile increases. In 2018, U.S. soybean plantings exceeded corn plantings for the first time in history. The record soybean plantings and yield are expected to result in a record U.S. soybean harvest of 4.6 billion bushels with record ending stocks in 2018. Soybean farm prices are projected to decrease by 8% to $8.60 per bushel. For corn, a record national average yield is forecasted, leading to the second-largest corn harvest on record at 14.6 billion bushels. Despite near-record production, domestic usage and exports are expected to reduce corn ending stocks. The record soybean plantings and yield are expected to result in a record U.S. soybean harvest of 4.6 billion bushels with record ending stocks in 2018. Soybean farm prices are projected to decrease by 8% to $8.60 per bushel. On the other hand, record exports will reduce corn ending stocks, lower the ending stocks-to-use ratio to 11.5%, and increase the season average farm price to $3.60/bushel. The United States is a major exporter of corn and soybeans, with 49% of soybean production and 15% of corn crop being exported in recent years. The outlook for these crops is crucial for farm sector profitability and regional economic activity. The trade dispute between the United States and China has caused uncertainty in the corn and soybean markets. China's reduced purchases of U.S. agricultural products have led to lower export forecasts by the USDA for 2018 and 2019. The soybean export forecast has been revised downward, and the outcome depends on the resolution of the trade dispute. The USDA's January 2018 Cattle report shows that U.S. cattle herd expansion has slowed but is still projected to grow through 2018. Record profitability in 2014 led to beef cow herd expansion, despite weakening profitability. High feed prices and drought caused an 8% contraction in the U.S. cattle inventory from 2007-2014. The contraction of the U.S. cattle inventory led to reduced beef supplies, resulting in higher prices. The slow rebuilding phase in the cattle cycle began in 2014. Despite strong demand, lower prices are expected to persist through 2019. Production of beef, pork, broilers, and eggs is projected to expand in 2018 and 2019. USDA projects growth in domestic and export demand for red meat and poultry, supporting prices and profit. The U.S. livestock sector is projected to grow for red meat and poultry, supporting prices and profit margins into 2019. The ratios of livestock output prices to feed costs have shown volatility from 2015-2018. While the hog, cattle, and broiler sectors remain profitable, milk prices and the milk-to-feed ratio fell sharply in 2018, leading to eroding profitability for some producers. Continued production growth for red meat and poultry may result in prices being vulnerable to weak demand. In 2018, milk prices faced pressure due to growing U.S. and global production. The federal milk margin protection program saw a drop below the payment threshold but rebounded above $8.00 in September. Total farm sector gross cash income for 2018 is projected to increase driven by government payments and farm-related income. Total farm sector revenue sources in 2018 include crop revenues (47%), livestock receipts (42%), government payments (3%), and other farm-related income (8%). Crop sales are projected at $199.2 billion, with feed crops up 4.8%, oil crops up 3.8%, food grains up 3.5%, and fruits and nuts down 1.7% compared to 2017. In 2018, total farm sector revenue sources include crop sales projected at $199.2 billion, with feed crops up 4.8%, oil crops up 3.8%, and food grains up 3.5%. Livestock sector cash receipts fluctuated, peaking in 2014 at $212.8 billion, declining in 2015 and 2016, but recovering in 2017 with 8.1% growth to $176.0 billion. In 2018, poultry and egg sales are expected to offset declines in other livestock categories, resulting in a projected livestock cash receipt decline to $175.6 billion. In 2018, livestock cash receipts are projected to decline to $175.6 billion (-0.2%). Cattle and calf sales are expected to be $66.4 billion (-1.4%), hog sales at $20.0 billion (-5.2%), poultry and egg sales at $46.7 billion (+9.5%), dairy sales at $35.3 billion (-7.1%), and miscellaneous livestock at $7.2 billion (+3.4%). Government payments are projected to increase by 17.9% from 2017 to $13.6 billion, mainly due to the market facilitation program providing $4.6 billion in response to the U.S.-China trade dispute. In August 2018, Secretary Perdue announced a trade aid package with direct payments of $4.7 billion to qualifying producers of agricultural commodities. The package also included government purchases of excess food supplies and trade promotion. USDA expects larger disaster assistance and crop insurance payments in 2018. Without these payments, net farm income would have decreased by over 20% to about $60 billion. The payments offset lower payments under revenue support programs for major field crops. Government payments for agricultural programs are expected to total $13.6 billion in 2018, representing 3% of projected gross cash income. This includes $188 million in payments for the dairy Margin Protection Program and $3.9 billion for conservation programs. In contrast, government payments are projected to make up 21% of the net farm income of $66.3 billion. Total production expenses for the U.S. agricultural sector in 2018 are projected to be $369.1 billion, with expenses affecting crop and livestock farms differently. Feed costs, replacement animal costs, interest costs, and hired labor are projected to increase in 2018. Prices received generally declined from 2014 through 2016, rebounded in 2017, then declined again in 2018. Since 2014, farm input prices have squeezed profit margins, with a slight decline in 2018. Renting land allows young farmers to enter agriculture without debt and helps existing operations adjust to market changes. About 38% of U.S. agricultural land has been rented since 2002, with 8% rented from other farms in 2012. In 2012, 30% of all land in farms was rented from nonoperating landlords, generating income for some operator landlords. Total net rent to nonoperator landlords is projected to increase by 2.4% to $15.8 billion in 2018, with average cash rental rates at $138 per acre. Rental rates reflect high crop prices and have yet to decline to pre-2011 levels. The rental rate for crop land peaked at $144 per acre in 2015 and is estimated at $138 per acre in 2018. U.S. agricultural exports have fluctuated between $130 billion and $152 billion since 2011, with a projected value of $143.4 billion in FY2018. Agricultural imports are projected to increase to $127.6 billion in FY2018, resulting in a trade surplus of $15.8 billion. In FY2019, U.S. agricultural imports are projected to remain at $127.0 billion, leading to a trade surplus of $14.5 billion, the lowest since 2007. The increase in U.S. agricultural exports is attributed to higher-priced grain and feed shipments, record oilseed exports to China, and growing animal product exports to East Asia. The top three markets for U.S. agricultural exports in FY2018 were Canada, China, and Mexico, accounting for 46% of total exports. However, their combined share is projected to decrease to 42% in FY2019 due to lower exports to China. In FY2018 and FY2019, U.S. agricultural exports are expected to decline due to the U.S.-China trade dispute. The European Union and Japan are the fourth- and fifth-largest export markets, accounting for 17% of U.S. agricultural exports. Meanwhile, the \"Rest of World\" component, including South and Central America, the Middle East, Africa, and Southeast Asia, is showing strong import growth and is projected to account for 41% of U.S. agricultural exports in FY2019. U.S. agricultural exports have seen steady growth in high-value products over the past four decades. In FY2019, U.S. agricultural exports are forecasted to decline, with bulk commodity shipments making up 33.4% at $47.2 billion, compared to high-valued export products at $94.3 billion for a 66.6% share. U.S. exports account for 19.8% of the overall market for agricultural products, indicating dependence on foreign markets. The export share of agricultural products in the U.S. varied significantly by product category from 2008 to 2016. Bulk food grain and oilseed had high export shares ranging from 50% to 80% and 47% to 58% respectively. Fruit, tree nuts, and meat products had mid-range export shares of 37% to 45% and 27% to 41%. Vegetable, melon, dairy products, and agricultural-based beverages had lower export shares ranging from 15% to 18%, 9% to 24%, and 7% to 13% respectively. The U.S. agriculture sector is expected to have a stable financial position in 2018. Farm asset values in the agriculture sector are projected to increase by 1.4% in 2018 to $3 trillion, with real estate values driving the growth while non-real estate values decrease. Crop land values are influenced by commodity prices, and the sector faces uncertainty due to downward price outlooks and reliance on international markets. Farm asset values in the agriculture sector are projected to increase by 1.4% in 2018 to $3 trillion, driven by real estate values. Crop land values are influenced by commodity prices, with total farm debt forecasted to rise to $409.5 billion in 2018. Farm equity is projected to be slightly up at $2.6 trillion, with the farm debt-to-asset ratio expected to increase to 13.5%. Average farm household income in 2018 is projected at $111,321, down 1.9% from 2017. About 17% of total farm household income comes from farm production activities, while the remaining 83% is earned off the farm. Farm income from off-farm sources peaked at about 95% in 2000 and has since decreased. In 2017, the average farm household income was $113,495, about 27% higher than the average U.S. household income. The average farm household income in 2018 is projected to be $111,321, down 1.9% from 2017. About 17% of total farm household income comes from farm production activities, while the remaining 83% is earned off the farm. In 2017, the average farm household income was $113,495, about 27% higher than the average U.S. household income. USDA data on monthly farm prices received for major commodities are presented in indexed format for comparison. Tables at the end of the report summarize U.S. agriculture's financial situation and forecasted farm prices for the 2018-2019 marketing year."
