    "content": "The Bias Crimes Compensation Act of 1993 may be cited as the \"Bias Crimes Compensation Act.\" It pertains to civil rights. The Congress finds that bias-motivated crimes of violence violate victims' rights based on race, color, gender, religion, national origin, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or disability. State and Federal laws do not adequately protect against bias elements in these crimes, leading to unequal treatment and lack of redress for victims. Bias-motivated crimes of violence have a significant impact on interstate commerce by deterring victims from traveling, working, and engaging in business across state lines. These crimes also reduce national productivity, increase costs, and affect the demand for interstate products. Federal civil rights claims are necessary to ensure equal protection of the laws and mitigate the adverse effects of these crimes on interstate commerce. Victims of bias-motivated crimes deserve protection and justice. (7) Victims of bias-motivated crimes have the right to equal protection under the law, free from such violence. Any individual who violates this right is liable for compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive or declaratory relief in a civil court. The section allows for claims of compensatory and punitive damages, injunctive relief, or declaratory relief for bias-motivated crimes of violence. It clarifies limitations, procedures, and concurrent jurisdiction for such claims. The section prohibits federal courts from having supplemental jurisdiction over State law claims related to divorce, alimony, property distribution, or child custody. Definitions include \"bias-motivated\" as acts based on race, gender, religion, etc., and \"crime of violence\" as acts constituting violence. The curr_chunk defines an offense as an act punishable by imprisonment exceeding one year, excluding property offenses with no serious risk of harm. It also includes actions that would be an offense based on the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim, regardless of criminal charges or location. The curr_chunk provides definitions for terms related to the jurisdiction of the United States and limitations on the removal of civil actions to district courts. It also amends the authority to award attorney's fees under the Bias Crimes Compensation Act of 1993."
