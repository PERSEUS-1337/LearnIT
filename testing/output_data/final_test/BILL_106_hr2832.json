    "content": "The Act is titled the \"United States Life-Saving Service Heritage Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings and purpose section. The Congress acknowledges the long tradition of heroic sea rescue efforts in the United States. Legislation has been passed to provide necessary equipment for the preservation of life and property from shipwrecks on the coast of New Jersey. This support has been extended to volunteer lifesaving efforts in other states and territories as well. The Life-Saving Service, established to protect life and property on the coast of New Jersey and Long Island, was reorganized by Congress in 1878. Stations were staffed by volunteer and professional lifesavers who risked their lives to rescue shipwrecked passengers. Many historic stations are at risk due to coastal environments, economic development, neglect, and lack of resources for preservation. The heroic actions of Life-Saving Service personnel deserve greater recognition through a comprehensive preservation program. The purpose of this Act is to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to establish a program to inventory, evaluate, document, and assist in efforts to restore and preserve surviving lifesaving stations and artifacts dedicated to our forefathers' lifesaving efforts. The United States Life-Saving Service Station Preservation Program is authorized by the Secretary of the Interior to inventory, evaluate, document, and assist in restoring and preserving lifesaving stations and artifacts. The Secretary of the Interior will establish a program to inventory, evaluate, document, and assist in restoring surviving United States Life-Saving Service stations in cooperation with the U.S. Life-Saving Service Heritage Association. This includes surveying coastal regions, documenting historic structures and boats, and evaluating lifesaving stations. The Secretary of the Interior will evaluate historic lifesaving stations, assess their significance, integrity, and condition, make recommendations for listing on the National Register of Historic Places or as National Historic Landmarks, and suggest lifesaving boats for inclusion in the Historic American Engineering Record Collection. Additionally, the Secretary will serve as a clearinghouse of information for those interested in restoring and preserving historic lifesaving stations. The Secretary of the Interior will evaluate historic lifesaving stations, assess their significance, integrity, and condition, make recommendations for listing on the National Register of Historic Places or as National Historic Landmarks, and suggest lifesaving boats for inclusion in the Historic American Engineering Record Collection. Additionally, they will provide educational materials and information on the history and development of lifesaving organizations and technical descriptions of lifesaving boats. The Secretary of the Interior provides technical descriptions of lifesaving boats, line-guns, life cars, and beachcarts, inventory documentation, and evaluation for historic lifesaving stations. They also offer guidance and assistance in listing stations on the National Register of Historic Places or as National Historic Landmarks, and in listing historic lifesaving boats in the Historic American Engineering Record Collection. Grants are available for restoration and preservation efforts. The Federal government provides financial assistance for the restoration and preservation of historic lifesaving stations, boats, and artifacts, with a maximum Federal share of 75% of the total cost. Definitions include historic lifesaving stations as structures formerly under the Life-Saving Service, and the Secretary is defined as the overseeing authority. The Secretary, defined as the Secretary of the Interior through the National Maritime Initiative of the National Park Service, is authorized to appropriate funds for grants and other provisions related to the U.S. Life-Saving Service Heritage Association. $5,000,000 is allocated for grants and $500,000 for other activities for each fiscal year from 2000 to 2004."
