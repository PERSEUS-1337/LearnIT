    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Arafat Accountability Act\". The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) led by Yasser Arafat failed to uphold promises made in the Oslo Accords for peaceful resolution and renunciation of terrorism. Arafat's lack of control in the West Bank and Gaza led to ongoing terrorism against Israeli and American civilians. Yasser Arafat has failed to offer credible security guarantees to Israeli and Palestinian peoples, violated peace commitments by purchasing offensive weaponry from Iran, and is responsible for the murder of hundreds of Israelis. He has also been implicated in funding and supporting terrorists responsible for bombings in Israel, further complicating the conflict resolution prospects in the region. The Sense of Congress is outlined in Section 3. The Sense of Congress outlined in Section 3 includes urging an immediate cessation of terrorist activities, surrender of Palestinian extremists to Israel for prosecution, and condemning all acts of terrorism, especially homicide bombings that targeted Israeli civilians. During March, hundreds were injured in terrorist attacks. Efforts include confiscating weapons, ending financial support for terrorism, and urging Arab nations to stop funding terrorists. Congress supports the President's peace efforts with Israel, Arab states, and the international community. SEC. 4. IMPOSITION OF SANCTIONS. The Secretary of State is prohibited from issuing visas to members of the Palestine Liberation Organization or Palestinian Authority. The President can waive this prohibition on a case-by-case basis for national security reasons. Measures will be taken to limit the activities of PLO offices in the United States. Travel restrictions will be imposed on the Senior PLO Representative at the United Nations. The Secretary of State will impose travel restrictions on the senior official of the Permanent Observer Mission of Palestine at the United Nations, similar to those imposed on officials from the Permanent Mission of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Additionally, the Secretary of State, in collaboration with the Attorney General, will identify and seize the assets of the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian Authority in the United States, as well as the personal assets of PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat. The President is required to submit a report every 90 days detailing any acts of terrorism by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) or its elements. The report will determine if these acts warrant designating the PLO as a terrorist organization. The President has the authority to waive these requirements for national security reasons. Duration of Sanctions: Sanctions imposed under this Act will continue until the President reports to the appropriate congressional committees that the conditions for sanctions no longer exist. Appropriate Congressional Committees: Refers to specific committees in the Senate and House of Representatives."
