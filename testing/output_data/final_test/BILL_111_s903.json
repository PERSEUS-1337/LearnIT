    "content": "The \"Highway Fairness and Reform Act of 2009\" allows states to choose to receive a state contribution to the Highway Trust Fund instead of participating in the federal-aid highway program. The \"Highway Fairness and Reform Act of 2009\" allows states to opt out of the federal-aid highway program and receive a direct Federal-aid highway program instead, starting from fiscal year 2011. Governors or chief executive officers of states can choose to waive their right to receive allocated amounts and receive a determined amount under this program. The election is irrevocable and must be made at least 90 days before the fiscal year begins. The Secretary will accept an election under subsection (a) if the State has an interstate maintenance program, submits a plan describing the purposes and projects for program funds, and agrees to use the funds exclusively for eligible projects under section 133(b) of this title. The State must report annually on the use of program funds and make the report public. Safety requirements may still apply to States electing under subsection (a). Funds must be suballocated using specific formulae and rules. There are no limitations on fund use except as specified. The State's expenditure of funds received under the program is not subject to regulation under certain titles. Making an election under subsection (a) does not affect pre-existing obligations. The amount transferred to a State for a fiscal year is determined by specific rules. Taxes appropriated to the Highway Trust Fund under section 9503 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, excluding the Mass Transit Account, for a fiscal year with an election in effect under subsection (a) are reduced by a pro rata share withheld by the Secretary. General fund amounts deposited into the Fund are treated as taxes. Transfers under the program are subject to specific rules. Transfers under the program are made at the same time as deposits to the Highway Trust Fund by the Secretary of the Treasury. Estimates are used for transfers, with adjustments made if prior estimates were inaccurate. Adjustments cannot exceed 5 percent of the transferred amount. The Secretary may rescind contract authority for a State with an election in effect under subsection (a). A clerical amendment is made to the chapter analysis for title 23, inserting a new item after section 149. The Secretary may rescind contract authority for a State with an election in effect under subsection (a). A new item is inserted after section 149 in the chapter analysis for title 23."
