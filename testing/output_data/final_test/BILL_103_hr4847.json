    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Bonneville Power Administration Appropriations Refinancing Act\". The \"Administrator\" in the Bonneville Power Administration is defined as the individual responsible for managing capital investments funded by Federal appropriations for projects or facilities that require repayment through the sale of electric power or services, excluding certain types of investments. The Administrator in the Bonneville Power Administration manages capital investments funded by Federal appropriations for projects or facilities that require repayment through the sale of electric power or services. The \"old capital investment\" refers to a capital investment incurred before October 1, 1995, for a project or facility placed in service before that date. The \"repayment date\" is the end of the period for repayment of the principal amount, and the \"Treasury rate\" is determined by the Secretary of the Treasury at the beginning of each fiscal year. The Treasury rate is determined at the beginning of each fiscal year based on the average prevailing market yield of interest-bearing securities with 15 years or more remaining to maturity. The rate is rounded to the nearest multiple of one-eighth of one percent. SEC. 3. NEW PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS. Effective October 1, 1995, old capital investments will have a new principal amount calculated based on the present value of old payment amounts and a fraction formula. The Administrator will determine these new principal amounts and obtain approval from the Secretary of the Treasury. The new principal amounts for old capital investments will be calculated based on the present value of old payment amounts and a fraction formula, with approval from the Secretary of the Treasury. The old payment amounts refer to the annual interest and principal that would have been paid to the United States Treasury from October 1, 1995, if the Act were not enacted. The interest on old capital investments is determined based on the interest rate assigned by the Administrator before October 1, 1993, or the Treasury rate for the fiscal year in which construction begins on the project. SEC. 4. The unpaid balance on new principal amounts for old capital investments bears interest at the Treasury rate for fiscal year 1996 until repayment. SEC. 5. Repayment date for new principal amounts is no earlier than the old capital investment repayment date. SEC. 6. Prepayment limitations set at $100,000,000 for new principal amounts before their repayment dates from 1995 to 2000. SEC. 7. Interest rates for new capital investments during construction. The principal amount of a capital investment for a project, facility, or separable unit placed in service after September 30, 1995, includes interest in each fiscal year of construction at a rate equal to the one-year Treasury agency borrowing rate. The Administrator is not required to pay the interest during construction. The one-year Treasury agency borrowing rate is used to calculate interest on capital investments for projects placed in service after September 30, 1995. SEC. 8. Interest rates for new capital investments are determined by the Secretary of the Treasury based on market yields of US Treasury obligations with comparable maturity periods. SEC. 9. Credits to the Administrator's payments to the United States Treasury. The Administrator shall apply a credit against amounts payable to the United States Treasury in specified amounts each fiscal year as long as annual payments are made to the Tribes under a settlement agreement. The settlement agreement resolves claims of the Tribes in Docket 181-D of the Indian Claims Commission. The Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, a federally-recognized Indian Tribe, are involved in a settlement agreement resolving claims in Docket 181-D of the Indian Claims Commission. They have credits applied against amounts payable to the United States Treasury each fiscal year. SEC. 10. CONTRACT PROVISIONS. In contracts with the Administrator for selling electric power, provisions must be included after September 30, 1995, regarding establishing rates based on old capital investments and interest rates. After September 30, 1995, contracts with the Administrator for selling electric power must include provisions for rates based on old capital investments and interest rates. Payments of principal on old capital investments reduce the outstanding balance, while interest payments are credited against the appropriate account. Apart from necessary charges for repayment and interest, no additional fees can be charged for returning funds to the United States Treasury. The Administrator must include provisions for rates based on old capital investments and interest rates in contracts for selling electric power after September 30, 1995. Payments for old capital investments must be made to the United States Treasury as repayment, and interest payments are credited accordingly. Amounts under section 1304 of title 31, United States Code, are the sole source for payment of judgments or settlements on claims for breach of contract provisions. The contract provisions do not prevent the Administrator from recovering taxes imposed on electric utilities or affect their authority under applicable law. The Administrator must adhere to applicable law, such as the Pacific Northwest Electric Power Planning and Conservation Act, to allocate costs and benefits for rates or resources and design rates. SEC. 11. SAVINGS PROVISIONS. This Act does not affect the Administrator's obligation to repay capital investments and pay interest from net proceeds. The Administrator retains authority to prepay capital investment principal amounts."
