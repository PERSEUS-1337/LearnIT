    "content": "Temporary visas for professional, managerial, and skilled foreign workers have significantly increased over the past two decades in the United States, with the number of visas issued annually more than doubling from FY1994 to FY2015. The visas for managerial, skilled, and professional workers have consistently dominated the trends, surpassing 1 million in FY2007 and FY2008, and reaching new peaks in FY2014 and FY2015. The State Department underestimates trends in professional, managerial, and skilled foreign workers due to not issuing visas to nonimmigrants changing status within the US. In FY2012, there were 937,366 visas issued to temporary employment-based workers and their families. The Department of Labor ensures foreign workers do not negatively impact US workers. The Department of Labor adjudicates labor certification applications for permanent employment-based immigrants, but many temporary foreign workers are not subject to labor market tests. Some temporary foreign employees are covered by labor market tests, including professional, managerial, and skilled workers. The admission of these foreign workers raises policy questions as the U.S. competes for talent globally. The policy questions surrounding the admission of professional, managerial, and skilled foreign workers in the U.S. include numerical limits, labor market tests for employers, labor protections, worker rights, and contractual obligations. The policy questions surrounding the admission of professional, managerial, and skilled foreign workers in the U.S. include visa portability, streamlined regulations, dual intent for LPR status, and focus on H-1B and L visas. The H-1B visa is for temporary professional specialty workers, often in STEM fields, with numerical limits that are frequently exceeded. Concerns include access to H-1B workers, impact on wages, benefits, and U.S. students. The U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) has recommended more controls to protect workers and prevent abuses in the H-1B visa program, citing limited authority of the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) to enforce program requirements. Weaknesses identified include fragmented oversight, lack of accountability for employers using staffing companies, and expansions increasing the pool of H-1B workers. A 2008 DHS investigation found a 13.4% fraud rate and a 7.3% technical violation rate in H-1B visa adjudications. Violations included document fraud and misstatements about job details. Some employers shifted filing fees to foreign workers. A 2010 investigation found a 14% \"not verified\" rate, sparking calls for further investigations and legislative action. The major U.S. utility company Southern California Edison announced plans to lay off 400 U.S. technology workers and outsource the work to companies in India, using H-1B workers. The New York Times exposed companies like Disney and Toys 'R' Us requiring U.S. workers to train H-1B workers before outsourcing their positions overseas. Concerns have been raised about L-1 intra-company transferees potentially displacing U.S. workers. Concerns have been raised about L-1 visa holders potentially displacing U.S. workers and serving as substitutes for H-1B visa holders, especially in outsourcing and information technology firms. There is also worry that unchecked use of L-1 visas could lead to the transfer of high-skilled jobs overseas. The increase in denials of L-1 visas and requests for additional evidence has raised concerns about displacement of American workers and the 'body shop' problem. Legislation for H-1B reform is often linked to addressing these issues. The rise in denials of L-1 visas and requests for more evidence has caused worries about American worker displacement and the 'body shop' issue. Immigration attorney Lynden Melmed highlights the uncertainty in the L-1 visa process, hindering companies from making business decisions and investments in the U.S. without assurance of bringing their own employees. The report will further explore the purposes, rules, and usage trends of temporary visas for professional, managerial, and skilled foreign workers under the Immigration and Nationality Act. The Immigration and Nationality Act provides temporary visa categories for highly skilled foreign workers, such as the H-1B nonimmigrant visa for \"specialty occupations\" requiring specialized knowledge in various fields. These workers range from skilled labor to management and professional positions, including jobs in sciences, arts, education, business, and athletics. The H-1B visa is for highly skilled foreign workers in various fields like sciences, arts, education, business, and athletics. Employers must submit a labor attestation to the Secretary of Labor before filing petitions with USCIS. The attestation ensures the nonimmigrant will be paid the prevailing wages for the occupation. Employers filing for H-1B visas must provide labor attestations ensuring prevailing wages, nonimmigrant working conditions do not harm other employees, and no strikes or lockouts. H-1B dependent employers with 15% H-1B workers must meet additional labor market tests, including recruitment of U.S. workers and not displacing them. Compensation packages for H-1B workers must be offered by H-1B dependent employers. Dependent employers must offer H-1B workers compensation packages comparable to U.S. workers. H-1B nonimmigrants need to demonstrate education and work experience to USCIS. The annual cap for H-1B workers was set at 65,000 by the Immigration Act of 1990, later increased to 115,000 in 1998. In 2000, Congress raised the H-1B visa annual ceiling to 195,000 for three years and exempted certain workers from the cap. USCIS approved 275,317 H-1B petitions in FY2015, an increase from a low point in FY2010. The number of H-1B petitions approved in FY2015 decreased from FY2014, with 275,317 petitions approved. The numerical limit for H-1B workers is 65,000 per year, with an additional 20,000 for those with masters degrees. Over the past decade, more H-1B workers were approved outside the numerical limits than under the cap. In FY2014, 203,425 H-1B workers were employed in computer-related occupations, making up 65% of all H-1B beneficiaries that year. In FY2014, 203,425 H-1B workers were employed in computer-related occupations, making up 65% of all beneficiaries. 45% had a bachelor's degree, 47% had a master's or professional degree, and almost 8% had a doctorate. The median salary reported was $75,000. Other visa categories for temporary professional workers include TN visas for Canadian and Mexican workers under NAFTA, and E-3 visas for Australian citizens. These visas require employment in a specialty occupation. The J visa is a broad category for cultural exchange, including professors, students, teachers, and au pairs. The U.S. Department of State's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs approves these programs, allowing J visa holders to work as part of their cultural exchange. The visas have expanded to include tasks like child care and camp counseling. Currently, foreign medical graduates can enter the US on J-1 visas for medical education and training. They must return to their home countries for two years before applying for other visas, unless granted a waiver. The Conrad 30 Program allows states to sponsor up to 30 waivers per year for foreign physicians to encourage immigration. The Conrad 30 Program aims to attract foreign physicians to underserved areas in the US. The Q visa is for employment-oriented cultural exchange programs, allowing practical training and employment while sharing culture. Employers must petition for Q nonimmigrants and demonstrate that program activities occur in public settings. Wages and working conditions for Q cultural exchange workers should be comparable to local standards. Intra-company transferees on L-1 visas must meet job qualifications and have worked for the firm for at least six months in the preceding three years. They must be in an executive, managerial, or specialized knowledge capacity. The INA does not require firms to show that U.S. workers will not be adversely affected to bring in L-1 transfers. The L-1 visa is valid for five years and renewable for a total of seven years. E-1 treaty trader visa allows foreign nationals to conduct substantial trade between the US and their country. E-2 treaty investor visa allows individuals to develop and direct operations of an enterprise they have invested in. Both visas require a treaty between the US and the individual's country of citizenship. E-1 and E-2 visas are valid for two years and renewable in two-year intervals. Persons with extraordinary ability in various fields can be admitted on O visas, which are valid for up to three years and renewable for one year. The O visa covers a broad range of occupations and endeavors, including athletics and entertainment. The P visa, with a lower standard of achievement, is restricted to artists, athletes, and entertainers, and is used for individual or group performances. Foreign nationals with extraordinary abilities in arts, athletics, or entertainment can enter the US on O visas for up to five years at a time, totaling up to 10 years. Those working in religious vocations can enter on R visas, defined as activities related to traditional religious functions within a religious denomination. The R visa allows entry for religious activities within a denomination for up to 30 months. In FY2015, 707,781 visas were issued to professional, managerial, and skilled foreign workers. Summer cultural exchange workers make up the largest category of temporary foreign workers. The J-1 visa is often used for Summer Work Travel (SWT) for foreign students to experience life in the US. The Q visa is utilized by the hospitality and entertainment industry. Visas for professional, managerial, and skilled foreign workers have increased over the past two decades. The growth in visas for professional, managerial, and skilled foreign workers over the past two decades has been mainly driven by H-1Bs, TNs, J-1, and L-1 visa categories. There has also been an increase in outstanding and extraordinary foreign workers on O and P visas. F-1 foreign students can participate in Optional Practical Training (OPT) for up to 12 months, with a 29-month extension available for STEM fields introduced in 2008. The Obama administration's Immigration Accountability Executive Action included a \"High Skilled Memorandum\" to expand OPT for STEM students. The new policy aims to increase eligible degree programs, extend OPT time, and strengthen ties to degree-granting institutions. The \"High Skilled Memorandum\" under the Obama administration aimed to expand OPT for STEM students, proposing a 24-month extension for graduates. The number of F-1 visa holders in OPT has significantly increased, raising concerns about potential fraud and abuse. DHS' Immigration and Customs Enforcement was found to be lacking in ensuring foreign students on OPT maintain their legal status in the U.S. Foreign nationals in the United States may be considered resident aliens for federal income tax purposes based on a \"substantial presence\" test. Certain visa holders, such as F, J, M, or Q visa holders working as teachers, students, or trainees, have exemptions from counting days towards substantial presence. However, professional, managerial, and skilled foreign workers are generally not exempt from the individual mandate for health care coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Most noncitizens employed in the U.S. are subject to Social Security and Medicare taxes under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, with exceptions for foreign temporary agricultural workers. Code excludes foreign temporary agricultural workers, foreign students on F and M visas, and cultural exchange visitors on J and Q visas from FICA employment definition. Regulations state that work by students at colleges or universities may be excluded from FICA if their primary status is as a student. Full-time employees are not considered students for FICA exceptions. The determination of student status depends on the predominant aspect of the employee's relationship with the employer. For example, full-time medical residents are not considered students. Foreign students and exchange visitors are exempt from FICA payroll taxes if authorized to work by DHS. The exemption applies to nonresident aliens on F, J, M, or Q visas while temporarily present in the US for the purpose specified in their visa category. Foreign nationals on F and J visas are exempt from FICA payroll taxes based on nonimmigrant status, regardless of the type of employment. The exemption applies to on-campus student employment, off-campus student employment authorized by USCIS, OPT student employment, and employment as a professor, teacher, researcher, physician, or au pair. Totalization Agreements with selected foreign governments help avoid double taxation for social security purposes for temporary foreign workers in the United States, including those on professional visas like H-1B. These visas are a significant pathway for high-skilled immigration, with many employment-based lawful permanent residents having previously held temporary visas. OPT status is also a key link for foreign students to transition to working in the US. The OPT status serves as a pathway for foreign students to transition to employment-based lawful permanent residents in the United States. Employers may hire foreign students as OPT to extend their F-1 visas, allowing for potential recruitment through the H-1B process. If temporary foreign workers meet expectations, employers can petition for them to become LPRs through employment-based immigration categories. This process is common, with over 90% of employment-based LPRs adjusting from a temporary visa category within the United States. The INA requires most foreign nationals seeking nonimmigrant visas to show they are not coming to reside permanently. Exceptions include H-1B and L visa holders who can apply for LPR visas simultaneously, known as dual-intent. \u00a7214(b) presumes all aliens are coming to live permanently, so most must prove otherwise. Exceptions include H-1 professional visas and L intra-company transferee visas. The tension between competing interests on foreign workers has long characterized American immigration policy, with a metaphor of \"Help Wanted\" and \"Keep Out\" at the border. Balancing priorities on temporary visas for professional, managerial, and skilled foreign workers is challenging, especially amidst the lack of consensus on comprehensive immigration reform."
