    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 402.1 of the Revenue and Taxation Code is amended to consider the impact of enforceable land use restrictions on property value, including zoning, contracts with governmental agencies, permit authority, and development controls by local governments. The curr_chunk discusses various environmental constraints and land use restrictions, including development controls by local governments, hazardous waste restrictions, and recorded conservation easements. The curr_chunk outlines different types of easements and contracts that restrict land use, including greenway easements for public agencies or nonprofit organizations, solar-use easements, and contracts with nonprofit corporations for affordable housing development. The contract for affordable housing development includes a deed of trust on the property, recorded with the assessor, and subject to long-term deed restrictions serving a public purpose. It is a renewable 99-year ground lease between a community land trust and the qualified owner of a single-family or multifamily dwelling. The contract for affordable housing development involves a single-family or multifamily dwelling on leased land from a community land trust, with affordability restrictions. Public agencies or officials must approve the affordability restrictions, and the contract must be recorded with the assessor. Affordability restrictions for affordable housing development include conditions such as resale to qualified owners, pricing formula, purchase option for a community land trust, and a renewable 99-year ground lease. A community land trust is a nonprofit corporation that meets specific criteria. The nonprofit corporation creates and maintains permanently affordable single-family or multifamily residences by selling or renting dwellings to low or moderate-income individuals. The land is leased to the qualified owner for 99 years, and terms like \"limited equity housing cooperative\" and \"persons and families of low or moderate income\" are defined. (v) \u201cQualified owner\u201d refers to low or moderate-income individuals or families, including those who collectively own a dwelling in a limited equity housing cooperative. There is a presumption that land use restrictions will not be removed or significantly changed in the near future, ensuring the land's value remains tied to its legally permissible uses. Grounds for rebutting the presumption of land use restrictions include past history of similar restrictions and comparable sales prices. The expiration of a restriction does not guarantee its future removal unless there is no opportunity for continuation or renewal. Assessors should not consider sales of unrestricted land when valuing restricted land unless the restrictions minimally affect its value. In assessing land with enforceable use restrictions, the assessor may consider sales of comparable lands with similar natural limitations. Comparable lands are similar in permissible uses and physical attributes, and representative sales information is used to determine the full cash value of the land being valued. The Legislature enacted this section to ensure accurate assessment of land under use restriction by determining representative sales information availability. It aims to avoid assessing land for uses not legally available to the owner and to encourage effective land use planning. This statute does not require undervaluing land or prohibit using comparable sales information for similar restricted lands.

This act mandates reimbursement to local agencies for costs determined by the Commission on State Mandates. It does not appropriate funds or reimburse local agencies for property tax revenue losses. The act allows for immediate tax levy and is effective under the Constitution."
