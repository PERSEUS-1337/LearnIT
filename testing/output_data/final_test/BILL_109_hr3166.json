    "content": "There is no information provided in the curr_chunk to summarize. The Secretary can cancel grazing permits and leases waived by permittees or lessees, retiring associated grazing allotments from commercial livestock grazing on Federal lands. Priority is given to waivers for grazing permits on National Wilderness Preservation System or National Wild and Scenic River System units if funds are insufficient. The curr_chunk lists various types of protected areas, including units of the National Wild and Scenic River System, National Park System, National Wildlife Refuge System, National Trails System, National Landscape Conservation System, critical habitats for endangered species, designated wilderness study areas, roadless areas, areas of critical environmental concern, Research Natural Areas, and grazing allotments with water-quality considerations. The curr_chunk specifies grazing allotments with water-quality concerns, Wild and Scenic Rivers Act designations, and other ecological or recreational values determined by the Secretary. It also clarifies that the Act does not impact the renewal or transfer of grazing permits or leases. The Act does not allow the use of eminent domain to acquire a grazing permit or lease. SEC. 5. COMPENSATION FOR WAIVED GRAZING PERMIT OR LEASE. Compensation for waived grazing permit or lease is required at a rate of $175 per animal unit month. If a permittee or lessee is in arrears of Federal grazing fees, the fees will be deducted from the compensation. Waiver of certain permits or leases is prohibited. The Act prohibits compensation for waiving a grazing permit or lease if no valid permit or lease exists. The Secretary retains authority to modify or terminate permits without compensation. Compensation does not establish a property right in permits or leases. SEC. 6 allows permittees or lessees to donate grazing permits or leases to the Secretary without compensation. They can also accept compensation from other sources. The Secretary will cancel donated permits and leases, retiring the associated grazing allotments. (a) Effect on Range Developments.--A permittee or lessee who waives a grazing permit or lease to the Secretary under section 4 and receives compensation under section 5, or donates a grazing permit or lease under section 6, shall be deemed to have waived any claim to all range developments on the associated grazing allotments. \n(b) Securing Retired Allotments Against Unauthorized Use.--The Secretary shall ensure that grazing allotments retired from grazing under this Act are rendered reasonably secure from trespass grazing by domestic livestock. \n(c) Relation to Other Valid Existing Rights.--Nothing in this Act affects the allocation, ownership, interest, or control of any water, water right, or any other valid existing right held by the United States, Indian tribe, State, or private individual, partnership, or corporation. SEC. 8. The Secretary will not issue grazing permits for allotments without valid permits and will permanently retire them from livestock grazing. SEC. 9. Permittees can choose not to graze or reduce grazing levels and still keep their permits. SEC. 10. County transition payments. The Secretary will pay $10 per animal unit month to counties for waived grazing permits, based on historical usage. Payments will be proportional to the land area in each county for allotments spanning multiple counties. SEC. 11. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATION. $100,000,000 authorized for compensation to permittees and lessees under section 5 and transition payments to counties under section 10. No funds for administrative costs related to this Act."
