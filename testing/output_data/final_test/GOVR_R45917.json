    "content": "The federal government's role in federal student loan programs has evolved over time, with most loans issued under the now-discontinued FFELP. Private lenders extended loans guaranteed by the government, but various entities helped operate the program. Recent developments, like the ECASLA in 2008, have shifted the government's role in the student loan system. The federal government's role in federal student loan programs has evolved, with recent legislation like ECASLA and SAFRA shifting towards direct lending through the Federal Direct Loan Program. This has increased the government's direct involvement in the student loan industry, leading to a reliance on servicers to administer federal student loan programs. The federal government relies on servicers to administer federal student loan programs, with various statutes and regulations governing the servicing of loans. Title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 establishes programs for financial assistance, including the FDLP and loans issued under the FFELP. Section 1082 of Title IV empowers the Secretary of Education to prescribe regulations for third party servicers. Section 1082 of Title IV empowers the Secretary of Education to prescribe regulations for third party servicers, including standardized forms and procedures for student loan servicing. Officers, directors, employees, and consultants of student loan servicing agencies must disclose potential financial conflicts of interest. Federal loan servicing contracts are awarded to eligible servicers for FDLP loans, with the requirement that servicers be qualified and possess relevant experience. The Secretary must ensure that student loan servicing contracts are awarded to qualified providers with relevant experience and competitive pricing. The legal debate includes a provision stating that loans under Title IV of the HEA are not subject to state disclosure requirements. ED has issued regulations for loan servicing under its rulemaking authority. The Code of Federal Regulations governs FFELP loans, outlining responsibilities for lenders and servicers. Servicers must respond to borrower inquiries, establish repayment terms, and report loan status. Standards for administrative and financial responsibility must be met by third-party servicers, with auditing requirements in place. The Code of Federal Regulations imposes auditing requirements on servicers of FFELP loans, with procedures for addressing violations. It is uncertain if these regulations apply to servicers of FDLP loans, as there is a preference for both loan types to be governed by the same legal standards. The FFELP regulations for third-party servicers may or may not apply to FDLP servicers, with conflicting court opinions. The servicing contracts do not clearly state if FDLP servicers must follow FFELP regulations, but ED may still expect compliance. Some servicers have hinted in legal documents that FFELP regulations could apply to FDLP servicers. Additionally, ED has established various responsibilities for the Secretary to fulfill. The Secretary has delegated responsibilities to servicers, including notifying borrowers about income recertification for IDR plans. ED contracts with multiple entities to service federal student loans, governing various aspects of their operations. Servicing contracts also outline mechanisms for ED to address servicers violating federal requirements. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has supervisory authority over certain nonbank \"larger participants\" in consumer financial markets, as defined by the Dodd-Frank Act. There are concerns about the effectiveness of ED's use of contractual provisions to punish and deter servicer misconduct. The CFPB has supervisory authority over larger participants in consumer financial markets, including student loan servicers with more than 1 million accounts. It can conduct examinations, request information, and bring enforcement actions against servicers. Questions have been raised about the relationship between the CFPB and the Department of Education. Questions have arisen regarding the relationship between the CFPB and ED, as the two agencies had MOUs for sharing information on student loan servicers and coordinating oversight activities, which were terminated by ED in 2017. ED claimed the CFPB overstepped its oversight role, leading to a lack of cooperation from student loan servicers for supervisory examinations since 2017. Some federal student loan servicers accused of misconduct, steering borrowers towards forbearance instead of IDR plans. Forbearance offers temporary relief from loan repayment, but interest continues to accrue and is added to the loan principal. Some federal student loan servicers are accused of steering borrowers towards forbearance instead of IDR plans, which offer reduced monthly payments based on income and loan forgiveness after a specified period. Critics claim servicers have a financial incentive to push forbearance over IDR plans. Servicers deny these allegations. Some federal student loan servicers are accused of failing to provide critical information to borrowers regarding income recertification for IDR plans. Critics allege that servicers do not advise borrowers of the consequences of not submitting timely recertifications, leading to increased loan payments and balances. Borrowers also claim that servicers misinform them about their options. Some borrowers allege that federal student loan servicers provided misinformation about eligibility for loan forgiveness under the PSLF program. The HEA does not allow borrowers to sue servicers directly, only the Secretary can enforce it. Some states have laws that allow entities other than the federal government to take legal action against federal student loan servicers. These state laws can target servicers specifically or apply more broadly to various entities. The specifics of each state statute vary, with some imposing additional legal requirements on servicers beyond federal law. Some states have laws that regulate student loan servicers, requiring them to maintain a state-issued license and facing penalties for misconduct. Revocation of licenses can occur if servicers are found incompetent, untrustworthy, or engaged in fraudulent activities. Some state licensing statutes regulate student loan servicers, requiring them to be licensed and penalizing misconduct. Certain states, like New York, allow automatic licensure for federal student loan servicers hired by the Department of Education. Other states, such as Colorado and Maine, have similar laws for federal student loan servicers. Some states designate a student loan ombudsperson to oversee servicers, resolve complaints, and educate borrowers. The ombudsperson can refer unlawful conduct to state agencies for enforcement. Some states require servicers to evaluate IDR plan eligibility before forbearance and prohibit incentivizing repayment specialists to violate regulations. Some states have enacted laws to prevent servicers from incentivizing repayment specialists to violate regulations or rush through processes. States also require servicers to disclose important information to borrowers, such as IDR plan expiration dates and consequences for not recertifying. Additionally, some states prohibit servicers from misinforming borrowers about loan forgiveness programs like PSLF. Several states have enacted laws to regulate servicers' operations, including requirements to acknowledge and respond to borrower complaints, recordkeeping obligations, and informing borrowers of payment recipient changes. Violations of state servicing laws can lead to various remedies, such as private cause of action and damages. Maine, for example, will allow borrowers to seek compensatory, treble, and punitive damages, along with costs and attorney's fees from servicers starting January 1, 2020. Some state statutes authorize fines, penalties, and lawsuits against servicers for violating servicing laws, allowing enforcement by both individual borrowers and the government. State laws may exceed federal requirements and incorporate federal standards for remedies. For example, Connecticut requires compliance with state and federal laws for student loan servicers. Loan servicers must comply with federal laws and regulations related to student loan servicing, with violations subject to enforcement action by the Connecticut Banking Commissioner. States may also have consumer protection statutes that apply to servicers, allowing for legal action against deceptive or unfair practices. Additionally, state courts recognize common law causes of action such as fraud. State and federal laws coexist in the realm of federal student loan servicing regulations, leading to questions of federal preemption. Federal law can preempt conflicting state law in two central ways, such as through statutory language that addresses the scope of a law's preemptive effect. Borrowers have invoked common law causes of action against servicers for misconduct. Federal law can preempt conflicting state laws through explicit statutory language or implied preemption principles. Implied preemption can occur through field preemption, where federal regulation is pervasive, or conflict preemption, where state laws conflict with federal laws. Courts analyze preemption based on congressional intent, sometimes starting with a presumption against preemption. The Department of Education (ED) announced in March 2018 that federal law preempts state laws regulating federal student loan servicers, claiming that federal law displaces state laws imposing regulatory requirements on servicing. This interpretation was published informally in the Federal Register without notice-and-comment rulemaking. The Department of Education (ED) announced that federal law preempts state laws regulating federal student loan servicers, citing conflict and field preemption theories. ED also relies on express preemption principles, arguing that federal law broadly bars states from imposing disclosure requirements on federal student loans. The Department of Education interprets 'disclosure requirements' broadly to include informal communications to borrowers. They have filed motions to dismiss lawsuits against student loan servicers based on preemption grounds. This has sparked debate between states and borrowers who argue state laws can coexist with federal laws, and ED and servicers who claim state regulations conflict with federal law. Federal courts are analyzing field preemption, conflict preemption, and express preemption in these disputes. Courts have analyzed field preemption, conflict preemption, and express preemption in relation to state student loan servicing laws and claims against federal student loan servicers. They have not uniformly concluded that the Higher Education Act (HEA) occupies the field of federal student loan servicing regulation. Some federal appellate courts have held that the HEA does not have field preemptive effect, allowing for state law to operate in the field legislated by Congress. Courts have recognized that the Higher Education Act (HEA) is comprehensive but that its comprehensiveness does not necessarily result in field preemption. The HEA contains explicit preemption provisions that foreclose certain state laws, such as usury and garnishment laws. Courts have rejected the argument that federal regulation of federal student loan servicers is an exclusive field under the HEA. The HEA does not result in field preemption, as it contains explicit preemption provisions. The federal government's interest in regulating federal student loan servicing does not necessarily preempt state regulation, as seen in the case of Student Loan Servicing Alliance v. District of Columbia. The federal government's dominant interest in student loan servicing is weighed against states' compelling interest in consumer protection. The federal district court invalidated parts of DC's student loan servicing law, ruling that state regulation did not conflict with federal law. The court did not defer to the ED's Interpretation, emphasizing states' interest in consumer protection. The federal district court invalidated parts of DC's student loan servicing law, ruling that state regulation did not conflict with federal law. The court did not defer to the ED's Interpretation, stating it lacked thoroughness and consistency. The court found that DC's licensing scheme undermined ED's authority to select servicers for federal student loans, preempting state laws that impede federal contracting decisions. This reasoning applied to FDLP loans and government-owned FFELP loans.

The court found that DC's licensing scheme undermined ED's authority to select servicers for federal student loans, preempting state laws that impede federal contracting decisions. This reasoning applied to FDLP loans and government-owned FFELP loans. The court held that federal law did not preempt state regulations of servicers of outstanding commercial FFELP loans, where private lenders own and decide whether to contract with student loan servicers and the federal government acts merely as a reinsurer or a guarantor. Beyond the Student Loan Servicing Alliance case and its preemption of DC's licensing requirement for federal student loan servicers, courts have generally declined to find conflict preemption in suits brought against servicers for misrepresentations under state laws of general applicability.

Courts have considered whether uniformity is a goal of the HEA, but enforcing state laws prohibiting deceptive conduct does not hinder uniformity in federal student loan programs. Courts have debated the extent of federal preemption in cases involving state regulation of student loan servicers. In Nelson v. Great Lakes Educational Loan Services, Inc., the Seventh Circuit ruled that allowing state law misrepresentation claims against a servicer would not conflict with federal interests. Recent cases have focused on the preemption clause in Section 1098g of federal student loan servicing laws. Recent federal student loan servicing cases have focused on the preemption clause in Section 1098g of the HEA, which prohibits states from imposing disclosure requirements on federal student loans. Courts are debating whether this preemption clause prevents state law suits against servicers for misrepresentations or misleading communications to borrowers. Allegations in these lawsuits include forbearance steering and misstatements about loan forgiveness eligibility, often made by servicers' call center representatives. Plaintiffs claim they were directed towards forbearance instead of being informed about other options or enrolling in a more beneficial IDR plan. Plaintiffs in recent federal student loan servicing cases have alleged misrepresentations by servicers, including steering towards forbearance instead of more beneficial plans. The main issue is whether state law claims against servicers are preempted by Section 1098g of the HEA. Federal courts have generally allowed these lawsuits to proceed, rejecting preemption arguments. In recent federal student loan servicing cases, courts have allowed lawsuits to proceed over alleged misrepresentations by servicers, such as steering towards forbearance instead of more beneficial plans. Courts have distinguished these claims as involving deceptive conduct, not just a lack of disclosure under Section 1098g of the HEA. For example, in Pennsylvania v. Navient Corp., a court ruled that state law claims regarding forbearance steering were not preempted by the HEA. However, in Lawson-Ross v. Great Lakes Higher Education Corp., a different conclusion on express preemption was reached in 2018. The court in Lawson-Ross v. Great Lakes Higher Education Corp. found that federal regulations already dictate the information provided to federal student loan borrowers, making state law claims for additional disclosure requirements impermissible. The court interpreted the plaintiffs' claim as a failure to disclose accurate information on eligibility, not an affirmative misrepresentation, citing Section 1098g and giving deference to the Department of Education's views on federal law preemption. The Lawson-Ross court, and servicers arguing for preemption, relied on the Chae v. SLM Corporation case from the Ninth Circuit to support their views on federal law preemption. In Chae, students sued a federal student loan servicer for misleading billing practices, but the court ruled that Section 1098g preempted the action, stating that the state-law misrepresentation claims were improper-disclosure claims. The Lawson-Ross court extended Chae's logic to servicers' oral misrepresentations about PSLF eligibility, while other courts have distinguished Chae, noting differences in the nature of misleading communications involved. The landscape of decisions on Section 1098g's preemptive scope may change as more appellate courts address the issue, with pending appeals in the Pennsylvania and Lawson-Ross cases, and the possibility of the Nelson case being appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. Legal debates on the preemptive effect of federal law in student loan servicing and beyond involve various considerations. In the student loan servicing context, replacing state laws with a national standard can have advantages by streamlining regulations and reducing compliance burdens. However, preempting state laws can also limit states' ability to fill regulatory gaps and experiment with new approaches. State laws may limit states' ability to experiment with regulating industries and behaviors, potentially hindering more effective methods than those devised by the federal government. Congress may consider legislation to clarify or modify the preemptive effect of federal law in student loan servicing. For example, the PROSPER Act in the 115th Congress aimed to exempt student loan servicing from state laws regarding disclosure requirements, communication restrictions, and other servicing requirements under Title IV of the HEA. Congress may consider legislation to clarify or modify the preemptive effect of federal law in student loan servicing. This could involve enacting a savings clause to specify that federal law does not preempt state laws imposing more restrictive requirements on federal student loan servicers. Alternatively, Congress could choose to displace state servicing laws by preempting all state laws that relate to loan servicing under Title IV of the HEA. Congress may consider legislation to clarify or modify the preemptive effect of federal law in student loan servicing. This could involve enacting a savings clause to specify that federal law does not preempt state laws imposing more restrictive requirements on federal student loan servicers. Alternatively, new federal laws governing the conduct, obligations, and oversight of federal loan servicers could raise legal questions regarding how those federal standards interact with state laws. Loan servicers could raise legal questions regarding how federal standards interact with state servicing laws and the roles of federal and state law in regulating federal student loan servicers. The preemptive effect of federal law depends on specific statutory text enacted by Congress. Changes in how the Higher Education Act (HEA) is enforced could affect the preemptive scope of federal law. Congress may empower other entities, such as states, individual borrowers, or federal agencies like the CFPB, to enforce federal student loan regulations if the Department of Education (ED) is not effectively monitoring servicers. Granting borrowers or states a private right of action under federal law against contractors that violate federal servicing standards could deter, correct, and punish alleged servicer misconduct. However, subjecting servicers to litigation and regulation by multiple entities may increase costs and undermine uniformity in federal student loan servicer regulation. Several bills in the 116th Congress propose increased litigation or regulation by entities other than the Department of Education. The Student Loan Borrower Bill of Rights proposes increased litigation against federal student loan servicers under the Truth in Lending Act. The CFPB Student Loan Integrity and Transparency Act of 2019 would require servicers to provide information to the CFPB and reinstate MOUs between ED and the CFPB. Legal questions regarding preemption in loan servicing will be left to the courts to resolve, potentially affecting uniformity in servicing regulations. The potential legal questions on preemption in loan servicing could impact the consistency of servicing regulations and oversight of federal student loan servicers."
