    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Upper Connecticut River Partnership Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings and purpose section. The upper Connecticut River watershed in NH and VT is a scenic region with historic villages, farms, forests, and the Connecticut River. It provides habitat, recreation, and hydropower. Recognized as part of the Silvio O. Conte National Fish and Wildlife Refuge, citizens' stewardship led to its preservation. The Connecticut River was designated as 1 of 14 American Heritage Rivers in 1998. It is home to the bi-State Connecticut River Scenic Byway and has established commissions for the watershed in Vermont and New Hampshire since 1989. These commissions work together to promote cooperation between various entities. In 1997, the Connecticut River Joint Commissions, with the involvement of 5 bi-State local river subcommittees, produced the Connecticut River Corridor Management Plan. In 2009, updates were published via the Connecticut River Recreation Management Plan and the Water Resources Management Plan. The legislatures of Vermont and New Hampshire have requested Congress to continue cooperation. The Act authorizes the Secretary to support the Connecticut River Joint Commissions in implementing recommendations from the Connecticut River Corridor Management Plan, with assistance from the National Park Service and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. The purpose of the Act is to provide support to the States of New Hampshire and Vermont. The Act authorizes the Secretary to provide technical and financial assistance to the States of New Hampshire and Vermont for management of the Connecticut River through the Connecticut River Joint Commissions.
