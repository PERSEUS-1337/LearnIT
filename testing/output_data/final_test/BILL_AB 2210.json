    "title": "AB 2210",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 89711 of the Education Code is amended to require an affirmative vote for reallocation of California State University campus-based mandatory fees, excluding student success fees, established through a majority student vote. Section 89711 of the Education Code now requires an affirmative vote for reallocation of California State University campus-based mandatory fees, except student success fees. A fee established through a student vote can be reallocated without another vote if the initial vote authorized a reallocation mechanism. This does not apply to fees approved before this section was enacted. Section 89712 is amended accordingly. Before approving a new student success fee or an increase to an existing fee, a California State University campus must inform and educate students on the fee's uses, impact, and cost. Students must also be informed that the fee can be rescinded by a majority vote, except within six years of implementation. The campus must hold a student election for any proposed student success fees or fee increases, requiring two-thirds of the student body to vote affirmatively. Approval by the Chancellor of the California State University is also necessary for implementation. A student success fee can only be rescinded by a binding student vote after at least six years have passed since its implementation. (c) (1) Student success fees may be rescinded with a binding student vote if a simple majority of voting students agree. The vote must be approved by the student government and can only occur once per academic year. Students must be informed of any long-term obligations supported by the fee before voting. (2) No new obligations can be made with the rescinded fee. The Chancellor of the California State University must ensure compliance on each campus. The Chancellor of the California State University ensures compliance with student success fee allocation oversight groups, annual reporting, and transparent decision-making processes. Reporting procedures are established for campus compliance, with a yearly summary to the Department of Finance and Legislature on fee adoption and usage. A \"student success fee\" is a mandatory fee required by California State University campuses for enrollment, as determined by the campus or Chancellor."
