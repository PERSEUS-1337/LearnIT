    "content": "Under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, Congress mandated the use of biofuels in the U.S. transportation fuel base, with a focus on increasing cellulosic biofuels to 16 billion gallons by 2022. Federal support includes tax credits and import tariffs to promote the development of the U.S. biofuels industry. However, uncertainties remain regarding the most cost-effective biomass sources and processing technologies for large-scale cellulosic biofuels production. The challenges of developing cost-effective biomass sources and processing technologies for large-scale cellulosic biofuels production include incentives for biomass producers, harvesting and transportation logistics, infrastructure changes, federal policies, and potential regional and international consequences. The current state of knowledge on biomass feedstocks, production constraints, processing technologies, and economics for biofuels is summarized to guide policymakers in developing federal policies to support the industry. The report provides an overview of the nascent U.S. cellulosic biofuels industry, highlighting uncertainties and technological developments. Conducted by researchers at Purdue University, it examines current and future technologies impacting biofuels production and the economics of biomass. The report on the economics of biomass production and biofuels processing provides an overview of key findings in five chapters, including an Executive Summary and detailed analysis in Chapters 2-5. Background information on cellulosic biofuels is covered in Chapters 2-4, leading to a comprehensive economic discussion in the final chapter. Access to additional CRS products on U.S. biofuels policy is available online. The CRS online \"Issues in Focus/Agriculture/Agriculture-Based Biofuels\" website provides reports on agriculture-based biofuels and cellulosic biofuels policy. Reports include analysis of policy issues, comparison of definitions in legislation, overview of the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), meeting the RFS mandate for cellulosic biofuels, waiver authority under the RFS, and biofuels incentives. The technology assessment and report on biofuels incentives and programs was written by Purdue University's Department of Agricultural Economics, led by Wallace E. Tyner, Sarah Brechbill, and David Perkis. The report's authorship is attributed to Tyner, Brechbill, and Perkis. The report on biofuels incentives and programs was authored by Tyner, Brechbill, and Perkis under contract to CRS. It was funded by the Joyce Foundation and focuses on the advantages of cellulose-based biofuels over corn ethanol. The U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard requires 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels by 2022, with a significant portion coming from cellulosic biofuels. The 2022 Renewable Fuel Standard mandates a portion of renewable fuels to come from cellulosic biofuels, an emerging industry facing uncertainties in its development. This report aims to outline the technical and economic potential, key challenges, and potential impacts of government mandates on cellulosic biofuels. Current research on feedstocks focuses on maximizing yields, harvesting efficiently, and testing supply chains to minimize costs. Preferred lignocellulosic feedstocks contain cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, with varying concentrations affecting conversion technology efficacy. Feedstocks rich in cellulose and hemicellulose are favored for biochemical processes, but research aims to incorporate lignin or modify its properties. This research has the potential to alter feedstock viability and preference. Numerous biomass feedstock sources are available for potential use. Potential biomass feedstocks in the United States include agricultural residues, perennial grasses, short-rotation woody crops, and forest residues. The Environmental Protection Agency estimated that 16 billion gallons of cellulosic biofuels mandated for 2022 will come from dedicated energy crops, agricultural residues, urban waste, and forest residue. Feedstock production and harvest costs vary for each type of biomass. Biomass production faces tradeoffs in terms of production, storage, and transportation. Dedicated energy and tree crops have high upfront costs but can yield high production with low maintenance. Residues are costless to produce but have challenges in collection and processing uniformity. Agricultural residues have trade-offs between soil nutrient loss and biomass yield. Logging residues face tradeoffs in energy production and processing quality. Economic incentives are crucial for producer participation in biomass feedstock production. Incentives are needed to encourage producer participation in growing biomass feedstocks, as markets are limited and risk management tools are scarce. Studies show varying estimated participation rates depending on factors like plant location, biomass price, and production costs. Feedstock transportation choices depend on plant location and local supply availability, with agricultural residues and perennial grass feedstocks requiring large volumes due to their low energy density. Transportation costs are crucial in biomass choice due to low energy density, requiring large volumes for plant operation. A 50-million-gallon-per-year cellulosic ethanol plant would need over 550,000 tons of corn stover from 280,000 acres. More truckloads are needed for cellulosic biofuel production, increasing transport costs and burden on rural infrastructure. Feedstocks may burden rural transportation infrastructure. Compacting biomass for transport can save costs. Long-term storage is necessary for biomass until plant use. Plants using multiple feedstocks can rotate based on harvest times. Storage costs and feedstock uniformity are crucial considerations. Uniformity of feedstock is crucial for biomass processing efficiency. Standardization and densification of biomass before reaching the plant can lower transportation costs and ensure a consistent product. Two main conversion methods for lignocellulosic feedstocks are biochemical and... The biochemical conversion process for lignocellulosic feedstocks involves pretreating the feedstock to separate cellulose and hemicellulose, hydrolyzing the sugars into simple sugars, fermenting the sugars into liquid fuel, and distilling the fuel to achieve purity. Production costs vary based on the specific implementation design and feedstock used. The liquid fuel is distilled to achieve a 95% pure form, incurring production costs. Pretreatment involves biological or chemical methods, with biological pretreatment taking 10 to 14 days. Hydrolysis costs depend on enzyme costs, estimated at $0.50 per gallon. The effectiveness of hydrolysis is dependent on pretreatment efficiency, impacting enzyme function and costs. Fermentation may require different yeast strains for various sugar types like hexoses or pentoses. Improved yeast strains for fermenting different sugars could reduce production costs. Managing recovered lignin for electricity generation can also save costs. Research areas for energy yield improvement include pretreatment, hydrolysis, and fermentation. Distillation is a well-established technology. The energy equivalency of ethanol to gasoline is about 67%. Blending ethanol with gasoline at low rates has minimal impact on gas mileage for consumers. At higher blend rates, especially at an 85%-ethanol blend rate (E85), the lower mileage is more noticeable and consumers may prefer energy-equivalent pricing, whereby the price for a gallon of E85 should be only 72% of the price of a gallon of gasoline. Ethanol cannot be used in the same infrastructure as gasoline, limiting delivery opportunities and raising costs. Thermochemical conversion processes are used in the ethanol production process. Thermochemical conversion processes, such as gasification and pyrolysis, are well-established methods that use heat to decompose biomass. Gasification involves partial combustion of biomass to produce syngas, which is then cleaned of impurities before being converted into liquid fuels using the Fischer-Tropsch process. Impurities in syngas can disrupt the conversion process, and biomass must be dried to 20% moisture content before gasification. Pyrolysis is a method of converting biomass into bio-oil at high temperatures without oxygen. Fast pyrolysis is currently the most promising conversion process, but stabilizing the pyrolysis oil for further refining into biofuels remains a challenge. Despite the barriers, pyrolysis offers advantages such as easier storage and transportation of the liquid biomass product. The thermochemical conversion of biomass into liquid fuels makes it easier to store and transport. These synthetic fuels are energy-equivalent to petroleum fuels and can be used in existing infrastructure. Research is focused on improving gasification and pyrolysis processes for cost reduction and stability. Commercialization of cellulosic biofuels is still in the early stages, with most production happening in small-scale plants. Development of commercial cellulosic biofuels is slow due to cost challenges. Various processes are being researched, but success on a large scale is uncertain. Cost estimates range from $2.50 to $3.00 per gallon. Theoretical ethanol yield calculations are used to determine maximum biofuel yield per ton of feedstock. Theoretical ethanol yields for different feedstocks are 113, 97, and 82 gallons per dry ton for corn stover, switchgrass, and forest thinning, respectively. Efficiency of biofuels production technologies could reach 100% of maximum theoretical energy yield. With the current ethanol tax credit, corn-ethanol plants break even at an oil price of $56.33 per barrel. The breakeven oil price for corn ethanol is $71.45 per barrel with the ethanol tax credit, rising to $91.62 without the credit. Cellulosic biofuels have higher breakeven prices, with biochemical and thermochemical processes requiring $92.74 and $113.77 per barrel, respectively. Energy-equivalent pricing increases the breakeven oil price for corn ethanol to $114.19 without the tax credit. Biochemical cellulosic biofuels have prohibitive breakeven prices of $145.98 with subsidy and $196.64 without, while thermochemical biofuels are more competitive at $98.92 per barrel. Simulation results suggest that corn ethanol is profitable only with volumetric pricing, while biomass-based cellulosic biofuels are not yet profitable under any pricing approach. A variable subsidy that declines with higher oil prices has been proposed to maintain biofuels incentives while limiting taxpayer exposure. The report includes a comparative analysis of fixed versus variable tax credits for biofuels incentives. Model results show that the variable subsidy reduces producer risk and taxpayer costs, but has slightly lower average returns. The paper aims to summarize the current knowledge on cellulosic biofuels, including technical and economic potential, government mandates, and incentives. Recent changes in the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) in the United States will require renewable fuels production to more than triple by 2022, with a focus on cellulosic biofuels. Various cellulosic feedstocks are being researched to maximize yields and minimize costs in the supply chain. Cellulosic conversion technologies are being researched to minimize costs and maximize yields in the supply chain. The technologies include biochemical and thermochemical approaches, which are different from those used for corn ethanol. Both feedstock supply and conversion technologies are still in early stages of development, with uncertain future progress. It is unclear whether one will dominate over the other or if they can evolve simultaneously to meet advanced biofuels requirements. The focus is on reducing costs for cellulosic biofuels production to make it competitive with other energy sources. Governments and universities will help reduce risks in feedstock production and biofuels plants. The report covers feedstock production, logistics, and biofuel production, with a discussion on distribution infrastructure and end use in vehicles. The report discusses lignocellulosic feedstocks, their characteristics, yields, production costs, and supply logistics. It also covers biochemical and thermochemical conversion technologies, energy yields, costs, and planned pilot plants. The report presents a list of planned and proposed pilot and demonstration plants, along with the allocation of funding from the Department of Energy. It also discusses the economics and policy of cellulosic biofuels, analyzing the effects of different subsidy models on biofuel production. Lignocellulosic feedstocks, composed of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, play a crucial role in biofuel production depending on their concentration in a feedstock. The composition of lignocellulosic feedstocks, including cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, impacts biofuel production. Cellulose and hemicellulose can be converted into liquid fuels, while lignin can be used for energy generation. The characteristics and amounts of these components in feedstock influence the efficiency of conversion technologies. Feedstocks in the United States include agricultural residues, perennial grasses, forest residues, and short-rotation woody crops. Research is being conducted to incorporate lignin into conversion processes or modify its properties through hybrid feedstocks. Lignocellulosic feedstocks also contain organic acids, ash, proteins, oils, minerals, and other compounds. Examples of biomass resources are agricultural crop residues like corn and wheat. Biomass resources include agricultural crop residues, perennial grasses, short-rotation woody crops, logging residues, manure, food/feed processing residues, municipal solid waste, and urban wood waste. Perennial grasses like switchgrass and Miscanthus have high yields, are low-maintenance, and have a positive environmental impact. However, they are not widely grown as primary crops for energy production. Perennial grasses like switchgrass are important for energy production but face challenges such as lack of crop insurance and a commodity market. Contracts between producers and processing plants are crucial for selling the product. The University of Tennessee Biofuels Initiative is currently growing switchgrass. Switchgrass is being grown by the University of Tennessee Biofuels Initiative and the Oklahoma Bioenergy Center. In Tennessee, 725 acres were planted in 2008, with an additional 1,900 acres in 2009. Producers are paid $450 per acre annually for a three-year contract. In Oklahoma, 1,100 acres were planted in 2008, with 1,000 acres in a single tract, the largest area in the world. Switchgrass grows annually for 10 years, while Miscanthus can grow for 15 to 20 years. It takes time to establish and harvest perennial grasses due to deep roots storing resources. Perennial grasses like switchgrass have deep roots that store resources, reducing the need for fertilizer. They can take advantage of long growing seasons and grow on marginal cropland. However, lower yields may increase production costs. Studies from the University of Tennessee show conflicting results on whether biofuels processing plants should prioritize switchgrass from more productive soil types. Miscanthus research has mainly been in Europe, with some plots now in the US. Miscanthus yields are higher than switchgrass due to larger mass, taller height, and longer growing season. Field experiments in Illinois and Iowa show switchgrass yields can be as low as one-fourth of Miscanthus yields. Both have high yields compared to agricultural residues, reducing production cost per ton. Switchgrass and Miscanthus have high yields compared to agricultural residues, reducing production costs per ton. However, perennial grasses like Miscanthus are more costly to produce due to higher establishment and maintenance costs. Miscanthus yields are higher than switchgrass, but it requires more machine power for harvesting and must be planted as rhizomes. Establishment costs for Miscanthus are much higher compared to switchgrass, which is planted as a seed. In the United States, perennial grasses like Miscanthus and switchgrass could be grown on unused land or land in the Conservation Reserve Program. Producers of these grasses will need to bear the risk of high upfront establishment costs and potential replanting, especially for switchgrass due to seed dormancy issues. Producers of perennial grasses like Miscanthus and switchgrass face risks such as seed dormancy and high upfront establishment costs. Government grants, university programs, and contracts with biofuels plants can help mitigate these risks. The profitability of these crops, alternative crop options, and proximity to production facilities will influence planting decisions. Small or part-time producers may lack the expertise and resources needed for cost-effective establishment and maintenance of perennial grass stands. Producers of perennial grasses may face challenges in establishing and maintaining cost-effective stands, especially on small and dispersed fields. Land grant university extension programs are expected to assist in streamlining the growing process. Agricultural residues like corn stover are seen as a more readily available and less expensive feedstock option compared to perennial grasses. The primary costs associated with residues include nutrient replacement, harvesting, storage, and transportation. Corn stover is used as the primary residue in this discussion. Corn stover is the primary residue discussed here, serving to prevent erosion and nutrient loss during fallow periods. The appropriate amount to remove depends on various factors like tillage practices, crop rotation, and soil type. While excessive removal can compromise soil health, there is no consensus on the maximum safe removal amount. Some argue that as corn yields increase, residue removal may be necessary. The equipment used for removal also influences the amount that can be taken out. The amount of corn stover residue that can be removed depends on various factors like tillage practices, crop rotation, and soil type. Different equipment can collect varying percentages of residue, with the most efficient collection techniques still being researched. More efficient technologies will likely be adopted by larger producers, leaving smaller producers to use existing hay equipment. A one-pass harvest system that attaches to the combine is the next step in equipment development for residue harvest. Time is critical during the fall harvest period, and weather conditions play a significant role in the harvest of residues. Producers may be hesitant to remove residue if it puts their corn yield at risk. Current research at Iowa State University is working on developing a more efficient harvesting system that attaches to a conventional combine. The one-pass harvesting system being developed attaches to a conventional combine, with a chopper and blower in the back. It chops stover into two-inch pieces and blows it into a wagon alongside the combine. The estimated cost is between $35,000 and $50,000. The system can be switched off to leave residue in a windrow behind the combine if needed. Efforts are ongoing to ensure that the system does not slow down grain harvest, regardless of the amount of residue removed. The one-pass harvesting system attaches to a conventional combine, chopping stover into two-inch pieces and blowing it into a wagon. Efforts are made to prevent slowing down grain harvest, regardless of residue removal. Research is ongoing to improve residue density for efficient transport and determine the best height to cut residue for conversion efficiency. Short-rotation woody crops like poplar and willow are grown for biomass on open land, regrowing quickly after harvest. These trees are commercially viable and adaptable to various regions. Residues left in the field can protect against erosion, with upper parts and cobs suitable for biofuel production. Perennial grasses require annual harvesting, while there is no obligation to remove residues unless under contract with a plant. Some trees are already harvested for pulp and small wood products. Short-rotation woody crops like poplar and willow are commercially viable for biomass production, offering environmental benefits such as improved soil quality and reduced CO2 emissions. Cuttings from year-old trees are planted during the dormant season, with trees ready for harvest in three to four years. The stand's lifespan is at least 20 years, with multiple harvests every three to four years. Maintenance is minimal during the growing period, and cost reduction in production is expected from increased yields and efficiency. Tree crop production focuses on increasing yields and production efficiency, along with valuing environmental benefits. Research is ongoing on poplar and willow hybrids to boost yield potential and reduce lignin content. Transportation efficiencies can be achieved by growing dedicated tree crops near conversion facilities. Storage is simplified as tree crops can be stored on the stump and harvested as needed. Utilizing forest residues, including naturally grown trees, residues from commercial logging, and processing mills, can help mitigate environmental impact. Forest residues, including those from commercial logging and processing mills, can help mitigate environmental impact by avoiding burning or landfill disposal. Efficient equipment for collecting residues within forests is lacking, but one-step harvesters that simultaneously collect round wood and biomass are being used by large-scale logging operations. These systems are capital-intensive and best suited for larger tracts of land. Residues from mills are advantageous due to their lower moisture content. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 restricts the collection of residues for biofuel production from federal lands, old-growth forests, and imperiled forests. This limitation may impact the availability of mill residues for biofuel production, as feedstock distribution varies among regions. Woody biomass is mainly found on private land in the southeastern US and federal lands in the western US. H.R. 2454, the American Clean Energy and Security Act, aims to broaden the definition of renewable biomass to include material removed from federal lands. Forest biomass must be condensed through chipping, grinding, or bundling, with chipping being the most efficient method. Bundling is the least efficient but allows for storage up to nine months with minimal loss. In establishing commercial-scale cellulosic biofuels plants, knowledge of feedstock supply is crucial. Supply estimates are based on potential rather than past experience. Biomass types are expected from different regions in the US, with the eastern half offering more variety. Biomass distribution is dense in the upper Midwest, Delta, Southeast, and Pacific Coast. Storage of bundles can last up to nine months with minimal loss. A 2005 study by the DOE and USDA estimated that forest and agricultural land in the US could produce over 1.3 billion tons of biomass per year, with agricultural residues contributing 428 million tons, perennial crops 377 million tons, and forestlands 368 million tons. This study raised concerns about the accuracy of its optimistic estimations. The Billion-Ton Study raised concerns about the accuracy of its estimations regarding biofuel feedstock availability. It is being updated with a release scheduled for the end of 2010. The study predicts that crop residues, perennial grasses, and forest residues will account for most biofuels production. In contrast, the National Academy of Sciences found that 416 million tons of biomass could be sustainably harvested for biofuel production in 2008, increasing to 548 million tons by 2020. By 2022, agricultural residues, forestry biomass, urban waste, and dedicated energy crops are expected to produce a total of 16 billion gallons of cellulosic ethanol. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates that corn stover will contribute 4.9 billion gallons, with a conversion yield of 92.3 gallons per dry ton. This would require 53 million dry tons of corn stover from 26.5 million acres of corn. A study projected an increase in logging residues by 1.6% by 2010 and 5.1% by 2020. Another study found that cropland and idled land could provide up to 92.6 million acres for growing switchgrass and Miscanthus for biofuels, potentially producing 17 to 53 billion gallons of ethanol. BP plans to use only dedicated crops for biofuel production. BP, a major biofuel player in the oil industry, plans to use dedicated crops for biofuel production due to their potential for achieving production scale. Plant location decisions may be influenced by factors such as feedstock availability, plant construction, and fuel distribution. Participation rates of landowners and producers in supplying biomass to cellulosic biofuel plants are crucial, with studies suggesting rates ranging from 30% to 80%. Participation rates depend on factors like plant size, biomass price, harvesting costs, and contract terms. Feedstock yields for biofuel production have uncertainties due to factors like weather conditions, soil characteristics, and water availability. The availability of corn stover is dependent on corn yield, with a one-to-one ratio between stover and grain. The yield of corn stover can be calculated based on grain yield and moisture content. The moisture content of corn stover can be estimated based on grain moisture and days after maturity. Stover availability per acre varies with grain yields, with stover moisture declining faster than grain moisture post-maturity. A stover-to-grain ratio above 18% moisture may result in a more realistic yield calculation. Corn stover availability is a function of corn yield, and removable stover depends on the removal rate. Overall, predicting the removable corn stover yield is challenging as it varies based on corn yield and removal rate. High grain yield areas will also have high residue yields, but the amount removed depends on the producer's ability to harvest while maintaining soil quality. Perennial grasses may have lower yields initially, with the possibility of dormant seeds requiring replanting, doubling establishment costs and delaying peak yield. Grass yields are higher in regions with high temperatures. Forest residue yields are influenced by conventional logging, with 20% to 40% of initial yield recoverable as additional residue. Biomass yield estimates vary based on geographic region, weather conditions, soil types, and producer expertise. Collection technology and resources impact the amount of residue collected. The production costs of different types of biomass can vary for various reasons, including location, timing, and yield. Studies estimate that corn stover can provide up to 5 tons per acre, switchgrass yields between 3 and 6 tons per acre, miscanthus averages about 13 tons per acre, short-rotation woody crops yield 2 to 5 tons per acre per year, and forest residue yields are calculated as a percentage of the forest stand yield. Explicitly identifying the factors influencing cost studies is crucial for accurate calculations. Corn stover production costs primarily include collection after corn grain harvest and nutrient replacement. It is a less expensive biomass feedstock as it is a byproduct. Fertilizer costs will increase with energy costs, impacting the cost of corn stover. Depending on the amount of stover removed after harvest, additional nutrients will need to be added before planting the following year. The cost of corn stover production varies based on different studies, ranging from $12 to $67 per ton. Factors such as fertilizer and energy costs, nutrient replacement, storage, densification, and payment to the producer influence these costs. Recent studies show significant differences in cost estimates due to various assumptions made. The Brechbill and Tyner study allows for higher removal rates, increasing yield and decreasing per-ton costs. Eidman and Petrolia studies do not include nitrogen costs in nutrient replacement, assuming a corn-soybean rotation. They differ in stover storage methods, transportation, and densification, impacting per-ton costs. Eidman and Petrolia studies allow for densification to reduce transportation costs, while Brechbill and Tyner study did not consider this. The Brechbill and Tyner study did not account for stover being hauled in bale form, offering a payment of 15% of production costs, approximately $5 per dry ton for corn stover. Eidman and Petrolia studies pay $20 per dry ton. Differences in total costs can be attributed to factors like land rent, establishment, maintenance, harvest, and storage in switchgrass studies. Perennial grasses production costs include one-time establishment and annual maintenance costs, with yields taking up to three years to peak, resulting in high initial costs and low benefits. Growing perennial grasses involves a long-term commitment of resources, with annual harvesting for the life of the stand. Production costs for switchgrass range from $23 to $114 per ton, depending on factors like yield and land rent assumptions. Miscanthus production cost estimates from a study at the University of Illinois are also listed. The University of Illinois conducted a study on Miscanthus production costs, finding it to be around $38 per ton, closer to corn stover estimates than switchgrass. The main difference is the higher yields of Miscanthus, leading to lower costs per ton. Production costs for short-rotation woody crops are mainly incurred in site preparation, establishment, and harvest years, with total costs depending on yield and land type. The costs associated with processing forest residues from the forest include capital investments estimated between $800,000 and $1,200,000. A study from Minnesota found the delivered cost of hardwood residue to be $40.37 per dry ton. The Idaho National Laboratory and the National Academy of Sciences released studies in 2009 that provide a comprehensive assessment of feedstock costs, looking at different supply systems. Table 9 compares cost estimates for conventional production processes using non-uniform feedstocks like corn stover and switchgrass. Switchgrass costs approximately $50 per dry ton, while corn stover costs about $55 per dry ton. The National Academy of Sciences report estimates biofuel feedstock costs based on literature parameters and industry demand expectations. These estimates reflect the willingness-to-accept price for the last delivered dry ton of biomass, representing the marginal cost of production. Each additional ton of biomass incurs higher costs due to an upward sloping marginal cost curve. The National Academy of Sciences panel expects feedstock costs to decrease over time with improvements in crop yields, land management, and logistics. The industry demands 500 million tons of biomass per year, leading to a 35 billion gallon cellulosic biofuel industry with larger plant capacities and biomass sourced from further distances. The National Academy of Sciences study analyzed feedstock costs for various biomass sources like corn stover, switchgrass, Miscanthus, prairie grasses, woody biomass, and wheat straw. The total costs are higher than expected, with breakdowns for establishment, seeding, harvesting, storage, transportation, and other factors presented in tables. The study anticipates cost reductions over time due to improved crop yields and logistics to meet the industry's demand for 500 million tons of biomass annually. The cost estimates for corn stover in the National Academy study include low, baseline, and high scenarios, with the baseline estimate as the midpoint. The 50% low and 50% high estimates are considered a more reasonable range. Corn stover costs can be compared to other biomass sources like switchgrass and Miscanthus. The highest nutrient replacement value in the literature is $15 per ton, while the highest harvest cost is around $35 per ton. Corn stover costs are assumed to be slightly higher than switchgrass and Miscanthus due to additional labor, but this may be an overstatement. Land rent costs for corn stover may not be applicable as it is a byproduct of corn. Perennial grasses are expected to be planted on marginal or pasture land with lower land rents. The land rent costs for biomass feedstocks are high, while storage costs are within expected ranges. Transportation costs may be higher for biomass with low energy density, requiring more truckloads and potentially straining rural infrastructure. Processing biomass before plant delivery can help mitigate these challenges. Processing biomass before plant delivery can increase density, reducing transportation costs and improving handling. However, densification costs may outweigh savings, especially if not done immediately after harvest. Low energy density requires a large volume of biomass for plant operation, such as a 50 million gallon per year ethanol plant needing a 90-feet-high pile of corn stover covering 100 acres for a year. The timing of biomass harvest for different feedstocks can impact storage and transportation efficiency. Short-rotation woody crops can be harvested year-round, while corn stover should be harvested within three weeks after corn harvest. Perennial grasses have their own harvesting requirements. Perennial grasses have longer harvest windows, up to 8 months depending on location, and must be harvested after the first frost for nitrogen retention. Corn stover harvest is concentrated in a short period, requiring long-term storage until needed for biofuels plants running year-round. Storage infrastructure for dense crops like grains is available on larger farms and centralized facilities. Corn can be dried and stored for an extended period. Forest biomass can be stored on the stump until needed and harvested year-round. Harvesting agricultural residues and perennial grasses may not coincide with biomass demand, requiring tailored transportation and delivery. On-site storage is necessary, with conditions varying by producer and region. Outdoor storage can lead to dry matter loss in biomass. Outdoor storage of biomass can lead to dry matter loss, with storage conditions depending on humidity and precipitation levels. Producers are expected to store their own biomass until needed by the plant, which could be months after harvesting. The packaging method for baled biomass can also affect dry matter loss. Ideally, corn stover bales should be stored on a site with good drainage, a concrete or gravel surface, and under cover or inside if not wrapped with plastic. Storage costs vary based on conditions, dry matter loss assumptions, storage location, and form of storage. The cost of storing biomass varies depending on the method used. For corn stover, storage adds $7 to $13 per dry ton. Round bales are cheaper to store at $2 per ton compared to square bales at $8 per ton. Round bales have lower dry matter loss and can be stored for up to six months with less than 5% loss. Rectangular bales reduce harvest and storage costs but have higher dry matter losses. A combination of both types may be the optimal solution. Research suggests using rectangular bales for immediate biomass processing and round bales with tarps for long-term storage. New storage systems are being developed to keep biomass wet, reducing dry matter loss to less than 5%. Advantages include compact storage, softening biomass, and lower fire risks. To maintain biomass quality, it is important to control moisture levels. Different types of biomass have varying moisture content, with wood needing to be below 65% moisture for efficient use as fuel. Forest residues typically have 40-60% moisture, while primary mill residues have around 20% and secondary mill residues less than 10%. Inconsistent biomass quality can affect its usability. Biomass feedstocks can vary in quality and characteristics, requiring uniform processing to optimize conversion. A uniform feedstock reduces processing costs and can potentially undergo pre-treatment before reaching the plant, streamlining the production process. The production of cellulosic feedstocks for biofuels faces challenges in harvesting, storage, and transportation. Uniform processing of biomass feedstocks is essential to optimize conversion and reduce costs. Producers lack experience in handling feedstocks, leading to uncertainties in farm-gate feedstock costs. Improved practices are needed to enhance the efficiency of feedstock supply chains. The choice of feedstock for cellulosic biofuels depends on plant location and local supply availability. Biochemical and thermochemical conversion methods are being researched, but commercialization is slow due to cost and scale challenges. The biochemical conversion process for cellulosic biofuels involves breaking down plants into sugars using enzymes or acids, which are then fermented into liquid fuel. This process has attracted the most attention due to its similarities to ethanol production from corn grain. Various research and development efforts are ongoing to improve efficiency in conversion processes. The feedstock for cellulosic biofuels is pretreated to separate cellulose and hemicellulose from lignin. Lignin cannot be converted into liquid fuel but can be recovered for later use. Reducing lignin content or modifying it can enhance hydrolysis effectiveness and reduce pretreatment inputs. A flexible pretreatment system should maximize sugar recovery and simplify the overall process to reduce costs. Pretreatment processes for biomass aim to be flexible, utilize various feedstocks, and minimize enzyme usage. Biological pretreatment with fungi alters feedstock composition but is slow for commercial use. Physical pretreatment breaks down structure to increase surface area for enzyme action. Chemical pretreatment is not yet viable due to high energy inputs. Combination pretreatments using physical and chemical processes are being explored as a more cost-effective option for breaking down biomass structure. Enzymatic hydrolysis is preferred over acid hydrolysis for commercialization due to its faster and more economical process of breaking down sugar molecules into glucose and xylose. Enzymatic hydrolysis is more efficient than acid hydrolysis, especially for lignocellulosic biomass. The presence of lignin can reduce the yield of simple sugars from hydrolysis, as it hinders enzyme activity. New catalysts are being researched to address this issue, and changing lignin characteristics may improve compatibility with the hydrolysis process. Enzymatic hydrolysis costs have decreased over time, but cost reduction remains a hurdle to commercialization. In 2009, enzymes cost about 50 cents per gallon, expected to be 44 cents per gallon by 2015. Fermentation is used to convert simple sugars into liquid fuel, with hexoses fermented easily by traditional yeast strains. Pentoses, like xylose, require research for improved fermentation. A yeast microorganism from Purdue University can ferment both pentoses and hexoses, increasing ethanol yield by 40% and reducing costs. Distillation is used to achieve a 95% pure form of liquid fuel after fermentation, with recovered lignin being burned to generate electricity. Research is focused on reducing lignin in biomass to decrease the need for pretreatment. Areas for improvement in the biochemical process include pretreatment, hydrolysis, and fermentation. Research is needed to reduce enzyme costs and improve efficiency by identifying inhibitors. Research is needed to identify inhibitors that block biomass breakdown into sugars, improve lignin resistance to enzymes, and develop a microorganism for efficient fermentation of both five and six carbon sugars. Combining pretreatment, hydrolysis, and fermentation steps is crucial for cost reduction. Thermochemical conversion processes like gasification and pyrolysis are established for converting biomass into liquid fuels. Thermochemical conversion processes like gasification and pyrolysis can convert biomass into liquid fuels. Gasification involves partial combustion of biomass feedstock to produce synthesis gas, which is then converted into liquid fuels using the Fischer-Tropsch process. Pyrolysis produces liquid bio-oil that can be used directly as fuel or converted into other types of fuel. Drying biomass to 20% moisture or less is necessary before gasification, with research focused on improving drying technologies for more efficient processes. Gasification is an anaerobic process that converts biomass into synthesis gas, a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. Despite being a technology in use, improvements are needed to clean up impurities in the synthesis gas for the Fischer-Tropsch process. Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, dating back to the 1920s, creates liquid fuel from coal. However, further development is required for gasification to be commercially viable for liquid fuel production. Oil companies have Fischer-Tropsch synthesis as a backup plan if gasoline prices rise. Pyrolysis is a biomass conversion process that produces bio-oil at high temperatures without oxygen. The bio-oil, similar to crude oil, needs refining into biofuels. Fast pyrolysis is preferred due to its quick process, but stabilizing the pyrolysis oil for conversion remains a challenge. Pyrolysis is a thermochemical technology used to convert biomass into bio-oil without oxygen. The main challenges include stabilizing the bio-oil for conversion into liquid fuels, addressing excess tar production, and improving biofuel yield per ton of feedstock. The Department of Energy Biomass Program's Theoretical Ethanol Yield Calculator estimates theoretical yields for corn stover, switchgrass, and forest thinning at 113, 97, and 82 gallons per dry ton, respectively. The production of cellulosic biofuels is still in its early stages, with uncertain total costs and a focus on cost reduction. Recent studies provide estimates for capital and operating costs per gallon for biochemical and thermochemical conversion technologies. There is no significant economic difference between the two methods. There is no distinct economic difference between biochemical and thermochemical conversion for cellulosic ethanol production. Herbaceous feedstocks are better suited for biochemical conversion, while woody biomass is better suited for thermochemical conversion. Currently, there are no commercial cellulosic biofuel plants in the United States, with 25 operational pilot and demonstration plants as of April 2009. These plants use various feedstocks including corn stover, switchgrass, wood residues, and municipal solid waste. Three plants using various feedstocks like sugarcane bagasse, switchgrass, wood residues, paper waste, and municipal solid waste are under construction for ethanol production. Despite delays, they aim to produce over 10 million gallons annually. Proposed ethanol plants in the US and Canada decreased from 118 in 2008 to 70 in 2009, with 30 planning to use cellulosic feedstocks for a potential production of one billion gallons per year. The decline in proposed biofuels plants from 2008 to 2009 indicates uncertainty in construction and commercialization timelines due to financial challenges and fluctuating oil and corn prices. The Department of Energy allocated over $800 million for biofuels research from 2002 to 2008, with an additional $786.5 million from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for commercial bio-refineries. Several cellulosic ethanol plants are in the planning stages, with 16 planned and 22 proposed plants having a total annual production capacity of 639 million gallons. Some plants receiving DOE or USDA support have faced delays or cancellations in construction plans. BP and DuPont are collaborating on biobutanol research. BP and DuPont have partnered to research and develop biobutanol as a transportation fuel. Biobutanol, with an energy content close to gasoline, can be produced from both first and second generation feedstocks. It can be easily blended with gasoline at higher concentrations, making it a preferred fuel over ethanol. The partnership is working on a demonstration plant and aims to have its first commercial plant operational by 2013. Researchers at Purdue University have developed new thermochemical processes to increase biofuel production efficiency from cellulosic biomass by adding externally produced hydrogen. This could potentially triple the biofuel output from the same amount of biomass. To commercialize cellulosic biofuels, the cost of conversion per gallon must be reduced, and a cost-effective source of hydrogen, such as nuclear, wind, or solar power for the long term and natural gas for the short term, must be secured. The development of cellulosic biofuels focuses on increasing efficiency and reducing costs through biochemical and thermochemical conversion technologies. Challenges include breaking down sugars in feedstocks and high enzyme costs for biochemical conversion, while thermochemical conversion faces barriers like higher capital costs. Funding from DOE and USDA supports new cellulosic plants, but the ultimate test lies in reducing feedstock and conversion costs. The final chapter of the report discusses government policies impacting the progress of cellulosic biofuels, including the Renewable Fuel Standard and the Biomass Crop Assistance Program. It also covers the blend wall's impact on biofuel growth in the US and potential solutions. A comparison of fixed and variable biofuels subsidies is provided, along with an evaluation of their effects using a cost model for biochemical and thermochemical conversion processes. The United States has been the leading producer of ethanol since 2005, surpassing Brazil. The biofuels industry started with corn-based ethanol in the late 1970s and grew slowly until the oil price increase in 2005. Ethanol blending has been subsidized with a tax credit of 40-60 cents per gallon. Policies like mandates for oxygenates in gasoline and the blending tax credit have promoted the growth of U.S. corn ethanol. The U.S. corn ethanol industry experienced steady growth with $20 oil prices and government subsidies. In 2004, higher oil prices led to a boom in the industry, resulting in large profits and increased investments in new plants. The price relationship between ethanol and gasoline became more volatile as ethanol quantity on the market increased. The corn ethanol industry faced economic difficulties starting in 2008 due to surging corn prices, leading to shutdown of production capacity. Despite a decrease in corn prices, capacity remained low due to the blend wall limit. Ethanol prices were forced down to break-even with corn prices. The industry saw some improvement in late 2009 and early 2010 but returned to operating at the blend wall in spring 2010. The future of cellulosic biofuels remains uncertain. The future of cellulosic biofuels and profitability depend on cost reductions in feedstock production and conversion technology. Economic situation and policies will determine commercialization, similar to corn ethanol. The blend wall limits ethanol blending in national fuel supply to 10%, with a recent modification allowing 15% blends for newer vehicles. The maximum amount of ethanol that can be blended to make E10 is 14 billion gallons, which is around 9% of gasoline consumption. Challenges in achieving this include lower blending limits in California, limited blending in the South due to higher evaporative emissions, and distribution issues to some regions. Despite a slight increase in gasoline use over the past 15 years, ethanol consumption has significantly risen, especially in the last five years. Ethanol consumption has increased significantly in the past 15 years, with a notable rise in the last five years. Despite the potential for increased ethanol use with E85, the limited availability of E85 pumps and low adoption of flexible fuel vehicles (FFVs) hinder its widespread use. Only about 3% of vehicles in the US are FFVs, and less than 0.5% of total gasoline consumption is in the form of E85. Increasing the use of E85 would require strong government intervention to address the blend wall challenge. The blend wall challenge can be addressed by increasing the ethanol blend rate in conventional vehicles to 15% or 20%. Tests are being conducted to determine compatibility with current vehicles, but there are concerns about warranties being voided. Current gasoline dispensing equipment can handle blends up to 15% ethanol, but E15 may pose risks to existing infrastructure. Ethanol producers have applied for a waiver to address these issues. In March 2009, Growth Energy applied for an EPA waiver to increase ethanol blending from 10% to 15%. On October 13, 2010, EPA issued a partial waiver for E15 use in model year 2007 or newer light-duty vehicles. No waiver was granted for older vehicles, motorcycles, heavy-duty vehicles, or non-road engines. Approval from states and infrastructure changes are needed before E15 can be sold at gas stations. The approval for E15 blending in newer vehicles may be limited by infrastructure changes. The blend wall, currently at 10%, could hinder the development of cellulosic biofuels industry. The Renewable Fuel Standard may need to be revised due to mandated biofuels amounts exceeding blending capacity. The blend wall constrains the market's ability to absorb ethanol. The blend wall limits ethanol demand, causing excess supply and low prices. Some U.S. ethanol capacity shut down in 2008-2010 due to this. A fixed subsidy increases ethanol demand. The blend wall limits ethanol demand, causing excess supply and low prices. With the subsidy, the demand curve becomes vertical at the blend wall quantity (Q BW). If the EPA maintains the blend level at 10%, cellulose ethanol investment would be unlikely due to the lower cost of corn ethanol. Cellulosic-based biofuels like bio-butanol could be developed as they are not affected by the blend wall. Even if the blending limit is increased to 15%, there may not be much room for cellulose ethanol. Corn and sugarcane ethanol could sum up to 19 billion gallons, which is the effective blend wall at 15% blending. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) was established in 2005, requiring the use of renewable fuels starting at 4 billion gallons in 2006 and increasing to 7.5 billion gallons by 2012. The RFS was expanded in 2007, with a requirement of 9 billion gallons in 2008 and reaching 36 billion gallons by 2022. Different types of fuels have specific mandates within the total requirement. The updated Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) limits corn-based biofuel production to qualify under the mandate, with a cap of 15 billion gallons by 2015. New corn-based ethanol refineries must reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% compared to conventional gasoline. Existing plants are grandfathered in, making up most of the 15-billion-gallon requirement. In 2010, the EPA ruled that new corn-based ethanol plants must reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20%. The remaining fuel to meet the mandate must come from advanced biofuels, which must achieve a 50% reduction in GHG emissions compared to conventional gasoline. Cellulosic advanced biofuels must achieve a 60% reduction in GHG emissions and may be reduced by 10% if initial requirements are not feasible. EPA determined that all evaluated biofuels meet the GHG thresholds. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) can be either non-binding or binding, with different market effects. A non-binding RFS will not affect quantity or price if the required amount is below market equilibrium. The presence of the RFS will cause some demand curve to become vertical, impacting quantity and price based on RFS quantity compared to market demand. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) can be either non-binding or binding. A binding RFS will decrease market equilibrium quantity and increase ethanol price. Supporters believe RFS encourages investment in technology and reduces dependence on imported oil. Critics argue it may hinder other alternative energy technologies. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) promotes renewable fuels but may hinder other alternative energy technologies. Improvements in fuel efficiency mandated by the government could make meeting the RFS more challenging. The RFS is based on renewable fuel use at specific levels, not as a share of overall fuel use. The EPA converted the RFS from a volumetric to an energy basis in 2010. The EPA converted the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) from a volumetric to an energy basis in 2010, setting a target of 36 billion gallons of ethanol equivalent by 2022. The EU 2020 target requires 20% of liquid fuels to be renewable based on energy content. The Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP) was established in 2008 to support biomass production financially. The Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP) provides financial support for biomass producers near biomass facilities. Over $243 million has been paid out to participants, with up to 75% of costs covered for establishing eligible biomass crops. Government payments are capped at $45/ton, with matching funds available for collection, harvest, storage, and transportation. The program has a spending limit of $552 million in FY2010 and $432 million in FY2011. Applications are open for conversion facilities to qualify for BCAP. The federal subsidies for ethanol include a tax credit of 40-60 cents per gallon, initially introduced in 1978. The credit was changed to a blender's tax credit in 2004, extended through 2010 in the 2008 farm bill. The credit was reduced to $0.45 per gallon in 2009, with an additional $0.10 per gallon for small producers. The 2008 farm bill introduced a tax credit of $1.01 per gallon for cellulosic biofuels, set to expire in 2012. U.S. ethanol production has increased since 2005, leading to significant federal costs in the form of tax credits. In 2009, biofuels subsidies cost nearly $5.9 billion, projected to reach $27 billion by 2022 if all tax credits are extended. The biofuels tax credits have been available even during periods of extreme profitability. Economists and federal budget watchdogs are interested in substituting a variable subsidy for the fixed subsidy to lower government costs while supporting the biofuels industry. Unlike a fixed subsidy, a variable subsidy adjusts its value depending on the current price of oil. At high oil prices, no subsidy is available, but as prices fall, the variable subsidy kicks in and increases in value. Variable subsidies in the ethanol industry are linked to petroleum prices, unlike fixed subsidies. They adjust based on oil prices, making biofuel production profitable when oil prices are high and challenging when prices are low. This approach reduces government costs by only paying large subsidies when necessary. Variable subsidies in the biofuels industry are tied to oil prices, ensuring competitiveness. The subsidy amount is triggered by a designated oil price, increasing as oil prices drop below this threshold. This system provides stability for biofuels producers during low oil price periods and allows market forces to dictate production during high oil price periods. The variable subsidy in the biofuels industry is designed to drive production without government intervention during high oil prices. An analysis found that the variable subsidy could decrease risk for producers compared to a fixed subsidy. The comparison between variable and fixed tax-credit subsidies is made for Congress' understanding, not as a policy recommendation. The price of ethanol can be compared to gasoline based on energy-equivalent or volumetric basis, with different results due to ethanol's lower energy content. On a volumetric basis, the price of ethanol is equivalent to gasoline, but on an energy-equivalent basis, ethanol is only about 67% of the price of gasoline. As ethanol blending increases in the future, pricing will likely shift to be more based on energy content. For example, E85, with an 85% blending rate, is expected to have 22% lower mileage than E10 due to energy content differences. The analysis considers cases where thermochemically-produced biofuels receive a subsidy 49% greater than ethanol on an energy-equivalent basis. Breakeven oil prices are calculated for biofuels pricing methods with and without fixed subsidies, for all processing technologies. Ethanol pricing is expected to shift towards energy content as blending increases in the future. When comparing different biofuel processing technologies, grain-based ethanol and biochemical conversion have lower breakeven oil prices than thermochemical conversion, especially when priced on an energy-equivalent basis. Thermochemical conversion may have a better chance of competing under energy-equivalent pricing. Including a fixed subsidy when calculating plant NPV results in lower breakeven oil prices for all cases. The plant NPV and breakeven oil price decrease with a subsidy passed on to the biofuel producer. Ethanol pricing does not impact thermochemical conversion, but an energy-equivalent subsidy could make thermochemical products competitive. A deterministic model evaluates biofuels profitability under different pricing methods, with grain ethanol showing profitability even under volumetric pricing. The profitability of biofuels made from cellulosic biomass is currently based on volumetric pricing, with a fixed subsidy of $1.01 per gallon. There is uncertainty whether pricing and subsidies will shift to an energy-equivalent basis in the future. Stochastic model simulations are used to evaluate a variable subsidy that adjusts based on market conditions, providing more support at low oil prices and reducing the subsidy at higher oil prices. The profitability of cellulosic biofuels is currently based on volumetric pricing with a fixed subsidy. A variable subsidy model is being considered, where subsidies adjust based on market conditions to reduce losses for firms and government subsidies. However, there may be a slight drop in NPV compared to fixed subsidies, and more research is needed to define an effective variable subsidy structure. Tables 23, 24, and 25 provide stochastic means and standard deviations for profitability under uncertain conditions. Tables 23, 24, and 25 present stochastic means and standard deviations for the net present value (NPV), probability of loss, and coefficient of variation with fixed subsidies for different oil price forecast scenarios. NPV comparisons are expressed per gallon of annual capacity for corn ethanol and other technologies. The tables also compare Subsidy Cost, Tax Revenue, and Net Government Cost for each scenario. Government measures are expressed as NPV per gallon of annual capacity, showing positive profits with high oil prices forecasted. Profitability decreases with lower oil prices and different pricing methods. Only grain ethanol with volumetric pricing is profitable under low oil price forecasts and fixed subsidies. The middle oil price forecast scenario suggests that ethanol and biofuels priced to compete with oil and gasoline could become more profitable. However, there is still a risk of negative profits in most cases. Grain ethanol priced volumetrically is the most likely to ensure profits. If oil prices follow the high-level forecast, most alternative biofuel technologies will be profitable due to higher oil-induced revenues. Comparing a fixed versus a variable subsidy is only meaningful in this context. When comparing fixed and variable subsidies for grain ethanol under volumetric pricing, it is found that a variable subsidy reduces the risk of loss for firms and lowers government costs, regardless of oil price scenarios. This risk-reducing effect is significant and beneficial for both parties involved. Variable subsidies can reduce risk for firms by lowering the standard deviation of net present value and cost to the government compared to fixed subsidies. Pricing biofuels based on energy content may favor thermochemical conversion as the least expensive option. However, volumetric pricing may undervalue biofuels with higher energy content from thermochemical conversion. The conclusions are based on assumptions and data from the literature. The numbers in this study are based on literature, but there could be new technologies with better costs and conversion rates."
