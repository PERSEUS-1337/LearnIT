    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Prosthetic and Custom Orthotic Parity Act of 2009\". Congress finds that there are over 1.8 million people in the US living with limb loss, with over 130,000 undergoing amputation annually. Military personnel have also suffered traumatic injuries leading to amputation. The number of amputations is expected to rise due to diabetes and other illnesses. Amputees can regain productivity with prosthetic devices, but insurance reimbursement is being limited. Insurance companies are limiting reimbursement for prosthetic equipment costs, shifting the burden onto Medicare and Medicaid. Eleven states have enacted prosthetic parity legislation, with 30 states actively considering it. States with these laws have seen minimal impact on insurance premiums and reduced costs for Medicare and Medicaid. Prosthetic parity legislation does not increase government size or costs for Medicare and Medicaid programs. Prosthetic parity legislation in states has led to amputees returning to productive lives, saving state funds, and benefiting the health insurance industry. Spina bifida affects 7 out of every 10,000 live births in the US. Custom prosthetic services help children with spina bifida return to their preexisting work quickly. Custom orthotic devices have a significant impact on children with spina bifida and cerebral palsy, improving their mobility, muscle strength, and overall quality of life. These devices help maintain functionality and independence, allowing them to be productive members of the community. The purpose of this Act is to require group health plans to provide coverage for prosthetic and custom orthotic devices on par with other medical benefits, to help children with cerebral palsy achieve maximum potential in growth and development. Group health plans must provide coverage for prosthetic and custom orthotic devices on par with other medical benefits, ensuring no less favorable terms and conditions. SEC. 715 of ERISA mandates equal coverage for prosthetics and custom orthotic devices in group health plans. Group health plans must provide prosthetic devices and custom orthotic devices under terms no less favorable than other medical and surgical benefits. Financial requirements for these devices cannot be separate. Requirements for prosthetic devices and custom orthotic devices under a group health plan must not be more restrictive than those for other medical and surgical benefits. Financial and treatment limitations must be no more restrictive than those for substantially all benefits provided under the plan. Requirements for prosthetic devices and custom orthotic devices under a group health plan must not be more restrictive than those for other medical and surgical benefits. This applies separately to in-network and out-of-network benefits. The group health plan must not restrict prosthetic devices and custom orthotic devices more than other medical benefits, for both in-network and out-of-network services. Prior authorization for these devices must be consistent with authorization for similar benefits under the plan. Benefits for prosthetic devices and custom orthotic devices under this section are limited to the most appropriate model determined by the treating physician. Coverage includes repair or replacement if deemed necessary by the physician. Annual or lifetime dollar limitations are not allowed for group health plans. Benefits for prosthetic devices and custom orthotic devices must not have annual or lifetime dollar limits unless they apply to all medical benefits. Definitions include prosthetic devices for limb replacement and custom orthotic devices and services. The term 'custom orthotic devices and related services' refers to custom-fabricated orthotics individually made for a specific patient, along with all necessary services and supplies for effective use, including design, fabrication, measurements, fittings, and patient instruction. These devices are unique to each patient and are based on clinically derived measurements and images of the body part. The fabrication process for custom-fabricated orthotic devices involves using basic materials like plastic, metal, leather, or cloth in various forms. It includes vacuum forming, cutting, bending, molding, sewing, drilling, and finishing before fitting on the patient. These devices can only be provided by a certified practitioner or accredited supplier in orthotics and/or prosthetics. Codes for custom-fitted high orthotics and related services are detailed in Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Transmittal 656. These services include prefabricated devices adapted and configured for a specific patient, along with necessary supplies for effective use. This involves design, fabrication, measurements, fittings, and patient instruction. Custom-fitted high orthotics and related services are provided by certified practitioners or accredited suppliers. Financial requirements include deductibles, coinsurance, co-payments, and limitations on total payments. Treatment limitations under the Act include restrictions on frequency, visits, coverage days, or duration of treatment. The amendments made by this section regarding prosthetics and custom orthotic device parity apply to group health plans for plan years starting after the enactment of this Act. Federal administrative responsibilities are outlined in Section 4. The Secretary of Labor provides assistance to plan participants and beneficiaries for compliance with the requirements of this section. Random audits of group health plans are conducted to ensure compliance. A study evaluates the impact of the amendments on the cost and access to health insurance coverage. The Comptroller General will conduct a study on the impact of the amendments on health care quality, benefits, prosthetic devices coverage, and cost to group health plans. A report will be submitted to Congress within 2 years. The Secretary of Labor will issue final regulations within 1 year to implement the Act and its amendments."
