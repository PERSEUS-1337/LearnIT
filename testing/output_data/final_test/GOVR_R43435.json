Violators may face federal criminal prosecution and additional consequences such as property confiscation, job loss, and loss of tax benefits. Despite federal laws, over 20 states have established medical marijuana regulations, with four legalizing marijuana for recreational use. State officials lack the authority to override federal laws. Federal law classifies marijuana as a Schedule I Controlled Substance, making it a federal crime to grow, sell, or possess the drug. State officials lack the constitutional authority to override conflicting federal laws, while federal officials lack the resources to override conflicting state laws. Congress established regulations on controlled substances with the Harrison Narcotics Act of 1914 and the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937, using its power to tax, regulate commerce, and implement treaty obligations. The Marihuana Act, similar to the Harrison Act, imposed penalties on those involved with marijuana but was later found to serve no revenue purpose and was solely a criminal law. The Supreme Court highlighted Fifth Amendment issues with tax-based enforcement structures like those of the Harrison and Marihuana Tax Acts in the late 1960s. The Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination provides a defense to charges related to unregistered firearms and transporting marijuana without paying the transfer tax. This led to the development of the Controlled Substances Act, which classified marijuana as a Schedule I substance but with less severe penalties compared to LSD and heroin offenses. The severity of penalties for marihuana-related offenses, compared to LSD and heroin offenses, is seen as inequitable. Despite evidence showing marihuana is less harmful, penalties remain strict. Longer sentences have not reduced drug violations, with marihuana violations doubling in the last 2 years. This has led to a clash between the youth generation and the Government. The clash between the youth generation and the Government over marihuana laws has led to calls for a study commission to address the issue. The commission recommended legalizing possession for personal use while keeping the Controlled Substance Act unchanged. Congress enacted the CSA in 1970 to regulate controlled substances for medical and research purposes. The Controlled Substance Act (CSA) regulates the distribution and use of controlled substances for medical, scientific, research, and industrial purposes to prevent illegal diversion. Substances are classified into five schedules based on medical use, abuse potential, and safety. Schedule I substances have no accepted medical use, while Schedules II-V have recognized medical uses. Those handling controlled substances must register with the DEA. Under the Controlled Substance Act (CSA), registrants must adhere to strict requirements for handling controlled substances to prevent theft and diversion. Schedule I drugs, with high abuse potential and no accepted medical use, can only be used for government-approved research. Only DEA-licensed doctors can prescribe Schedule II-V substances to patients. Federal regulations under the Controlled Substance Act (CSA) govern the issuance of lawful prescriptions for controlled substances. The CSA provides a framework for controlling, decontrolling, and rescheduling substances. Rulemaking proceedings to change a drug's schedule can be initiated by the DEA, HHS, or through petition. Rescheduling marijuana has been largely unsuccessful. Congress can also change a drug's scheduling status through legislation, with civil and criminal penalties for violations. When Congress enacted the CSA in 1970, marijuana was classified as a Schedule I drug, which it remains today. Unauthorized cultivation, distribution, or possession of marijuana is a federal crime, with penalties including up to one year imprisonment and a minimum fine of $1,000 for possession. Repeat offenses trigger a mandatory minimum fine of $2,500 and a minimum imprisonment term of 15 days. The Controlled Substances Act imposes strict penalties for drug offenses, with mandatory fines and imprisonment terms. Repeat drug offenses result in increased fines and longer imprisonment terms. Marijuana cultivation, distribution, or possession with intent to distribute can lead to imprisonment for five years to life. The Department of Justice may use civil forfeiture provisions to disrupt marijuana dispensaries. The civil forfeiture provisions of the Controlled Substances Act are used to disrupt marijuana dispensaries and production facilities by confiscating property without the need for criminal charges against the owner. Civil forfeiture is a penalty where property is seized and forfeited to the government, regardless of the guilt or innocence of the property owner. The civil forfeiture provisions of the Controlled Substances Act allow for the seizure and forfeiture of property connected to illegal activities without the need for criminal charges. Property subject to forfeiture includes proceeds of illegal activities and any property used to facilitate the crime. Section 511 of the CSA authorizes the Attorney General to seize a wide array of property associated with violations of the Act. The civil forfeiture provisions of the Controlled Substances Act allow for the seizure and forfeiture of property connected to illegal activities without the need for criminal charges. The government can seize property like equipment, firearms, money, transportation, or real property used in violation of federal law. The Attorney General can destroy seized controlled substances and sell other forfeited property. Excess funds from forfeiture proceedings go to the DOJ Asset Forfeiture Fund. Forfeiture proceedings are less resource-intensive than criminal prosecutions and have been used against medical marijuana dispensaries. DOJ can seize and liquidate property associated with marijuana production, distribution, or retail sale facilities without criminal charges. The civil asset forfeiture provisions of the Controlled Substances Act allow for the seizure and forfeiture of property associated with illegal activities, including marijuana production, distribution, or retail sale facilities, without criminal charges. Many states have laws mirroring the federal Controlled Substances Act, with some decriminalizing small amounts of marijuana or legalizing possession and cultivation. Additionally, over 20 states have established medical marijuana exceptions in their state laws. More than 20 states have established state law exceptions for medical marijuana, with Colorado and Washington authorizing retail and personal growth, sale, and possession of marijuana. Alaska and Oregon have similar retail marijuana laws, but were not fully operational at the time of the report. State medical marijuana laws vary in enforcement due to individual characteristics, influenced by the Controlled Substances Act and the Conant v. Walters case from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The CSA allows the Attorney General to revoke a physician's authority to prescribe controlled substances for not complying with its demands. The Ninth Circuit ruled that doctors could be held criminally liable if they provide patients with means to acquire marijuana with specific intent. However, holding doctors responsible for patients' actions beyond what they could anticipate is not within the scope of conspiracy or aiding and abetting. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's order enjoining DEA enforcement actions related to doctor-patient discussions on medical marijuana. State laws require a doctor's recommendation, not a prescription, for medical marijuana. Registered individuals are immune from state criminal laws. Physicians can recommend medical marijuana for specific debilitating conditions like cancer, glaucoma, and HIV. The curr_chunk discusses the qualifying medical conditions for medical marijuana, including cancer, glaucoma, HIV, chronic pain, seizures, and muscle spasms. Some states aim to restrict the scope of qualifying conditions to prevent potential abuse. In many jurisdictions, medical marijuana laws restrict the amount of marijuana a patient can possess, typically less than three ounces. Caregivers must register and be designated by patients, with some laws allowing for cultivation by patients or caregivers. Most states have established regulatory schemes for dispensaries, with four states having retail marijuana regimes. Retail marijuana regimes regulate the distribution of marijuana for recreational use, sharing general patterns but also having unique characteristics. Each state has specific laws decriminalizing possession and consumption for individuals over 21, while prohibiting public consumption and driving under the influence. Washington has specific statutory authority, while Colorado allows regulatory agencies to fill in details through regulations. Washington Initiative 502 and Colorado Amendment 64 decriminalize possession and use of marijuana for individuals over 21. In Washington, individuals can possess up to one ounce of dried marijuana or marijuana-infused products, but must use it in private. Colorado allows individuals to possess and use marijuana without it being an offense under state or local law. Driving under the influence of marijuana is prohibited in both states. In Colorado, individuals 21 years or older can possess up to one ounce of marijuana or grow up to six plants for personal use. Oregon's Ballot Measure 91 decriminalizes possession of up to eight ounces of homegrown marijuana and cultivation of up to four plants for individuals over 21. Alaska law allows individuals over 21 to possess one ounce of marijuana and up to six plants, with restrictions on public consumption and cultivation. Licensing regimes are established for retail production, distribution, and sale of marijuana under recreational marijuana laws. Washington Initiative 502 addresses possession regulations. Washington Initiative 502 establishes a three-tiered licensing system overseen by the state Liquor Control Board for the production, processing, and retail sale of marijuana. It allows for legal possession, delivery, distribution, and sale of marijuana by licensed individuals, while imposing restrictions and requirements for obtaining the necessary licenses. The LCB adopted rules for implementing Initiative 502, detailing marijuana license qualifications, application process, fees, packaging restrictions, recordkeeping, security requirements, and advertising restrictions. Colorado implemented licensing standards through statutes and regulations, with the General Assembly passing three bills signed into law by the Governor. The Department of Revenue and State Licensing Authority adopted regulations for retail marijuana facilities. Alaska and Oregon have established licensing and registration regimes for recreational marijuana, with specific regulations on physical security, video surveillance, labeling, health and safety precautions, and advertising. The laws also include taxation measures on recreational marijuana. Washington and Colorado have implemented taxes on recreational marijuana sales. Washington imposes a 25% excise tax on each sale within the distribution system, while Colorado has a 25% tax on retail transactions. The revenue generated from these taxes is used for social and health services in Washington and public school construction in Colorado. Oregon Ballot Measure 91 imposes taxes on marijuana producers based on plant and product type. Revenue generated will fund enforcement of marijuana regulations and contribute to state funds like the Common School Fund. Alaska law imposes a $50 per ounce excise tax on marijuana transactions. Local governments may have the authority to regulate marijuana businesses within their jurisdictions. Local governments in Colorado, Alaska, and Oregon have the authority to regulate or prohibit marijuana businesses within their jurisdictions. Washington's laws do not clearly allow cities to ban marijuana stores, leading to uncertainty about enforcement. The Department of Justice has prosecutorial discretion in enforcing marijuana laws, as they cannot prosecute every violation of the Controlled Substances Act. Courts have recognized that the decision to prosecute is not easily reviewable and involves various factors. Through prosecutorial discretion, the DOJ can prioritize which marijuana-related activities to focus on. The Obama Administration issued four memoranda outlining their position on marijuana enforcement since 2009. The DOJ issued four memoranda since 2009 outlining the Obama Administration's stance on state-authorized marijuana activities. In 2009, Deputy Attorney General David W. Ogden advised federal prosecutors to prioritize prosecuting significant drug traffickers over individuals complying with state laws on medical marijuana. The Ogden Memorandum assured that the DOJ would not prosecute marijuana activities complying with state law, leading to an increase in medical marijuana dispensaries, particularly for chronic pain patients. The DOJ clarified in 2011 that individual medical marijuana patients would not be prosecuted, but \"commercial\" dispensaries could face federal enforcement. Cultivating, selling, or distributing marijuana, even if compliant with state law, is a violation of the CSA. The 2011 Cole Memorandum clarified that individual medical marijuana patients would not be prosecuted, but \"commercial\" dispensaries could face federal enforcement for violating the CSA. The surge in enforcement activity following the release of the memorandum caught many by surprise. Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole's 2013 memorandum provided guidance on federal enforcement of the CSA in states that have legalized marijuana for medicinal or recreational use. The DOJ's 2013 memorandum allows jurisdictions to authorize marijuana use with strict regulations to ensure public safety and health. Federal prosecutors are instructed to focus on preventing specific activities related to marijuana distribution. The 2013 DOJ memorandum advises U.S. Attorneys to target specific activities related to marijuana distribution, including revenue going to criminal enterprises, diversion to states where it is prohibited, trafficking of other drugs, violent behavior in cultivation, public health consequences, growing on public lands, and possession on federal property. Federal law enforcement is urged to prioritize enforcement regardless of state laws. The 2013 DOJ memorandum advises U.S. Attorneys to target specific activities related to marijuana distribution, including revenue going to criminal enterprises, diversion to states where it is prohibited, trafficking of other drugs, violent behavior in cultivation, public health consequences, growing on public lands, and possession on federal property. The memorandum also acknowledges a change in Administration policy regarding \"large scale, for-profit commercial enterprises\" in states with legalized marijuana activities. The 2013 DOJ memorandum advises targeting specific activities related to marijuana distribution, including revenue going to criminal enterprises, diversion to prohibited states, trafficking of other drugs, violent behavior in cultivation, public health consequences, growing on public lands, and possession on federal property. DOJ directs prosecutors not to consider the size or commercial nature of a marijuana operation alone as a proxy for assessing enforcement priorities. States with robust regulatory systems for recreational marijuana are seen as less likely to threaten federal priorities. This may impact the debate on state marijuana regulatory laws conflicting with federal law. The Oregon Supreme Court suggests that states may not authorize conduct prohibited by federal law, especially in the context of marijuana use. The 2014 Cole memorandum addressed banking and money laundering laws for marijuana establishments, emphasizing the importance of investigating offenses involving financial transactions. The preemption doctrine, based on the Supremacy Clause, dictates that federal law supersedes state laws in cases of conflict. This principle applies to the federal-state marijuana debate, where federal statutes and regulations take precedence over state laws. Congress has the authority to choose when preemption applies within its constitutional powers. Congress has the authority to choose when preemption applies within its constitutionally enumerated powers. State law must give way to federal law if it conflicts in either impossibility preemption or obstacle preemption scenarios. The determination of an obstacle for preemption is based on examining the federal statute's purpose and intended effects. The Controlled Substances Act clarifies Congress's preemptive intent, stating that federal law does not preempt state laws unless there is a direct conflict. State courts have had mixed results in addressing preemption challenges to state medical marijuana laws. Some state courts in Colorado, California, and Michigan have found that certain aspects of medical marijuana laws in those states survive preemption analysis. In a Colorado case, People v. Crouse, the court ruled that state marijuana laws only conflict with federal law when it is physically impossible to comply with both. In People v. Crouse, the court ruled that state marijuana laws do not preempt federal law under the obstacle preemption doctrine. The court found that returning marijuana to Crouse would not obstruct the CSA but would be authorized under a specific exemption for law enforcement officers. In San Diego NORML, California law required local governments to issue medical marijuana cards. The California appellate court found that the medical marijuana statute did not obstruct the CSA, as the CSA's purpose is to combat recreational drug use, not regulate medical practices. In Beek v. City of Wyoming, the Michigan Supreme Court ruled that the CSA did not preempt the Michigan Medical Marihuana Act, which allowed cultivation of marijuana for medical purposes. The Michigan Supreme Court ruled that the Michigan Medical Marihuana Act (MMMA) was not preempted by the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). The MMMA was found to be permissive and did not conflict with federal law, as it provided immunity from state law consequences without altering the federal criminalization of marijuana. The Oregon Supreme Court in Emerald Steel case interpreted obstacle preemption differently, stating that federal law preempts state law that authorizes use of medical marijuana. The decision's continued validity is uncertain, as a later case suggested the test used in Emerald Steel may have been too broad. The Oregon Supreme Court's decision in the Emerald Steel case regarding preemption of state marijuana laws may have been an overgeneralization. It should not be seen as a standalone rule, but rather as an attempt to apply federal law to a specific preemption issue. In a separate case, conflict preemption was not found to be an issue in relation to state marijuana laws. The constitutional amendments for medical marijuana and general marijuana usage clarify that they apply to state law only, without impeding federal law enforcement. The Supreme Court has ruled that Congress can outlaw marijuana cultivation and possession under the Commerce Clause, but cannot force states to comply. Litigants have used this limitation to defend against the Controlled Substances Act. Litigants have invoked limitations to shield themselves from the Controlled Substances Act, but have been unsuccessful. The Tenth Amendment argument that the Act intrudes upon state police powers has also not been successful. Various constitutional amendments and rights impose limits on legislative powers, but litigants have struggled to convince courts to grant relief. The Constitution's delegation of power to the United States overrides Tenth Amendment reservations, while Ninth Amendment and Due Process Clauses may limit government intrusion on fundamental rights. Courts have not recognized marijuana possession as a fundamental right, leading to legal challenges under due process and equal protection clauses. At the federal level, courts have rejected claims that the government is estopped from enforcing the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) due to misleading statements. Municipal zoning laws play a role in state marijuana-related due process cases, with varying laws on whether municipalities can restrict marijuana activities. Federal banking laws aim to protect financial institutions from dealing with controlled substances. The Department of Justice and the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network issued guidance on marijuana-related financial crimes, requiring banks to file suspicious activity reports for transactions involving $5,000 or more suspected of illegal activity. Failure to comply can result in imprisonment for up to five years. Banks must establish anti-money laundering programs to ensure officers can identify when to file SARs and CTRs for transactions involving $10,000 or more in cash. Failure to report can lead to imprisonment for up to five years, or up to 10 years for repeated violations or structuring transactions to avoid reporting requirements. The money laundering statutes impose criminal liability on banks, their officers, employees, and customers for marijuana-related financial transactions. Section 1957 makes it a federal crime to deposit or withdraw $10,000 or more in proceeds from marijuana distribution. Section 1956 criminalizes engaging in financial transactions with such proceeds to promote further offenses. Violations of these sections can lead to imprisonment for up to 20 years. Conspiracy and aiding and abetting carry the same maximum penalties. FinCEN guidance emphasizes banks' SAR reporting requirements and the focus on federal priorities in investigating and prosecuting financial crimes related to marijuana distribution. Violations of money laundering statutes can lead to imprisonment and confiscation of property. Banks engaging in illegal banking practices risk civil money penalties and loss of deposit insurance coverage. The FinCEN guidance highlights federal priorities for preventing illegal activities related to marijuana distribution, including preventing sales revenue from funding criminal enterprises, gangs, and cartels, and stopping the diversion of marijuana to other states. Financial institutions serving marijuana-related businesses must adhere to these priorities. Financial institutions serving marijuana-related businesses must file special SARs: a marijuana limited SAR, a marijuana priority SAR, or a marijuana termination SAR. The limited SAR is for customers not violating state laws or DOJ priorities, while the priority SAR is for those engaged in such activities. A termination SAR is filed when ending the relationship is necessary for anti-money laundering compliance. FinCEN also lists \"red flags\" for when a priority SAR is appropriate. The priority SAR is appropriate when a business cannot provide satisfactory documentation of being licensed and operating within state law, lacks evidence of legitimate outside investments, or shows signs of concealing involvement in marijuana-related activities. Negative information such as criminal records or connections to illicit activities found in publicly available sources may also trigger a priority SAR. A marijuana-related business may be flagged as a priority for suspicious activity reporting if it is involved in illicit activities, subject to enforcement actions, engages in interstate or international transactions, has owners or managers residing outside the state, operates on federal property, violates state laws regarding proximity to schools, or falsely claims to be a non-profit. A marijuana-related business may be flagged for suspicious activity if it is engaged in commercial activity inconsistent with its non-profit classification, making excessive payments to managers or employees, or using the business to launder money from criminal activities. Indicators include receiving more revenue than expected, depositing excessive cash compared to reported revenue, and being unable to comply with state law limitations. The business may be flagged for suspicious activity if it cannot prove its revenue is solely from legal marijuana sales, engages in excessive cash transactions, structures deposits to avoid reporting requirements, rapidly moves funds, receives deposits from unrelated third parties, or commingles funds with personal accounts. The FinCEN guidance highlights suspicious activity in businesses related to marijuana, including transactions on behalf of undisclosed parties and inconsistent financial statements. It also mentions the obligation to report cash transactions over $10,000. Additionally, the use of marijuana, even for medicinal purposes, can lead to adverse employment consequences, with courts upholding the right to terminate employees for medical marijuana use despite state laws. State medical marijuana laws provide immunity to users but do not grant affirmative rights against private entities. The Americans with Disabilities Act and similar anti-discrimination laws are hindered by the Controlled Substances Act. Government employees have Fourth Amendment protections, limiting the likelihood of employers discovering their marijuana use. The Fourth Amendment limits government searches, requiring reasonable suspicion or special need for employee drug testing. Some government employees undergo random drug testing due to their job duties, like those with access to sensitive information. State and local government employees in safety-sensitive roles may also be subject to drug testing. The federal Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 (DFWA) imposes a drug-free workplace requirement on federal contractors and grantees to maintain policies for a safe workplace or face consequences like loss of funding or fines. Employers without federal influence can establish their own drug-free workplace policies and terminate employees testing positive for marijuana, except in cases where medical marijuana statutes protect them. The federal Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 requires federal contractors and grantees to maintain drug-free workplace policies. Employees fired for marijuana use may be ineligible for unemployment benefits. Marijuana merchants face a federal tax disadvantage under Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code. Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code prohibits marijuana merchants from deducting operating expenses on their federal income tax, except for the cost of goods sold. This applies regardless of state laws on marijuana. Customers of medical marijuana merchants cannot deduct their purchases as medical expenses. Possessing a firearm or ammunition as an unlawful user of a controlled substance is a federal crime punishable by up to 10 years in prison. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) prohibits individuals using marijuana from possessing firearms or ammunition, regardless of state laws. Those involved in marijuana cultivation or sales may face additional firearm-related criminal liability, including mandatory imprisonment terms for providing security with a firearm. The ATF prohibits marijuana users from possessing firearms. Offenders and accomplices face mandatory imprisonment terms for firearm possession, brandishing, or discharging. Illegal drug users are ineligible for federally assisted housing, with agencies able to prohibit admission or terminate tenancy for drug use. The Department of Housing and Urban Development can deny access to federally assisted housing for individuals using marijuana, including medical marijuana. While drug testing for housing applicants is not required, the Eleventh Circuit's Lebron decision suggests preliminary testing may not be allowed without individualized justification. The American Bar Association's Model Rules of Professional Conduct prohibit lawyers from counseling clients to engage in criminal activities but allow discussing legal consequences. Some states have issued ethics opinions on conflicts between state and federal marijuana laws, with Arizona State Bar creating a \"safe harbor\" for those complying with state medical marijuana laws. The Arizona State Bar created a \"safe harbor\" for lawyers to counsel clients within the state's medical marijuana law, while Maine and Connecticut bar associations advise caution due to conflicts with federal law. The Connecticut Bar Association advises lawyers to inform clients about the state medical marijuana statute but not assist in violating federal law. The Colorado opinion provides more detailed examples of permissible legal advice regarding marijuana-related activities. The Colorado attorney may not draft contracts for marijuana activities that violate federal law. Washington State attorneys can advise on marijuana businesses as long as it complies with state law. An attorney in Washington can advise on marijuana businesses as long as it complies with state law and makes clients aware of federal regulations. Ownership of a marijuana dispensary does not automatically lead to disciplinary action, according to the King County Bar Association. The Washington State Bar Association proposed an advisory opinion allowing lawyers to counsel clients on state marijuana laws. A lawyer in Washington can advise clients on state marijuana laws and assist in establishing and maintaining a dispensary within state law boundaries. The lawyer can also engage in marijuana business activities without violating professional conduct rules, as long as federal regulations are followed. The federal government maintains strict controls over marijuana use for research purposes. The Secretary of Health and Human Services determines qualifications for practitioners conducting research on schedule I drugs like marijuana. The DEA has registered 237 practitioners for marijuana research, with some approved for research on human subjects using smoked marijuana. Practitioners obtain marijuana for research through the National Institute on Drug Abuse. The Attorney General can register applicants to manufacture or grow marijuana under the CSA. The Attorney General can register applicants to manufacture or grow marijuana if consistent with public interest and international treaties. Currently, the National Center for Natural Products Research at the University of Mississippi is the only registered organization. NIDA administers the federal contract with NCNPR, serving as the sole source for researchers to obtain marijuana. Legislative provisions and proposals have been introduced regarding marijuana and state legalization initiatives. The provision in the Act may prevent the implementation of D.C.'s recreational marijuana law, causing uncertainty. Some argue it prohibits the use of funds to enact the law, potentially leading to legal consequences for D.C. employees. However, others, including D.C.'s attorney general, believe it does not restrict the use of local funds for this purpose. The 2015 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act prohibits the use of FY15 local funds to implement Initiative 71, a marijuana law enacted before the Act. The Act has sections related to SNAP benefits and industrial hemp, with rules to prevent medical marijuana costs from affecting SNAP eligibility and authorization for hemp research by institutions of higher education and state agriculture departments. The 2015 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act allows for the cultivation of industrial hemp for research purposes and prohibits the Department of Justice from using funds to interfere with state laws on medical marijuana. There is debate on the interpretation of this provision, with some arguing it only restricts the Department from interfering with state implementation of medical marijuana laws, while others believe it should prevent enforcement of the Controlled Substances Act against individuals following state medical marijuana laws. The CARERS Act, S. 683 / H.R. 1538, aims to exempt individuals following state medical marijuana laws from the Controlled Substances Act. It proposes reclassifying marijuana as a Schedule II substance, allowing for medical use and providing legal protections to financial institutions serving marijuana businesses. The CARERS Act aims to exempt state-compliant marijuana businesses from the Controlled Substances Act and reduce BSA reporting burdens. It also facilitates research on marijuana, eases DEA approval for cultivation, and allows VA health care providers to recommend marijuana use for veterans. Additionally, the Industrial Hemp Farming Act of 2015 would remove industrial hemp from the CSA definition of \"marihuana.\" H.R. 262, States' Medical Marijuana Property Rights Protection Act, would amend civil forfeiture provisions to protect real property used for medical marijuana activities in compliance with state law. H.R. 667, Veterans Equal Access Act, authorizes VA health care providers to recommend marijuana for veterans. H.R. 1013, Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol Act, aims to remove marijuana from CSA schedules and regulate it like alcohol. H.R. 1014, Marijuana Tax Revenue Act of 2015, would impose taxes on marijuana sales. The Marijuana Tax Revenue Act of 2015 proposes an excise tax on marijuana sales, starting at 10% and increasing annually to a maximum of 25%. It includes exemptions for medical use, requires an occupational tax for marijuana enterprises, and mandates permits from the Secretary of the Treasury. Penalties are imposed for non-compliance with the new tax regulations. The bill H.R. 1635, Charlotte's Web Medical Access Act of 2015, aims to remove cannabidiol and cannabidiol-rich plants from the Controlled Substances Act and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Marijuana merchants face a federal tax disadvantage under Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code, which disallows deductions for expenses related to their business activities. Marijuana merchants are affected by Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code, which prohibits deductions for operating expenses related to trafficking controlled substances. This means they cannot deduct expenses like labor, rent, and utilities when calculating federal income tax. However, they can deduct the cost of goods sold (COGS) to determine gross income. This provision applies to marijuana as long as it is considered a controlled substance under federal law, regardless of state laws allowing its purchase and use. Customers of a medical marijuana merchant cannot deduct amounts spent on marijuana as medical expenses due to tax regulations."
