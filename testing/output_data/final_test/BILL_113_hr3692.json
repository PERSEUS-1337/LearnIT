    "content": "The \"Schools of the Future Act\" may be cited as the short title. Key findings are outlined in the Act. The Congress finds that digital learning technology has the potential to transform rural education by overcoming distance barriers and increasing school capacity. However, smaller rural educational agencies may struggle to access and implement these tools effectively, risking the bypassing of rural areas in digital learning advancements. Digital learning technologies need to be developed for rural areas to meet their unique needs. The demand for these tools is increasing, requiring rigorous evaluation to inform decision-making for improving student achievement. High-quality digital learning expands student access to previously unavailable courses. Expanding student access to courses in rural communities, enhancing college and career readiness. The Secretary of Education can award grants to eligible partnerships for 3 to 5 years to carry out activities described in section 6. A school partner must serve as the fiscal agent if a partnership receives a grant. An eligible partnership seeking a grant must submit an application to the Secretary with details about the partnership, the technology-based learning project, teacher qualifications, and student participation. The eligible partnership applying for a grant must provide details on how they will use the funds to ensure access to necessary equipment, obtain parental consent for devices, include selection criteria information, and describe the evaluation process. The eligible partnership applying for a grant must provide a rigorous, independent evaluation design meeting What Works Clearinghouse standards to measure effects on outcomes. They must estimate the number of students to be reached and ensure schools are designated with specific locale codes. The Secretary may determine Fringe Rural, Distant Rural, or Remote Rural status for eligibility, along with any additional required information. SEC. 5. APPLICATION REVIEW AND AWARD BASIS. The Secretary will use a peer review process to evaluate grant applications, appointing individuals with relevant expertise. Grants will be awarded with diversity in funded activities. Selection criteria include the need for technology-based learning, quality of design, and existing research evidence. The Secretary will evaluate grant applications based on the need for technology-based learning, quality of design, existing research evidence, the eligible partnership's experience, and the quality of the proposed evaluation. The use of funds is outlined in Section 6. An eligible partnership receiving a grant under this Act must use the funds to implement and evaluate technology-based learning practices, tools, and courses designed to personalize the learning experience. This includes personalized instructional systems, adaptive software, games, tools, and computer-based tutoring courses for struggling students. Technology-based practices and strategies include games, digital tools, smartphone applications, adaptive software for formative assessment, and web resources aligned with high-quality standards for personalized learning experiences. Technology-based practices and strategies include tools, courses, and resources aligned with high-quality standards for personalized learning experiences, such as historical sources for history courses and science experiments. Additionally, online professional development opportunities, mentoring, and learning communities are available to support teachers. Tools, courses, and strategies aimed at enhancing student achievement, particularly for those with specific educational needs, include digital tools for students with disabilities, online courses for credit recovery, language instruction for English language learners, and other tailored resources. Technology-based tools, courses, and strategies are designed to help students develop 21st-century skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, communication, collaboration, and innovation. Online courses provide access to learning opportunities that students may not have otherwise. Technology-based or online courses provide students access to courses they wouldn't otherwise have, including elective courses, foreign language courses, and advanced college-level courses that can be taken for credit. Eligible partnerships receiving grants can use funds to develop technology for learning. The grant funds can be used to develop technology-based learning strategies, purchase necessary hardware or software, address the needs of student subgroups, provide professional development on technology use, and tackle cost and capacity issues in rural areas and shortage subjects. SEC. 7. DATA COLLECTION AND EVALUATION. Each eligible partnership receiving a grant under this Act must conduct an independent evaluation after the third year to measure the impact on student achievement, costs, and at least one of the following: student achievement gaps, graduation rates, college enrollment, or college persistence. The Secretary will evaluate the impact of activities supported under the grant program, identify best practices, and disseminate findings in consultation with educational laboratories and comprehensive centers. The Education Sciences Reform Act of 2002 and comprehensive centers focus on research on best practices in school leadership. An evaluation partner can use funds for an implementation evaluation to provide useful information for schools and educational agencies. Results of the evaluation must be submitted to the Secretary and made publicly available. SEC. 8. DEFINITIONS.
