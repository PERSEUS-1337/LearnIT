    "content": "This report summarizes selected provisions of S. 1733, the Clean Energy Jobs and American Power Act, focusing on electric power and incentives for natural gas technologies. A comparison with H.R. 2454, the American Clean Energy and Security Act, is also included. Additional information on S. 1733 and H.R. 2454 can be found on the CRS website. The report is divided into sections on Electric Power and Natural Gas Technologies, and Electric Power Transmission and Related Technologies. Section 181 of Subtitle H of Division A establishes a program to promote low carbon emitting energy technologies. The Emission Reduction Program in the bill aims to promote dispatchable power generation projects to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The EPA administrator is tasked with establishing rules to incentivize projects generating 300,000 Gwh of electricity annually within 90 days of enactment. Dispatchable units like natural gas, nuclear, or coal can be run at-will, unlike wind or solar plants dependent on weather conditions. To qualify for incentives, projects must reduce greenhouse gas emissions below 2007 levels. The bill focuses on reducing all GHG emissions from power plants, with CO2 being the main target. Table 2 shows CO2 emissions per Mwh for different fuel sources in 2007. New natural gas plants are also included in the estimates. The estimated emissions for new natural gas plants show that only high efficiency plants can meet reduction targets of 25% for 2010-2020 and 40% for 2021-2025. No combustible fuel source can meet the 65% target starting in 2026 without carbon controls. Nuclear power and geothermal power have low emissions, but geothermal is limited to small installations in the western US. Wind or solar power combined with electricity storage could be a viable option, but current storage technologies have limitations. Incentives should prioritize projects with lower emissions. Incentives prioritize projects with characteristics like integrating renewable energy sources, carbon capture, and emission reduction efficiency. Section 181 lacks clarity on total incentives, project timelines, and emission reduction targets over time. The bill aims to provide incentives for eligible projects generating 300,000 gigawatt-hours of electricity per year. It is unclear if awards must be made within three years of enactment. Section 182 establishes programs for accelerating advanced natural gas technologies deployment. The EPA Administrator may provide research and development grants for low greenhouse-gas-emitting technologies for natural gas electricity generation and residential/commercial sectors. The Secretary of Energy is responsible for reporting to Congress on the progress of these programs every 180 days. These provisions are not found in H.R. 2454. Subtitle F of Title I of H.R. 2454 focuses on transmission planning and permitting for electric power, including provisions not found in S. 1733. The program aims to develop high-efficiency natural gas combustion turbines for combined cycle power plants, with a target efficiency of 65%. The Secretary of Energy is directed to carry out a research, development, and technology demonstration program to achieve this goal. Subtitle F of Title I of H.R. 2454 focuses on transmission planning and permitting for electric power. It establishes a national transmission planning policy to facilitate the deployment of renewable energy sources while ensuring reliability, reducing congestion, and minimizing environmental harm. The bill grants FERC new federal siting and permitting authority within the Western Interconnection. The bill H.R. 2454 grants FERC new federal siting and permitting authority within the Western Interconnection for proposed transmission projects meeting criteria for renewable energy demand. It includes provisions for supporting smart grid technologies and directing agencies to identify products for smart grid capability and potential consumer savings labeling. H.R. 2454 proposes requirements for electric power retailers to reduce peak loads using smart grid technologies and modify energy efficiency programs. It also includes provisions for appliance rebates with smart grid capabilities and compatibility with plug-in electric vehicles. Additionally, the bill provides for net metering of federal agencies to encourage distributed generation. Metering is a ratemaking concept that promotes distributed generation by requiring utilities to take any excess electricity generated by a facility, reducing the facility's utility bill. Section 152 of the bill mandates state regulatory authorities to consider implementing net metering for federal facilities and non-regulated utilities. The net metering standard must be adopted if consistent with state law and deemed \"appropriate\" by the regulatory authority. Section 153 of Subtitle F proposes incentives for developing transmission lines using non-commercial technology, including high-efficiency underground and overhead lines. These technologies would qualify for a new loan guarantee program under EPACT05. The loan guarantee program under EPACT05 was expanded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 to include \"advanced electric transmission property\" and \"advanced electric transmission manufacturing plant.\" This program supports the development of low carbon and advanced energy technologies."
