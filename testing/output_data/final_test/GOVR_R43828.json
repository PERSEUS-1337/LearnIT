DAB/DAB+ standards are compatible with digital cellphone standards like GSM. By the late 1990s, digital radio broadcasts over cell phones became available in Europe. DAB radio chips were incorporated into handsets by 2000, allowing for radio listening as a feature. With smartphones, the conversion from phone to radio became easier for consumers. In the United States, digital broadcast radio was authorized by the FCC in 2002 as HD Radio, a trademark of iBiquity Digital Corporation. iBiquity's core business is HD Radio, with radio stations paying fees to iBiquity. In 2011, Pew Research identified 2,103 HD Radio stations, approximately 13% of all radio stations. The number of HD Radio stations appeared to have plateaued by 2012, with more stations dropping it than adopting it. iBiquity reported \"close to 2,100\" HD Radio stations in September 2014, while the FCC reported 15,433 licensed radio stations. iBiquity also markets digital radios and radio chips, primarily for car radios. iBiquity, a company specializing in HD Radio technology, initially focused on car radios but later explored incorporating their radio chips into iPods and smartphones. HD Radio dongles for mobile devices are available from various manufacturers, activated by downloading an HD Radio app. In 2014, the BBC launched the \"Universal Smartphone Radio Project\" to expand digital radio listenership by adding FM/DAB/Internet chips to smartphones. The BBC is leading an industry coalition to add FM/DAB/Internet chips to smartphones, marketed as NextRadio in the US. NextRadio allows listening to over-the-air radio with interactive features. The business case is to increase radio listeners and advertising revenue by reaching new audiences through cellphones. In 2012, radio reached 92% of Americans over 12 years old, with 175 million active smartphones in the US by the end of 2013. Smartphone owners tend to be younger, with higher income and education levels. A study projected smartphone users to rise from 62.6 million in 2010 to 220 million in 2018. Interest in NextRadio among 18 to 49-year-old smartphone users was significant, but market demand has not fully materialized. By late 2014, 6.5 million NextRadio-enabled smartphones were in circulation, with 1.25 million activated for NextRadio. Emmis Communications reported that 1.25 million smartphones had been activated for NextRadio, with a forecast of 14.5 million activated smartphones by mid-2015. They have a three-year agreement with Sprint to preload the NextRadio app on at least 30 million smartphones, with a payment of $15 million per year to Sprint. This agreement does not limit NextRadio LLC from placing the app on FM-enabled devices on other networks. Emmis granted the U.S. radio industry a call option on assets used in NextRadio and TagStation businesses. The option can be exercised in 2017 or 2019 by paying a purchase price based on fair market value or investments. The business case for wireless carriers to include FM radio is complex as subscribers switch to smartphones. Including FM radio in smartphones is a complex decision for wireless carriers. NextRadio can be offered as a product enhancement to attract subscribers. While radio access is free, interactive services may incur data charges. Carriers like Sprint see it as an entertainment choice, while T-Mobile focuses on free music streaming to attract new subscribers. Apple plans to pre-install Beats app on iPhones and iPads in 2015. The broadcasting industry is lobbying for NextRadio chips in smartphones to include FM radio, potentially boosting interest in streaming music. Trends show a preference for Internet streaming over radio, but radio remains important for information and entertainment. Carriers may need to consider how a commitment to over-the-air radio could affect the development of other services. Industry leaders predict a shift to fifth-generation technologies by 2020, which may require re-engineering of devices to utilize new wireless capabilities. The broadcasting industry is advocating for NextRadio chips in smartphones to include FM radio for emergency alerts. Policy makers have considered using radio-enabled cellphones for alerts, but focus remains on IP-enabled networks for communication. The National Emergency Communications Plan aims to provide vital information across various devices, including smartphones and the Emergency Alert System. The National Emergency Communications Plan (NECP) emphasizes the importance of using communication technologies to reach people with alerts. This includes utilizing social media and smartphone networks for broadcasting emergency alerts. The Emergency Alert System (EAS) relies on AM radio stations as Primary Entry Points for distributing alerts across the country. The Emergency Alert System (EAS) utilizes various media outlets to distribute alerts across the country, including radio stations, television, cable systems, and other media as required by the FCC. FEMA has been enhancing the EAS backbone to reach 90% of the population since 2009. EAS is jointly administered by FEMA and the FCC, in cooperation with the National Weather Service (NWS) under NOAA. The primary source for alerts and warnings over EAS is the NOAA/NWS weather radio system, known as National Weather Radio. Ongoing efforts are being made to improve the NWR and related networks, such as the development of the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS) by FEMA to meet alert system requirements specified by an Executive Order issued by President George W. Bush. IPAWS aims to accept any legitimate alert. IPAWS, initiated by President George W. Bush, aims to relay alerts to various communication devices. Legislation in 2006 led to Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA) for cellphones. WEA uses the IPAWS network for geographically targeted messages. The FCC is working to improve wireless networks due to the reliance on mobile devices for information. The FCC is taking actions to enhance wireless network reliability by adopting new technologies and standards. These advancements include the installation of small-scale networks and the development of a new chip with various applications, such as handling wireless connections for large crowds. The goal is to improve emergency communications infrastructure by transitioning from analog to digital technologies for 9-1-1 calls. The transition from analog to digital technologies for 9-1-1 calls is being accelerated. Authorities are reconsidering the practice of turning off wireless phone networks after the Boston Marathon bomb attack in 2013, due to the widespread use of cellphones for communications and Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA)."
