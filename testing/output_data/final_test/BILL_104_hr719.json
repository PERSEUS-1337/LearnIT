    "content": "The Act titled \"Systematic Application of Value Engineering Act of 1995\" requires federal agencies to implement value engineering. Federal agencies must apply value engineering to reduce costs and improve project quality. Senior management personnel are required to establish and maintain value engineering procedures that utilize qualified personnel and ensure efficient work arrangements. Accomplishments must be reported to the Office of Management and Budget. Each Federal agency must designate a senior management official with a background in value engineering to oversee and monitor value engineering efforts. They should develop criteria and guidelines for identifying programs, projects, systems, and products with potential savings from value engineering methodology. The criteria and guidelines for value engineering should focus on maximizing savings during early phases of development. This includes considering the return on investment and setting a dollar threshold for applying value engineering to agency projects. The criteria for value engineering include identifying programs, projects, systems, and products with a dollar value above a certain threshold or within the top 20th percentile in terms of value. Additionally, programs below the threshold can be combined if they share planning elements or are functionally equivalent. The agency's value engineering manager may waive the Act's requirement for studies on a case-by-case basis. Training in value engineering methodology is provided to agency staff, and funds for value engineering efforts are included in annual budget requests. The Office of Management and Budget must document programs requiring value engineering techniques and adhere to acquisition regulations. Discretionary grants must also include value engineering requirements. The Office of Management and Budget mandates the use of value engineering methodology in grant applications. Federal agencies must develop annual plans for value engineering implementation and report activities to the Office of Management and Budget. The Office of Management and Budget requires federal agencies to submit an annual report on the results of using value engineering. The report must include the agency's current value engineering manager's details, the return on investment achieved through implementation of recommendations, and the potential return on investment. The annual report on value engineering for federal agencies must include the potential return on investment achievable through recommendations, the application of value engineering to programs and projects, and criteria for waiving value engineering requirements. Inspector General audits will be conducted on the savings reported by Federal agencies every second year. Unobligated amounts resulting from value engineering will have 50 percent available for use in the next fiscal year. The Act requires Federal agencies to implement methods for achieving savings in programs and projects, with 50 percent of the savings deposited in the Treasury to reduce the Federal debt. The Director of Management and Budget will review the policies in the Act after 5 years. Definitions for \"Federal agency\" are provided in the Act. The term \"value engineering\" refers to a team effort aimed at analyzing functions to achieve essential functions at the lowest life-cycle cost. The term \"value engineering\" refers to a team effort aimed at analyzing functions to achieve essential functions at the lowest life-cycle cost. Life-cycle cost is the total cost of owning, operating, maintaining, and disposing of a program, project, system, product, item of equipment, building, facility, service, or supply over a specified period of time."
