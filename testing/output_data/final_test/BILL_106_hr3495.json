    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Department of Energy Nuclear Employees Exposure Compensation Act\". The Congress recognizes federal nuclear activities as ultra-hazardous and the Department of Energy's responsibility for worker safety. Workers were exposed to harmful substances without consent, and information on health risks was withheld for decades. The Department of Energy lacks accurate records of worker exposure to harmful substances, shifting the burden of proof onto workers. State compensation programs are inadequate for addressing chronic diseases linked to exposure at DOE facilities. Scientific evidence confirms ionizing radiation as a carcinogen, with specific cancers being radiogenic. The curr_chunk is a section titled \"SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\" The curr_chunk defines the terms \"Department of Energy\" and \"DOE nuclear employee\" as individuals employed by the Department of Energy or its contracted entities at specific facilities in Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee. The curr_chunk lists various facilities under the Department of Energy, including locations in Tennessee, Washington, Idaho, Colorado, Ohio, New Mexico, Florida, Texas, Nevada, New York, Iowa, and Illinois. The curr_chunk lists specific facilities under the Department of Energy, such as Fermi Nuclear Facility in Illinois, Weldon Spring in Maryland, Savannah River in South Carolina, and Argonne National Lab in Illinois. It also mentions suppliers like Allied Signal Facility in Illinois, Nuclear Fuels Services in Tennessee, Linde Air Products in New York, and Reactive Metals in Ohio. The term \"specified disease\" includes leukemia (excluding chronic lymphocytic leukemia), multiple myeloma, and lymphomas (excluding Hodgkins). The curr_chunk specifies primary cancers or pre-cancerous conditions of various organs, in addition to other diseases covered by the Nuclear Claims Tribunal of the Marshall Islands. The DOE Nuclear Facility Employees' Exposure Compensation Fund is established. The DOE Nuclear Employees' Exposure Compensation Fund is established in the Treasury for disbursement by the Attorney General. It will terminate 22 years after enactment, with remaining amounts deposited in the Treasury. Appropriations are authorized as necessary, with funds remaining available until expended. Authority to enter contracts or make payments is limited to each fiscal year. Payments are only effective in a fiscal year to the extent provided in an appropriation Act. SEC. 5. ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES. Eligible DOE nuclear employees who have worked at a DOE nuclear facility for at least a year and have been monitored for radiation exposure can receive $100,000 and medical coverage for specified diseases if they provide medical documentation of contracting the disease during their employment period. The claim must be filed with the Attorney General and meet certain requirements. In accordance with section 6, the claim must meet the Act's requirements. SEC. 6. DETERMINATION AND PAYMENT OF CLAIMS. The Attorney General establishes filing procedures for eligible employees to submit claims for payment under this section. The Attorney General determines claim eligibility by consulting with relevant authorities and establishes guidelines for medical documentation and employment/exposure determinations. The Attorney General is authorized to make payments. The Attorney General is authorized to pay claims from the Fund that meet Act requirements. Upon payment, the US is subrogated to the individual's right or claim. For deceased DOE nuclear employees, payments are limited to specific conditions. If a DOE nuclear employee is survived by a spouse, the payment goes to the spouse. If there is no spouse, the payment is divided equally among the children. If there are no spouse or children, the payment is divided equally among the parents. If there are no spouse, children, parents, or grandchildren living at the time of payment, the payment shall be made in equal shares to the grandparents of the DOE nuclear employee who are living at the time of payment. If there are no surviving family members, the amount will remain in the Fund for future use. If a DOE nuclear employee eligible for payment dies before filing a claim, a survivor may file a claim for payment. Definitions for \"spouse\" and \"child\" are provided. The Attorney General must determine each claim filed under subsection (a) within 12 months. Additional information and documentation may be requested from the claimant. The Attorney General may request additional information or documentation from a claimant to complete the claim determination. The time taken to provide the requested information is not counted towards the 12-month period for claim determination. If the information is not provided within 60 days, the claimant can sue the Department of Energy or its contractor to compel production of the requested information. An individual may not receive payment under this Act if the requested information has not been provided within 60 days. Costs incurred by the Attorney General in carrying out this section shall not be paid from the Fund or deducted from a payment under this section. The Department of Energy will reimburse the Attorney General for costs related to establishing and administering the adjudications. The Attorney General is responsible for establishing and administering the compensation program under this Act until the Fund terminates. Payments under this section are not subject to federal income tax, do not affect eligibility for other benefits, and are not subject to certain offsets. The Attorney General has regulatory authority to issue necessary regulations.
