    "content": "The report focuses on legal issues surrounding the use of seclusion and restraint in schools, including incidents of deaths and injuries. Congressional interest in this topic led to reporting requirements issued by the Department of Education in March 2010. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a study on the use of seclusion and restraint in education, finding cases of alleged abuse and death. GAO noted a lack of centralized data collection on these methods. The Department of Education added seclusion and restraint data to its collection in 2010. The Secretary of Education urged states to review their policies on these practices. The Department of Education urged states to review and potentially revise their policies on the use of seclusion and restraint in schools before the 2009-2010 school year. Federal law does not have specific provisions on this issue, and states have varied approaches. The Chief State School Officers were to be contacted by ED to discuss relevant laws and guidance by August 15, 2009. The Children's Health Act of 2000 prohibits the use of seclusion and restraint in certain facilities for children. Legislation has been introduced to address the use of seclusion and restraint in schools, with some bills passing in the House. Legal principles regarding this issue are being examined. Seclusion and restraint in schools are defined by the Department of Education for the 2009-10 Civil Rights Data Collection. Seclusion is the involuntary confinement of a student alone in a room, while restraint includes physical and mechanical restraints that limit a student's movement. Physical restraint in schools refers to restricting a student's movement, while mechanical restraints involve using devices to limit freedom of movement. This does not include devices prescribed by medical professionals for specific purposes like adaptive devices or vehicle safety restraints. In school settings, seclusion and restraint are defined differently than in community-based facilities. Seclusion is the involuntary confinement of an individual alone in a room, while restraint immobilizes or restricts movement. The use of seclusion and restraint in public schools has faced constitutional challenges. The use of seclusion and restraint in public schools has faced constitutional challenges based on the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of due process and the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable seizures. The Supreme Court has not directly ruled on the constitutionality of seclusion and restraint in schools but has established a liberty interest in reasonably safe conditions of confinement and freedom from unreasonable bodily restraint. Courts must defer to qualified professionals to determine the reasonableness of seclusion and restraint in public schools. Due process challenges have been rejected if such tactics are deemed reasonable, but may be actionable if found to be unreasonable under the Due Process Clause. Courts may find the use of seclusion and restraint in public schools unreasonable under the Due Process Clause, especially if it \"shocks the conscience.\" In Orange v. County of Grundy, the court ruled that isolating school children in a storage closet for a whole school day without access to lunch or a toilet facility is unacceptable. The reasonableness of seclusion must be upheld, and school officials are responsible for supervising isolated students. The due process inquiry and reasonableness standard are subjective and depend on the specific case. Some plaintiffs claim that the use of seclusion and restraint in public schools violates the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures. Courts assess Fourth Amendment claims using a reasonableness standard, as seen in cases like Rasmus v. Arizona and Couture v. Board of Education of the Albuquerque Public Schools. The use of supervised timeouts for a student with disruptive behavior was deemed reasonable by the court, especially since it was authorized by the student's IEP. Fourth Amendment claims regarding seclusion and restraint depend on the specific case, with violations typically only found in cases of excessive or unreasonable tactics. Courts may limit constitutional claims if they can be addressed under state tort law, as seen in Ingraham v. Wright. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is a federal statute that authorizes funding for special education and related services for children with disabilities. States and school districts must provide a free appropriate public education (FAPE) to all children with disabilities, typically between the ages of 3 and 21, under IDEA. Remedies for the unlawful use of seclusion and restraint in public schools should be sought under state tort law, as the Court held that traditional common-law remedies are adequate to afford due process. Under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), states and school districts must provide free appropriate public education (FAPE) to children with disabilities aged 3 to 21. Children with disabilities are evaluated to determine eligibility for special education services, with an individual education program (IEP) outlining specific services. Parents are involved in planning and overseeing their child's education. Procedural safeguards are provided, including the right to a due process hearing and appeal to federal court. IDEA requires the IEP team to consider positive behavioral interventions for children with disabilities whose behavior impedes learning. The use of seclusion and restraints is not specifically addressed in IDEA, but state laws may allow them if consistent with the child's IEP. The Supreme Court has not specifically addressed the use of seclusion or restraints under IDEA, but in Honig v. Doe, the Court examined requirements for children with violent behavior. Educators can use \"normal procedures\" like study carrels, timeouts, and detention, despite the lack of specific language in IDEA regarding restraints and seclusion. In Melissa S. v. School District of Pittsburgh, the Third Circuit addressed allegations of IDEA violations involving a child's serious behavior problems. The court found that the school's use of a time-out area did not violate IDEA as it was within normal procedures for dealing with children endangering themselves or others. Similarly, the Eighth Circuit in CJN v. Minneapolis Public Schools also addressed similar issues. The Eighth Circuit in CJN v. Minneapolis Public Schools found that a third grade child with brain lesions and a history of psychiatric illness received FAPE despite extensive use of seclusion. A dissenting opinion criticized the punitive approach to discipline and police intervention for behavioral problems created by the school's failure to address the child's unique disorder. Courts have examined whether IDEA's administrative exhaustion requirements apply in cases involving seclusion and restraint. The exhaustion requirements of IDEA apply in cases involving seclusion and restraint. In C.N. v. Willmar Public Schools, parents challenged the use of these procedures, withdrew their daughter from the school, and requested a due process hearing. The Eighth Circuit ruled that the parents should have filed for a due process hearing while the child was still in the school district. In cases involving seclusion and restraint, administrative exhaustion is required under IDEA. The Ninth Circuit also upheld this requirement in a case involving the use of a \"safe room\" in a child's IEP. However, in a separate case, the court found no exhaustion requirement for damages related to physical and emotional abuse. In Pennsylvania, a district court initially did not require exhaustion for allegations of abuse by a special education teacher, but later changed its decision due to a court of appeals ruling mandating IDEA procedures for FAPE violations. In Peters v. Rome City School District, despite the mother's consent to the child's IEP with a time-out room, constitutional violations were still alleged. The mother testified about lack of knowledge on room usage and conditions. IDEA issues were not directly addressed in this case. In Peters v. Rome City School District, IDEA issues were not directly addressed as the school district did not object to the court's failure to instruct the jury about federal and state laws regarding time-out rooms. In a separate case, parents used IDEA to challenge a New York state regulation banning aversive interventions, arguing that some students' IEPs were being revised without consent, depriving them of necessary therapies. The Second Circuit vacated an injunction against the regulation, emphasizing the importance of uninterrupted behavioral treatments for student plaintiffs. The district court upheld regulations on the use of aversives in schools, citing a choice between opposing schools of thought. Recent studies show little uniformity in state laws on seclusion and restraints, with some states lacking regulations altogether. The Department of Education reviewed state restraint policies in 2010, highlighting variations in coverage among states. GAO found in 2009 that 19 states have no laws on seclusion or restraints, with wide discrepancies in regulations among states that do have them. In 2007, a study found that 24 states had policies on time-out procedures in schools. A 2009 survey revealed that 41% of states had no laws on restraint and seclusion, with almost 90% allowing prone restraints. Legislation was introduced in 2009 to establish safety standards in schools regarding restraint and seclusion. Legislation was introduced in the House and Senate regarding the use of restraint and seclusion in schools. The bills, H.R. 4247 and S. 2860, were passed in the House and introduced in the Senate as S. 3895. The bills require the Secretary of Education to create regulations, with S. 3895 allowing physical restraint or seclusion in a student's IEP plan under certain conditions, which is a controversial issue. The bills H.R. 4247 and S. 2860 aim to regulate the use of restraint and seclusion in schools, with H.R. 4247 requiring the Secretary of Education to create regulations to protect students from abuse and unnecessary physical restraint or seclusion. This legislation could impact communication between schools and parents regarding a student's needs and the inclusion of seclusion and restraint in a student's IEP or behavior intervention plan. H.R. 4247 would regulate the use of physical restraint and seclusion in schools receiving federal education funding. It prohibits these interventions in IEP plans, requires state plans to meet minimum standards, allows grants for implementation, and clarifies the use of handcuffs by school resource officers. H.R. 4247 regulates physical restraint and seclusion in schools receiving federal funding, prohibits these interventions in IEP plans, requires state plans to meet standards, allows grants for implementation, and clarifies the use of handcuffs by school resource officers. S. 2860 and S. 3895 introduce similar requirements but with some differences, such as notification to state protection and advocacy systems in cases of serious injury or death from seclusion or restraint. S. 3895 also mandates regulations to protect students from harmful interventions and restraints, to be implemented within one year of enactment. S. 3895, unlike H.R. 4247, does not prohibit earmarks and allows physical restraint or seclusion in a student's IEP plan under certain conditions."
