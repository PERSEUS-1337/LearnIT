    "title": "SB 1422",
    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 799 of the Public Utilities Code is amended regarding taxes enacted by local jurisdictions on customers of public utilities or service suppliers. Public utilities are not required to independently verify the validity of the tax ordinance. In case of tax ordinance invalidity, public utilities are not liable for collecting the tax from customers. If a local jurisdiction must refund the tax, they are solely responsible for the refund process unless the utility is reimbursed for assisting with calculations and distribution. In actions related to taxes imposed on customers of utilities, the local jurisdiction and the service supplier are the only necessary parties, with the service supplier not named in the action. If a local jurisdiction changes a tax related to utilities, they must notify the service supplier in writing and provide all necessary information. The supplier is not required to implement the changes until 60 days after receiving the notification. If the 60th day is not the first day of a month, the changes will be implemented on the first day of the following month. If a local jurisdiction adopts a new tax, they must notify the service supplier in writing. The supplier can start collecting the tax 90 days after receiving the notification, starting from the first day of the following month if the 90th day is not the first day of a month. To delay tax collection by service providers, local jurisdictions must notify them in writing, allowing a 90-day period before collection can begin. The limitations imposed by this section on service providers, including holders of state franchises, are deemed a matter of statewide concern by the Legislature. These limitations apply to all cities, counties, districts, and public corporations within California. The amendment of Section 799 of the Public Utilities Code is declaratory of existing law and does not constitute a change."
