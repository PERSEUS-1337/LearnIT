    "content": "The \"Family and Medical Leave Clarification Act\" includes sections on definitions, intermittent leave, request for leave, paid leave substitution, certification requirements, and regulations. The Act also provides a table of contents and references the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993. The Congress acknowledges that the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 is not functioning as intended due to broad regulations causing compliance issues for employers, leading to increased costs, productivity loss, and paperwork. The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 has compliance issues for employers, conflicts with existing sick leave policies, and results in most leave becoming paid. The Commission on Leave failed to identify many compliance problems due to conducting the study too soon after the Act's enactment. SEC. 3. DEFINITION OF SERIOUS HEALTH CONDITION. The term 'serious health condition' under Section 101(11) (29 U.S.C. 2611(11)) does not include short-term conditions with brief treatment and recovery. Covered conditions include heart attacks, severe respiratory conditions, spinal injuries, pneumonia, severe arthritis, injuries from serious accidents, ongoing pregnancy, complications related to pregnancy, and recovery from childbirth. Regulations of the Secretary of Labor are repealed. The Secretary of Labor's regulations at sections 825.114 and 825.115 of title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations are repealed. New regulations must be issued within 180 days after the date of enactment, allowing employers to rely on previous regulations for existing leave requests. Employers can rely on previous regulations of the Secretary of Labor for existing leave requests. In any enforcement action after the effective date of new regulations, old regulations cannot be used as evidence of non-compliance. SEC. 4. INTERMITTENT LEAVE. Amended to allow intermittent leave in increments of up to one-half of a work day, as certified by a health care provider. Employers may require employees to take leave for the duration of work assignments if unable to accommodate intermittent leave requests. SEC. 5. REQUEST FOR LEAVE. Section 102(a) (29 U.S.C. 2612(a)) is amended to include provisions for requesting leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act. Employers can require employees to timely request leave and may deny leave if the request is not made in a timely manner. Timeliness of the request is defined based on advance notice requirements and submission of written applications within 5 working days. Employees must notify their employer verbally of the need for leave at the start of the leave and submit any required written application within 5 working days, with extensions allowed for incapacity. SEC. 6. SUBSTITUTION OF PAID LEAVE. Employers can require employees to choose between paid absence provided under certain agreements or plans and unpaid leave under this title. SEC. 7. CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS. SEC. 7. CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS. Section 103(b)(3) is amended to require appropriate medical facts documented by objective medical findings. SEC. 8. REGULATIONS. The Secretary of Labor must review and revise regulations within 6 months to reflect amendments made by this Act. Compliance with previous regulations before the effective date of the revised regulations will be considered full compliance with the Act. SEC. 9. EFFECTIVE DATE. The amendments made by this Act will take effect 180 days after its enactment."
