    "content": "The National Health Service Corps (NHSC) is a program created by Congress to address health workforce shortages in underserved areas. It recruits individuals to serve at approved facilities in designated shortage areas for a minimum of two years through scholarships and loan repayment agreements. The NHSC offers scholarships and loan repayment agreements to individuals studying in medical or dental programs, as well as physician assistants, nurse-midwives, and nurse practitioners. Child and adolescent psychiatrists are now eligible for the loan repayment program. States can expand the list of eligible providers to include other disciplines like pharmacy or optometry. The NHSC, managed by the Bureau of Health Workforce in the HRSA, was created in 1970 to ensure an adequate supply of health providers in designated areas. It has been authorized and revised multiple times, with the most recent authorization in the ACA. The ACA also established the CHCF, providing mandatory appropriations for the NHSC until FY2017. The NHSC, managed by the Bureau of Health Workforce in the HRSA, was created in 1970 to ensure an adequate supply of health providers in designated areas. The ACA required the Secretary of HHS to redefine how HPSAs and Medically Underserved Areas/Populations are designated, implemented a part-time option for NHSC clinicians, authorized tax-exempt income for NHSC participants, and allowed NHSC clinicians to count teaching time towards their service commitment. Funding trends from FY2011 through FY2017 and a summary of NHSC programs are also provided. The ACA established the CHCF with mandatory funding for the NHSC from FY2011-FY2017. The CHCF transferred $11 billion to support the NHSC and federal health center programs. The NHSC received $288.6 million in FY2017, with funding extended by MACRA. CHCF was the sole funding source for NHSC from FY2012-FY2016. The NHSC received mandatory funding from the CHCF from FY2011-FY2017. Funding was extended through MACRA in FY2015, with $310 million allocated for FY2016 and FY2017. No sequester was ordered for FY2016 due to the timing of the funding extension. Final FY2017 funding is estimated at $288.6 million. The NHSC received funding from the CHCF from FY2011-FY2017, with $310 million allocated for FY2016 and FY2017. Final FY2017 funding is estimated at $288.6 million, with a 6.9% mandatory sequester. NHSC supports clinician recruitment and retention programs through scholarships and loan repayment in federally designated HPSAs. The federal program provides loan repayments and scholarships, with states receiving matching funds. NHSC participants may receive continuation awards to extend their service in HPSAs. The NHSC Scholarship Program recruits students in medical, dental, and nursing schools, offering financial support through scholarships for up to four years in exchange for a service commitment in a HPSA. Each state has the authority to make loan repayment awards according to its needs, consistent with federal regulations. The NHSC Scholarship Program offers financial support for up to four years in exchange for a service commitment in a HPSA. Recipients must provide an additional year of service for each year of scholarship support received. The Federal Loan Repayment Program recruits licensed professionals for full- or part-time service at NHSC-approved work sites, with options for up to $50,000 for a two-year obligation. The Students to Service (S2S) Loan Repayment Program offers up to $120,000 to medical students in their final year of school. In exchange, recipients must complete an approved primary care residency in a HPSA for at least three years full-time or six years half-time. Alternatively, they can opt for post-graduate training in an approved specialty for one year. The State Loan Repayment Program, similar to the Federal program, allows states to match grants with the NHSC and expand or contract clinician participation. States can include additional professionals like nurses and pharmacists. NHSC participants can receive a single loan to serve full-time. The NHSC offers loan repayment agreements and scholarship awards to individuals who serve in HPSAs for a minimum of two years. From FY2011 to FY2016, they awarded 23,854 federal loan repayment agreements, 1,084 scholarship awards, 322 students to service agreements, and 2,206 state loan repayment awards. A total of 15,303 new federal loan repayments were awarded during this period, with an average of 3,061 new federal loan repayments annually. In FY2011, NHSC awarded 4,113 new federal loan repayments, the largest number in a single year during FY2011-FY2015, due to increased program appropriation. NHSC's field strength in FY2015 was 9,683, enabling providers to serve 10.2 million individuals in HPSAs. Field strength changes are influenced by appropriation levels. Changes in NHSC's field strength are influenced by funding levels. For instance, an increase in funding from FY2010 to FY2011 led to a 36% rise in field strength, from 7,530 to 10,279. The number of individuals served by NHSC providers fluctuated with changes in field strength, with 10.5 million individuals served in FY2011, 9.3 million in FY2013, and 10.2 million in FY2015. The NHSC's workforce includes a diverse range of health professionals, with behavioral/mental health providers being the largest group since FY2010, followed by physicians and nurse practitioners. In FY2015, Congress recognized the Secretary's authority to add pharmacists to the NHSC. The NHSC workforce is composed of mental and behavioral health providers, allopathic and osteopathic physicians, and nurse practitioners. Physicians were the largest group in FY2009, but the composition of the NHSC workforce continues to be debated. In FY2009, physicians accounted for 35% of NHSC providers, the largest group. Debate surrounds diversification of the NHSC workforce to improve access for rural populations. Child and adolescent psychiatrists were added to NHSC-eligible providers in 2016. NHSC's workforce composition in FY2015 is shown in Figure 2."
