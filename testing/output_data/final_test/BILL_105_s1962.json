    "content": "The \"Education Modernization Fund Act\" may be cited as the short title. It establishes education modernization loans and a fund. The \"Education Modernization Fund Act\" establishes loans for constructing and modernizing schools. The Secretary of Education will provide low-interest, long-term loans to States, with eligibility requirements and terms determined by the Secretary. Funds will be allocated to States based on a formula determined by the Secretary. The \"Education Modernization Fund\" Act establishes a trust fund in the Treasury of the United States for providing financial assistance to States with significant increases in elementary and secondary school student populations. The fund consists of transferred amounts and interest earned on investments. The Secretary of the Treasury transfers $5 billion from the modernization fund to the Trust Fund. All amounts received from loan operations are deposited in the Trust Fund. The Secretary of the Treasury invests the Trust Fund, with investments made only in obligations. Investments in the Trust Fund are limited to interest-bearing obligations of the United States or guaranteed obligations. Special obligations can be issued exclusively to the Trust Fund at par. Special obligations issued to the Trust Fund bear interest at a rate based on the average rate of interest of marketable interest-bearing obligations of the United States. The Secretary of the Treasury must determine the issuance of these special obligations. The Trust Fund may sell or redeem obligations at market price, with interest and proceeds credited to the Trust Fund for expenditures. Expenditures from the Trust Fund are available to the Secretary of Education for carrying out subsection (a)."
