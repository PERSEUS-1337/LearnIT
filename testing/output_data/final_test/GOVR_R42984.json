The reliance on Information and communications technology (ICT) for various aspects of modern life makes the infrastructure vulnerable to cyber-based attacks, which could have cascading negative effects. Cyber-based attacks pose a significant threat to national security, the economy, and individual safety. Criminals, terrorists, and spies use technology to steal data, launch attacks, and disrupt services. These illegal actions go against U.S. interests and can have severe consequences. Cyber-based attacks by various cyber-actors pose a significant threat to national security and critical infrastructure. Cyberterrorists, cyberspies, cyberthieves, cyberwarriors, and cyberhacktivists are discussed as potential aggressors. These actors use the Internet for planning attacks, propaganda distribution, and communication, demonstrating the vulnerability of essential infrastructure components to cyber threats. In 2009, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) conducted the Aurora Project, revealing vulnerabilities in the nation's power grid control systems. Cyberspies steal classified information for strategic advantage, as seen in a 2011 FBI report of a company losing $1 billion worth of data overnight. The Department of Defense's classified network was also breached in 2008. In 2008, the Department of Defense's classified computer network system was unlawfully accessed by a foreign intelligence agency, leading to data being transferred to servers under foreign control. A classified National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) highlighted a massive cyber-espionage campaign targeting the U.S., with China's efforts surpassing those of Russia, Israel, and France. A 2013 report revealed that cyberattacks on over 100 targets were linked to a Chinese group possibly tied to the People's Liberation Army. Cyberthieves engage in illegal activities for financial gain, such as stealing credit card numbers. Cybercrime is seen as profitable for criminals and costly for victims, with global costs estimated in the hundreds of billions of dollars annually. Accurate estimates of these costs are challenging to determine. Cyberwarriors are nation-state agents conducting cyberattacks for strategic objectives. Attacks may not be government-sanctioned, leading to blame shifting. In 2012, Saudi Aramco was targeted with 30,000 computers compromised. The cyberattack on Saudi Aramco in 2012 compromised 30,000 computers and aimed to disrupt oil production. Iran or an insider employee were suspected as possible perpetrators. Cyberhacktivists engage in attacks for nonmonetary reasons, ranging from personal challenges to political motives. Their activities can vary from nuisance denial of service attacks to disrupting government and private corporation operations. Cyber attackers can pursue various types of attacks, such as cybertheft, cyberspying, and cyberwarfare. It is challenging to ascertain the intentions and capabilities of these aggressors, especially with the United States being an early adopter of vulnerable technologies. This complexity requires careful consideration of operational responses, policies, and legislation to protect national interests. E.O. 13636 aims to enhance cybersecurity by expanding information sharing and collaboration between the government and private sector, developing cybersecurity standards, and addressing issues like information sharing and the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure sectors. The executive order aims to enhance cybersecurity by developing a voluntary framework of cybersecurity standards for protecting critical infrastructure, establishing a consultative process for improving cybersecurity, identifying high-priority infrastructure for protection, and incentivizing voluntary adoption of the framework. Improved information sharing on cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities is seen as crucial but faces barriers and uncertainties. The executive order aims to enhance cybersecurity by developing a voluntary framework of cybersecurity standards for protecting critical infrastructure. Information sharing on cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities is crucial but faces barriers such as privacy concerns, liability issues, and protection of proprietary information. Most information sharing is voluntary through sector-specific programs under the Department of Homeland Security. The key question is how to balance the need for better cybersecurity information with privacy, civil rights, and business interests. The order builds on a voluntary effort established in May 2011 called the DIB Cyber Pilot. The DOD established the DIB Cybersecurity/Information Assurance Program in May 2012 to share threat information with defense contractors. The program includes sharing threat signatures from NSA monitoring activities and providing cybersecurity best practices. Companies can report cyber incidents, coordinate mitigation strategies, and participate in damage assessments. Additionally, there is an optional classified-information sharing subprogram called the DIB Cybersecurity Enhancement Program. The DHS established the Joint Cybersecurity Services Pilot (JCSP) in 2012 to expand the program beyond the DIB sector. The program, now called Enhanced Cybersecurity Services (ECS), shares threat indicators with participating commercial service providers (CSPs) instead of CI entities directly. The executive order requires the expansion of ECS to all CI sectors and expedited security clearances for appropriate personnel. The executive order aims to enhance cybersecurity by sharing threat indicators with commercial service providers, expediting security clearances for CI personnel, and placing private-sector experts in federal agencies temporarily. There is a debate on the efficacy of voluntary versus regulatory efforts in protecting critical infrastructure sectors from potential attacks. The executive order aims to enhance cybersecurity by involving the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in developing cybersecurity technical standards. It focuses on voluntary consensus standards and business best practices to reduce cybersecurity risks to critical infrastructure. The executive order aims to enhance cybersecurity by involving NIST in developing technical standards to reduce risks to critical infrastructure. The framework is technology-neutral, identifies areas for improvement, and is regularly reviewed and updated. The Secretary of Homeland Security sets performance goals, establishes a voluntary program, and coordinates incentives for adoption. Sector-specific agencies review the framework, develop sector-specific guidance, and report annually to the President. CI regulatory agencies engage in consultative review, determine cybersecurity requirements adequacy, propose additional authority if needed, and recommend remedies. The executive order involves NIST in developing technical standards for cybersecurity to reduce risks to critical infrastructure. The framework, released in February 2014, offers broad guidance using a risk-based approach adaptable to different needs. It does not grant additional authority for regulating critical infrastructure beyond existing laws and aims to coordinate efforts led by the private sector. The cybersecurity framework by NIST uses a risk-based approach adaptable to different critical infrastructure sectors. It includes a common set of activities and outcomes, organized into five functions. The profile describes an entity's current and target cybersecurity postures, while the implementation tiers characterize current and intended practices. The implementation tiers in the cybersecurity framework by NIST range from Tier 1 to Tier 4, representing different levels of practices. NIST identified areas for improvement including authentication, cybersecurity workforce needs, supply-chain risk management, and technical standards. DHS has developed the Critical Infrastructure Cyber Community C\u00b3 Voluntary Program to assist entities in adopting and implementing the framework. The executive order includes provisions on CI cybersecurity such as Acquisition and Contracting, Consultative Process, Cybersecurity Workforce, and High-Risk Critical Infrastructure. It aims to improve security standards in acquisition processes, coordinate cybersecurity improvements, assist regulatory agencies with cybersecurity workforce development, and address high-risk critical infrastructure. The executive order includes provisions on High-Risk Critical Infrastructure, requiring the Secretary of Homeland Security to identify critical infrastructure vulnerable to cyberattacks with catastrophic impacts. It also mandates privacy and civil liberties protections in agency activities. The executive order mandates the assessment of risks to privacy and civil liberties in DHS activities, with recommendations for mitigation. Agency officials must provide assessments to DHS, and specific deadlines are set for various deliverables, such as threat reports and cybersecurity program expansion. The executive order mandates recommendations to the President on incentives, acquisitions, critical infrastructure designation, cybersecurity framework publication, privacy and civil liberties report, and regulatory requirements review. The executive order includes requirements for agencies with regulatory responsibilities for critical infrastructure, proposed risk mitigation actions, and reports to the Office of Management and Budget on ineffective requirements. Some deliverables have been publicly available, with provisions like expedited security clearances being used to facilitate communication during cyberattacks. The Administration's assessments in the spring of 2013 focused on regulatory requirements and proposed actions by DHS, EPA, and HHS to mitigate cyber risks. Presidential Policy Directive 21 (PPD 21) on critical infrastructure security was released alongside Executive Order 13636, superseding Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 (HSPD 7) to strengthen cyber and physical security of critical infrastructure. The curr_chunk discusses clarifying functional relationships among federal agencies, establishing separate DHS operational centers for physical and cyber-infrastructure, identifying baseline requirements for information sharing, applying integration and analysis capabilities in DHS to manage risks, organizing research and development for secure critical infrastructure. It also mentions the analysis of public-private partnerships in critical infrastructure security and resilience. The Secretary of Homeland Security is focused on improving infrastructure security and resilience through public-private partnerships, intelligence exchange requirements, situational-awareness capabilities, and an updated National Infrastructure Protection Plan. The directive also outlines responsibilities for various federal departments and agencies. The Executive Order 13636 was issued in response to the lack of cybersecurity legislation in Congress, raising questions about the President's authority to act through an executive order. This issue is often evaluated using the framework set forth by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Jackson in the case of Youngstown Sheet & Tube Company v. Sawyer. The President's authority to act through an executive order is evaluated using the framework set forth by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Jackson in the case of Youngstown Sheet & Tube Company v. Sawyer. The President's authority is at its maximum when acting with congressional grant, at its minimum when incompatible with Congress, and in a zone of uncertainty when neither granted nor denied by Congress. For example, Congress has provided explicit statutory authority for the executive to regulate the security of private entities, such as chemical facilities subject to CFATS standards. The President's authority to direct sector-specific agencies to coordinate cybersecurity standards is at its maximum when Congress has provided explicit regulatory authority, such as in the case of anti-terrorism and maritime security standards. In situations where there is congressional silence, the President's authority may be in a zone of uncertainty. The President's authority to direct action on cybersecurity falls within a \"zone of twilight\" and could be justified under explicit or implied powers granted by the Constitution. For example, E.O. 13636 directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to identify critical infrastructure for cybersecurity incidents, which could be authorized under the Homeland Security Act of 2002 or the President's constitutional authority. However, some legislative proposals may be beyond unilateral executive action, such as regulating cybersecurity of critical infrastructure and limiting liability. Limits on liability or safe harbors for regulated entities complying with cybersecurity regulations have been proposed to mitigate the adverse effects of regulatory schemes on civil liability exposure. These limits range from complete immunity to restrictions like prohibiting punitive damages, potentially tied to regulatory compliance for added incentive. Justifying the abrogation of civil claims without explicit congressional authorization based on executive powers alone may be challenging. Notably, the executive order does not extend similar liability protections to private entities complying with cybersecurity standards. The executive order does not provide liability protections to private entities complying with cybersecurity standards, but it does direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to coordinate incentives for voluntary participation in the critical infrastructure program. Recommendations or risk assessments under the order may be used as evidence in tort litigation related to cybersecurity incidents. Authorization for telecommunications providers to engage in more aggressive monitoring of communications networks in real-time may not be possible under the executive order. The executive order does not provide liability protections to private entities complying with cybersecurity standards but directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to coordinate incentives for voluntary participation in the critical infrastructure program. Authorization for telecommunications providers to engage in more aggressive monitoring of communications networks in real-time may not be possible under the executive order. Several legislative proposals on cybersecurity in the 112th Congress addressed various issues such as cybersecurity workforce, R&D, data breach notification, DHS authorities, FISMA reform, information sharing, penalties for cybercrime, protection of critical infrastructure, public awareness, and supply chain vulnerabilities. E.O. 13636 focuses on information sharing and protection of critical infrastructure. The executive order on cybersecurity does not provide exemptions from liability for information sharing, unlike some legislative proposals. It also differs in the creation of new entities for information sharing and the role of NIST in developing the Cybersecurity Framework. Legislative proposals in the 113th Congress address information sharing and NIST's leadership in cybersecurity. S. 2588, H.R. 3696, and S. 1353 aim to improve information sharing and require NIST to lead a public/private effort similar to the Cybersecurity Framework development process. The House bills passed but faced controversy. The executive order is seen as a necessary step in enhancing cybersecurity, with proponents highlighting its ability to address cybersecurity issues among stakeholders. Critics have raised concerns about the order. Critics of the executive order have raised concerns about its effectiveness, pointing out that existing processes already address cybersecurity issues. They argue that the order may hinder the enactment of legislation, as Congress may wait for the order to be fully implemented before taking action. Proponents, on the other hand, believe that the order clarifies Obama Administration goals, introduces new provisions, and was necessary in the absence of legislation. Some observers believe changes in current law are necessary to provide liability protections for information sharing and meet other needs, despite concerns about the slow or rushed process for developing cybersecurity frameworks. Delays in implementing security measures have been criticized, with some entities reportedly waiting for consensus on framework adoption. Some entities have delayed implementing security measures while waiting for federal guidance on cybersecurity frameworks. Concerns exist about the framework potentially becoming a de facto regulation or being insufficiently enforceable. There are also worries about government intrusion into private-sector activities and the effectiveness of voluntary measures. However, some argue that advancements in technology and workforce readiness could make a voluntary approach successful. The executive order on designating high-risk critical infrastructure by DHS has raised concerns about potential overclassification or underclassification. It is unclear how effectively these concerns will be addressed, but the private sector's response has been largely positive, with some urging adoption of the framework by critical-infrastructure entities. Experts have recommended the adoption of the framework by critical infrastructure entities. NIST sought public feedback on the framework in August 2014, receiving over 60 responses from various organizations. The responses show varying levels of understanding and implementation, indicating that more experience is needed to assess the framework's success in improving cybersecurity for critical infrastructure."
