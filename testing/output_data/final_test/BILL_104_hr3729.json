The \"Defend America Against Weapons of Mass Destruction Act of 1996\" outlines findings regarding the limited ability to detect and intercept weapons of mass destruction delivered by unconventional means. The incentive for unconventional delivery of such weapons increases with the perceived effectiveness of regular military defense systems. The threat posed by chemical and biological weapons may not be military in nature, posing a risk to US citizens. The threat of chemical and biological weapons delivered by nonconventional means is significant and growing, with hostile countries like Iraq, Libya, and Iran showing interest in acquiring the necessary technology. Extremist groups and terrorist movements also have the capability to acquire and use weapons of mass destruction, with states able to transfer weapons to them through covert or unconventional means of delivery. Traditional arms control efforts are ineffective in monitoring and controlling the sudden development of chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons using commercial supplies. Due to the dire consequences posed by weapons of mass destruction, a coordinated effort among local, State, and federal agencies is necessary. Congress has expressed concern about weapons of mass destruction and called for a coordinated effort among local, State, and Federal emergency response organizations to develop technologies for detection and interception, equip and protect first responders, and decontaminate affected areas. The development of early detection and response capabilities for terrorist use of chemical or biological agents, emergencies involving industrial chemicals, or disease outbreaks is a key focus. The term \"weapons of mass destruction\" refers to chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons designed to spread their contents through explosions or other dissemination means. The Department of Defense research and development program is outlined in Section 3. The Department of Defense is establishing a research and development program to enhance capabilities related to the threat of an attack inside the United States using weapons of mass destruction. The program will include activities such as research, development, testing, and evaluation of technologies. The Department of Defense is establishing a research and development program to enhance capabilities related to the threat of an attack inside the United States using weapons of mass destruction. This program includes technologies for detection, interception, protection, response assistance, casualty treatment, decontamination, personnel training, and equipment transfer between Federal agencies and State/local agencies. The program aims to enhance capabilities for addressing threats of attacks using weapons of mass destruction within the United States. It involves technology development for detection, interception, protection, response assistance, casualty treatment, decontamination, personnel training, and equipment transfer between Federal agencies, State, and local authorities. The Secretary is required to consult regularly with representatives of State and local government law enforcement and emergency planning authorities. The Stafford Act is amended to provide pre-event planning assistance for states preparing against major disasters involving weapons of mass destruction. Technical assistance can be provided by designated US departments or agencies. Additionally, a report to Congress is required. The President must report to Congress within one year of the enactment of the Act on the actions taken to implement specific sections of the Stafford Act and the costs involved."
