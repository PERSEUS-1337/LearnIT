    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature aims to encourage counties to establish jail industries to help inmates succeed upon release and reduce recidivism. Small and disabled veteran businesses should have equal opportunities to provide goods and services to county-run jail facilities. Chapter 2.5 of the Penal Code is amended to create the Jail Industry Authority. Section 4325 is repealed and a new Section 4325 is added. The Legislature encourages counties to establish jail industries to support inmate reentry and reduce recidivism. Section 4325 of the Penal Code allows certain counties to create a Jail Industry Authority within their jail system, enabling the employment of prisoners in industrial, agricultural, or service programs. The goal is to provide working conditions similar to private industry. To support inmate reentry and reduce recidivism, counties are encouraged to establish jail industries. Inmates can work to earn funds, improve work habits, and acquire skills. Participation in programs may earn additional time credits. The goal is for the work program to be self-supporting by selling products and services to cover expenses. Section 4326 of the Penal Code is repealed, and Section 4327 is amended. SEC. 6. The board of supervisors shall establish a Jail Industries Fund for funding the operations of the Jail Industry Program. All income from jail industries will be deposited into this fund. SEC. 7. Section 4329 of the Penal Code is repealed. SEC. 8. Counties must meet certain criteria to receive funds from General Obligation Bonds for correctional facilities. In the design and planning of facilities financed under the County Correctional Facility Capital Expenditure and Youth Facility Bond Act of 1988, products from the Prison Industry Authority or local Jail Industry Authorities must be used unless proven impractical or unsuitable. Counties and cities must consult with Prison Industry Authority or local Jail Industry Authority for product development. The Board of State and Community Corrections or Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation must approve county plans before entering into contracts. Section 4497.52 of the Penal Code is amended. Section 4497.52 of the Penal Code is amended to allow counties or cities to purchase products from the Prison Industry Authority or local Jail Industry Authority without the need for bids or compliance with the Public Contract Code. The Legislature deems a special law necessary for specific counties due to their unique needs."
