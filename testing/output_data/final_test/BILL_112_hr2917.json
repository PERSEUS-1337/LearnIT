The \"Restoration of State Sovereignty Act of 2011\" ensures that states retain rights and authorities unless expressly waived. Federal financial assistance under grant programs can only be received by a state if approved by its legislature. The \"Restoration of State Sovereignty Act of 2011\" requires state legislature approval for receiving federal financial assistance under grant programs, with exceptions for certain programs like the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and Title 38, United States Code. States with biennial legislatures have a special rule under this act. The \"Restoration of State Sovereignty Act of 2011\" mandates state legislature approval for federal financial assistance under grant programs, with exceptions for specific programs. For states with biennial legislatures, there are special rules in place. The definition of \"authority of a State\" includes administering agencies, officers, employees, and local government authorities. The section applies to the State, its officers, employees, and local government authorities. It becomes effective in each State 90 days after the first regular session of the legislature that begins 5 years after the Act's enactment, continuing until changed by law. SEC. 3. DEDICATION OF SAVINGS TO DEFICIT REDUCTION. Upon determination that Federal financial assistance cannot be released to a State for a fiscal year, a statement of excess grant funds must be prepared and provided to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. The amount involved will be rescinded from the funds available for the grant program in the applicable appropriation Act for the fiscal year. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget must submit an annual report to Congress detailing the total amount of rescissions made during the fiscal year and categorizing them by appropriation Acts, accounts, and programs. For states with biennial legislatures, the required statement on excess grant funds is only prepared for fiscal years when the state legislature meets. In this Act, a \"State with a biennial legislature\" is defined as a state whose legislature meets every other year."
