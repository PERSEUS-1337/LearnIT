    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Highway Trust Fund Integrity Act of 1997\" and includes findings. Congress finds that the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 split the Federal budgeting process into two categories, one for receipts and mandatory spending, and the other for discretionary spending. The Highway Trust Fund is split between these categories, leading to a disconnect between taxes deposited into the fund and transportation spending. To reestablish this link, all components of the Highway Trust Fund should be in the same budget category. The Trust Fund should be in the same budget category and follow the same budget rules and procedures. SEC. 3. DEFINITION. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 is amended to include a definition of a revenue constrained fund related to the Highway Trust Fund. This fund is not considered part of discretionary appropriations categories. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 is amended to define a revenue constrained fund related to the Highway Trust Fund, which is not part of discretionary appropriations. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 defines a revenue constrained fund related to the Highway Trust Fund. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 defines revenue constrained funds under Part A of title IV of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 defines revenue constrained funds and sets limits on increasing new budget authority for these funds in the House of Representatives and the Senate. Amendments are made to the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to enforce these limits. \"Sec. 408. Revenue constrained funds. SEC. 5. SEQUESTER. Part C of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 is amended to include sequestration with respect to revenue constrained funds.\" On October 1 of each year, OMB estimates the total revenues deposited into each revenue constrained fund in the previous fiscal year. 40 percent of this total amount is available for obligation in the budget year. On December 15 of each year, OMB determines the total revenues deposited into revenue constrained funds in the previous fiscal year. The total amount available for obligation in the budget year is equal to the total amount of revenues deposited. This amount replaces the 40 percent made available on October 1. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 is amended to reduce the level set forth in subsection (b)(2) for the next fiscal year by the amount of any budgetary excess in a revenue constrained fund for the current fiscal year. \"Sec. 251B. Sequestration with respect to revenue constrained funds. SEC. 5. BUDGETARY IMPACT.\" The Congress acknowledges the substantial surface transportation and infrastructure needs in the United States and aims to address them through additional spending from the Highway Account of the Highway Trust Fund. The purpose is to ensure that any budgetary offset required due to this Act's spending does not impact surface transportation programs. The budgetary impact of the amendments will not be considered for sequestration purposes under specific sections of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. OMB will reduce discretionary spending limits for budget authority and outlays in accordance with the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 for each fiscal year. This reduction includes the total amount of discretionary budget authority provided from the Highway Account of the Highway Trust Fund in the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1997. Additionally, it includes an estimate of the amount of discretionary outlays that would be expended from the Highway Account of the Highway Trust Fund. The Highway Trust Fund in the Department of Transportation will see reductions in discretionary spending limits for budget authority and outlays as per the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. This includes new budget authority and obligation authority provided in the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1997. SEC. 6. STUDY TO ENSURE THAT THE HIGHWAY TRUST FUND IS DEFICIT NEUTRAL. The Congress finds that the Highway Trust Fund should not contribute to the Federal Government's budget deficit. Increases in Fund revenue from tax hikes are partially offset by a 25 percent reduction in other Federal revenues. This offset applies to all excise taxes, not just those for the Highway Trust Fund. An updated examination of this offset's application to Fund taxes is necessary. The Secretary of Treasury, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, must submit a report to Congress within 24 months of the Act's enactment on ensuring deficit neutrality of the Highway Trust Fund. The report will determine the deductibility of Fund taxes from other Federal taxes, estimate the amount of taxes deducted, and assess the annual revenue loss due to tax deductibility. The report will determine the deductibility of Highway Trust Fund taxes from other Federal taxes and provide policy options to prevent tax changes from contributing to the deficit."
