    "content": "In March 2011, AT&T announced an agreement to acquire T-Mobile USA for $25 billion in cash and $14 billion in stock, subject to regulatory approval. The merger would make AT&T the largest mobile wireless service provider in the US. If the merger fails, AT&T would pay a $3 billion breakup fee. The DOJ filed a complaint to block the $39 billion merger between AT&T and T-Mobile, alleging it would harm competition in the mobile wireless telecommunications market. AT&T responded that it would \"vigorously contest\" the complaint. The FCC required proof that the transfer of control of a radio spectrum license would be in the public interest. AT&T and Deutsche Telekom filed their applications, sparking public comments and petitions against the transfer. On November 22, 2011, the FCC announced a draft order for an administrative hearing on the proposed merger between AT&T and T-Mobile due to unresolved questions of fact. The next day, AT&T and Deutsche Telekom withdrew their applications, with AT&T stating it was considering re-filing them later. On November 29, 2011, the FCC granted the request to withdraw the merger applications \"without prejudice,\" allowing for re-filing in the future. The staff report concluded that the merger would harm competition and that AT&T and T-Mobile failed to show enough benefits to outweigh this harm. The DOJ lawsuit was delayed in December 2011, giving AT&T and T-Mobile time to consider their options. On December 19, 2011, AT&T announced the end of its bid to acquire T-Mobile, delaying the proceedings. The judge required a report on their proposed transaction status by January 12, 2012. Supporters claim the merger would lead to improved services, lower prices, and innovation. The proposed merger between AT&T and T-Mobile has sparked debate. Supporters argue it would improve service offerings, lower prices, and drive innovation. Opponents fear it would give AT&T too much power, making it difficult for competitors to compete. AT&T has been gaining subscribers, while T-Mobile has been losing them, partly due to AT&T's focus on high-end customers seeking advanced data services. AT&T and T-Mobile target different customer segments, with AT&T focusing on high-end customers seeking advanced data services, while T-Mobile caters to value customers sensitive to price. Both companies have compatible networks based on older wireless technology standards, allowing devices to work on both networks. AT&T holds significant spectrum in various frequency bands, including lower frequency bands known for superior coverage. AT&T has substantial holdings in the PCS and AWS frequency bands, providing essential backhaul facilities for mobile providers. They are also a major wireline broadband provider, offering alternatives for broadband capabilities in a market convergence trend. AT&T and T-Mobile propose a merger to address network spectrum and capacity constraints, aiming to deploy 4G LTE technology for advanced mobile broadband services. LTE is seen as the preferred technology by major wireless carriers like Verizon Wireless. The merger is defended by both companies as not reducing competition in the market. AT&T claims that the merger with T-Mobile would create an efficient capacity-enhancing combination, allowing for increased output, improved quality, and lower prices. They argue that the merger would enable them to deploy LTE to more than 97% of Americans, significantly more than their current plans. This move is seen as a response to the federal government's slow adoption of spectrum policy changes needed for network expansion. The government is slow in adopting spectrum policy changes needed for mobile wireless services. DOJ claims the merger between AT&T and T-Mobile would lessen competition, leading to higher prices and lower quality services. DOJ asserts that T-Mobile's innovative approach and focus on value leadership in the wireless service market are key factors in the anticompetitive effects of the proposed merger with AT&T. T-Mobile's emphasis on aggressive pricing and network development has positioned it as a strong challenger in the industry, prompting competitive pressure on other carriers. The company aims to make smartphones more affordable for the average consumer, further solidifying its market position. The DOJ argues that the removal of T-Mobile as a competitor in the wireless market would lead to a significant loss of competition in 97 cellular market areas in the US. It also claims that T-Mobile's focus on becoming a bigger player in the enterprise market would be hindered by the merger with AT&T, reducing competition and potentially leading to higher prices for consumers. The FCC's public interest standard for reviewing the proposed merger is broader than the DOJ's standard, focusing on national broadband access and increasing adoption, especially in rural and low-income households. If the merger allows AT&T to expand its broadband network, it could counter anticompetitive effects. The FCC is expected to consider the impact of the proposed merger on wireless broadband availability in its public interest analysis. Sprint and Cellular South have filed petitions and lawsuits opposing the merger, arguing that it would not be in the public interest and could cause antitrust issues. Judge Huvelle ruled that both companies have standing to make claims of possible business damages from the merger. The opponents of the merger argue that it would give AT&T too much control over the mobile wireless market, potentially stifling competition. They claim that AT&T's dominance could harm other wireless service providers and consumers. The opponents of the merger argue that AT&T's strategic decisions, including anticompetitive practices, aimed to weaken T-Mobile. They believe a combined entity would further strengthen AT&T's position to dominate the market, especially with T-Mobile's spectrum holdings. AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon together control a significant portion of U.S. mobile wireless subscribers and revenues. Tycoon Research confirms that AT&T and Verizon have higher revenues per subscriber compared to other providers targeting price-sensitive customers. AT&T argues for a merger citing a unique spectrum shortage not shared by competitors. However, most supporting data is redacted, making it difficult to verify claims. Price-sensitive customers with lower revenues per user tend to have higher churn rates due to less customer loyalty. AT&T faces network-capacity challenges due to spectrum constraints and the need to maintain multiple technology generations. Despite competitors potentially facing similar issues in the future, AT&T claims to have sufficient spectrum for now. The company has been adding thousands of cell sites to expand its network. AT&T is addressing network-capacity challenges by adding cell sites and deploying antenna systems and Wi-Fi hotspots. However, these are temporary solutions that do not solve the underlying spectrum shortage issue. T-Mobile also faces challenges with LTE deployment and projected growth in data services demand. T-Mobile needs additional spectrum for LTE deployment, but parent company Deutsche Telekom won't invest. Merging with AT&T provides a solution to capacity constraints, as their spectrum and networks are complementary. The merger between AT&T and T-Mobile would create a combined network with substantial synergies, allowing for increased overall output and benefiting consumers. The integration of cell sites would expand network capacity, improve spectrum usage efficiency, and provide additional spectrum for LTE services. AT&T claims that the merger with T-Mobile would result in more spectrally efficient LTE services, allowing for LTE coverage in markets where neither company could offer it separately. Customers would benefit from fewer dropped calls, better coverage, faster data services, and T-Mobile's customer care practices. The merger would also expand LTE deployment to reach 97% of the U.S. population, supporting applications like telemedicine and online gaming. T-Mobile customers would benefit from the merger with AT&T by gaining access to LTE services, a broader range of devices, faster data speeds, and a fuller range of rate plans. AT&T argues that alternative solutions to capacity challenges would be inferior and costly. These alternatives include adding cell sites, deploying antenna systems, and purchasing or leasing spectrum. AT&T claims that the spectrum it is purchasing from Qualcomm is one-way and cannot be integrated into two-way wireless technologies until LTE specifications are developed in 2012. The merger would allow for wider LTE deployment, stimulating economic growth and creating jobs, especially in rural areas with limited broadband access. The spectrum likely won't be available until 2014 at the earliest. AT&T argues that the merger and LTE deployment will improve low latency rates, benefiting online applications like distance learning, video conferencing, and gaming. They claim it will stimulate investment in cloud computing and mobile applications, help bridge the digital divide, enhance public safety, and preserve America's global leadership. AT&T argues that the merger would promote competition in the mobile wireless market by leveraging spectrum and network efficiencies to expand capacity and output, leading to strong price competition. The market is characterized by accelerating growth, quality improvements, falling prices due to consolidation, investment in network infrastructure, and fierce competition based on price and service quality. AT&T argues that the mobile wireless marketplace would remain highly competitive following the merger because three-quarters of Americans live in areas that would still be served by at least four facilities-based providers. They also mention the availability of mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) like TracFone and the potential spectrum from LightSquared for new retail service providers. AT&T asserts that it is not a close competitor with T-Mobile. AT&T argues that the departure of T-Mobile from the market would have minimal competitive effect as other providers like Sprint, MetroPCS, and Leap are more effective competitors. They propose a more efficient capacity-enhancing combination to replace capacity-constrained providers, creating market incentives for expanded output, higher quality, and lower prices. AT&T suggests that the DOJ should focus on the provision of mobile broadband services using advanced networks for its antitrust analysis. AT&T argues that regional providers compete in the same product market as carriers that market nationally but only in some local geographic markets. They suggest the FCC use a \"spectrum screen\" to determine if additional scrutiny is needed for proposed mergers involving spectrum licenses. AT&T proposes expanding the FCC's spectrum screen for merger reviews to include 90 MHz of mobile satellite service spectrum and all 194 MHz of Broadband Radio Services spectrum. This is to address concerns that the current screen overstates competition threats by excluding available spectrum for mobile telephony and broadband services. AT&T suggests expanding the FCC's spectrum screen for merger reviews to include 90 MHz of mobile satellite service spectrum and all 194 MHz of Broadband Radio Services spectrum. This is to address concerns that the current screen overstates competition threats by excluding available spectrum for mobile telephony and broadband services. AT&T identifies strong competition from Verizon Wireless and Sprint in the mobile wireless market. Verizon Wireless competes aggressively with AT&T, deploying 4G LTE and targeting AT&T in advertising. Sprint, the third-largest provider, is increasing subscribers and scores well in customer satisfaction surveys. MetroPCS and Leap, industry mavericks offering aggressively priced unlimited voice and data plans, are gaining customers from AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile. MetroPCS now provides LTE services in major markets, aiming to offer the best value for data at the high-end. U.S. Cellular, Cellular South, and Allied are also players in the competitive mobile market. Clearwire, owned by a consortium of Sprint, Comcast, Time Warner Cable, Intel, Google, and Bright House Networks, is the largest holder of spectrum in the United States, offering retail 4G data services in the 2.5-2.6 GHz band. LightSquared plans to deploy a nationwide 4G LTE network in 2011, with agreements with Leap and Open Range for spectrum leasing. LightSquared has agreements with Leap and Open Range for spectrum leasing. AT&T argues that their merger with T-Mobile will not lead to anticompetitive coordination due to the diverse nature of the wireless market. AT&T argues that the merger with T-Mobile would not result in anticompetitive unilateral effects, as it would increase output and lower prices. They also mention that T-Mobile does not currently constrain AT&T's behavior and that new entry threats from other companies minimize concerns about unilateral effects. AT&T argues that the merger with T-Mobile would not lead to anticompetitive effects, citing examples from Western Europe and Japan. Critics of the merger have filed petitions against it, disagreeing with AT&T's characterization of T-Mobile as unable to compete effectively. The proposed merger of a national provider would limit consumer options and leave Sprint as the only competitor to AT&T and Verizon Wireless, but Sprint would be at a significant disadvantage in size and network capabilities. Sprint's reliance on Clearwire's 4G WiMAX network may not be as competitive as the LTE networks of its rivals. The proposed merger raises concerns about limiting consumer options and leaving Sprint as the only competitor to AT&T and Verizon Wireless. Sprint's reliance on Clearwire's WiMAX network may not be as competitive as LTE networks. There are objections to the merger, including challenges for smaller competitors to compete in the high-end market against AT&T and Verizon Wireless. These competitors may face difficulties in accessing handset arrangements and data roaming. Critics are concerned that the proposed merger between AT&T and Verizon Wireless will create a duopoly in the wireless market, leading to pressure on remaining providers to seek partnerships for competitiveness. There is speculation that Verizon Wireless may try to acquire Sprint. Some critics disagree with AT&T's argument that market concentration in overseas markets is not undesirable, as the U.S. market can support more providers at an efficient scale. The U.S. market can support more wireless providers at an efficient scale due to economies of scale and scope. While consolidation may bring cost efficiencies, it could also reduce competition and innovation in a rapidly changing market. Consolidation in the wireless market may lead to less pressure for innovation and cost restraint. However, it could also hinder dynamic efficiency by giving dominant market share to a few providers. Spectrum availability is crucial for mobile wireless services, with AT&T citing spectrum shortage as a key reason for a proposed merger. The FCC is making additional spectrum available to meet the growing demand for mobile data services. Increased investment in network facilities can expand the capacity of spectrum for mobile wireless traffic. Increased investment in network facilities can expand the capacity of spectrum for mobile wireless traffic, but throwing spectrum at a perceived shortage may not incentivize efficiency and innovation. If additional spectrum is obtained through a merger, it is unlikely to go unused. The FCC implemented a \"spectrum cap\" to prevent any entity from controlling more than 45 megahertz of the available 190 megahertz of spectrum for mobile wireless use. This was to maintain competition and prevent one firm from limiting spectrum availability for other providers. The FCC eliminated the spectrum cap in 2003 to allow for a case-by-case market analysis of proposed mergers, using a \"spectrum screen\" to trigger more intensive review in markets where the merged entity would hold more than one-third of the available spectrum. AT&T has proposed adding certain spectrum for mobile wireless use to the spectrum pool for the screen calculation. Tables and charts from the FCC's Fourteenth Mobile Wireless Competition Report show the spectrum holdings of various mobile wireless providers. Three major carriers, Verizon Wireless, AT&T, and Sprint Nextel, dominate the low frequency spectrum for mobile wireless. Clearwire has a significant amount of spectrum in the 2.5 GHz band, while T-Mobile, AT&T, Verizon Wireless, and Sprint Nextel have PCS and AWS spectrum in the 1.7-2.1 GHz range. The FCC emphasizes that low-band spectrum can provide the same service at a lower cost compared to higher-frequency bands. Licensees with higher frequency holdings may need to build more cell sites at additional cost to match coverage provided by lower frequency bands. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed a propagation model comparing the 700 MHz, 1.9 GHz, and 2.4 GHz spectrum bands. It concluded that coverage using the same transmission power differed significantly, translating into the need for less infrastructure. An analysis using the Okumura-Hata model shows that rural, suburban, and urban cell sizes at 700 MHz are more than three times larger than cells in the PCS band. The FCC concluded that spectrum resources in different frequency bands have distinguishing features that can make some frequency bands more favorable for coverage. Providers with spectrum assets below 1 GHz may have competitive advantages in rural areas and buildings due to superior propagation characteristics. Holding a mix of frequency ranges can optimize service quality at low cost. AT&T's spectrum shortage despite similar holdings to Verizon Wireless has raised questions about dropped calls in key cities. AT&T faces spectrum shortage causing dropped calls and slow data speeds in key cities, unlike Verizon Wireless. Critics claim AT&T has unused spectrum in top markets. AT&T attributes shortage to allocating spectrum to 2G and 3G customers, limiting capacity for data traffic. Despite congestion since iPhone introduction in 2007, AT&T's wireless capital expenditures only increased by 1% in 2009, while Verizon Wireless increased by 10%. AT&T's wireless capital expenditures only increased by 1% in 2009, while Verizon Wireless increased by 10%. The proposed merger may be the most efficient way for AT&T to expand its capacity, but concerns arise about potential consumer harm from spectrum concentration. AT&T projects slower growth in data traffic, prompting questions about addressing capacity shortages through network investment versus spectrum acquisition. AT&T argues that the FCC overlooks available spectrum for mobile wireless use, including MSS/ATC and BRS/EBS bands. This additional spectrum would lower market shares for firms like AT&T and T-Mobile. AT&T's proposed change in the spectrum screen does not consider the challenges and delays in making new spectrum available for use. The 700 MHz spectrum purchased from Qualcomm may not be available until 2014 due to technical specifications and equipment development. This suggests an even longer delay for the LightSquared spectrum, as the 700 MHz band has had more time for standards and developments compared to the MSS band. The MSS spectrum faces interference issues that need to be resolved before mobile wireless usage is allowed. The 700 MHz band has better propagation properties than the 1.5-2.2 GHz MMS band, requiring less network capital investment for comparable capacity. Equipment manufacturers may be less motivated to develop equipment for smaller market share firms or unproven spectrum in the mobile wireless market. The lag in availability of high frequency spectrum for mobile wireless market may be longer than Qualcomm spectrum. Network infrastructure includes base stations with transceivers, antennas, power supply, switches, gateways, and back-office capabilities for wireless carriers. The communications tower industry is competitive, making it efficient for new wireless carriers to co-locate on existing structures. The proposed merger between AT&T and T-Mobile may allow for consolidation of antennas to better positions, potentially freeing up tower placements for competitors. Regulatory bodies are reviewing detailed information about AT&T's LTE network plans. The FCC and DOJ are reviewing detailed information about AT&T's LTE network plans, including the impact of the proposed merger on network infrastructure investment. AT&T claims it will expand its LTE network to cover a significant portion of the US, especially in less populated areas. Concerns arise about AT&T's capacity issues and network investment, raising questions about the likelihood of the merged company to provide high-quality service throughout its service area. The FCC and DOJ are examining the impact of AT&T's proposed merger with T-Mobile on network infrastructure investment. AT&T plans to expand its LTE network, but concerns remain about its capacity issues and financing for the buildout. The merger is projected to result in operational savings and cost synergies exceeding $39 billion, with annual savings of $3 billion starting in year three. Financing for the network buildout remains unclear despite projected savings. Some carriers, like T-Mobile, have faced challenges in reaching data roaming agreements with other carriers, such as AT&T. In April 2011, the FCC mandated that providers of commercial mobile data services must offer data roaming arrangements to other providers on commercially reasonable terms. Verizon Wireless and AT&T, along with two FCC commissioners, argue that the FCC lacks the authority to impose data roaming requirements as it is not considered a \"commercial mobile service\" under the Communications Act. Verizon Wireless filed an appeal in the U.S. District Court of Appeals against the FCC's requirement. AT&T opposes negotiating data roaming arrangements, stating it would not expand its network to unserved areas if other carriers can negotiate freely. AT&T may not expand its LTE network to 97% of Americans as stated in its merger submission if data roaming requirements are not enforced by the FCC. The backhaul market is expected to grow due to the increase in wireless data traffic, with copper lines, microwave, and optical fiber being the main technologies for backhaul transmission. The backhaul market is expanding with the increase in wireless data traffic. Most backhaul is carried over copper lines, but microwave and optical fiber are also gaining share. Special access services for backhaul are purchased from third parties, with AT&T and Verizon controlling most of the special access lines. Sprint and T-Mobile are advocating for FCC intervention on special access rates, while AT&T and Verizon are opposed. Carriers are looking to transition to packet-based services and IP technology. In the backhaul market, wireless carriers are transitioning to IP technology to meet increased demand. AT&T provides essential backhaul facilities to mobile wireless providers, but Sprint argues that the proposed merger with T-Mobile would limit options for backhaul services, making independent carriers more dependent on AT&T and Verizon. Sprint advocates for FCC intervention on special access rates. Consumer surveys show that handsets and devices are increasingly important in the mobile wireless market, with 38% of respondents switching providers to obtain desired handsets. The market is seeing growth in handset manufacturers and models, particularly with the rise of innovative smartphones. The mobile wireless market is seeing an increasing share of the market with manufacturers making separate handsets for each network technology. Two important business models are bundling wireless service subscriptions with handset purchases and exclusive handset arrangements. Bundling contracts require consumers to purchase a wireless service subscription for a minimum of one or two years along with the handset. Service providers enforce these contracts by \"locking\" the handsets. The mobile wireless market offers bundled contracts where consumers must purchase a wireless service subscription along with a handset for a minimum period. Service providers lock subsidized devices to prevent porting and charge early termination fees for breaking the contract. Subsidized rates for devices make bundled offers appealing, especially for high-end consumers. There is a growing distinction between high-end consumers and value customers who prefer prepaid plans with smaller handset subsidies. In the mobile wireless market, there is a distinction between prepaid and post-paid plans, with post-paid plans offering smaller handset subsidies due to higher churn rates. Carriers serving the high-end market are protected from price competition. Exclusive handset agreements involve a manufacturer selling a specific model to only one service provider for a set period, as seen with Apple and AT&T for the iPhone. Verizon Wireless and Sprint also have agreements for iPhones. EHAs often involve shared financial commitments and market exclusivity. Exclusive Handset Agreements (EHAs) involve sharing financial commitments and market risks between manufacturers and service providers. Manufacturers typically take on R&D commitments while providers handle marketing and minimum volume commitments. EHAs are common with providers that have large customer bases and extensive network penetration. Smaller rural carriers have complained about EHAs, like the AT&T-iPhone agreement, putting them at a competitive disadvantage. Post-merger AT&T and the old Bell monopoly have differences despite both being descendants of the Bell monopoly. AT&T and the old Bell monopoly, broken up in 1984, do not compete in wireline services but compete in mobile wireless with Verizon. The old Bell monopoly was regulated federally and at the state level. Data roaming regulation is challenged by Verizon Wireless. The mobile wireless industry's early history is noted. The early history of the mobile wireless industry dates back to 1982 when the FCC allocated cellular spectrum, giving Bell Companies a head start due to their wireline investments. This hindered the development of new technologies until more spectrum became available, allowing new companies to enter the market. The AT&T submission fails to address this impact. The AT&T submission for the proposed merger lacks mention of global competition impact and focuses minimally on the enterprise market. It is notable that the merger could be part of a global market strategy, with Deutsche Telekom gaining an 8% share of AT&T. However, there is no mention of how the merger could benefit AT&T in global markets where it competes with other providers like Deutsche Telekom. The proposed merger between AT&T and Deutsche Telekom raises concerns about competition in the global telecommunications market, especially regarding GSM technology. International organizations and corporations have expressed worries about the lack of competition in the U.S. for GSM-based wireless services. International travelers to the United States may face increased costs for roaming services if AT&T merges with Deutsche Telekom, as they would lose the option to seek such services from T-Mobile. This could lead to higher rates for international carriers and visitors making calls to the U.S."
