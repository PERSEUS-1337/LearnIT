Various commanders reiterated and modified the threat, with some attempting to downplay the conflict during naval exercises. Iran threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz from December 2011 to January 2012, in response to potential sanctions on its oil exports. This threat was seen as a defense of its critical oil exports, which provide a significant portion of its export earnings and government revenues. The warnings came amidst increasing likelihood of multilateral sanctions that could impact Iran's oil export earnings. Previous sanctions targeted Iran's energy sector but not its ability to export oil directly. In response to sanctions on its oil exports, Iran threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz from December 2011 to January 2012. This led to the expulsion of the British Ambassador to Iran and the ransacking of the British Embassy in Tehran. The events coincided with the passing of a bill sanctioning foreign banks doing business with Iran's Central Bank. The EU considered an embargo on Iranian oil purchases, which was agreed upon by EU foreign ministers on January 23, 2012. The narrow Strait of Hormuz, at 22 nautical miles wide, is crucial for Iranian oil exports and commerce. Iran's dependence on the strait shapes international policy debates, but closing it is unlikely due to its own reliance on the waterway for trade. The EU's embargo on Iran's oil could lead to Iran closing the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial waterway for Iranian oil exports. This move could provoke conflict with the United States. Iran's potential conflict with the United States over the Strait of Hormuz could lead to U.S. military action to reopen the waterway and destroy Iran's military and nuclear infrastructure. Threatening traffic through the straits may alienate other nations, including China, Iran's largest customer for oil imports. China and India have indicated they will continue to buy Iranian crude, but payment difficulties have led to a reduction in Chinese imports in early 2012. Iran has invested in capabilities to potentially block the Strait of Hormuz, but the US has measures in place to counter this. Iran's naval capabilities are divided between the regular Navy and the Revolutionary Guard Navy. The regular Navy controls larger ships and submarines, while the Revolutionary Guard Navy is politically powerful. The IRGC Navy, allied to Iran's hardliners, patrols the Strait of Hormuz and Persian Gulf with a lighter fleet. It is more willing to undertake operations without full approval. Iran's naval forces have developed asymmetric warfare capabilities post Iran-Iraq war. Key capabilities include mines. Iran's inventory includes up to 5,000 mines of various types, making mine-clearing operations challenging, especially when countering other Iranian forces like speed boats and shore-based cruise missiles. The IRGC Navy's small fleet and unconventional tactics pose a threat for asymmetric warfare. The IRGC Navy poses a threat for asymmetric warfare with its small fleet and unconventional tactics, such as \"swarming\" with cruise-missile armed small boats. They control a variety of ships, including China-supplied missile patrol boats and Iran-made patrol craft. Iran's naval capabilities include MK-13 patrol craft armed with cruise missiles and torpedoes, PEYKAAP patrol craft, Boghammer fast-patrol boats, small boats designed in Italy, Kilo-class submarines, and coastal cruise missiles like CSS-C-2 \"Seersucker\" and China-made C-801. The IRGC Navy controls batteries of anti-ship missiles along Iran's coast, including C-802 used by Hezbollah in 2006. Iran may disrupt shipping in the Gulf to deter pressure from the US and its partners. They could start with low-intensity tactics and escalate to more violent options over time. Iran has the potential to disrupt shipping in the Gulf by implementing various violent options, such as declaring the Strait of Hormuz closed to shipping, intercepting or attacking ships, using speed boats to harass vessels, and mining the Strait. Iran has the potential to disrupt shipping in the Gulf by attacking selected ships transiting the Strait or other parts of the Gulf, mining the Strait, and declaring foreign naval ships operating in certain waters outside the Strait subject to attack. They may use submarines, surface ships, shore-based cruise missiles, and aircraft to target foreign naval ships. In response to U.S. and coalition military actions, Iran could expand its options to include using theater ballistic missiles, submarines, commandos, or aircraft to attack military or economic land targets on the western side of the Gulf, and ordering terrorist attacks in the region and beyond. Iran responded to Iraq's air superiority during the Iran-Iraq war by laying mines in the Gulf and using cruise missiles to target oil tankers. This led to U.S. operation Earnest Will to protect Kuwaiti tankers and de-mine the Gulf. The U.S. launched operation Praying Mantis after a mine struck the U.S.S. Samuel B. Roberts, resulting in the destruction of 25% of Iran's naval fleet. Iran's failed attempt to use \"swarming\" tactics against a fixed target in October 1987 involved sending a flotilla of small boats. In October 1987, Iran attempted to attack the Saudi-Kuwaiti offshore oil terminal at Khafji but was repelled by Saudi Arabia's air force. Iran's military buildup in the Gulf in the mid-1990s raised concerns among the U.S. and Gulf states. In March 2007, Iran detained British marines for two weeks, claiming they had entered its territorial waters. Resuming nuclear talks with the P5+1 could help reduce Iran's threat to the region. Iran has shown interest in resuming nuclear talks with the P5+1 group to assure the international community of the peaceful nature of its nuclear program. Despite positive statements from Iranian officials, no formal response has been sent, and no talks are scheduled yet. Progress in these talks could lead to a potential easing of EU sanctions against Iran. Iran allowed an International Atomic Energy Agency team to visit Iran to discuss past nuclear activities. U.S. officials warned against any attempt by Iran to close the Strait of Hormuz, stating it would not be tolerated. On January 8, 2012, U.S. officials, including Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta and General Martin Dempsey, warned that any attempt to close the Strait of Hormuz would be considered intolerable and provoke a response. The Obama Administration also communicated through a secret channel to Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, emphasizing that blocking the strait would cross a 'red line' for the U.S. Experts and observers believe the United States will act against Iranian efforts to disrupt commerce in the Strait of Hormuz. Iran has the military capacity to interfere with shipping using various means, but the U.S. military, alone or with coalition partners, can counter these actions and restore order. The United States, with coalition partners, has the capability to counter Iran's forces and restore shipping flow in the event of disruption in the Strait of Hormuz. This effort may take time, potentially days to months, especially if Iranian mines need clearing. U.S. forces are monitoring for mine deployment to prevent extensive military engagement. Naval analysts estimate varying timelines for reopening the strait, but agree that Iran's naval forces could be ultimately destroyed if they inflict damage. Iran could block the strait if they choose to do so. \"Iran could disrupt traffic through the Strait of Hormuz, but likely cannot completely shut down the world's most important oil route. Their goal would be to panic markets, raise shipping insurance rates, and increase world oil prices to pressure the United States to back down on sanctions. An Iranian attempt to close the Gulf to shipping could lead to various forms of response from the U.S. and coalition military forces.\" The possibility of a military confrontation between Iran and the United States and coalition partners over shipping in the Gulf carries a risk of escalating to a wider conflict. This complicates U.S. defense policy following a troop pullout from Iraq and the announcement of new defense guidance. The new defense guidance emphasizes the Asia-Pacific region and investing in capabilities to counter moves by Iran or China. UK forces may join US forces in responding to an Iranian attempt to close the Gulf. Britain has sent additional warships to the Gulf to augment US capabilities. Other potential coalition partners include western allies and the Gulf Cooperation. Potential coalition partners could include western allies, the Gulf Cooperation Council states, and Asian oil consumers who are concerned about disruptions in the Strait. US and coalition military actions would be tailored based on Iran's actions, such as clearing mines, organizing convoys, establishing protected shipping corridors, and defending against Iranian attacks. Options could extend to air strikes against Iranian anti-ship weapons and military assets not directly involved in closing the Gulf. Shore-based Iranian military assets, potentially linked to nuclear weapon development, could be targeted by US and coalition forces. Attacks may focus on IRGC assets or broader Iranian military assets. Limited mine-clearing assets in Bahrain pose a challenge for mine-clearing operations in the Gulf. The additional minesweepers provided by coalition partners at Bahrain could help mitigate the need for the United States to transport more mine-clearing ships and helicopters. U.S. and coalition forces could use ship-based guns, missiles, aircraft, and helicopters armed with missiles, rockets, guided bombs, and guns to counter Iranian speed boats and surface craft. Iran could make it challenging by dispersing its speed boats along the Persian Gulf shoreline. U.S. and coalition military leaders might keep their warships out of confined waters until the threat posed by speed boats has been suppressed. Iran's shore-based anti-ship cruise missiles are mobile and camouflaged, making them difficult to locate and destroy. Radars providing targeting for these missiles are in fixed locations, easier to attack. Detecting well-maintained Kilo-class submarines near choke points like the Strait of Hormuz poses a challenge for navies. Iran's Kilo-class submarines near choke points like the Strait of Hormuz are a challenge for navies due to their limited endurance and vulnerability when surfaced. Mini-submarines in the Gulf are difficult to detect but also have limited endurance and payload capacity. The global oil market relies on the Strait of Hormuz. The global oil market heavily relies on the key artery of the Strait of Hormuz, through which Persian Gulf oil exporters ship about 17 million barrels a day. This accounts for roughly 20% of the global oil market and 35% of seaborne trade. Additionally, more than a quarter of the world's liquefied natural gas trade moves through the strait, primarily exports from Qatar to Europe and Asia. The Persian Gulf is home to the world's spare oil production capacity, mainly held by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the UAE. This spare capacity serves as a cushion for the oil market to offset supply disruptions, but it would not be available to offset a disruption to the vital shipping route of the Strait of Hormuz. Saudi Arabia could potentially redirect 1.5 Mb/d of oil exports through alternative routes in the event of a disruption. A disruption of oil through the Strait of Hormuz could significantly impact global oil prices, leading to Asian refineries seeking alternative oil sources. The Persian Gulf's spare oil production capacity held by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the UAE serves as a cushion for supply disruptions but would not offset a Strait of Hormuz disruption. Saudi Arabia could potentially redirect 1.5 Mb/d of oil exports through alternative routes in such an event. There is uncertainty on how disruptions could affect crude oil prices, with past Iran-related events not always leading to clear price increases. Factors like reduced global oil supply, risks of further reductions, and duration of disruptions play a key role. Damage to oil facilities in the Persian Gulf and responses from oil-importing countries are also important considerations. The potential closure of the Strait of Hormuz could lead to a significant increase in oil prices due to limited bypass options. However, outright closure may be unlikely and even if it occurs, it may not last long. Another possibility is the harassment of tanker traffic through the strait, which could also impact oil prices. The impact of harassment on tanker traffic through the Strait of Hormuz could reduce oil exports, raise transport costs, and increase concerns of future disruptions. Iran may use threatening statements to raise oil prices without military action, benefiting from increased revenues. Consumer countries could release strategic oil stocks to offset supply disruptions. The United States holds 696 million barrels of crude oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to offset supply disruptions. The SPR is coordinated with other members of the International Energy Agency (IEA) like Japan, Germany, and South Korea. IEA countries collectively released stocks three times in response to crises like Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 and Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. IEA countries collectively hold 4.2 billion barrels of crude oil and refined products in inventory, with 1.5 billion held by governments. Government-held stocks could be delivered to the market at a rate of 10.4 Mb/d of crude oil and 4 Mb/d of products in the first month of an IEA collective action. Strategic stock releases can help offset supply disruptions and stabilize oil prices. Additional resources include emergency stocks held by oil companies and demand restraint measures coordinated by IEA members. Iran has invested in military capability to close the Strait of Hormuz, but the threat of a military response from the United States and other countries makes it unlikely for Iran to attempt to do so. Iran has the option of harassing tanker traffic through the Gulf as more countries reduce Iranian exports. Iranian action may become more likely, but they could also continue making threats without acting or seek a diplomatic solution. A disruption of oil exports through the Strait of Hormuz would impact global oil prices, which could be offset by reserves. Concerns about a future disruption may also contribute to higher oil prices due to uncertainty. Iran's threats about the Strait of Hormuz could lead to higher oil prices, especially if they are seen as credible. Legislation to increase sanctions on Iran is pending in Congress, and the question of presidential authority to use force may arise if hostilities occur. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) was adopted in 1982 to establish a legal order for the seas and oceans, promoting peaceful uses and cooperation among nations. UNCLOS, adopted in 1982, governs international law for seas and oceans. It incorporates rules from the 1958 UN Convention on the High Seas and addresses various sea areas and resources. The US is not a party to UNCLOS, but it is seen as customary international law. Iran is a signatory, Oman has ratified it, and it covers straits used for international navigation. Part III of UNCLOS addresses the legal status of waters forming straits and authorized forms of passage. It includes provisions on transit passage and innocent passage, defining transit passage as the freedom of navigation for continuous and expeditious transit between high seas or exclusive economic zones. Vessels must comply with rights and duties while exercising transit passage. Ships and aircraft exercising the right of transit passage through straits must proceed without delay, refrain from using force against bordering states, and limit activities to normal transit unless necessary. Bordering states can enact laws related to safety, navigation, pollution, fishing, and trade, but these laws must not discriminate against foreign ships or impede transit passage. States can designate sea lanes and traffic separation schemes for maritime traffic safety. States bordering straits can designate sea lanes and traffic separation schemes to ensure safe passage of ships. The Straits of Hormuz have established sea lanes and a traffic separation scheme approved by the International Maritime Organization. They can change these schemes after consulting with the IMO. Ships in transit passage must adhere to these designated sea lanes and traffic separation schemes. Bordering states must not obstruct transit passage and must alert others to any navigation dangers in the strait. Transit passage in straits must not be suspended, and ships must adhere to designated sea lanes and traffic separation schemes."
