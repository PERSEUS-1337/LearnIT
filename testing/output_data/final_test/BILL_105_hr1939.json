    "content": "The \"Railroad Infrastructure Financing Improvement Act of 1997\" is also known as the \"Rail Infrastructure and Equipment Loans\" Act. It introduces a new chapter in the United States Code for direct loans and loan guarantees related to rail infrastructure and equipment. The term 'cost' in the context of direct loans or loan guarantees refers to the estimated long-term cost to the Government, calculated on a net present value basis. For direct loans, the cost includes loan disbursements, repayments of principal, and payments of interest adjusted for defaults, prepayments, fees, penalties, and recoveries. Loan guarantees' cost is also calculated on a net present value basis. The cost of a loan guarantee is determined by the net present value of estimated government payments for defaults, interest subsidies, and other fees, as well as estimated payments to the government. Any government action that changes the net present value of a direct loan or loan guarantee is considered a cost change. The net present value of a direct loan or loan guarantee is determined using the average interest rate on marketable Treasury securities of similar maturity. A direct loan is a disbursement of funds to a non-Federal borrower with a repayment requirement, including loan purchases or participations. A direct loan obligation is a binding agreement by the Secretary of Transportation to make a direct loan under specified conditions. The term 'loan guarantee' refers to a pledge for payment of debt obligations, excluding deposit insurance. A 'loan guarantee commitment' is a binding agreement to guarantee a loan when conditions are met. The term 'railroad carrier' is defined in section 20102. \"SEC. 22302. DIRECT LOANS AND LOAN GUARANTEES.\" The Secretary of Transportation can provide direct loans and loan guarantees for rail equipment, facilities, refinancing debt, and new railroad facilities. Operating expenses are not eligible for these loans. The Secretary of Transportation can provide direct loans and loan guarantees for rail projects that prioritize public safety, environmental enhancement, economic development, competitiveness in international markets, state-endorsed plans, and preserving rail service to small communities. The total amount of loans and guarantees under this section cannot exceed $5 billion at any given time. Interest rates for direct loans will be determined by the Secretary. The Secretary can provide direct loans and loan guarantees for rail projects, with interest rates set to recover costs. Loan guarantees will not exceed reasonable interest rates. The Secretary may accept infrastructure partners' assistance instead of budget appropriations. The Secretary may accept commitments from non-Federal sources to fund credit risk premiums for loans. The total appropriations and credit risk premiums for a loan must cover its cost. The amount of credit risk premiums is determined based on applicant circumstances, collateral, and loan disbursement schedule. The Secretary may accept commitments from non-Federal sources to fund credit risk premiums for loans. Credit risk premiums must be paid before loan disbursement and are determined based on various factors including repayment history, consultation with the Congressional Budget Office, and other relevant considerations. Cohorts of loans are established to manage credit risk premiums efficiently. The Secretary may return unused credit risk premiums and interest to the original source on a pro rata basis. Prerequisites for assistance include repayment within 25 years, justification based on demand for rail services, and assurance of economic utilization of facilities or equipment. The Secretary requires applicants to agree to terms ensuring the economic use of funds, repayment feasibility, and consistent loan purposes. Conditions include not diverting railroad funds for nonrail purposes. The applicant or railroad carrier must maintain its capital program, equipment, facilities, and operations on a continuing basis, refrain from making discretionary dividend payments that conflict with the loan purposes stated, and not divert funds for nonrail purposes. \"SEC. 22303. ADMINISTRATION OF DIRECT LOANS AND LOAN GUARANTEES.\" The Secretary of Transportation prescribes application requirements for assistance under section 22302, establishes terms for loans and guarantees, and allows for assignment of loan guarantees. Loan guarantees are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States, and modifications can be approved by the Secretary. The Secretary may approve modifications to a direct loan, loan guarantee, or loan guarantee commitment if it is deemed equitable and in the best interests of the United States. Compliance with the terms and conditions of the assistance, including regular inspections, is required. Loan guarantees are considered valid for claims by parties other than the Secretary. A loan guarantee or commitment approved by the Secretary is considered valid and legally binding, with conclusive evidence of compliance with the Act. The guarantee is incontestable in the hands of the holder, except in cases of fraud or misrepresentation. The Secretary will establish procedures for default on loans, ensuring terms and conditions are met. If a payment under the loan is in default for more than 30 days, the Secretary will pay the holder the unpaid guaranteed interest. If the default continues for over 90 days, 90 percent of the unpaid guaranteed principal will be paid. After resolving the default, any remaining guaranteed amounts not recovered will be paid to the holder. The Secretary is not obligated to make payments if certain conditions are met. The Secretary will pay the holder the unpaid guaranteed interest if a payment under the loan is in default for more than 30 days. If the default continues for over 90 days, 90 percent of the unpaid guaranteed principal will be paid. The holder shall not receive payment exceeding the actual loss, and the Secretary has rights of subrogation and property disposition. The Secretary has the authority to recondition, reconstruct, renovate, repair, maintain, operate, charter, rent, sell, or dispose of property obtained under this section without being subject to Federal or State regulatory requirements. In case of default on a direct or guaranteed loan under section 22302, the Secretary can bring a civil action in federal court in the name of the United States or the loan holder. The Secretary may accept property as payment for sums owed due to default.
