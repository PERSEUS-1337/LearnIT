The modified bill reduced funding for new construction projects by $9 billion and included provisions outside the committee's jurisdiction. Some Members criticized the funding mechanisms as inadequate. Some Members criticized the funding mechanisms of the modified surface transportation bill, H.R. 3763, as inadequate. Reid Ribble (R-WI) expressed disappointment in the phony pay-fors. The bill was modified after leaving the committee, with changes aimed at aligning revenue provisions with the Senate's version while preserving the policy language for future negotiations. The new version, Rules Committee Print 114-32, was presented on the House floor. The House floor considered Rules Committee Print 114-32 for H.R. 3763, with post-committee adjustments made through a special rule without allowing debate or a separate vote on the changes. The House adopted a special rule for post-committee adjustments to the highway bill, allowing changes to be made automatically before floor consideration. Congressional scholar Barbara Sinclair explains that adjustments are typically negotiated and incorporated into a substitute bill or amendment, avoiding the need to take legislation back to committee for formal revision. The House adopted a special rule for post-committee adjustments to the highway bill, allowing changes to be made automatically before floor consideration. This approach of establishing a Rules Committee print as the baseline text for consideration on the floor is an increasingly common method by which post-committee adjustments are made. In some instances, the text of a Rules print is considered as an amendment to the text of a committee-reported bill, and may itself be subject to further amendment. In recent Congresses, the House has increasingly started floor proceedings with a Rules print drafted by the Rules Committee in consultation with the House majority leadership and relevant committees. This technique allows for post-committee adjustments to be made before floor consideration, departing from the historical practice of initiating floor debate based on committee-reported legislation. The report examines the use of Rules prints for post-committee adjustments in legislation, highlighting the role of the Rules Committee in organizing House floor business. It assesses the qualitative and quantitative aspects of how textual changes are communicated to Members and staff, emphasizing the evolution of procedural adjustments made by the Rules Committee. The report analyzes the use of Rules prints for post-committee adjustments in legislation by comparing the number of sections in Rules Committee prints to reported bills since the 106th Congress. Floor time for legislation is limited on Capitol Hill due to the high volume of legislative proposals introduced each Congress. Choices must be made on which proposals to consider on the House floor. The House considers proposals based on importance and urgency, not just in the order they are reported by committees. House Rule XIV sets a daily order of business unless overridden by the House. Privilege is needed for a measure to be considered against Rule XIV, granting special legislative status for floor consideration. Privilege is a special status given to certain measures in the House, allowing them to be considered for floor action at any time, overriding the normal order of business specified in Rule XIV. Bills can obtain privilege through various House rules, including appropriations bills, budget resolutions, ethics committee resolutions, House administration committee measures, and proposals from the Rules Committee. House rules grant privileged access to certain measures on the House floor, allowing them to be considered at any time. Rule XV designates specific days for privileged legislative business, such as suspension of the rules on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays. Motions to discharge committees and bills on the Private Calendar have privilege on designated days of each month. House rules grant privileged access to certain measures on the House floor, allowing them to be considered at any time. Bills listed on the Private Calendar are privileged on specific days of each month. Calendar Wednesday is a rarely used procedure for committees to call up bills they have reported. Special rules recommended by the Rules Committee can also grant privilege for floor consideration of certain bills. Special rules recommended by the Rules Committee grant privileged access to certain measures on the House floor, allowing for tailored floor procedures and flexibility in conducting business. The Rules Committee has the authority to create special rules that determine floor debate time, amendments, and points of order for specific bills. These rules can address any parliamentary situation and are subject to a majority vote on the House floor after a period of debate and votes on the \"previous question\" and adoption of the resolution. The Rules Committee in the House plays a crucial role in setting special rules that guide floor debates and amendments for specific bills. The committee is closely tied to the majority party's leadership, with a membership advantage of nine to four, reflecting its control over the House's agenda and policy choices. The Rules Committee in the House, also known as the \"Speaker's Committee,\" controls the House's floor agenda and policy choices through special rules. These rules have evolved over time to become more detailed, complex, and restrictive on amending activity, regardless of the majority party in power. The committee's procedural innovations are often adopted by the minority party when they assume the majority. The House Rules Committee, also known as the \"Speaker's Committee,\" controls the House's agenda through special rules. These rules, adopted by the minority party upon assuming majority status, set parameters for debate and amendment of legislation. Post-committee adjustments, increasingly common in recent Congresses, can modify committee-reported bills before floor consideration. This can be done by incorporating provisions into the bill through the special rule resolution or by amending the bill in the Rules Committee report. The Rules Committee can modify legislation through amendments in the Rules Committee report or by using a Rules print for floor consideration. This practice is a continuation of past procedures and does not significantly change how the House conducts its business. Committees play a crucial role in adjusting legislation after it leaves committee, allowing for debate and amendment on the House floor. Committees in the House play a vital role in vetting proposed measures, recommending legislative changes, and packaging endorsed amendments for floor debate. While committee-endorsed amendments receive procedural protections, leadership may override committee recommendations if they conflict with the majority party's policy preferences. During the legislative process in the House, recommended changes to a bill can be made through a leadership-crafted amendment in a Rules Committee report, as seen in House Resolution (H. Res.) 1265 during the 110th Congress. This allows for expedited consideration of legislation, such as providing unemployment compensation during the 2008 \"Great Recession.\" When the House takes up H.R. 5749, the committee-reported text will be replaced with language from the Rules Committee report on H. Res. 1265. The amendment printed in the report becomes the base text for floor consideration, with debate and amendment proceeding based on subsequent provisions of H. Res. 1265. Alternatively, the Rules Committee may draft a Rules Committee print to serve as the basis for floor consideration through a special rule. This process allows for expedited consideration of legislation. The use of Rules Committee prints as the base text for floor consideration has increased sharply in recent years. These prints often contain language identical or very similar to the committee-reported version of bills. For example, Rules Print 113-12 mirrored the text of H.R. 1911 reported by the Committee on Education and the Workforce. Selecting a Rules print for debate and amendment offers an expedited process for considering legislation. Selecting a Rules print as the basis for debate and amendment offers advantages such as easy accessibility in PDF format, enhanced transparency in lawmaking, and quick online posting of the text. This can be beneficial for Members offering amendments due to fixed page and line numbers, unlike bills reported from committee. Some Rules prints may differ from the committee-reported bill, containing additional material or subtracting sections. Changes can be minor or substantive, reflecting post-committee negotiations involving relevant committees, chairs, and majority party leaders. Print rules require majority leadership input and review to address issues like lack of votes or jurisdictional disputes after a measure is reported by a committee. The Rules Committee can use print rules to adjust legislative text after it leaves committee, enhancing the majority party's ability to build support for policy proposals. This practice, more frequent now, allows for post-committee adjustments before the bill is debated on the House floor. The Rules Committee uses language to communicate textual changes in Rules prints, with some prints containing identical language to the committee-reported version of a bill. Out of 82 Rules prints, 44 had the same language as reported from committee, while others had different language. The Rules Committee uses different language in Rules prints to indicate changes in bills. Some prints have the same language as the committee-reported version, while others have different language to convey significant changes. For example, Rules Print 113-2 included new language on immigration in a Senate bill reauthorizing the \"Violence Against Women Act.\" The Rules Committee uses various statements in Rules prints to indicate changes in bills, with some prints showing new language on immigration in a Senate bill reauthorizing the \"Violence Against Women Act.\" The summary statement at the top of a Rules print conveys the magnitude and significance of any post-committee adjustments contained in the print, with a typology of statements rank-ordered by the significance of textual changes they convey. The Rules Committee uses various statements in Rules prints to indicate changes in bills, with some prints showing new language on immigration in a Senate bill reauthorizing the \"Violence Against Women Act.\" Post-committee adjustments can be assessed by comparing the number of sections in a Rules Committee print to the corresponding reported bill(s), providing a measure of the degree to which a bill has been modified. The Rules Committee uses Rules prints to indicate changes in bills, allowing for combining multiple bills into one for House consideration. Section counts in prints compared to reported bills can show modifications made. The Rules Committee combines multiple bills into a single print for House consideration, with 20% of prints in recent Congresses doing so. Some prints include text from introduced or already passed bills. Language from introduced bills is often included at the start of a new Congress or near adjournment when time is limited. The Rules Committee combines multiple bills into a single print for House consideration, with 20% of prints in recent Congresses doing so. The sections of all incorporated bills are compared in Rules prints, showing the volume of legislation presented and modifications made after being reported from committee. The percentage of print sections not corresponding with reported bills has been increasing, indicating a growing use of Rules prints as the textual basis for floor action. The Rules Committee has increasingly used Rules prints as the basis for floor debate and amendments since 2011. The 112th Congress had a significant difference of 323 sections between prints and reported bills. The use of Rules prints became routine during the 112th Congress, with prints combining multiple bills becoming common. The use of Rules prints for floor debate and amendments has evolved since the 112th Congress, with a noticeable decrease in post-committee adjustments during the 113th Congress. Speaker Paul Ryan's leadership in the Rules Committee may impact the future use of Rules prints. Time constraints in Congress drive innovative solutions like Rules prints to manage the workload efficiently. Innovations like Rules prints streamline lawmaking by combining bills for debate, resolving disputes, and allowing time for study and amendments. This approach addresses time constraints and strategic political considerations in modern legislative processes. The strategic demands of \"message politics\" shape the work of House majority party leaders and the Rules Committee. Leadership involvement varies by issue, with \"message\" issues showing active leadership at all legislative stages. Special rule provisions help manage uncertainty on the House floor and enhance majority leadership control over policy. The Rules Committee adapts to changing circumstances to serve the needs of the majority party, as advocated by Speaker Thomas Bracket Reed. Speaker Thomas Bracket Reed emphasized the importance of majority rule in governing, stating that rules should facilitate the action of the majority. The evolution of special rules in the House has been significant over the past century, with new practices emerging and old ones being discarded. The Rules Committee's agenda-setting responsibilities will continue to adapt to changing political and legislative circumstances."
