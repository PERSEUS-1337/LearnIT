    "content": "There are permanent disaster tax relief provisions that apply to property destroyed or damaged due to casualty or theft. Relief may be limited to property lost in federally declared disasters or disasters where the IRS takes administrative actions. Casualty losses for personal property can be deducted, with limitations based on the type of disaster. Casualty losses are an itemized deduction. Casualty losses are deductible with a $100 floor per casualty and must exceed 10% of the taxpayer's AGI. Involuntary conversions involve property destruction, theft, or condemnation, allowing gain deferral. Replacement period is two years. The replacement period for an involuntary conversion is two years (three years for condemned business property). For a taxpayer's principal residence and its contents, the replacement period is four years for conversions stemming from a federally declared disaster. Special rules apply for gain realized from insurance proceeds for unscheduled personal property and for the residence or its contents. The owner may elect to recognize gain only if the common fund exceeds the cost of the replacement property. In cases of involuntary conversion due to a federally declared disaster, the taxpayer is not required to replace the property with a similar one to avoid recognizing gain, as long as the replacement property serves a business purpose. The low-income housing tax credit allows owners of qualified residential rental property to claim a credit over 10 years based on construction, rehabilitation, or acquisition costs for low-income units. Owners in low-income or difficult development areas may claim a credit based on 130% of project costs allocated by the state. The low-income housing tax credit program provides relief for property owners in major disaster areas, including exemptions from credit recapture, carryover allocation rules, and income certifications for displaced households. Owners may also qualify for additional credits for rehabilitation expenditures, with state agencies eligible for relief as well. Taxpayers in major disaster areas can receive relief from compliance monitoring and extend the credit period. LIHTC allocating agencies are also eligible for relief. Qualified disaster relief and mitigation payments can be excluded from income, covering various expenses incurred as a result of the disaster. Taxpayers affected by federally declared disasters can receive relief from compliance monitoring and extend tax deadlines. Qualified disaster mitigation payments can be excluded from income, including insurance reimbursements for living expenses while temporarily occupying another residence. The IRS is authorized to postpone federal tax deadlines for up to one year for affected taxpayers. The IRS can extend deadlines for retirement account distributions and required minimum distributions. Federal tax deadlines can be postponed for 60 days for taxpayers in disaster areas. Underpayment penalties may be waived in cases of casualties. The IRS can waive underpayment penalties in cases of casualties, disasters, or unusual circumstances. Temporary disaster tax policies have been enacted following major disaster events, but not all events receive targeted tax relief. Specific tax relief provisions for past disasters are summarized in tables. Recent disaster tax provisions are discussed first. Recent disaster tax relief packages enacted in response to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, and the 2017 California wildfires contained five key provisions: enhanced casualty loss deduction, expanded access to retirement plan funds, increased limits on charitable deductions, employee retention tax credits, and EITC/CTC credit computation look-back rules. Additional LIHTC allocations will be provided to certain areas in California affected by natural disasters in 2017 and 2018. Disaster tax relief for 2018 and 2019 disasters will also be available. Enhanced casualty loss deductions have been provided for various disasters in recent years, including Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, California wildfires, and others. These enhancements waive the 10% of AGI floor and increase the $100 floor for each casualty to $500. The Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2019, BBA18, TCJA, and the Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2017 provided tax relief for retirement plan distributions in disaster areas by waiving the 10% penalty for early withdrawals. The Disaster Tax Relief Acts allowed for increased withdrawal amounts from retirement plans for disaster victims without immediate tax consequences. The maximum withdrawal amount was $100,000 or 100% of the plan participant's benefits, with funds able to be recontributed over three years. Additionally, taxable portions could be included in gross income over three tax years instead of all at once. The Disaster Tax Relief Acts increased the maximum loan amount for disaster victims to the lesser of $100,000 or the greater of $10,000 or 100% of the vested benefits. Taxpayers can deduct contributions to charitable organizations, with limitations on the deduction amount based on income levels. Contributions exceeding the limit can be carried forward for five years. The Disaster Tax Relief Acts temporarily suspended limitations on qualified contributions for disaster relief efforts. An additional deduction is allowed for excess charitable contributions. A retention credit was provided for disaster-damaged businesses. The Disaster Tax Relief Acts temporarily suspended limitations on qualified contributions for disaster relief efforts and allowed an additional deduction for excess charitable contributions. The Act of 2017 provided a retention credit for disaster-damaged businesses that continued to pay wages to employees unable to work after the disaster. Eligible employees were those whose principal place of employment was in the disaster area, with the credit equaling 40% of the employee's first $6,000 in wages paid. The Disaster Tax Relief Acts of 2017, 2018, and 2019 allowed individuals affected by disasters to use previous year's income for calculating tax credits like the Child Tax Credit and Earned Income Tax Credit. This provision benefited taxpayers in disaster zones or displaced from their homes. The Act of 2019 increased credits available to California in 2020. The Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2019 increased California's 2020 LIHTC allocation for areas affected by natural disasters in 2017 and 2018. Previous legislation like the GO Zone Act provided additional LIHTC allocations to disaster-affected areas in Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi. The Heartland Act allowed states to allocate additional funds for disaster areas based on population. U.S. territories have different tax systems, with mirror code possessions using the Internal Revenue Code. The Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2019 requires payments to possessions for temporary tax relief. The Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2019 provides temporary tax relief for mirror code possessions and non-mirror code possessions with approved distribution plans. Various temporary tax provisions have been used to respond to disasters before 2010, with the first package enacted after the September 11 attacks. Capital expenditures are generally required to be added to the relief measures. The Heartland Act increased Section 179 expensing allowances by up to $100,000 and $600,000 for qualified disaster area property for federally declared disasters before January 1, 2010. The maximum expensing allowance after 2018 is $1 million with an investment limitation of $2.5 million. The Heartland Act increased expensing allowances for qualified disaster area property before January 1, 2010. It also added IRC Section 198A for full expensing of qualified expenditures related to hazardous substances or disaster damage. Net operating losses can now be carried forward indefinitely, limited to 80% of taxable income, with no carryback option, as per the 2017 tax act (P.L. 115-97). Before 2018, a taxpayer's net operating loss (NOL) could be carried back and deducted in the two tax years before the NOL year, and then carried forward for up to 20 years after the NOL year. The Heartland Act provided for a five-year carryback period for qualified losses from any federally declared disaster occurring prior to January 1, 2010. Businesses may claim a 100% expensing for eligible property acquired and placed in service after September 27, 2017, and before January 1, 2023. Businesses can claim a 100% expensing allowance under Section 168(k) for eligible property acquired and placed in service after September 27, 2017, and before January 1, 2023. The Heartland Act provided a 50% bonus depreciation provision for qualified disaster assistance property from a federally declared disaster before January 1, 2010. Mortgage revenue bonds are tax-exempt bonds used to finance below-market-rate mortgages for low- and moderate-income homebuyers. The Heartland Act waived purchase price restrictions for low-income areas and disaster-affected homes, allowing for increased limitations. It also allowed for owner financing for home repair to be treated as a qualified rehabilitation loan, with a maximum limit of $150,000. The GO Zone Act and KETRA had similar provisions, with a maximum bond issuance of $1,000 per state. The Heartland Act and GO Zone Act increased bond issuance limits based on state population in disaster areas. The GO Zone Act also expanded private activity bond issuances for mortgage revenue bonds. Additional funds were allocated for Katrina disaster areas. Capital expenditures were required to be added to property basis, except for qualifying environmental remediation costs expensed before January 1, 2012 under IRC Section 198. Section 198 allows for the deduction of environmental remediation costs for hazardous substances at contaminated sites, regardless of specific disasters. It was enacted in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 and extended multiple times before expiring in 2011. The Heartland Act and GO Zone Act also extended this provision, with the latter treating petroleum products as hazardous substances. Before 2005, only C corporations could claim an enhanced deduction for food inventory donations. The enhanced deduction for charitable contributions of food inventory and book inventory was initially allowed for C corporations, with special rules under KETRA. The provisions have been extended multiple times, with the enhanced deduction for food inventory made permanent in the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015. The enhanced deduction for book inventory expired at the end of 2011. Various acts have extended the time period to purchase replacement property in disaster areas. Debt forgiveness is generally included in the taxpayer's income, but there are exceptions such as gifts or discharge of student loans for qualifying services. The Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act of 2007 temporarily excluded qualified canceled mortgage debt income associated with a primary residence from taxation. Taxpayers may defer taxation on income from the discharge of indebtedness in certain situations, such as bankruptcy or insolvency. KETRA and the Heartland Act allowed victims to exclude nonbusiness debt forgiveness from income under specific conditions, like Hurricane Katrina victims being able to exclude forgiven debt from certain financial institutions. After August 24, 2005, and before January 1, 2007, individuals in disaster areas were eligible for benefits if they suffered economic losses. The GO Zone Act and Heartland Act provided relief by excluding certain cancelled debt from income and offering employer-provided housing benefits. The GO Zone Act and Heartland Act allowed employers to deduct up to $600 per month from employees' income for disaster relief, with a 30% credit. Employees needed a principal residence in the disaster area and employers needed a business there. States could issue tax-exempt bonds for various projects in the disaster area. The Heartland Act and Job Creation Act allowed states to issue tax-exempt bonds for disaster relief projects in the GO Zone. New York was permitted to issue up to $8 billion in bonds for various projects in the disaster zone. Additionally, operators of low-income residential rental projects could benefit from the GO Zone Act, 2008 Farm Bill, and Heartland Act. The Heartland Act and Job Creation Act allowed states to issue tax-exempt bonds for disaster relief projects in the GO Zone. Operators of low-income residential rental projects financed by IRC Section 142(d) bonds could rely on displaced individuals' income qualifications for tenancy within six months of displacement. Bondholders could claim a credit based on the bonds' outstanding face amount, with specific issuance requirements and state caps on bond amounts. The Heartland Act and Job Creation Act allowed states to issue tax-exempt bonds for disaster relief projects in the GO Zone. Bonds had caps based on disaster area populations, with tax relief provided to those offering free housing to displaced individuals. Additional personal exemptions could be claimed for housing displaced persons for at least 60 days, with specific requirements for eligibility. The Heartland Act and Job Creation Act allowed states to issue tax-exempt bonds for disaster relief projects in the GO Zone, with caps based on disaster area populations. Tax relief was provided to those offering free housing to displaced individuals for at least 60 days. Individuals using personal vehicles for charitable purposes during disaster relief could claim a deduction based on miles driven, with a temporary increase in the charitable mileage rate to 70% of the standard business mileage rate. The standard business mileage rate in 2019 is 56 cents per mile. Additionally, there was a temporary exclusion from a charitable volunteer's gross income for qualifying mileage reimbursements received for operating expenses of a volunteer's passenger automobile used for disaster relief. The Heartland Act, GO Zone Act, and KETRA authorized adjustments in tax laws for disaster-affected taxpayers to prevent loss of deductions or credits. Eligible individuals could claim higher education tax credits, with the Hope credit covering 100% of the first $1,000 of expenses and 50% of the next $1,000. The Lifetime Learning credit was 20% of up to $10,000 of expenses. The American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) temporarily increased the Hope credit from 2009, allowing 100% of expenses up to $2,000 plus 25% of the next $2,000. The Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes (PATH) Act made the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) permanent, replacing the Hope credit. The GO Zone Act and Heartland Act provided adjustments for students in disaster areas, increasing credit limits and allowing certain expenses to qualify for education credits. Taxpayers could claim a credit for rehabilitating a qualified building. The GO Zone Act and Heartland Act temporarily increased percentages for rehabilitating qualifying buildings damaged by disasters. Certain net operating losses and disaster losses may be carried back or deducted. Provisions included encouraging the Treasury Secretary to designate Gulf Coast Recovery Bonds. The Treasury designated Series I inflation-indexed savings bonds as \"Gulf Coast Recovery Bonds\" under the new markets tax credit. Taxpayers can claim a credit for investments in qualified community development entities over seven years, with a 5% credit for the first three years and 6% for the next four years. The credit was capped at $2 billion for 2005 and $3.5 billion for 2006 and 2007, with increases under the GO Zone Act. Taxpayers can expense up to $10,000 of qualifying reforestation expenditures under IRC Section 194, and carry net operating losses back for two years under IRC Section 172. The GO Zone Act introduced special rules for timber producers with less than 501 acres of timber property, increasing the Section 194 limit by up to $10,000 for qualified timber property in disaster zones and extending the Section 172 carry back period to five years for losses related to timber property in those zones. Businesses hiring individuals from high unemployment groups can claim the work opportunity tax credit, with a maximum credit of $2,400 for wages up to $6,000 paid during the employee's first year. KETRA allowed businesses to claim the credit on wages paid to certain employees hired after Hurricane Katrina. The Work Opportunity Tax Credit can be claimed on wages paid to eligible employees hired after Hurricane Katrina, with extended expiration dates for firms hiring \"Hurricane Katrina employees.\" The Job Creation Act also provided benefits for New York Liberty Zone business employees and certain employees outside the zone. Tax policy for disaster relief in the New York disaster zone aims to provide resources to businesses and individuals who suffered losses. It can target low-income groups but has limitations. Additionally, tax policy can incentivize investment in the affected areas, questioning the need for government intervention to overcome barriers to investment. Tax policy for disaster relief aims to provide resources to businesses and individuals in disaster zones. Challenges include identifying the disaster area and ensuring relief reaches those most affected. Relief can be tied to federal disaster declarations or specific geographic areas. Tax benefits for businesses and individuals affected by hurricanes like Katrina, Maria, Irma, and Harvey are discussed, along with tax policies supporting disaster-related charitable giving. Hurricanes like Katrina, Maria, Irma, and Harvey have caused significant property and earnings losses for businesses. Employee displacement and supply chain disruptions can create long-term challenges. Tax policies, such as bonus depreciation and enhanced expensing, have been used in the past for disaster relief. Currently, with bonus depreciation at 100%, there is limited availability of this policy tool. Expensing allowances could be expanded further to provide additional relief in disaster areas if necessary. Expanding expensing allowances for disaster relief can be achieved by raising the expensing limit, allowing NOL carrybacks for disaster-related losses, and lengthening replacement periods for involuntary conversions. These tax policy measures aim to provide relief for businesses in disaster areas and encourage employment. Tax policy can be used to encourage businesses to provide employment and housing in disaster areas. Employee retention credits and targeted hiring credits incentivize employers to continue paying employees and hire workers displaced by disasters. Tax benefits have been provided in specific geographic zones like the New York Liberty Zone and Gulf Opportunity Zone following certain disasters. Tax policy can incentivize businesses to provide employment and housing in disaster areas through employee retention credits and targeted hiring credits. Special bond allocations in disaster-affected zones, like the Gulf Opportunity Zone, have been questioned for their effectiveness in financing recovery. Improvements in the bond allocation process could better target small businesses or heavily impacted areas. Additionally, tax provisions for specific industries, such as small timber producers and public utilities, have been included in past disaster tax legislation. Tax relief provisions for business after disasters may not be well-suited for immediate capital needs. Benefits are often limited to businesses with positive taxable income, leaving out those with little profit or no tax liability. Tax relief provisions for businesses after disasters may not be suitable for immediate capital needs. Expanded NOL carrybacks can benefit businesses with limited income or tax liability. The effectiveness of disaster-related tax benefits in achieving policy goals is questioned, as much of the relief may go to taxpayers who would have rebuilt without incentives. The purpose of these benefits is debated, whether to encourage specific behavior like rebuilding or to provide financial relief for affected businesses. Congress has enacted legislation to provide financial relief for individuals who have suffered property or income loss after disasters. Tax relief provisions for low- and moderate-income taxpayers after disasters may be limited due to their lack of tax liability and limited wealth. Providing access to retirement plan funds or refundable tax credits may offer little relief to those with no tax burden to eliminate. Tax relief for low- and moderate-income taxpayers after disasters is limited due to their lack of tax liability. Refundable tax credits like the EITC and CTC can be based on previous year's income to help those in need. Higher-income taxpayers benefit more from tax policy, as they have positive tax liabilities that can be offset with deductions. Access to retirement account withdrawals can help replace lost income or assets after a disaster. Policies reducing penalties for early withdrawals can be beneficial. One option for providing relief to taxpayers after disasters is to reduce penalties for early withdrawals from retirement accounts. Timing concerns exist in using the tax code for immediate relief. Questions arise about whether relief should be tied to federally declared disasters or other events. Post-2025, individuals may claim deductions for casualty losses from various events, not just federally declared disasters. Disaster tax policy aims to provide special relief for personal property destroyed in federally declared disasters. It can prevent taxpayers from facing a tax burden due to disaster relief payments and insurance living expense payments being excluded from income for tax purposes. Temporary provisions have been implemented in response to past disasters. The charitable sector supports disaster relief activities and Congress has provided tax incentives to encourage charitable giving after disasters, such as relaxing income limitations for charitable deductions and increasing the charitable mileage rate. Other tax incentives have also been enacted to encourage specific types of charitable giving. Following disasters, Congress has enacted provisions to encourage charitable giving, such as enhanced deductions for food and book inventory contributions. The impact of these tax incentives on additional giving and whether they crowd out other charitable activities are key questions to consider. Following disasters, Congress has enacted provisions to encourage charitable giving, such as enhanced deductions for food and book inventory contributions. Evaluating charitable giving incentives after disasters raises questions about the distribution of giving, the beneficiaries of enhanced deductions, and the effectiveness of targeting tax relief to specific events or regions. Since 2001, temporary tax policies have been used in response to various disasters, with some events receiving tax relief packages while others did not. Disasters are inevitable and unique, affecting individuals, businesses, and economic sectors differently. Policymakers face challenges in providing efficient and effective disaster relief, which may require targeted or tailored responses. Some disasters fundamentally change the economy of affected regions, necessitating broader economic development measures. Disaster tax relief, as currently applied, includes permanent provisions that offer relief to all affected by qualifying disasters. Disaster tax relief combines permanent and temporary provisions for specific disaster events, zones, or time periods. Policymakers may need to reassess the balance to ensure efficient and effective relief. Broad tax relief may not always address the specific needs of a disaster."
