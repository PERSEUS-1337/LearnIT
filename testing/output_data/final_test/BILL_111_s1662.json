This aims to create higher-skill, higher-wage jobs and enhance participation in the global marketplace. The Public Works and Economic Development Act is amended to define a business incubator as an organization that supports the start-up and growth of businesses to create jobs and revitalize distressed areas. The Public Works and Economic Development Act defines a business incubator as an organization that supports start-up businesses to create jobs and revitalize distressed areas, excluding for-profit ventures. The Public Works and Economic Development Act amends the unemployment rate period from 24 months to 12 months. Additionally, there is an increase in the federal share for special need areas. Section 204(c) of the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 is amended to increase the Federal share for areas with high unemployment rates or low per capita income. The Federal share for grants in areas with high unemployment rates or low per capita income can be increased up to 70 percent of the project cost if the unemployment rate is at least 150 percent of the national average, or up to 125 percent of the national average if the unemployment rate is at least 125 percent. The Federal share for grants in areas with high unemployment rates or low per capita income can be increased up to 60 percent of the project cost if the unemployment rate is at least 1 percentage point greater than the national average or per capita income is not more than 80 percent of the national average. Additionally, in cases of severe economic distress, grant rates based on relative need can be adjusted. In cases of severe economic distress, the Secretary may deem an area to be experiencing a special need, reduce the non-Federal share to 20 percent, and waive the local share entirely if the unemployment rate exceeds 12 percent.
