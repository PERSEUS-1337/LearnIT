    "content": "PROVIDING FOR BALANCED BUDGETS. Each House of Congress must adopt a budget resolution for each fiscal year, ensuring that total outlays do not exceed total receipts and are not more than 18 percent of the GDP. The Congressional Budget Office must certify the budget resolution once adopted. The President pro tempore of the Senate must certify if the House of Congress has met the requirements of the budget resolution for each fiscal year, starting from 2016. The President pro tempore of the Senate certifies if Congress has met the budget resolution requirements each fiscal year since 2016. SEC. 3 states the effect of failing to adopt a resolution. If the Director does not certify Congress meeting budget requirements for fiscal year 2016 by April 16, 2015, salaries of Members of Congress will be held in escrow until certification is made. Payments will be released only after the specified period. If the Director does not certify Congress meeting budget requirements for fiscal year 2017 by April 16, 2016, salaries of Members of Congress will be held in escrow until certification is made. If the Director does not certify Congress meeting budget requirements for fiscal year 2017 by April 16, 2016, salaries of Members of Congress will be held in escrow until certification is made. During this period, payments for the compensation of Members of Congress will be deposited in an escrow account and released only upon the expiration of the specified period. The payroll administrator will withhold and remit amounts from payments held in escrow until the last day of the One Hundred Fourteenth Congress. This is to ensure compliance with the Constitution and to avoid varying the compensation of Senators or Representatives. Amounts remaining in escrow will be released for payments to Members of Congress at the end of the congress. The Secretary of the Treasury will assist payroll administrators of Congress in managing escrow accounts until the end of the One Hundred Fourteenth Congress. The payroll administrator is defined as the Chief Administrative Officer of the House of Representatives or a designated employee. The Chief Administrative Officer or designated employee will carry out the section for the House of Representatives, and the Secretary of the Senate or designated employee for the Senate. If the Congressional Budget Office Director does not certify compliance with section 2(a) by April 16 for fiscal year 2018 and beyond, each Member of that House will be paid $1 annually. The term \"Director\" refers to the Director of the Congressional Budget Office. The term \"Member\" includes a Delegate or Resident Commissioner to Congress. SEC. 4. SUPERMAJORITY REQUIREMENT FOR INCREASING REVENUE. In the Senate and the House of Representatives, a bill, joint resolution, amendment, conference report, or amendment that increases revenue requires an affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members. This rule is part of the rules of each House and supersedes other rules only if inconsistent. The rules of the Senate and House of Representatives require a three-fifths vote for any measure that increases revenue, which supersedes other rules if inconsistent. Each House has the constitutional right to change its rules regarding procedures at any time."
