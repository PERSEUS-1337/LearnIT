    "content": "The Act titled \"Catch-Up Lost Retirement Savings Act\" allows for catch-up payments. The Act titled \"Catch-Up Lost Retirement Savings Act\" allows eligible individuals to make catch-up contributions to their retirement savings, increasing the deductible amount by 3 times the applicable amount. Eligible individuals can make catch-up contributions to their retirement savings if they were qualified participants in a qualified cash or deferred arrangement where the employer matched at least 50 percent of the employee's contributions with stock of the employer. An employer is described as being a debtor in a case under title 11 of the United States Code or similar law, and subject to an indictment or conviction related to business transactions in preceding taxable years. The text discusses the eligibility criteria for a qualified participant in a cash or deferred arrangement, with a specific timeframe requirement before the filing of a case. Additionally, it mentions the termination of the subparagraph for taxable years after December 31, 2007. This information is part of an amendment related to a credit allowed for catch-up contributions in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. \"SEC. 25C. Certain catch-up IRA contributions.\" The text chunk discusses the allowance of a tax credit for eligible individuals making qualified retirement savings contributions, with the credit amount being 50 percent of the contributions. It also states that no double benefit will be allowed for the same contribution, and the contribution will still be considered in determining the investment in the contract. This section does not apply to certain taxable years. The section allowing a tax credit for retirement savings contributions will not apply to taxable years after December 31, 2007. The amendments made by this section regarding catch-up IRA contributions will apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2002."
