These amendments increase funding for certain activities while decreasing or striking funding for others in the same bill. Offset amendments may transfer funds between activities or reduce funding with across-the-board spending cuts. Representatives use offset amendments for various reasons, such as ensuring proposals to increase funding for specific activities. This report introduces House rules and practices for offset amendments in appropriations bills. It explains the need for offset amendments, the two types of offset amendments, and the mechanisms for waiving House rules. Offset amendments are used to redistribute spending priorities by increasing funding for certain activities while decreasing or striking funding for others in the same bill. The report discusses House rules and practices for offset amendments in appropriations bills, including procedural factors and mechanisms for waiving House rules. It emphasizes the importance of offset amendments to prevent exceeding spending ceilings associated with the annual budget resolution. The House Parliamentarian advises on procedural issues related to offset amendments. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 requires Congress to consider an annual budget resolution each spring, which establishes total new budget authority and outlay ceilings for the upcoming fiscal year. These figures are allocated among House committees with spending jurisdiction, including the House Appropriations Committee, which further subdivides its allocations among its 12 appropriations subcommittees. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974 requires Congress to consider an annual budget resolution, allocating spending ceilings to appropriations subcommittees. Two points of order enforce spending limits on appropriations measures for the upcoming fiscal year. The 302(f) point of order restricts new budget authority that exceeds allocated amounts, mainly affecting discretionary spending. The 302(b) subdivision sets a $24 billion limit on new discretionary budget authority for a fiscal year. Any amendment increasing this authority would trigger the 302(f) point of order. The 311(a) point of order restricts appropriations measures that exceed total budget authority and outlay ceilings in the budget resolution for the fiscal year. The House considers spending measures that could potentially exceed budget ceilings, leading to a point of order. This affects the last spending bills, such as supplemental appropriations. Appropriations bills on the House floor are typically near the 302(b) subdivision level and may impact offset amendments. The procedural necessity of an offset for a funding set-aside within a lump-sum appropriation in appropriations bills is dependent on the structure of the appropriation. Lump-sum and line-item appropriations are common in regular and supplemental appropriations measures, with most paragraphs providing lump-sum amounts for programs or projects. Total spending levels in appropriations bills include all appropriations, rescissions, and other spending provisions. An amendment increasing a lump-sum or line-item appropriation in a general appropriations bill must be accompanied by a commensurate offset to avoid exceeding spending ceilings. In appropriations bills, funding set-asides are specific amounts allocated for programs or projects. Any increase in these set-asides must be offset by a decrease in another set-aside or the total lump-sum amount. For example, if a $200 million lump-sum appropriation is divided into three set-asides, any increase in one set-aside must be balanced by a decrease in another to maintain the total amount. In appropriations bills, funding set-asides are specific amounts allocated for programs or projects. Increases in set-asides must be offset by decreases in other set-asides or the total lump-sum amount. Amendments may include offsets from other appropriations to avoid reductions in funding for activities not set aside. Offset amendments, such as clause 2(f) and reachback amendments, are available during consideration of regular and supplemental appropriations bills in the Committee. Clause 2(f) offset amendments in appropriations bills allow for changes in funding amounts by directly adding or changing text in the bill. Reachback offset amendments, on the other hand, are typically offered at the end of the bill and change funding amounts by reference. These amendments transfer appropriations among objects in the bill without exceeding total budget authority levels. An example is reducing funding for the Bureau of the Census by $10. The House made offset amendments in appropriations bills, increasing funding for the Bureau of the Census and the Office of Justice Programs by $10 million each. These changes were made by inserting parenthetic increases after the dollar amounts in the bill. Under House rules, clause 2(f) offset amendments must be offered when the first portion of the bill to be amended is pending. In practice, they may be offered at other times if no Member objects. In the Committee of the Whole, appropriations bills are generally read for amendment sequentially by paragraph. Members may propose amendments to a paragraph after it is read, but not after the next paragraph is read. Before considering a proposed clause 2(f) offset amendment, the presiding officer asks if any Member wants to raise a point of order against any provision the en bloc amendment would change. If a point of order is sustained, the provision is removed. Clause 2(f) offset amendments must offset any increase in budget authority and outlays, can only transfer appropriations, may include unauthorized appropriations, and are exempt from a \"demand for a division of the question.\" Spending increases in these amendments must be offset by reductions in budget authority and outlays. The 302(f) point of order enforces allocations only on budget authority. Offset amendments must provide equal increases and decreases in new budget authority within the same fiscal year. The resulting outlays may vary among different accounts based on the time needed to complete funded activities. The Congressional Budget Office estimates spendout rates each year to predict the rate at which budget authority will be spent in a fiscal year. The spendout rate is the rate at which budget authority is expected to be spent in a fiscal year. Varying spendout rates of appropriations can complicate efforts to increase budget authority. Increasing budget authority for operating expenses may result in higher outlays compared to the construction account. Representatives often ask CBO to estimate these scenarios. Clause 2(f) offset amendments involve transferring appropriations within a bill, with the House Appropriations Committee determining budgetary effects. Unauthorized appropriations are prohibited under Clause 2(a) of House Rule XXI. Certain committee-reported appropriations bills and amendments may increase funding for unauthorized appropriations already in the bill. Appropriations must generally be for authorized purposes under prior legislation. Authorizations for appropriations can be permanent, multi-year, or annual. The rule prohibits appropriations for expired authorizations or exceeding authorized budget ceilings. An authorization act provided an authorization of appropriations of $2 million for program yellow. An authorization act provided an authorization of appropriations of $2 million for program yellow through FY2016; as of the close of FY2016, the entire amount of the authorization had expired. Subsequently, an FY2017 regular appropriations bill provides an unauthorized appropriation of $2 million for program yellow. The House adopts a special rule waiving clause 2(a) of House Rule XXI against all provisions in the bill, allowing the above appropriation to remain. A clause 2(f) offset amendment parenthetically increasing the unauthorized appropriation by $1 million for program yellow is allowed. Offset amendments that increase the authorized level in appropriations bills are prohibited under House Rule XXI. These types of amendments cannot be divided for separate consideration and must be taken as a whole. Reachback offset amendments add new sections to appropriations bills that change previously considered amounts. Title VI of the H.R. 3043 bill in the 110th Congress revised funding amounts by reducing the Department of Labor's budget and increasing funding for the National Institutes of Health, specifically the National Cancer Institute and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. Amendments to general appropriations bills could increase spending as long as they did not violate certain points of order. Reachback amendments must offset budget authority, may add new lump-sum appropriations and set-asides, subject to restrictions, and avoid unauthorized appropriations. The 3(d)(3) and 302(f) points of order require budget authority offsets, while the 311(a) point of order applies to both new budget authority and outlays. The most restrictive points of order are under 3(d)(3) and 302(f), enforcing only budget authority. Budget authority offsets are the primary procedural concern for reachback amendments. Reachback amendments must offset budget authority and may include new appropriations and set-asides that are relevant to the pending bill. Opponents may raise concerns about the lack of outlay offsets and potential procedural issues in the Senate or conference. Representatives often request CBO estimates on the outlay effects of their amendments. All amendments must be germane to the pending bill according to House Rule XVI. Under House Rule XVI, all amendments must be germane to the pending bill, meaning they cannot introduce new subject matter. Reachback amendments at the end of a bill or title must also be relevant. Regular appropriations bills have broad subject matter, allowing for flexibility in amendments. However, set-asides cannot violate the rule against legislation in general appropriations bills. Legislation in this context refers to any provision that changes existing law. Legislative language examples include amending or repealing existing law, abolishing departments, agencies, or programs, and proposing new rescissions in appropriations bills. Amendments designating funds must not interfere with executive branch officials' statutory authority. For instance, altering an official's discretion is prohibited as it changes existing law. Amendments proposing new set-asides that violate rules by altering agency heads' authority are also out of order. Recent House practice includes amendments that do not include set-asides in the amendment text to avoid violating rules. Instead, sponsors discuss the set-aside during debate and may urge inclusion in a conference report. Amendments with both an increase and offset for the same provision use en bloc offset amendments to allow discussion without changing overall funding levels. Amendments must be proposed for authorized purposes under House Rule XXI. Amendments must be proposed for authorized purposes and set-asides must be included in amendments for authorized lump-sum appropriations. Reachback amendments do not change the text of the bill but add further unauthorized appropriations. Members can demand separate consideration of different portions of an amendment if each portion is a separate proposition. When an amendment is deemed divisible, each divided portion will be debated and voted on separately. Members may request a division of the question to defeat specific parts of an amendment. This can lead to separate votes on different aspects of the proposal. Amendments may include offsetting spending cuts, and certain amendments can only directly change specific elements. Clause 2(f) amendments in the bill may be changed directly, with rules potentially suspended to consider offset amendments. Procedural advantages exist for both clause 2(f) and reachback amendments, with limited opportunities to waive rules for offset amendments. If a point of order is raised against an amendment violating parliamentary rules, it may be rejected unless rules are waived. The House Rules Committee usually sets special rules for appropriations measures, which may include waivers for offset amendments. Members can request consideration of rule-violating amendments by unanimous consent, but objections can prevent this. Sponsors of offset amendments in appropriations bills typically choose between clause 2(f) or reachback amendments to achieve their policy goals. The House Rules Committee often reports a special rule to waive the prohibition against unauthorized appropriations, allowing for increased unauthorized appropriations through clause 2(f) amendments. Reachback amendments, on the other hand, can only raise authorized appropriations to their authorized level. In cases where bills contain unauthorized appropriations, reachback amendments cannot increase those amounts. The House Rules Committee often reports a special rule to waive the prohibition against unauthorized appropriations, allowing for increased unauthorized appropriations through clause 2(f) amendments. Reachback amendments can only raise authorized appropriations to their authorized level, while clause 2(f) amendments can increase unauthorized appropriations. Reachback amendments are limited to authorized appropriations, while clause 2(f) amendments offer more flexibility in increasing appropriations. Reachback amendments may add new lump-sum appropriations and set-asides within certain restrictions, while clause 2(f) amendments are limited to transferring appropriations among objects already in the bill. Reachback amendments must offset only new budget authority, whereas clause 2(f) amendments must offset both new budget authority and outlays. In practice, sponsors sometimes provide offsets in both budget authority and outlays to gain political support. Sponsors provide offsets in budget authority and outlays to gain political support for reachback amendments."
