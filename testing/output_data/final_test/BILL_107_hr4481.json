    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Airport Streamlining Approval Process Act of 2002\". It includes findings related to airport processes. Congress finds that airports are crucial for commerce, with congestion and delays negatively impacting the economy. Airport capacity projects are a national priority that must include environmental reviews and collaboration between various government agencies. The importance of airports for commerce is highlighted by Congress, with a focus on addressing congestion and delays. Airport capacity projects are a national priority that require environmental reviews and interagency collaboration. Additionally, it is essential to honor milestones and deadlines while working to protect the environment and sustain economic vitality in aviation growth. SEC. 3 promotes new runways at congested airports, while SEC. 4 focuses on streamlining airport projects. The Secretary of Transportation will lead a coordinated review process for airport capacity enhancement projects at congested airports. This process will ensure that all necessary environmental reviews and approvals are conducted concurrently and completed within a specified time frame. Federal and State agencies involved in the project will be identified promptly. The Secretary will promptly identify Federal and State agencies with jurisdiction over environmental matters related to airport projects. States may choose to participate in the coordinated review process for projects within their boundaries. The coordinated review process for airport projects involves determining whether to issue environmental permits, licenses, or approvals. A memorandum of understanding may be developed between the Secretary and other Federal and State agencies involved in the project. Failure to meet deadlines will result in notification to Congress and the CEQ. The Secretary must notify relevant committees and agencies within 30 days of a determination of failure to meet deadlines for airport project reviews. The agency or sponsor must submit a report within 30 days explaining the reasons for the delay and proposed actions to complete the project. The Secretary must notify committees and agencies of missed deadlines for airport project reviews. The agency or sponsor must submit a report within 30 days explaining delays and proposed actions. Federal or State agencies participating in a coordinated review process for airport capacity enhancement projects at congested airports must adhere to defined project purposes and needs. The Secretary will determine reasonable alternatives for such projects. The Secretary of Transportation will develop a list of categorical exclusions for airport projects within 120 days of enactment. Airport sponsors can request access restrictions to ease construction at congested airports. The Secretary of Transportation may approve restrictions on runway use at congested airports to minimize noise impacts if necessary for construction, cost-effective, and not detrimental to small communities or air safety. Airport revenue can be used for mitigation efforts. The Secretary of Transportation may allow airport sponsors to use airport revenue for environmental mitigation measures related to airport capacity enhancement projects at congested airports, if it aligns with the preferred project alternative under the National Environmental Policy Act. The curr_chunk discusses mitigation measures for aircraft noise, including insulation of buildings and improvement as required by local building codes. It also mentions the acceptance of funds from airport sponsors by the FAA Administrator for hiring staff or consultants. The FAA Administrator may hire additional staff or consultants to expedite environmental activities for airport development projects. Funds can be transferred from airport sponsors to the Administrator's account for these activities, with receipts credited as offsetting collections. Funds accepted for activities and services must be used for those purposes and remain available until expended. No funds can be accepted if the FAA does not allocate at least the amount spent in fiscal year 2002. Authorization of appropriations is granted to the Secretary of Transportation from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. The Secretary of Transportation is authorized to use funds from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund for environmental activities related to airport capacity enhancement projects at congested airports. Judicial review of orders issued by the Secretary or other Federal agencies can be sought in specific courts. The petition for judicial review must be filed within 60 days of the order being issued, with possible extensions granted for valid reasons. The court has the authority to review and make decisions on the order, including instructing the Secretary or relevant agency to take further action. The court may grant interim relief by staying the order or taking other appropriate action when good cause exists. Findings of fact by the Secretary or head of another agency are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence. In reviewing an order, the court may only consider objections made in the proceeding or if there was a reasonable ground for not making the objection. A decision by the court may be reviewed only by the Supreme Court. In this section, the term 'order' includes a record of decision or a finding of no significant impact. Definitions for 'airport sponsor', 'congested airport', and 'airport capacity enhancement project' are provided in this subchapter. The term 'airport capacity enhancement project' refers to runway construction or extension projects and other airport developments designated by the Secretary to reduce air traffic congestion and delays. SEC. 5. GOVERNOR'S CERTIFICATE.\n\nAmends Section 47106(c) of title 49, United States Code by making various changes related to airport projects and certifications. SEC. 6. CONSTRUCTION OF CERTAIN AIRPORT CAPACITY PROJECTS. Section 47504(c)(2) of title 49, United States Code, is amended to allow airport operators of congested airports and local governments to carry out noise mitigation projects surrounding the airport, even without meeting part 150 requirements, if included in a Federal Aviation Administration record of decision for an airport capacity enhancement project. Airport operators and local governments can conduct noise mitigation projects near congested airports without meeting part 150 requirements if included in a Federal Aviation Administration record of decision for an airport capacity enhancement project. SEC. 7. LIMITATIONS.\n\nThis Act does not preempt or interfere with public comment practices or the authority of State agencies or airport sponsors in carrying out airport capacity enhancement projects."
