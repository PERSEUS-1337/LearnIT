Within 90 days of the proclamation, a public hearing must be held by the Secretary of the Interior. The Secretary must hold at least 1 public hearing within a county or comparable unit of local government, with notice provided 30 days in advance. Participants can provide comments during the hearing. The Secretary must ensure participation in public hearings, solicit comments from the public, and record all comments received. The record of the hearing must be made available promptly after the hearing date. The Secretary must make the record of the public hearing available to the public online or through electronic means. Components of the record completed before the entire record is finalized must be made available upon completion.
