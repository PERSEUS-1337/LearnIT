    "content": "The \"Safe Transfer Act\" requires disclosure of disciplinary proceedings against a student. Section 444(b)(6) of the General Education Provisions Act is amended to require institutions of postsecondary education to disclose final results of disciplinary proceedings against students accused of sex offenses to be eligible for funding under applicable programs. In order to be eligible for funding under applicable programs, institutions of postsecondary education must disclose final results of disciplinary proceedings against students accused of sex offenses. This includes disclosing the results to other institutions and including them on the student's transcript. During a pending disciplinary proceeding for a student accused of a sex offense, the institution must disclose this information to other postsecondary education institutions where the student plans to enroll. Additionally, the institution must note the pending proceeding on the student's transcript. The institution must notify the student of any disclosure regarding a pending disciplinary proceeding, allow the student to inspect a copy of the proceeding without names of other students, and provide an opportunity for the student to write a statement. The Secretary will inform postsecondary education institutions about these requirements. The institution must notify students of any disclosure regarding pending disciplinary proceedings and provide opportunities for students to review and respond. Postsecondary education institutions are required to disclose information on sex offenses, including sexual assault and related offenses as defined by the Higher Education Act of 1965. Statutory rape regulations were finalized by the Department of Education in 2014."
