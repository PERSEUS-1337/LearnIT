    "content": "In the 115th Congress, discussions have focused on reorganizing government trade and development functions, particularly in the context of development finance. Development finance involves government-backed financing to support private sector investments in developing economies. Development finance institutions like the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) play a key role in providing such finance. President Trump renewed the debate over the future of U.S. development finance at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) CEO Summit in Danang, Vietnam in November 2017. The Trump Administration's National Security Strategy prioritized modernizing U.S. development finance tools to advance U.S. global influence and compete with China in providing development finance. The Trump Administration's interest in development finance reform, particularly with China as a major supplier of development finance, has led to proposals to consolidate OPIC and other agency functions into a new U.S. development finance agency. The BUILD Act was introduced to create the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation, consolidating OPIC's functions and other development finance entities. The BUILD Act proposes the creation of the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation, consolidating OPIC's functions and other development finance entities. The House and Senate versions now both provide a seven-year authorization for the new DFI. The Trump Administration supports the BUILD Act but calls for modifications to enhance alignment with national interests and address risk management concerns. Stakeholders have differing views on the DFI proposal. The White House proposed consolidating development finance tools like OPIC and DCA in a government-wide reorganization plan. The BUILD Act is seen as the main way to implement this proposal, which may require changes to U.S. law. Many countries have established DFIs, which are usually government-owned and operate independently or as part of larger institutions. Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) are government-owned entities that promote economic development by supporting foreign direct investment (FDI) in underserved projects, regions, and countries. They can operate independently or as part of larger institutions, including international financial institutions like the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and regional development banks such as the African Development Bank (AfDB) and Asian Development Bank (AsDB). Unlike OPIC, other bilateral DFIs are usually permanent and not subject to renewals by their countries' legislatures. Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) support foreign direct investment in underserved projects, regions, and countries. They use various financial instruments to promote private sector investment in developing countries, aiming to be catalysts for private sector activity and public-private partnerships. DFIs provide support when commercial financing is not available on viable terms, focusing on additionality to complement existing funding sources. Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) provide financing for projects when commercial terms are not viable, aiming to complement the private sector. DFIs focus on long-term commitment to development and financial sustainability, often investing in projects that generate returns. They vary in size and portfolio compositions, co-financing projects with each other. Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) often co-finance investment projects at both multilateral and bilateral levels to pool funds and diversify risks. Unlike government-backed export financing, there are no international rules governing DFIs' investment activities. Major players in development funding were international financial institutions and bilateral government donors, but private capital flows and bilateral DFIs, including those from the US and European countries, have become more active. Emerging economies are also now significant suppliers of development finance. Centralized, comprehensive, and comparable sources of information on DFI activities are difficult to find. The amount of financing committed by major DFIs grew significantly from 2000 to 2014, with China's development finance surpassing other historical suppliers. For example, the China Development Bank's assets in 2016 were larger than the World Bank's IFC. Direct investment flows have outpaced official development assistance. Development finance has become more prominent as a way to encourage private investment in undercapitalized areas, with a shortfall in infrastructure investment of about $350 billion a year. OPIC and USAID are central to the current development finance reorganization debate. The United States supports development finance at the multilateral and regional level through entities like the IFC and regional development banks. OPIC, established in 1971, promotes economic growth in developing economies by providing project financing and insuring against political risks of investing abroad. OPIC, established in 1971, provides project financing and political risk insurance for investments abroad. It does not take equity positions in investment funds but supports them through financing. OPIC's authority was extended through September 30, 2018 by Congress. It operates under the Secretary of State's policy guidance and is governed by a 15-member Board of Directors. In FY2017, OPIC authorized $3.8 billion in new commitments for 112 projects, reaching a record exposure of $23.2 billion. It helped mobilize $6.8 billion in capital and supported 13,000 new jobs in host countries. OPIC's activities are backed by the U.S. government and projects must meet specific requirements to be eligible for support. Considerations include U.S. economic impact, environmental impact, worker rights, and development impact on the investment destination country. OPIC operates on a self-sustaining basis, charging interest and fees to cover costs. It assesses risks of proposed transactions and relies on other U.S. government agencies for international presence. In contrast, USAID has been providing development finance since 1961, focusing on loans for infrastructure projects in its early years. In the 1980s, the agency expanded efforts to develop the private sector in developing countries, including lending to micro, small, and medium businesses. The Development Credit Authority (DCA) supports bank lending for specific development purposes by employing the promise of U.S. government repayment typically of up to half of each loan in case of default. In FY2016, nearly half of DCA guarantees issued by value promoted activity in energy and 26% focused on agriculture. Enterprise Funds are private sector-managed entities established to stimulate economic growth, with a focus on venture capital investments. These funds also support mortgage securitization, microfinance, equipment leasing, and other financial instruments. Ten funds were launched in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union after the fall of communist governments. Two more funds have been established in Tunisia and Egypt. USAID has been providing financial and technical assistance to entrepreneurs in Tunisia and Egypt through various intermediaries since the 1960s. They have promoted policy reforms to facilitate private sector lending and supported SMEs in rural areas with limited access to finance. Additionally, they have developed a new credit scoring tool to assist lenders in making better lending decisions. Development of a new credit scoring tool to assist lenders in making better lending decisions, leading to $39 million in new lending. USAID has been leveraging private sector resources to increase development impact, utilizing its convening power as a leading development agency in the U.S. government. Efforts to catalyze private sector finance are ongoing at both mission and central bureau levels. In 2017, USAID missions in Pakistan and Ethiopia established equity and innovation funds to support small and medium businesses. The Africa Bureau's Private Capital Group for Africa (PCGA) in South Africa works to attract private capital for development projects by identifying profitable transactions and eliminating financial barriers. The USAID Global Health Bureau is exploring ways to use private sector finance for global health needs, such as providing working capital to pharmacies in Africa. The Office of Private Capital Development and Microenterprise (PCM) was established to mobilize private sector capital for development projects, partnering with organizations like CrossBoundary Energy and Sarona Asset Management to pilot new financing models in Africa. The U.S. government agencies, including the Export-Import Bank of the United States, provide financing and insurance for U.S. exports. Unlike OPIC and USAID, Ex-Im Bank focuses on supporting U.S. exports to contribute to U.S. employment. Other agencies like USDA and SBA also play a role in development programs. The U.S. government agencies, such as USDA and SBA, provide export financing for specific constituencies like agricultural products and small businesses. The U.S. Trade and Development Agency (TDA) offers technical assistance to support U.S. foreign policy and trade objectives, linking businesses to export opportunities overseas. TDA funds pre-export activities like feasibility studies and pilot projects. European DFIs, members of EDFI, are comparable to OPIC but can take equity positions and offer technical assistance without political risk insurance. EDFI members collectively had a $45 billion portfolio in 2015, concentrated in Africa and Latin America. The UK's DFI focuses exclusively on Africa and South Asia. Financial services were the largest sector of support for EDFI members, similar to OPIC's focus on economic and social development. China, a major global supplier of development finance, provides funding through entities like China Development Bank (CDB), Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), and New Development Bank (NDB). Data on China's activities are limited, but estimates suggest they may have provided over $100 billion. China's development finance activities, linked to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), may have received over $100 billion in financing from China. The BRI, announced in 2013, aims to enhance economic connectivity across Asia, Africa, Europe, and other regions through infrastructure investments. Chinese financial institutions like CDB have supported numerous BRI projects, totaling $30 billion. China's focus is on infrastructure and energy projects, often involving Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs). China's development finance activities, including state-owned enterprises (SOEs), extend beyond Asia, Africa, and Latin America, especially with the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Chinese support for overseas investment lacks the same environmental and social standards as other DFIs, leading to concerns about environmental and social risks. Projects funded by China, such as hydropower projects, have raised questions about displacement and debt sustainability in countries with high debt-to-GDP ratios. China's lending poses debt challenges, as seen in Sri Lanka leasing its Hambantota port to Beijing due to inability to repay loans. Japan's Japanese Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) provides development finance, focusing on energy and mineral resources projects. The Japanese Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) focuses on securing energy and mineral resources through overseas investment loans. In FY2016, Asia received the largest share of JBIC's commitments, followed by North America and Europe. Discussions on the reorganization of U.S. government development finance functions raise various issues for Congress to consider. Supporters of \"upgrading\" OPIC argue that outdated rules, limited resources, and lack of long-term authorization constrain the agency. They believe OPIC fills gaps in private sector support, helps U.S. firms compete globally, and advances U.S. foreign policy and economic interests. Critics dispute these claims and question the agency's effectiveness. Critics of OPIC argue that government involvement in financing and insuring private sector investments diverts capital from efficient uses, crowds out private alternatives, and raises questions about the development benefits of its programs. They call for terminating OPIC's functions or privatizing them instead of boosting them through a new DFI. The impact of government-backed financing on markets is debated, with some economists suggesting it may have little effect on overall U.S. investment and could even have negative consequences due to opportunity costs. Some experts argue that U.S. government support is crucial for American investors to compete with foreign-backed projects. The impact of state-backed foreign investments on U.S. firms is hard to prove due to lack of transparency. However, the significant financing from emerging economies could affect U.S. commercial activity in the long run. In considering U.S. development finance reform, the question arises whether consolidation or individual agency reforms are more effective. A proposal for a new Development Finance Institution (DFI) has been discussed, with stakeholders suggesting merging OPIC and other agencies. Congressional hearings have explored changes to OPIC, and the Administration's FY2019 budget proposed creating a new DFI through interagency discussions involving OPIC, USAID, and the State Department. The BUILD Act was introduced in February 2018, supported by the Trump Administration with some suggested modifications to align the new DFI with U.S. national interests and enhance its institutional links with development agencies. The Administration also proposed changes to the funding structure to improve risk management and prevent displacement of private sector resources. Supporters of reorganization argue that consolidating the U.S. government's development finance functions could enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and better leverage development finance tools. They believe a new DFI would help the U.S. compete with China and foreign counterparts. Critics fear the creation of a new bureaucracy and potential costs, as well as dilution of resources. Some concerns raised about reorganization include potential dilution of development finance functions at issue due to differing approaches of OPIC and USAID. Suggestions to enhance coordination through multilateral DFIs are also considered. If Congress pursues reorganization, structuring the proposed new DFI poses challenges as it would be a successor to OPIC. The BUILD Act proposes creating a new International Development Finance Corporation (IDFC) by consolidating OPIC's functions and USAID's DCA. The IDFC aims to promote private sector participation in economic development of developing countries, aligning with U.S. development assistance objectives. Concerns have been raised about the new DFI's development mandate, transparency, and environmental standards. Some supporters have concerns about the transparency, environmental, and social standards of the new DFI compared to OPIC. Critics suggest strengthening the DFI's mandate to counter China's influence in developing countries. One key issue is the debt burdens China imposes on these nations. Amendments to the BUILD Act address these concerns by directing the DFI to consider economic and financial soundness, development objectives, and providing a robust alternative to state-directed investments by authoritarian governments and U.S. strategic competitors. The proposed DFI under the BUIILD Act would have a nine-member Board of Directors, including government officials and private sector members. This structure differs from OPIC's 15-member Board of Directors, with a focus on transparency, environmental standards, and debt sustainability in partner countries. The new DFI under the BUILD Act would have a smaller nine-member Board of Directors, with more federal government representation than private sector. Unlike OPIC, it does not have specific requirements for small business, labor, or cooperatives representation, and the USAID Administrator would serve as the Vice Chairperson of the Board. The BUILD Act would establish a new DFI with a smaller Board of Directors, emphasizing federal government representation over the private sector. The House and Senate versions differ on the required private sector experience for board members. Congress must decide whether to make the new DFI a permanent entity or subject to reauthorization, with the current versions favoring a seven-year extension. The current versions of the BUILD Act favor a seven-year extension for the new DFI. Congress may consider whether to make it a permanent entity like other DFIs or subject to periodic reauthorizations for enhanced oversight. The BUILD Act proposes to increase the new development finance agency's exposure limit to $60 billion for five years, with adjustments every five years based on the Consumer Price Index. This larger liability limit would allow for more projects but could pose risks to taxpayers if projects fail. The BUILD Act proposes expanding the IDFC's authorities beyond OPIC's to include making loans, guarantees, issuing insurance, and taking minority equity positions in investments. The IDFC would also have the ability to issue loans in local currency, establish enterprise funds, conduct feasibility studies on investment projects, and provide cost-sharing. The BUILD Act proposes expanding the IDFC's authorities to include making loans, guarantees, issuing insurance, and taking minority equity positions in investments. The new DFI would have the authority to take a minority equity stake in investment funds, allowing for diversification and increased competitiveness. The BUILD Act proposes expanding the IDFC's authorities to include making loans, guarantees, issuing insurance, and taking minority equity positions in investments. The new DFI would have the authority to administer special projects and programs, including technical assistance, grants, and studies for various activities. Critics argue that equity authority would require more resources and could lead to additional risk and financial exposure. The IDFC would have authority to conduct feasibility studies on proposed investment projects, including cost-sharing. This would distinguish it from OPIC's current operations, which have limited authority for technical assistance in Africa. Other U.S. government agencies, such as the Department of State, USAID, and TDA, focus on technical assistance for foreign policy programs. The new DFI's technical assistance function could enhance its effectiveness, although it may overlap with other agencies. The new DFI's technical assistance function could overlap with other government agencies' roles, prompting questions about excluding TDA from the consolidation. The DFI would have expanded authority to make loans in U.S. or foreign currency, compared to OPIC. Both House-passed and Senate committee-reported bills would only allow foreign currency support with a substantive policy rationale. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee's bill would require the DFI to collect data on minority- and women-owned businesses in projects it supports. The new DFI's support for projects may be subject to requirements and limitations imposed by Congress to quantify outreach activities to minority- and women-owned businesses. Congress can guide the DFI's activities through conditions while considering the impact on its flexibility and agility compared to other DFIs. Many provisions in the BUILD Act mirror OPIC's enabling legislation. The BUILD Act's provisions for the new DFI would prioritize support in low-income or lower-middle-income economies, with stricter criteria for upper-middle-income countries. This could enhance the DFI's development impact by focusing on underserved areas or populations. The new DFI under the BUILD Act would prioritize support in low-income or lower-middle-income economies, with stricter criteria for upper-middle-income countries. The DFI would have greater specifications on interest rates and market-based support compared to OPIC. It would only need to give preferential consideration to projects involving the U.S. private sector, potentially expanding its development impact but decreasing benefits to U.S. employment interests. The new DFI under the BUILD Act would prioritize support in low-income or lower-middle-income economies, with stricter criteria for upper-middle-income countries. It would give preferential consideration to countries in compliance with international trade obligations, worker rights, and environmental impact. Support would not be provided to projects benefiting persons subject to U.S. sanctions. The DFI would need to include specified language in contracts regarding worker rights and child labor. Additionally, the DFI would be required to supplement, not compete with, private sector support. The House-passed and Senate committee-reported versions of the BUILD Act require the new DFI to develop safeguards, policies, and guidelines to ensure support does not harm U.S. employment. It also mandates consideration of women's economic empowerment and mitigation of gender gaps. The House-passed version includes a boycott restriction for projects involving individuals who have supported a foreign boycott in the past three years. The BUILD Act aims to ensure that beneficiaries of the new DFI's support do not undermine U.S. foreign policy goals. It includes provisions to restrict support in countries and projects benefiting persons subject to U.S. sanctions. Both the House and Senate committee-approved versions establish a risk committee and require beneficiaries to certify they are not conducting business subject to U.S. sanctions. The House and Senate committee-approved versions of the BUILD Act would establish a risk committee and audit committee to monitor the new entity's performance. The IDFC would be required to develop a performance measure system and monitor projects, subject to reporting and auditing requirements. The risk committee would assess foreign entities' due diligence policies to prevent corruption and other illegal activities. The aim is to ensure the IDFC does not support entities engaged in corruption, terrorism, drug trafficking, human trafficking, or gross human rights violations. The BUILD Act would expand the new DFI's exposure cap and authorities, with a focus on risk management practices. Some argue that the proposed DFI's organizational structure, including a Chief Risk Officer and audit committees, could effectively manage risks. Technical assistance provided by the DFI for projects could lead to financially sound outcomes. It is suggested that taking on risks in challenging markets could make a significant impact. The BUILD Act would establish an Inspector General specific to the new DFI, with differing views on the need for this. The new DFI would be required to establish an independent accountability mechanism to evaluate compliance with various standards. The new DFI under the BUILD Act would need to adhere to environmental, social, labor, human rights, and transparency standards. It would also be required to develop a performance measurement system based on OPIC's current system. Measuring development impact can be complex due to various factors such as definitional issues and resource constraints. DFI support ends due to resource constraints. Comparing development impacts is challenging as indicators may not be harmonized. Rigorous adherence to development objectives and a measurement system are crucial for gauging effectiveness. Congress should consider U.S. contributions to regional and multilateral DFIs. The new DFI must develop standards for measuring project impact and ensure transparency and public participation. The BUILD Act requires the new DFI to notify Congress before making financial commitments over $10 million and to establish a policy for public engagement. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee's version of the bill includes a Development Advisory Council to advise the Board on development objectives. The new DFI under the BUILD Act would have a council composed of nine members representing NGOs and think tanks, not subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act. Funding considerations for the DFI's self-sustainability and grant-making functions would need to be addressed by Congress. The proposal allocates $56 million in ESDF money for development finance programming and authorizes additional transfers of funds from USAID. The House and Senate committee-approved appropriations bills for FY2019 do not include funding for a new DFI, but indicate they will consider it if legislation is enacted. The impact of the proposed legislation and Administration's budget on USAID is not yet clear. Both call for transferring the Development Credit Authority to the new institution. The proposed legislation and Administration's budget call for transferring the Development Credit Authority (DCA) from USAID to the new Development Finance Institution (DFI). The DCA is a key assistance tool used by USAID to address development issues identified by country-based missions. The reorganization aims to consolidate these functions under the new DFI. Supporters of the proposed reorganization argue that consolidating DCA with other development finance functions would increase efficiency. However, critics like Andrew Natsios and Eric Postel believe that removing DCA from USAID would make its use as a development tool less effective. Proponents suggest that with effective interagency coordination, USAID could still access the benefits of DCA guarantee instruments. H.R. 5105 and S. 2463 would establish the position of Chief Development Officer within the new DFI to work directly with USAID missions for continuous access to development credit tools. Some observers argue that transferring existing authorities for the Europe/Eurasia enterprise funds to the proposed DFI may not be effective due to differences in funding sources and management models. The USAID enterprise funds are primarily funded by U.S. government grants and require close oversight, while OPIC's funds are supported by the private sector. This difference in funding and management could potentially make the USAID model less effective if transferred to an agency without similar features. The potential transfer of functions from USAID to the new DFI, including equity investment and microfinance activities, could impact USAID's overall development efforts. PCM currently serves as a research/project pilot and technical expertise resource for drawing in private capital, but these functions may be lost or need to be reintroduced in a different form if transferred. Transfer of financing functions could have unintended consequences on development efforts. The proposal to transfer functions from USAID to the new DFI, including equity investment and microfinance activities, could impact development efforts. The DFI proposal calls for transferring $56 million from traditional USAID accounts for development finance-related programming. This could potentially make many USAID development efforts less effective by preventing duplication of methodologies using private funding. The proposal seeks to transfer functions from USAID to the new DFI, including equity investment and microfinance activities, with a focus on cost savings and operational efficiencies. It is unclear how this transfer would save funds or allow the new DFI to efficiently conduct its activities without duplicating USAID's advantages in development programming. Close coordination between the two agencies is suggested in the legislation. The BUILD Act requires a joint report to Congress on how the DFI and USAID will coordinate the transfer of functions. The legislation emphasizes the need for interagency coordination, particularly between the DFI, USAID, and MCC, with the appointment of a Chief Development Officer for policy coordination. The DFI proposal aims to work closely with USAID missions to enhance the enabling environment for private sector investment. Supporters believe that the DFI's relationship with USAID could provide access to a range of finance tools, including equity and risk insurance, benefiting both organizations. The DFI would also expand its overseas presence significantly. The DFI aims to enhance private sector investment by working closely with USAID missions, expanding its overseas presence significantly. The challenge lies in achieving seamless coordination between the two agencies due to past difficulties in interagency cooperation and coordination. Currently, OPIC and USAID have distinct corporate cultures and focus, with OPIC providing larger-scale financing for infrastructure projects while USAID works at a smaller, locally oriented level. The differences in their approaches suggest challenges in coordination between the two agencies. Some suggest hard-wiring coordination between the new DFI and USAID in legislation to ensure effective cooperation. One proposal is a dual-hatted Chief Development Officer to align DFI operations with USAID needs. Another idea is to fund DCA guarantees from USAID budgets to emphasize USAID as a key customer. Metrics for measuring development success could include support for USAID programs. Congress may need to consider coordination issues between OPIC, Ex-Im Bank, and the proposed DFI, as they all play roles in supporting U.S. exports and economic impacts. OPIC collaborates with Ex-Im Bank on projects like Power Africa and outreach to small businesses. The proposed DFI's role with the private sector may impact current synergies between OPIC and Ex-Im Bank, as well as broader interagency coordination efforts. The BUILD Act amends the act to require the DFI to have a Chief Development Officer coordinating with USAID. Congress may examine how the new DFI would support U.S. businesses in competing for overseas investment opportunities and the policy trade-offs involved. The new DFI's potential role in supporting U.S. strategic economic interests and countering China's influence in developing countries may be of congressional interest. Congress may examine how the DFI could strategically deploy its resources to advance U.S. policy objectives. The DFI may play a role in countering China's influence in developing countries. Congress could consider advocating for international rules to ensure a level playing field for the DFI. China is not currently a party to international rules on export credit financing. The current proposals for reorganizing development finance present Congress with various issues in structuring the new DFI and balancing policy goals. Development finance intersects with U.S. interests in foreign policy, national security, and economic interests, combining public and private sector capital. The BUILD Act and other legislation for federal development finance reorganization may spark debate in Congress."
