    "content": "The \"Arab Spring\" prompted discussions on supporting democratic transitions in the Middle East and North Africa. President Obama announced the MENA \"Trade and Investment Partnership Initiative\" in 2011 to promote economic growth in Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, and Tunisia. Some Members of Congress have called for new free trade agreements with Egypt and Tunisia. Some Members have called for new free trade agreements with Egypt and Tunisia, and deeper economic ties with Libya. U.S. trade and investment policy in the region focuses on fostering economic growth, promoting economic reforms, and supporting democratic transitions. Efforts are part of the MENA-TIP initiative and broader U.S. trade policy measures. Political uncertainty and security changes may impact U.S. engagement, prompting questions on timing and feasibility. Congress has oversight and authorization. The report discusses the need for congressional involvement in new U.S. trade and investment initiatives in the MENA region, including potential legislative action for free trade agreements. It also highlights economic challenges and limited integration in the region, emphasizing the importance of re-evaluating U.S. trade and investment policies in light of political changes. The report examines current U.S. trade and investment policy efforts in the MENA region, discussing the potential for increased economic ties and the need for re-evaluating policies in light of political changes. The MENA region lags behind in key economic indicators, accounting for a smaller share of the world's GDP despite its population size. The MENA region has lower GDP compared to Latin America and East Asia. It has underdeveloped manufacturing and service sectors, leading to high unemployment rates, especially among youth. Despite rich natural resources like oil and gas, the region struggles with economic opportunities. In the MENA region, oil and natural gas revenues are underutilized, leading to a lack of development in other industries. Despite producing a significant amount of oil and gas, many countries in the region import more than they produce. This imbalance, known as the \"resource curse,\" hinders economic growth and exacerbates inequality. Some governments are now trying to use oil revenues to support economic development. Governments in the MENA region are looking to use oil revenues to boost non-hydrocarbon sectors and create more job opportunities. Various factors like weak global integration, easy money from natural resources, non-democratic political institutions, and a poor business environment have hindered economic development in the region. The weak business environment in the MENA region, caused by heavy government involvement, corruption, and lack of infrastructure spending, has deterred foreign investment. The educational system has not equipped youth with the necessary skills for the competitive global market. Subsidies and budget allocations to defense create economic distortions, while low female labor force participation limits productivity. Despite challenges, there have been pockets of economic success, highlighting the need for diverse economic policies to foster growth in the region. The MENA region faces challenges such as a weak business environment, corruption, and lack of infrastructure, deterring foreign investment. Despite this, there have been successes in social indicators and macroeconomic stability. The IMF notes improvements in inflation, trade balances, and public debt levels, but some countries in political transition face instability. Tailored policy solutions may be needed for each economy in the region. Some countries in the MENA region have achieved economic success, with high GDP per capita in oil-exporting countries like Kuwait and Qatar. Qatar also ranks high in rule of law strength. Saudi Arabia is considered one of the easiest countries to do business in. Israel has a relatively high female labor force participation rate. In 2010, women made up 47% of the labor force in Israel. Some countries in the MENA region face social challenges and economic instability. For example, poverty is high in Egypt, with 15.4% living on less than $2 a day in 2008. Yemen has a high under-5 mortality rate of 77 per 1,000 births in 2011. Lebanon and Egypt struggle with high public debt and budget deficits. Despite oil production, many MENA countries face economic challenges due to weak global and regional integration. The MENA region has high levels of exports and imports relative to GDP, with oil dominating exports and manufactured goods dominating imports. However, trade is highly concentrated in a few key products, limiting interactions in the global economy. In 2009, goods accounted for 54% of total imports in the MENA region. Tariff rates averaged 6.1% in 2010 among developing MENA countries. The European Union is MENA's biggest trading partner, with limited intra-MENA trade due to similar products and political tensions. The Arab League has maintained a boycott of Israeli companies since 1948. U.S. trade with MENA countries is limited, accounting for 5% of total U.S. trade in 2011. Oil makes up 73% of U.S. imports from MENA, totaling $90 billion out of $123 billion. In 2011, oil accounted for 73% of U.S. imports from the MENA region, totaling $90 billion out of $123 billion. If Israel were excluded, oil's share would rise to over 90%. The United States exports various goods to the MENA region, with trade concentrated in eight countries: Saudi Arabia, Israel, Algeria, Iraq, UAE, Egypt, Kuwait, and Qatar, which made up more than 90% of all U.S. trade with the region. In 2011, oil constituted nearly all exports to the United States from Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Iraq, and Kuwait. Other countries with oil representing over 65% of exports included Qatar, Oman, Tunisia, Yemen, Libya, and Syria. Israel exports a mix of products to the United States. MENA region accounts for a small share of global FDI by U.S. firms, with only 1% invested in the region. Total FDI in the United States in 2011 was $2.5 trillion, with MENA countries accounting for 1% of total FDI into the U.S. In 2011, U.S. foreign direct investment in MENA economies was concentrated in countries like Egypt, Qatar, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Algeria, and the UAE. Israel accounted for 90% of FDI into the U.S. from MENA countries, with over $15 billion invested. Challenges remain for international firms, including U.S. firms, looking to do business in the region. Country Commercial Guides by the U.S. Commercial Service highlight obstacles to doing business overseas. The reports from the U.S. government highlight obstacles for U.S. firms doing business in MENA countries, including corruption, bureaucratic red tape, weak rule of law, and differences in business cultures. Specific issues in selected countries include corruption in Egypt, inconsistent customs procedures in Tunisia, irregularities in government procurement in Morocco, weak enforcement of arbitration in Saudi Arabia, and the need for a local sponsor for business visas in the UAE. The challenges for U.S. firms doing business in the MENA region include difficulties with non-performing local employees, selling without a local partner, slow payments, and cumbersome dispute resolution mechanisms. Policymakers are discussing how trade and investment can support successful democratic transitions in the region, with a focus on fostering economic growth and reforms. President Obama emphasized the importance of economic prosperity for democratic transitions in a speech in May 2011. U.S. trade policy aims to promote economic growth, support democratic transitions, and provide overall support for the region. The U.S. trade policy in the MENA region aims to support democratic transitions, promote economic growth, and create and sustain U.S. jobs by opening international markets. Sanctions are imposed on Iran and Syria due to their nuclear program and state sponsorship of terrorism, respectively. The U.S. trade policy in the MENA region aims to support democratic transitions, promote economic growth, and create and sustain U.S. jobs by opening international markets. Congress may revisit restrictions on aid to Syria in case of political change. The U.S. uses policy tools to promote trade and investment, including formal agreements and government programs like export assistance. The MENA Trade and Investment Partnership (MENA-TIP) was announced by President Obama in 2011 to address political changes in the region. The MENA Trade and Investment Partnership (MENA-TIP) was announced by President Obama in 2011 to facilitate trade within the region, promote trade and investment with the United States and other global markets, and engage willing MENA partners in regional trade arrangements. The U.S. has primarily engaged with Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, and Tunisia under this initiative, focusing on investment, trade facilitation, support for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and regulatory practices. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) leads the implementation of the MENA-TIP initiative. Under the MENA-TIP initiative, various government agencies, including Commerce, State, and Treasury, are involved in efforts to enhance trade relations. In Egypt, steps are being taken to boost exports, promote investment, and strengthen the SME sector through programs like the Generalized System of Preferences and Qualifying Industrial Zones. In December 2012, the United States completed bilateral agreements with Morocco to stimulate trade and investment. The agreements include non-binding principles for international investment and information and communication technology services. Discussions are ongoing for a possible binding agreement on trade facilitation, reflecting new developments since the U.S.-Morocco free trade agreement. In January 2013, the United States finalized bilateral agreements with Jordan, similar to those signed with Morocco in December 2012. These agreements cover international investment principles, ICT services, and worker rights enforcement. Follow-up cooperation on labor issues is planned, and the U.S. may negotiate similar agreements with other countries in the region like Egypt. The Bush Administration launched the MEFTA plan in 2003 to create a U.S. Middle East Free Trade Area by 2013, aiming to promote economic growth and fight terrorism through trade liberalization and investment. Despite efforts to support WTO membership, negotiate BITs, and FTAs, the initiative fell short of establishing a regional free trade area. The MEFTA plan, launched in 2003 by the Bush Administration, aimed to create a U.S. Middle East Free Trade Area by 2013. Efforts to establish a regional free trade area fell short, but new FTAs were completed with Bahrain, Jordan, Morocco, and Oman. The United States has various trade and investment agreements in the MENA region, with most countries being WTO members. Algeria, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Syria, and Yemen have observer status at the WTO. The U.S. has supported some of these countries in their efforts to join the WTO. The United States has Trade and Investment Framework Agreements (TIFAs) with most MENA countries, bilateral investment treaties (BITs) with five countries, and FTAs with five countries in the region. FTA negotiations with some MENA countries have faced challenges, such as discussions with Egypt being put on hold in 2005. Issues included concerns over election results, human rights, intellectual property rights regime, and import duties for apparel and textile products. Negotiations with the UAE on an FTA were also paused. The United States has various trade agreements and policy initiatives with MENA countries, including TIFAs, BITs, and FTAs. Negotiations with the UAE on an FTA were put on hold in 2007 due to differences on labor, market access for services, and government procurement. In 2011, talks under the TIFA with Tunisia were re-launched to support its political transition. The U.S. also aims to enforce its rights under existing trade agreements and relies on federal programs to promote international trade. The United States relies on federal programs to support international trade and investment with MENA countries. Key programs include the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) and Qualifying Industrial Zones (QIZ). GSP grants duty-free treatment to imports from developing countries like Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, and Yemen. Countries must meet certain conditions to be eligible for GSP, which was first authorized in 1974. The Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program was first authorized in 1974 and was extended through July 31, 2013. However, utilization of the GSP program among beneficiary developing countries in the MENA region remains low, with only 0.8% of total U.S. imports from these countries entering under GSP. This is due to the fact that oil, which accounts for over 70% of MENA exports to the U.S., is not eligible for GSP benefits. Additionally, other major exports like apparel, iron, and steel are also excluded from preferential treatment under the GSP program. Qualifying Industrial Zones (QIZs) were established in 1996 to allow certain regions in Egypt, Jordan, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip to export products duty-free to the U.S. Jordan and Egypt have Qualifying Industrial Zones (QIZ) that allow duty-free export of certain products to the United States. The purpose is to support the Middle East peace process and build economic ties between Israel and Arab neighbors. U.S. imports under the QIZ programs are mainly apparel products. Jordan's exports to the U.S. under the QIZ program grew significantly but the share of total exports declined due to preferential treatment under the U.S.-Jordan FTA. Exports from Egypt to the United States under the QIZ program have grown significantly from $266 million in 2005 to $1 billion in 2011, with the QIZ share of Egypt's total exports to the U.S. increasing from 13% to 52% during this time period. Issues have arisen in Jordan's QIZ facilities, particularly concerning working conditions for migrant laborers, prompting the U.S. to work with Jordan to address these concerns. The U.S. government actively promotes U.S. exports through various export assistance programs administered by federal agencies. The U.S. government has directed export promotion efforts through the National Export Initiative (NEI) to double exports and support U.S. jobs. While the NEI does not specifically focus on the MENA region, efforts to boost exports worldwide may contribute to MENA-specific trade policy goals. Key agencies like the Department of Commerce, Export-Import Bank, OPIC, and TDA play a role in promoting U.S. commercial ties with MENA countries. The Department of Commerce, specifically through its International Trade Administration (ITA), leads export promotion services for non-agricultural U.S. businesses in the MENA region. ITA aims to expand U.S. exports, engage in commercial diplomacy, remove market access barriers, and support SMEs in the region. ITA also supports USTR's implementation of the MENA-TIP initiative. The International Trade Administration (ITA) leads export promotion services for non-agricultural U.S. businesses in the MENA region, providing export assistance and advocacy services. ITA conducts trade missions to various countries in the region to explore business opportunities, with upcoming missions planned to Egypt and Kuwait focused on the energy sector. The International Trade Administration (ITA) leads export promotion services for non-agricultural U.S. businesses in the MENA region, providing export assistance and advocacy services. A 2013 trade mission is planned to Egypt and Kuwait, focused on the energy, infrastructure, safety, and security technology sectors. The Ex-Im Bank provides direct loans, guarantees, and insurance to help finance U.S. exports in the region. The Ex-Im Bank saw a significant increase in authorizations for financing in the MENA region from $443 million in FY2011 to $8.9 billion in FY2012. This accounted for about 25% of Ex-Im Bank financing worldwide in FY2012. Large authorizations were made to Saudi Arabia and the UAE for various projects, totaling $5.5 billion and $3.3 billion respectively. OPIC provides political risk insurance and finance to support U.S. investment in developing countries, contributing to U.S. exports and employment. In FY2011, OPIC committed $108.7 million for new investment projects in MENA countries, with the largest destinations being the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Iraq, and Jordan. OPIC's portfolio exposure in MENA totaled $2.6 billion, focusing on support for SMEs, infrastructure development, agriculture, and humanitarian assistance. In response to political change, OPIC targeted up to $3 billion in investment support in the region. In response to political change in the MENA region, OPIC has targeted up to $3 billion to support investment, focusing on SMEs, infrastructure, and key sectors like renewable resources. This includes fast-track approval for rapid deployment of capital while maintaining investment policy standards. President Obama also announced $1 billion in financing specifically for infrastructure and job creation in Egypt. OPIC approved $500 million in lending to Egypt and Jordan to support small businesses. The loan guarantee facility is in collaboration with USAID, providing grant funding and technical assistance. The Egypt facility is not operational yet, while the Jordan facility is further along in implementation. TDA, authorized under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, promotes economic development and U.S. commercial interests in developing countries. It connects U.S. businesses to export opportunities for priority projects, focusing on sectors like transportation, ICT, energy, and water management in the Middle East. In FY2012, TDA allocated $5.6 million for projects in the region, including those in Egypt and Morocco. In FY2011, TDA funded projects in Egypt, including grants for ICT infrastructure expansion and a feasibility study for a data center. TDA also sponsored an Egypt: Forward initiative to promote commercial ties between U.S. and Egyptian sectors. Government initiatives supporting U.S. private sector trade in MENA countries may offer new opportunities for U.S. businesses overseas. The U.S. budget constraints may impact trade and investment initiatives in the MENA region, potentially offering new opportunities for U.S. businesses overseas. However, the effects of these initiatives may take time to materialize and may not provide immediate economic relief. Congress and the executive branch have various options to increase trade and investment ties with MENA countries, including unilateral, bilateral/regional, and multilateral approaches. Unilateral trade policy tools could be considered to support and expand economic relations with MENA economies without requiring negotiations with trading partners. The U.S. could extend non-reciprocal trade benefits to MENA countries without negotiations, encouraging improvements in worker rights and intellectual property protection. Efforts like the MENA-TIP initiative aim to increase the utilization of trade preference programs, such as the GSP program, by MENA beneficiary countries. Congress could revise GSP provisions to facilitate expanded product coverage for these countries. Congress could consider extending the authority of the GSP program, which expires on July 31, 2013, and creating a regional trade preference program for the MENA region. They could also revise the QIZ program by expanding existing zones in Egypt or approving additional zones in other countries. The QIZ program in Egypt and Jordan was initially targeted due to peace treaties with Israel. Proposing new Israeli content requirements for QIZ programs may face criticism in some MENA countries. Congress could boost export assistance and financing for the MENA region, including opportunities in Iraq for U.S. businesses. Opportunities for U.S. exporters and investors in MENA countries include energy, housing, and infrastructure projects. Federal assistance may be available for pursuing these opportunities. Congressional efforts could focus on bilateral and regional policy options to facilitate trade and investment. Initiatives for trade agreements may lead to economic and governance reforms and regional integration. Tariff and non-tariff barriers to U.S. exports could be reduced through trade agreements. Trade negotiations for regional integration aim to reduce barriers to U.S. exports in MENA countries, potentially easing political opposition. However, increased foreign import penetration may face resistance from regional economic actors seeking protection. Middle East countries have pursued FTAs with the U.S. to advance economic reforms and diversify their economies. The U.S. has Trade and Investment Framework Agreements (TIFAs) with most developing countries in the region, excluding Iran and Syria. Discussions under the 2002 TIFA with Tunisia were re-launched in 2011 to support bilateral trade and investment. The United States could re-launch TIFAs with other MENA countries like Egypt to support bilateral trade and investment. Negotiating new trade and investment agreements with countries undergoing political transitions, such as Egypt or Tunisia, could promote economic development and political reform. Expanding the U.S. partnership with Egypt through an FTA could incentivize constructive regional engagement and strengthen its role. An FTA with Egypt could advance reforms related to transparency, governance, and privatization. However, economic benefits would likely be long-term and may not address short-term issues like public debt. Concerns exist that without complementary reforms, the benefits of an FTA may only benefit a narrow section of society and not improve overall economic conditions. Increased foreign competition from an FTA could adversely affect some industries, firms, and workers. The United States could focus on renewing FTA negotiations with the UAE and consider negotiating regional investment and trade agreements to strengthen economic ties. The renewal of Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) may be necessary for negotiating new FTAs and BITs. The 113th Congress could consider renewing Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) for negotiating new BITs. The Obama Administration's review of the U.S. Model BIT in 2012 may give momentum to negotiating new BITs. Updating existing FTAs and BITs, including with Egypt, Tunisia, and Israel, could also be considered by Congress. The scope of issues discussed in trade negotiations has expanded since the United States entered into FTAs. The U.S.-Israel FTA lacks provisions on electronic commerce and technical barriers to trade, has limited coverage of services and IPR, and has had a limited effect on trade in agricultural products. Congress could conduct oversight of existing FTAs in the region to assess their impact on increasing and diversifying bilateral trade flows. Additionally, Congress has multilateral tools to foster economic ties with MENA countries, such as encouraging WTO accession for countries like Iraq. States to intensify efforts to support WTO accession for MENA countries like Iraq, Libya, and Yemen, provide technical assistance, and fully implement WTO commitments. Collaboration with the EU and other countries in international forums is also recommended. The G-8 launched the \"Deauville Partnership with Arab Countries in Transition\" in 2011 to coordinate assistance for transitioning MENA countries. This partnership involves G-8 countries, regional countries, and international financial institutions pursuing policy tools to strengthen economic ties. The MENA-TIP initiative is part of the U.S. contribution to international efforts under the trade and investment \"track\" of the Deauville Partnership. Congress may face issues in facilitating greater U.S. trade and investment with the MENA region, with some analysts questioning if it can support democratic transitions. The belief is that increased trade and investment will promote economic growth and aid democratic transitions in the region. Some experts argue that trade and investment can promote governance, increase the middle class, and develop institutions related to rule of law, which can create pressure for democracy. Pursuing FTAs and BITs with MENA countries could anchor reforms for democratic transitions. However, others argue that the links between trade, investment, and democracy are not straightforward, as governments can gain legitimacy through economic growth without political reform. Some analysts question whether trade and investment could help Arab countries transition to more democratic political systems. Public opinion in Egypt suggests that economic liberalization under the old regime led to corruption and economic inequality. There are doubts about the effectiveness of U.S. trade policy tools in promoting greater trade and investment in the MENA region. Increased U.S. trade and investment in the MENA region face obstacles related to corruption, transparency, governance, and bureaucratic red tape. Completing FTAs, BITs, or joining the WTO could help push through reforms, but implementation issues may limit trade and investment. Factors like market size, economic growth, natural resources, political stability, and infrastructure also impact investment and trade flows. The effectiveness of policy options in increasing trade and investment in the MENA region is questioned due to various factors like political instability and limited support from federal export finance agencies. Questions arise regarding the timing of enhancing trade and investment ties in the region amidst uncertain political situations. The United States faces a dilemma on whether to delay engagement in the MENA region until political stability is achieved or to enhance trade and investment ties sooner to influence favorable political outcomes. There is a debate on pursuing a region-wide agenda or tailoring policies to fit the individual needs of specific countries in the region. The United States considers the implications of engaging in the MENA region amidst political instability. While the US and EU have different approaches, cooperation efforts are underway to increase trade and investment in the region. Membership in the WTO is seen as a stepping stone to a Free Trade Agreement (FTA), with Libya having observer status and facing political upheaval. The US and EU have differing views on regulatory policy and standards in the MENA region. Some view US and EU businesses as competitors. Countries in the region already have strong economic ties with the EU and want closer ties with the US. Cooperation could expand through negotiations on a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. The United States has agreements with Morocco and Jordan on Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Services, modeled after U.S.-EU agreements. Congress approved FTAs with Colombia, South Korea, and Panama in 2011. The approval raises questions about future FTA negotiations and priorities in the MENA region, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership and Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. Trade promotion authority will be crucial in future FTA negotiations with MENA countries. U.S. trade policy responses to political changes in the MENA region are seen as incremental. U.S. trade policy responses to political change in the MENA region are incremental and focused on creating building blocks for future trade agreements. Current efforts with Egypt aim to improve the business environment for trade and investment, potentially leading to FTA negotiations. External factors like diverse trade relationships and Libya's non-membership in the WTO influence U.S. engagement in the region. The United States has established trade relationships with Morocco and Jordan, including bilateral FTAs, serving as a foundation for recent bilateral agreements on investment and ICT services under MENA-TIP. Countries in the region have diverse economic situations and priorities, with some focused on short-term stability like Egypt, while others with stable economies can engage more effectively with the U.S. on trade policy issues. Political uncertainty in some countries makes it challenging to negotiate trade policy agreements. Despite the challenges posed by political uncertainty in the region, U.S. trade negotiators face difficulties in knowing whom to negotiate with on the Egyptian side due to the fluid political situation. In contrast, Tunisia's smoother transition has facilitated U.S. engagement under the re-invigorated TIFA process. U.S. trade policy responses are influenced by the demand of U.S. companies for business opportunities in specific regions, with agencies like OPIC, Ex-Im Bank, and TDA prioritizing support for U.S. commercial activity in the region. Commercial incentives play a crucial role in determining U.S. businesses' utilization of available financing and funding. Trade and investment policies in the MENA region can impact political transitions and U.S. interests. In a constrained budgetary environment, these policies may be more attractive for supporting economic development and reforms compared to foreign aid. They also have the potential to create new economic opportunities for U.S. businesses."
