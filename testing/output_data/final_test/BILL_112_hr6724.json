    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Commercial Automotive Products Export Reform Act of 2012\". Congress finds that the economic and national security interests of the United States are enhanced when the military has access to affordable automotive products and technologies, and when companies can freely export these products to certain entities. The United States' economic and national security interests are hindered by export control regulations that limit the military's access to commercially-available automotive products and technologies. These restrictions are unnecessary and impede the export of such products without obtaining licenses from the Department of State or Department of Commerce. The export control regulations restrict the military's access to commercially-available automotive products and technologies, requiring licenses from the Department of State or Department of Commerce. These unnecessary restrictions hinder the United States' economic and national security interests. The export control regulations restrict access to automotive products and technologies, impacting military vehicles' safety and fuel economy, creating barriers to job creation, burdening taxpayers with increased costs, and wasting resources on controlling insignificant products. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, definitions are provided for terms such as \"automotive products,\" \"automotive technologies,\" \"automotive vehicles,\" and \"Commerce Control List.\" The Code of Federal Regulations defines \"commercially-available automotive products and technologies\" as those available for non-military automotive vehicles, including prototypes and concept vehicles with minor modifications. The Code of Federal Regulations defines \"commercially-available automotive products and technologies\" as those needed for military vehicles to function properly, excluding weaponry, armor, threat detection, reconnaissance, surveillance, command control, communications, and location concealment. Minor modifications for commercially-available automotive products or technologies include changes from British Imperial/SAE sizes to metric sizes or vice versa. Changes that may constitute minor modifications for automotive products include moving inputs or outputs, altering mounting characteristics, changing voltage requirements, adjusting size, modifying data values for electronic parts, and altering the number or configuration of constituent items. Changes that may constitute minor modifications for automotive products include altering the configuration of constituent items or technologies, such as adjusting the number of tires in a tire pressure monitoring system from 18 to 6, selecting a new combination of characteristics from existing options in the non-military automotive vehicle market, and making other changes that do not hinder the product or technology from being a commercial item. The curr_chunk states that modifications to products or technologies should not enhance military weaponry, armor, threat detection systems, reconnaissance or surveillance systems, command control and communications systems, or location concealment, except for sound reduction or non-restricted paints or coatings. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to export regulations, technology, and the United States Munitions List. The curr_chunk states that proposed regulations will be issued. The President will issue proposed regulations to remove commercially-available automotive products and technologies from certain lists, unless it impacts military potential or national security. The President will submit a report to Congress for each determination not to remove commercially-available automotive products or technologies from certain lists. The report must demonstrate narrow definition, estimate costs, and consider impacts on military modernization. The President's report to Congress must justify the decision not to remove automotive products or technologies from specific lists, considering costs, impacts on military modernization, and reasons for not using targeted trade sanctions. The President must issue final regulations within 180 days to remove commercially-available automotive products and technologies from certain lists. Exceptions apply if the President determines not to remove a product or technology and submits a report to Congress. Annual reviews and reports are required. The President must conduct annual reviews to reaffirm or reverse determinations regarding commercially-available automotive products and technologies on certain lists. If a determination is reversed, the product or technology must be removed within 90 days. The President must submit an annual report to Congress if a commercially-available automotive product or technology is not removed from the United States Munitions List or Commerce Control List. SEC. 7. CLARIFICATION REGARDING TRADE SANCTIONS. This Act does not require the President to change export restrictions involving countries, organizations, or individuals under U.S. trade sanctions."
