The \"Green Energy Paper Manufacturing Act of 2009\" provides a renewable green-energy pulp, paper, or paperboard manufacturing credit under section 38 of the Internal Revenue Code for steam and electricity produced from biomass fuels at qualified facilities in the United States. The \"Green Energy Paper Manufacturing Act of 2009\" offers a renewable energy credit for steam and electricity produced from biomass fuels at qualified paper product facilities in the United States. The maximum annual credit per facility is $25,000,000, and double benefits are not allowed if a credit is already claimed under another section. The \"Green Energy Paper Manufacturing Act of 2009\" provides a renewable energy credit for biomass fuels used in qualified paper product facilities. Biomass fuels include liquid, solid, or gaseous fuels derived from biomass or biomass process residuals from paper facilities. Only the Btus from biomass fuel can be considered when co-fired with fossil fuels. The \"Green Energy Paper Manufacturing Act of 2009\" offers a renewable energy credit for biomass fuels used in qualified paper product facilities located in the United States. The tax for any taxable year may be increased by the recapture amount for the 3rd preceding taxable year, which is 50 percent of the credit determined under this section. For taxable year, aggregate payments made under section 6429 to taxpayer for steam and electricity produced, minus aggregate qualified reinvestment made by taxpayer in renewable energy projects, energy efficiency projects, and environmental improvements at US facilities. The taxpayer's basis for investments in the United States is reduced by credits and federal grants received. Qualified reinvestment is considered when the property is placed in service, with an option for estimated investments to be treated as made during construction. The investment in a qualified paper product facility is considered made when construction begins, with adjustments made when the investment is placed in service. If multiple owners are involved, the dollar limitation is allocated among them. The credit is part of the general business credit and can be used against the minimum tax. The current year business credit is amended to include the renewable green-energy pulp, paper, or paperboard manufacturing credit under section 45R. The credit can be used against the minimum tax as part of the general business credit. The table of sections for subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Code is amended to include a new item after section 45Q, related to the renewable green-energy pulp, paper, or paperboard manufacturing credit under section 45R. The amendments made by this section apply to energy produced after December 31, 2009, in taxable years ending after that date. A new section is added for advance payments for liquid biomass used as a fuel at paper product facilities. The Secretary will pay a person using qualified biomass liquid as fuel at a paper manufacturing facility in the US an amount based on the energy produced. The maximum annual payment per facility is $25,000,000. Qualified biomass liquid is defined as liquid derived from biomass or biomass process residuals. The section outlines the eligibility criteria for claiming payments for using qualified biomass liquid as fuel at a paper manufacturing facility in the US. Claims can be filed for periods where $200 or more is payable and not less than 1 week. Payment of claims is subject to specific conditions. The section specifies the payment process for claims filed under specific conditions, including a timeframe for payment and interest accrual. Claims must be filed within a set deadline to be considered valid. Additionally, it clarifies the attribution of Btus for qualified biomass liquid when co-fired with fossil fuels. Conforming amendments are also outlined. The table of sections is amended by replacing the item for section 6429 with a new item.
