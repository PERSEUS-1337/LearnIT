    "content": "The \"Travelers' Rights Act of 1996\" aims to provide access to safety and security information for air travelers and coordinate assistance for victims of air travel accidents. The \"Travelers' Rights Act of 1996\" aims to provide access to safety information for air travelers by requiring air carriers to provide written information on safety inspection reviews conducted by the FAA. The \"Travelers' Rights Act of 1996\" requires air carriers to provide safety information about their aircraft, safety rankings, crew compliance with certification requirements, and guidelines for providing this information to passengers upon request. The Secretary issues certificates for aircraft operation under this subtitle as deemed appropriate by law. A report reviewing air carrier safety, including accident numbers and aircraft makers involved, must be submitted to Congress annually by December 31. The National Transportation Safety Board establishes a program for victims and survivors of aircraft accidents to provide immediate and unrestricted access to information from the air carrier involved. This information is made available to travel agencies, consultants, and other entities upon request. The National Transportation Safety Board, in cooperation with federal agencies and the American Red Cross, establishes a program for coordinating information disclosure and victim assistance in air commerce accidents. This program ensures access to information from the air carrier involved and assistance for victims and survivors. The National Transportation Safety Board, in collaboration with federal agencies and the American Red Cross, sets up a toll-free telephone line to provide information and assistance in air commerce accidents. The telephone number will be published in newspapers and made available to the public. The toll-free telephone line established by the National Transportation Safety Board provides information on air commerce accidents, including aircraft identifier, victim names, investigation status, federal agency contacts, and victim identification facilities. Air carriers failing to comply with this information provision may face civil penalties. The section imposes a civil penalty of up to $100,000 per violation for failure to provide required information. Travel agencies and those not providing air transportation are exempt. Appropriations are authorized for implementation. \"44724. Air traveler safety program.\""
