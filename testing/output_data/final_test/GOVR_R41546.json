    "content": "The Administrative Procedure Act (APA) outlines procedures for agency rulemakings and judicial review of final agency actions. It covers rulemaking methods, exceptions to procedural requirements, executive orders impacting rulemaking, and judicial review criteria. The APA outlines rulemaking procedures for federal agencies, defining rules broadly as statements implementing law or policy. Agencies can issue rules through various methods, including notice-and-comment procedures. The APA outlines rulemaking procedures for federal agencies, defining rules broadly as statements implementing law or policy. Agencies can issue rules through various methods, including formal, hybrid, direct final, and negotiated rulemaking. The method of rule issuance can impact the procedures required and the deference from reviewing courts. The APA also provides exceptions to procedural requirements. Legislative rules or rules under delegated authority follow informal rulemaking procedures, requiring public notice and comment for participation. The APA requires federal agencies to provide the public with adequate notice of proposed rules through publication in the Federal Register. The notice must include details such as the time, place, and nature of public proceedings, legal authority, and the substance of the proposed rule. This ensures public participation and transparency in the rulemaking process. The notice requirement of \u00a7 553 is met when the agency gives interested persons a meaningful opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process. Interested parties can submit written comments, leading to a comprehensive rulemaking record. The length of the comment period is just one factor in determining if the agency provided an adequate opportunity to comment. After the comment period closes, the agency must consider the relevant information presented and incorporate it into the final rule. The final rule should include a concise general statement of the basis and purpose, enabling the public to understand the justification for the rules. Agencies are only required to respond to significant comments, and the rule must be published in the Federal Register at least 30 days before its effective date. Formal rulemaking is necessary in limited circumstances when rules are required to be made on the record after an agency hearing. Formal rulemaking requirements of \u00a7 556 and \u00a7 557 apply when rules are required to be made on the record after an agency hearing. The agency must follow trial-like procedures, allowing parties to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. Ex parte communications are prohibited, and proceedings must be presided over by an agency official or Administrative Law Judge with certain powers. Formal rulemaking procedures prohibit ex parte communications between interested persons and agency officials involved in the process. The agency or proponent of the rule bears the burden of proof and must issue rules based on the whole record and substantial evidence. Congress may direct agencies to follow specific procedural requirements in addition to those of the APA. Hybrid rulemaking statutes add procedural requirements similar to adjudicative processes but do not mandate formal rulemaking. These statutes offer more flexibility and public participation than informal rulemaking procedures. Hybrid rulemaking statutes, required by Congress in the 1970s, involve more public participation than informal rulemaking procedures. Federal agencies use direct-final rulemaking to efficiently finalize rules without expected opposition. If no adverse comments are received, the rule becomes effective on a specific date. Direct-final rulemaking allows agencies to efficiently finalize rules without opposition. If even one adverse comment is received, the proposed rule is withdrawn. Negotiated rulemaking supplements traditional procedures by consulting with interested parties to increase efficiency and decrease opposition. Negotiated rulemaking aims to increase administrative efficiency and reduce opposition by involving outside groups with significant interest in the rule's subject matter. The process allows for consensus building early on to create a final rule acceptable to all parties. The Negotiated Rulemaking Act authorizes agencies to establish committees for this purpose, with mandatory considerations to determine public interest. Once a committee is established, the agency must adhere to the Federal Advisory Committee Act and publish relevant information. The Negotiated Rulemaking Act requires agencies to follow the Federal Advisory Committee Act when establishing a committee. The committee must have up to 25 members, including at least one agency representative. Public input is required on the committee's creation and membership. If consensus is reached on a proposed rule, a report is issued. If no consensus is reached, a report with negotiated positions may be issued, but the agency is not bound by the committee's conclusions. Any proposed rule from the committee must go through standard notice-and-comment procedures for finalization. The APA provides exceptions to the default notice-and-comment rulemaking requirements for rules related to specific subject matter areas such as military or foreign affairs, agency management or personnel, and public property, loans, grants, benefits, or contracts. These rules may not need to go through all of the procedural requirements of \u00a7 553. The APA provides exceptions to the notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures for rules related to military or foreign affairs, agency management, and public property distribution. These rules still have the force of law and do not need to satisfy all procedural requirements. The APA provides exceptions to the notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures for rules related to military or foreign affairs, agency management, and public property distribution. Rules promulgated through the notice-and-comment process have the force of law and are known as legislative rules. Agency procedural rules are exempt from notice-and-comment requirements and must have an intra-agency impact. Courts define agency procedural rules as technical regulations that prescribe order and formality in agency business transactions. The APA provides exceptions to notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures for rules related to military or foreign affairs, agency management, and public property distribution. Agency procedural rules are exempt from notice-and-comment requirements and must have an intra-agency impact. Non-legislative rules, such as interpretive rules and general statements of policy, do not require notice-and-comment procedures. These rules allow agencies to efficiently perform routine duties and provide timely policy guidance without lengthy processes. Interpretive rules and general statements of policy are non-legislative rules that do not require notice-and-comment procedures. They allow agencies to provide guidance on existing duties and announce future intentions in a non-binding manner. Determining whether agency actions are legislative or non-legislative rules can have significant consequences. Determining whether a rule is legislative or non-legislative can be challenging but has important implications for agency procedures and court deference. Agencies must decide if a rule interprets existing law or makes a substantive change. Non-legislative rules still need to follow certain APA procedural requirements, such as petition, publication, and public availability provisions. Non-legislative rules are exempt from APA's notice-and-comment requirements and have immediate effectiveness upon publication. Federal agencies can use the good cause exception under Section 553(b)(B) if traditional procedures are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest, providing supporting reasons. Proper use of the exception requires an evaluation of the necessity for immediate action and the consequences of inaction. The good cause exception allows agencies to bypass notice-and-comment procedures for immediate action, but courts narrowly construe and reluctantly allow this exception. Interim final rules can be issued without public notice, but agencies must assert a valid reason for doing so. Unlike non-legislative rules, interim final rules are considered final and can be modified after publication through a post-promulgation comment period. Interim final rules, unlike non-legislative rules, have the force of law and do not require a 30-day waiting period before becoming effective. Exceptions to this waiting period include interpretive rules, policy statements, and rules granting exemptions or relieving restrictions. Repealing a rule may also be exempt from the waiting period requirement. Rules that qualify for exceptions, such as interpretive rules or policy statements, may be effective upon publication of the final rule. Agencies must follow APA procedures to amend or repeal existing rules issued under discretionary authority. This includes complying with notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures outlined in \u00a7 553 of the APA. If a statute requires alternative procedures for promulgating a rule, the same procedures may apply to amending or repealing that rule. The APA requires agencies to follow notice-and-comment procedures when amending or repealing rules. Rule repeals may be exempt from the delayed effective date requirement if they \"relieve a restriction.\" Repeals that remove requirements on regulated entities can take immediate effect upon publication. Upon publication of the final repeal, agency rules that lack the force of law can be immediately altered without public participation. Long-standing agency positions implemented through non-legislative rules can generally be reversed without notice-and-comment procedures. Temporary delays of new rules have been implemented without public notice during the early days of a new presidential Administration. The last three Presidents have directed agencies to delay the effective dates of finalized rules by 60 days to allow for review by the new Administration. Agencies have been successful in implementing these delays without notice-and-comment, but some courts have suggested that such delays may require public participation. Courts have rejected claims that a delay due to a presidential transition qualifies for the good cause exception. Agencies can delay the effective date of a rule without notice-and-comment if there is a pending legal challenge. Recent Presidents have imposed non-statutory requirements on the rulemaking process through executive orders. Executive orders, starting with President Reagan's, allow the White House to review and approve regulatory actions by federal agencies. The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) reviews significant regulatory actions. Agencies must conduct cost-benefit analyses and justify regulations under these orders. President Trump's Executive Order 13771 requires agencies to offset costs. Order 13771, issued by President Trump, mandates agencies to offset costs of new rules in fiscal year 2017 by repealing existing rules. The total incremental cost of new regulations must not exceed zero, with costs offset by eliminating existing costs from at least two prior regulations. The Order applies to significant regulatory actions with exceptions and is implemented through guidance from the OMB. The Executive Order 13771 mandates agencies to offset costs of new rules by repealing existing rules. It exempts rules related to military, national security, or foreign affairs functions, agency organization rules, and other exempted categories. Agencies can proceed with mandated rules without identifying offsetting actions if needed to comply with statutory or judicial deadlines. However, agencies must comply with procedural requirements when repealing or amending rules to meet the cost-offset requirement. The APA mandates that agency rule alterations must comply with judicial review. There is a strong presumption for judicial review of administrative actions, except in cases where statutes preclude it or agency action is at the discretion of the agency. The APA allows courts to set aside agency actions that are arbitrary, capricious, contrary to law, or exceed statutory limits. The APA mandates judicial review of agency actions, allowing courts to set aside actions that are arbitrary, capricious, contrary to law, or exceed statutory limits. Judicial review may differ based on the type of agency action, with formal rulemakings subject to \"substantial evidence\" review and other actions subject to \"arbitrary and capricious\" review. The most common standard of review for challenges to agency actions is the \"arbitrary and capricious\" standard under the APA. This standard applies to factual determinations in informal rulemaking and discretionary decisions made by agencies. The substantial evidence test is sometimes required for informal rulemakings, but some argue that the two standards are similar and tend to converge in judicial review. The \"arbitrary and capricious\" standard for reviewing agency decisions is fact-based and situation-specific. Courts should not substitute their judgment for that of the agency but should invalidate decisions that lack a rational connection between facts and choices made. The decision must be based on relevant factors and not show a clear error of judgment to avoid being considered arbitrary and capricious. The Court outlined that an agency decision is arbitrary and capricious if it relies on factors not intended by Congress, fails to consider important aspects, provides explanations counter to evidence, or is implausible. The standard requires reasoned decision-making with adequate explanation and essential facts supported by evidence, not just conclusory statements. Illogical or inconsistent reasoning, failure to consider relevant factors, and lack of justification with evidence can render an agency decision arbitrary and capricious. Administrative decisions must be based on reasoned decision-making with adequate explanation and supported by evidence to avoid being deemed arbitrary and capricious. Agencies have the flexibility to change rules but must comply with procedural requirements, such as notice-and-comment rulemaking, when making significant policy changes or reversals. The agency may implement policy changes through notice-and-comment rulemaking and must provide a reasoned analysis for the change to avoid being deemed arbitrary and capricious. Judicial review of agency actions altering prior policies does not require more stringent scrutiny, according to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court's 2009 decision in FCC v. Fox Television Stations established principles for judicial review of agency policy changes. An agency must acknowledge the change, provide good reasons for it, and ensure the new policy is permissible under the statute. In some cases, a more detailed justification may be required for the change. The Supreme Court established principles for judicial review of agency policy changes in FCC v. Fox Television Stations. A more detailed justification may be needed for a change in policy when factual findings contradict prior policies or serious reliance interests are at stake. In Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, the Court ruled that a rule reflecting an agency's altered statutory interpretation was arbitrary and capricious due to a lack of a reasoned explanation for the change. An agency must provide a thorough explanation when there has been industry reliance on a prior policy. The Supreme Court requires agencies to provide a thorough explanation for policy changes when there has been industry reliance on a prior policy. This is especially important when serious reliance interests are at stake, and agencies must offer more than just conclusory statements for their decision to change course. The standard of judicial review for congressional delegations of legislative authority to administrative agencies focuses on whether an agency's action exceeds statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations. The Court emphasizes that an agency's power to regulate in the public interest must be based on a valid grant of authority from Congress. The Supreme Court requires agencies to provide a thorough explanation for policy changes, especially when there has been industry reliance on a prior policy. Judicial review focuses on whether an agency's action exceeds statutory authority. Deference to agency interpretations of statutes is discussed in CRS Report R43203, Chevron Deference."
