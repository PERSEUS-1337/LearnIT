    "content": "The text chunk \"SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\" is a condensed version of the previous information provided. The \"Home Lead Safety Tax Credit Act of 2003\" acknowledges the prevalence of lead-based paint in 38 million housing units in the US, with 25 million posing hazards due to lead levels above safety standards. Despite a decrease in lead poisoning cases, it remains a serious threat to children's health and development. The Secretary of Health and Human Services aims to end childhood lead poisoning by 2010. Federal lead abatement programs lack resources to make homes lead-safe, leading to insufficient hazard reduction for lead-poisoned children. Approximately 15% of children are poisoned by lead from home renovation projects. Old windows are a significant risk factor for lead exposure. The purpose of encouraging safe removal of lead hazards from homes is to decrease the number of children suffering from health consequences due to lead poisoning. Old windows with lead-based paint pose significant risks, as they deteriorate and generate lead dust, but replacing them can reduce lead poisoning hazards and save energy. SEC. 2. LEAD ABATEMENT TAX CREDIT. Amends tax code to include a new section for HOME LEAD ABATEMENT. The tax code allows a credit of 50% of abatement costs for eligible dwelling units, with a limit of $1,500 per unit per year.

A certified risk assessor must determine the hazard, and a certified lead abatement supervisor is required for the work. The term 'certified inspector' refers to an inspector certified by the EPA or a State agency. A 'certified risk assessor' is someone certified by the EPA or a State agency. No credit is allowed for eligible dwelling units without proper documentation after lead abatement. After lead abatement, a certified inspector or risk assessor provides written documentation to the taxpayer certifying post-abatement procedures and absence of lead dust hazards. The taxpayer must file this documentation with the State agency. The taxpayer must file documentation with the State agency, including receipts for lead hazard assessment and abatement costs, along with a statement indicating the age of the dwelling unit. The basis of the property eligible for the credit is reduced by the amount of the credit. The credit allowed under subsection (a) for the taxable year is limited by the regular tax liability plus other specified credits. Any excess credit can be carried forward for up to 20 years.
