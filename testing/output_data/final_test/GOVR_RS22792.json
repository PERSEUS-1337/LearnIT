    "content": "Workers with higher education levels have historically earned more annually than those with lower education levels. In 2007, a worker with a bachelor's degree earned 2.66 times more than a high school graduate. The importance of education in earnings has increased over the years, with the wage premium for bachelor's degree holders growing by 13 percentage points from the 1980s to the 2000s. The wage gap between high school graduates and non-graduates also increased by 14 percentage points. The wage gap between workers with postsecondary education short of a four-year college degree and high school graduates widened from 10% in 1980-1987 to 13% in 2000-2007. Workers with higher education levels have seen their standard of living increase, with wages more insulated from rising prices. Individuals without a high school diploma saw their earnings slightly outpace the rise in the Consumer Price Index, increasing their purchasing power by $839. Workers with a high school diploma or some college saw their wages hold up better against price increases, allowing them to buy an additional $4,224 to $4,486 in goods and services. The purchasing power of Bachelor's degree holders increased by $11,477 from 1987 to 2007. The earnings of college graduates have steadily grown, while those with a high school degree or less have fluctuated. This wage disparity raises concerns about inequality in the U.S. The annual earnings differences by education level are expected to widen over time. High school dropouts working full-time over 40 years may earn $1.0 million in 1999 dollars. In 2008, the unemployment rate varied by educational attainment, with rates ranging from 9.0% for those without a high school diploma to 2.6% for those with at least a bachelor's degree. The risk of displacement is lower for more educated individuals, and the likelihood of unemployment decreases as educational attainment increases. Workers with higher levels of education, especially those with a four-year college degree or more, have lower displacement rates and higher reemployment rates compared to workers with lower levels of education. For example, in the period from January 2003 to December 2005, 72% of workers with an advanced degree and 63% of workers with a bachelor's degree who were displaced from full-time jobs were reemployed in full-time jobs by January 2006. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a 15.3% increase in jobs requiring a bachelor's degree between 2006 and 2016, with nearly five million new jobs available for college graduates. Professional occupations like computer software engineers, teachers, and accountants are among the fastest-growing fields. Occupations that require little or no postsecondary education are projected to grow slowly, but jobs like retail salespersons, food preparation workers, office clerks, and home health aides will see significant increases in employment between 2006 and 2016."
