The Act \"Strengthening Community Safety Act of 2011\" amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to provide grants for eligible first responder agencies. Definitions in the section include 'active duty', 'eligible first responder agency', and 'first responder agency' which encompasses law enforcement agencies, fire services, and publicly or privately operated entities. The term 'reservist' is defined as a member of a reserve component of the Armed Forces. Grants are authorized for eligible first responder agencies, including law enforcement, fire services, and ambulance services authorized by the state for emergency medical response. Non-profit organizations are included, while for-profit organizations are excluded. The Administrator may grant up to $100,000 to eligible first responder agencies for costs incurred due to reservists being placed on active duty, excluding federally funded positions. The Administrator can grant up to $100,000 to first responder agencies for costs related to reservists on active duty. The grant authority will end 3 years after the section's enactment. Funds can be used for pay, benefits, overtime, and filling vacancies due to employees on active duty. First responder agencies can use grant funds for various expenses such as advertising, background investigations, and hiring incentives. The grant covers expenses from 90 days before deployment until the employee returns to work. Agencies must submit an application with required information to the Administrator. First responder agencies seeking assistance must describe activities and provide documentation to meet requirements. $5,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2012 through 2014. Reporting requirements include definitions and a report due within 2 years of enactment.
