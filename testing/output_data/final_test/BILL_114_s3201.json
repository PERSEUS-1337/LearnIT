    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Commodity Checkoff Program Improvement Act of 2016\". Congress finds that generic checkoff programs are intended to increase demand for agricultural commodities and benefit producers. However, these programs have been found to use funds to influence policy, which harms some producers. To prevent misuse of funds, there should be strict separation of engagement between the Boards. Checkoff programs should have strict separation between Boards and policy entities to prevent conflicts of interest and ensure lawful operation. Transparency is lacking in checkoff programs, allowing for misuse of funds. Anticompetitive conduct should be prohibited to maintain the proper operation of checkoff programs. Lack of transparency in checkoff programs enables and conceals abuses, necessitating transparency in expenditure to prevent and uncover such abuses. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.
