    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Consumer Telephone Records Protection Act of 2006\". It includes findings related to consumer telephone records. Congress finds that telephone records can be exploited by criminals due to the personal information they contain, such as users' doctors, relationships, and business associates. Unauthorized access to these records can occur through employees selling data or through pretexting. Unauthorized access to telephone records can happen through pretexting, where a person pretends to be the owner of the phone to convince the telephone company to release the data. Additionally, unauthorized access can also occur via the Internet, especially since many customers have their online accounts set up in advance but never access them. If someone activates the account before the customer, they can gain unfettered access to the telephone records and call logs. SEC. 3. PRIVACY PROTECTION FOR CUSTOMER INFORMATION OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS. Prohibition on obtaining customer information by false pretenses includes making false statements or providing forged information to a telecommunications carrier. Prohibition on soliciting or selling customer information obtained under false pretenses, with exceptions for law enforcement agencies. The section prohibits law enforcement agencies from obtaining customer proprietary network information of a telecommunications carrier in connection with their official duties. SEC. 4 amends Section 222 of the Communications Act to require telecommunications carriers to notify customers of any unauthorized disclosure of customer information. SEC. 5 involves enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission. SEC. 5 states that violations of section 3 will be enforced by the Federal Trade Commission under section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The Commission has the power to enforce compliance with the section, regardless of the person's engagement in commerce or meeting jurisdictional tests. SEC. 6 outlines criminal penalties for knowingly and intentionally violating section 3, including fines or imprisonment for up to 5 years. Enhanced penalties apply for aggravated cases involving violations of other laws or illegal activities exceeding certain thresholds.
