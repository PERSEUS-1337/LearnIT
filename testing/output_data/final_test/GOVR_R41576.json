    "content": "Mexico's close ties with the United States are crucial for both countries. The rising violence in Mexico, including murders, intimidation of politicians, and assassinations of journalists, is a major concern. Drug-related violence has led to brutal crimes like beheadings and car bombs, spreading beyond the border with the U.S. into Mexico's interior. Organized crime groups in Mexico have diversified their activities to include extortion, kidnapping, auto theft, oil smuggling, human smuggling, and drug sales. Violence, measured by intentional homicides, has increased by 7% between 2014 and 2015. Drug traffickers maintain territorial influence near production hubs and trafficking routes. During the Pe\u00f1a Nieto administration, homicide rates rose significantly, reaching record levels in 2017 with over 29,000 intentional homicides. Concerns were raised about human rights violations involving Mexican military and police forces colluding with criminal groups. The armed forces injured or killed around 3,900 individuals in domestic operations between 2007 and 2014. The high death rate in encounters with Mexican military indicates the lethality of the situations, with about 500 injuries and the rest being killings. There is debate on the exact number of casualties due to discrepancies between government and media reports. Data on casualties have not been consistently reported, with statistics not being made public after 2014. During President Calder\u00f3n's tenure, there was a sharp increase in organized crime-related homicides until 2011, followed by a slight decline. Approximately 150,000 homicides since 2006 were linked to organized crime. Drug trafficking violence is used to settle disputes and maintain order, with a significant escalation in Mexico compared to the U.S. since the 1980s. Mexico's violence extends beyond resolving disputes and discipline, targeting the government, political candidates, and the news media. While the country's homicide rate is not exceptional in the region, Latin America as a whole has a high level of intentional homicides. The rise in killings related to the drug war in Mexico, along with violence in other countries like Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela, is concerning to many observers. The rapid rise in Mexico's homicide rates and absolute number of homicides, along with over 34,000 disappeared individuals, has raised domestic and international concern. Former President Calder\u00f3n focused on combating drug trafficking organizations, deploying military troops and federal police to hot spots. Despite some high-profile arrests, few kingpins were prosecuted or convicted. Between 2007 and 2012, Mexico increased extraditions to the U.S. for drug trafficking suspects. This led to accusations of human rights violations against the Mexican military. President Pe\u00f1a Nieto aimed for a new security policy focused on reducing criminal violence. President Pe\u00f1a Nieto continued the strategy of targeting top drug kingpins and maintained cooperation with the United States under the M\u00e9rida Initiative, which began during President Calder\u00f3n's term. The government recentralized control over security to Mexico's interior ministry, but analysts noted continuity with Calder\u00f3n's security approaches. The M\u00e9rida Initiative, launched in 2008 during President Calder\u00f3n's term, initially focused on providing Mexico with hardware to combat drug trafficking organizations (DTOs). The $2.9 billion effort shifted to training and technical assistance for police, judicial reform, and crime prevention. The Pe\u00f1a Nieto government continued the programs, implementing a national militarized police force in 2014 with 5,000 officers added to the federal police force. The Pe\u00f1a Nieto administration reduced the federal police force from 40,000 to 5,000 officers to protect citizens from crime and safeguard economic activities. However, the focus on crime prevention declined due to budget austerity measures and slow economic growth. Congressional hearings addressed violence in Mexico, U.S. foreign assistance, and border security concerns. The U.S. consulate staff and security personnel in Mexico were attacked, some killed or wounded, allegedly with corrupt police support. Mexican drug traffickers may be using insurgent or terrorist techniques, including car bombs and grenades. Mexico's criminal groups control illicit drugs and are expanding into the heroin and synthetic opioids market. Political candidates were targeted in 2018. The increase in violence in Mexico during the 2018 electoral season, including attacks on political candidates, has led to concerns about political intimidation and threats to democracy. The U.S. Congress is monitoring the situation and evaluating Mexican government efforts to combat the illicit drug trade and reduce related violence. In March 2017, the U.S. Senate passed S.Res. 83 in support of Mexico and China's efforts to reduce fentanyl production and trafficking. President-elect Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador won the election in July 2018. There are concerns about potential decreased cooperation on security matters due to his skepticism towards the U.S. government. The splintering of large drug trafficking organizations into competing factions and gangs has been ongoing since 2007. The evolution of organized crime groups from large hierarchical DTOs to smaller, more agile networks has made criminal behavior harder to eradicate. These smaller organizations often outsource aspects of trafficking and resist norms to limit violence, leading to increased rivalries and continued violence. Larger organizations like Sinaloa have adopted cellular structures to protect themselves. The violence generated by Mexican crime groups is difficult to measure due to restricted reporting and attempts to mislead the public. Criminal actors publicize their crimes to intimidate rivals, the public, or security forces, sometimes masking their crimes by blaming others. Shoot-outs may go unreported due to media self-censorship or bodies disappearing. An example is the reported death of a Knights Templar leader, Nazario. Forced disappearances in Mexico are a growing concern, with efforts to count the missing limited by underreporting. Government estimates of disappeared people vary, especially those missing due to force and possible homicide. Mass graves are also a grim reality, exemplified by the case of the 43 disappeared students in Iguala, Guerrero. In mid-March 2017, a mass grave in Veracruz was discovered with 250 skulls and remains, some years old. Over 5,000 disappeared during former Governor Javier Duarte's term. Lack of databases in many states hinders identifying bodies and tracing weapons used by drug cartels. Mexican drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) are global businesses focused on efficiently distributing illegal drugs to maximize profits. They are major wholesalers in the US and are gaining control of retail distribution through alliances with US gangs. Despite their presence in multiple US jurisdictions, their operations are less violent in the US compared to Mexico. DTOs use bribery and violence to discipline employees, enforce transactions, limit competitors, and neutralize government actions. Mexican drug trafficking organizations use bribery and corruption to neutralize government actions, ensure impunity, and facilitate operations. Proceeds from drug sales are used to corrupt border officials, law enforcement, and public officials. When corruption fails, violence is used as an alternative. Law enforcement officials corrupted by DTOs sometimes carry out violent assignments. Purges of police have not solved the problem. The relationship between drug traffickers and the government is constantly evolving. The growth of Mexico's drug trafficking networks occurred during one-party rule by the PRI government, which tolerated and protected drug production and trafficking. The government pursued a policy of accommodation, allowing some drug activities to take place despite occasional arrests and eradication efforts. The PRI government in Mexico tolerated drug production and trafficking through a policy of accommodation. However, widespread corruption led to a working relationship between Mexican authorities and drug lords in the 1990s. The system's stability began to deteriorate as political power decentralized and democratization efforts increased, disrupting the equilibrium between state actors and organized crime. This led to a decrease in officials' ability to ensure impunity for drug traffickers and regulate competition among Mexican DTOs. During the 1980s and early 1990s, Mexico transitioned to become a key player in the international drug trade as Colombian DTOs lost control over cocaine trafficking routes to the United States. This shift was a result of intense enforcement efforts by the U.S. government, leading to the shutdown of traditional trafficking routes through the Caribbean. Mexican traffickers took over the profitable cocaine trade, causing intra-DTO violence as cartels competed for dominance over drug trafficking plazas. As Colombian DTOs lost control of cocaine trafficking routes to the United States in the 1980s and 1990s, Mexican DTOs took over, being paid in cocaine instead of cash. Mexico's DTOs evolved from couriers to wholesalers, dominating the U.S. drug markets and leading to increased violence to protect market share. Today, major Mexican DTOs handle multiple drugs and engage in violent struggles over strategic routes and warehouses. Mexico is a major producer and trafficking route for heroin, marijuana, methamphetamine, and cocaine destined for the United States. Sinaloa is a key region for drug cultivation and trade, with a history of notorious traffickers. Colombia saw a rise in coca bush cultivation and cocaine production in 2017. Mexico is a major producer and trafficking route for heroin, marijuana, methamphetamine, and cocaine destined for the United States. The Office of National Drug Control Policy estimates that 772 metric tons of cocaine were trafficked through Mexico in 2016. Mexican TCOs pose a significant threat to U.S. communities due to their dominance in heroin and fentanyl exports. Mexico is a major producer of heroin, with traffickers now producing white heroin, a purer and deadlier product. Additionally, Mexico is a producer and trafficker of the potent synthetic opioid, fentanyl. Mexico increased its eradication efforts of opium poppy and cannabis in 2016. Poppy cultivation expanded to 32,000 hectares, with potential heroin production totaling 81 metric tons. Mexican forces seized 13 metric tons of cocaine, 26 metric tons of methamphetamine, and 235 kilograms of opium gum in 2016. The DTOs in Mexico have been in constant flux in recent years. The drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) in Mexico have fragmented into many more groups, with between 9 and 20 major organizations now existing. This fragmentation has led to diversification into other criminal activities. The fluidity of these groups is highlighted by their competition and changing challenges. The Gulf cartel, once dominant in northeastern Mexico, faced internal fragmentation when its enforcers, Los Zetas, split to form a separate DTO. The Sinaloa DTO, rooted in western Mexico, fiercely competes for control of border routes in Chihuahua and Baja California to maintain its dominance in the country. Sinaloa DTO has a decentralized structure, making it adaptable in a competitive environment. Despite the arrest of its founder, Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n, in 2014, the cartel did not show visible power struggles initially. Speculation arose that Guzm\u00e1n's role in the cartel was more of a figurehead after his escape and subsequent rearrest. The Mexican government's decision to extradite Guzm\u00e1n to the United States in 2017 led to violent competition from the Cartel Jalisco-New Generation (CJNG). CJNG's rise and a power struggle within Sinaloa caused increasing violence. La Familia Michoacana split in 2015, leading to the rise of the Knights Templar in the region. CJNG gained prominence between 2013 and 2015. The CJNG cartel rose to prominence between 2013 and 2015, becoming the most dangerous and largest Mexican cartel. They thrived with the decline of the Knights Templar, targeted by the Mexican government. Information about the traditional DTOs is more available than about smaller crime groups. There are over 45 new regional and local crime groups operating, sometimes in conflict and sometimes cooperatively. The AFO controls the drug smuggling route between Baja California. The AFO, based in Tijuana, historically controlled the drug smuggling route between Baja California and southern California. Founded by Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo, it included leaders like Rafael Caro Quintero and \"El Chapo\" Guzman. The AFO, once dominant in Mexico, was known for brutal drug trade control in Tijuana in the 1990s and early 2000s. In the early 2000s, U.S. authorities targeted the AFO, resulting in arrests and killings of key members. Tijuana became violent in 2008 as the AFO split into two factions. The arrest of Garcia Simental in 2010 created a power vacuum for the Sinaloa DTO to gain control. Following the 2010 arrest of Garcia Simental, the Sinaloa DTO took advantage of the power vacuum to control the Tijuana/San Diego smuggling corridor. The AFO maintained control through an agreement with Sinaloa, with other trafficking groups paying a fee to use the plaza. Despite law enforcement successes, violence in Tijuana increased in late 2016. Violence in Tijuana surged in late 2016, with over 100 monthly murders attributed to Sinaloa battling CJNG. CJNG is involved in local and cross-border drug trafficking, potentially reshaping the area's DTO landscape. Analysts suggest CJNG's alliance with AFO remnants is fueling violence in Tijuana and Southern Baja California. Tijuana experienced a high number of homicides in 2017, indicating a resurgence of violence. Sinaloa, a longstanding DTO, consists of smaller networks. The Sinaloa Cartel, Mexico's oldest and most powerful DTO, was designated as a drug kingpin entity by President Obama in 2009. Its leaders, including \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n, controlled a vast network that corrupted officials in Mexico and abroad. By 2012, Sinaloa controlled 40%-60% of Mexico's drug trade, earning up to $3 billion annually. The Sinaloa Cartel, designated as a drug kingpin entity in 2009, controlled a significant portion of Mexico's drug trade by 2012, earning up to $3 billion annually. The DEA identified them as the primary trafficker of drugs to the United States. Following a federation breakup in 2008, violence escalated among former partners, leading to a tumultuous period in Mexican history. The United States targeted individuals and financial entities associated with the cartel, such as Alejandro Flores Cacho and his drug trafficking enterprise. The Sinaloa Cartel, led by \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n, faced challenges with his escapes from Mexican prisons. After extradition to the US in 2017, he awaits trial for criminal enterprise charges. His defense may argue he was not the cartel's head but a subordinate. The Sinaloa Cartel, led by \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n, may have a more decentralized leadership structure than previously thought, with Ismael Zambada Garcia, alias \"El Mayo,\" assumed to be a key figure. The cartel operates through a network of bosses controlling territories and forming alliances with local gangs for drug trafficking operations. Sinaloa's rivals are eyeing their drug empire built on trafficking cocaine, methamphetamine, marijuana, and heroin to the US market. The Sinaloa Cartel, led by \"El Chapo\" Guzm\u00e1n, faces uncertain future amid rising tensions between US and Mexico. Analysts debate on cartel's power, with some citing international dominance and government infiltration, while others point to factional breakup and violence. CJNG emerges as a new rival, battling Sinaloa in various regions since 2015. The Ju\u00e1rez DTO, once a powerful crime syndicate in Mexico, controlled the smuggling corridor between Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez and El Paso, TX in the 1980s and 1990s. Under the leadership of Amado Carrillo Fuentes, it controlled half of Mexican narcotics trafficking. After Amado's death in 1997, his brother Vicente took over until his arrest in 2014. The Ju\u00e1rez DTO broke from the Sinaloa federation in 2008, leading to violent rivalry between the two cartels. Between 2008 and 2012, Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez experienced a wave of violence with spikes in homicides, extortion, kidnapping, and theft, costing about 10,000 lives. The Ju\u00e1rez cartel, traditionally trafficking marijuana and cocaine, expanded into opium cultivation and heroin production. Violence dropped between 2012 and 2013, credited to police actions and President Calder\u00f3n's program Todos Somos Ju\u00e1rez. The Sinaloa DTO's dominance, possibly aided by local authorities, has led to relative peace in Juarez despite the continued presence of the Ju\u00e1rez DTO in Chihuahua. Many residents are hesitant to return due to the high homicide rate. The Gulf DTO, based in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, was a major competitor to Sinaloa in trafficking routes. The Gulf DTO, once a major competitor to Sinaloa for trafficking routes, now battles its former enforcement wing, Los Zetas, in northeastern Mexico. The Gulf DTO has split into competing gangs, with some analysts considering it fragmented. It originated in the bootlegging era of the 1920s and had ties to the Cali cartel in the 1980s. Its leader, Juan Garc\u00eda Abrego, was captured in 1996, and his successor, Osiel C\u00e1rdenas Guill\u00e9n, corrupted Mexican military forces to become his hired assassins. Gulf was considered one of the most powerful Mexican DTOs in the early 2000s. C\u00e1rdenas was eventually arrested by Mexican authorities. In the early 2000s, the Gulf DTO, one of the most powerful Mexican drug trafficking organizations, saw a split with Los Zetas. The tensions culminated in the killing of Antonio C\u00e1rdenas Guill\u00e9n in 2010, leading to leadership passing to Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sanchez. The exact cause of the split is unclear, but some attribute it to the growing strength of Los Zetas and a possible murder that sparked the rift. The conflict between the Gulf DTO and Los Zetas escalated in 2010, leading to intense violence in Mexico. Federal forces targeted key leaders in 2014, resulting in both groups being severely weakened. They now operate as fragmented cells with limited communication. From 2014 to 2016, reports of daily violence including kidnappings and shootings were rampant in Tamaulipas. Los Zetas, a prominent transnational DTO, have expanded into various criminal operations beyond drug smuggling, such as fuel theft and extortion. Originally consisting of former elite airborne special force members who defected to the Gulf DTO, they are known for organized violence and generating revenue through crimes like fuel theft, extortion, human smuggling, and kidnapping. Los Zetas had a significant presence in several Mexican states on the Gulf side of the country and extended their reach to Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez and some Pacific states. Los Zetas, a transnational DTO, are known for their aggressive tactics and control of territory through intimidation. They have been linked to numerous massacres and killings, including the 2011 firebombing of a casino in Monterrey and the mass execution of 193 migrants. Unlike other DTOs, they do not seek local support and have a reputation for violence and brutality. In 2012, Mexican marines killed Zeta leader Heriberto Lazcano in Coahuila. The capture of his successor, Miguel Angel Trevi\u00f1o Morales, in 2013, marked a decline for Los Zetas. Trevi\u00f1o Morales's brother Omar was also arrested in 2015. According to Mexico's attorney general, government efforts against cartels hit the Zetas the hardest, with over 30 leaders removed. Los Zetas are involved in various criminal activities, including fuel theft, extortion, kidnapping, human smuggling, and arms trafficking. Pemex, Mexico's state oil company, lost over $1.15 billion in 2014 due to oil tapping. The Atlantic Council reported that Los Zetas control about 40% of the stolen oil market. Illegal siphoning mainly occurs in Tamaulipas and Veracruz. Veracruz. Los Zetas factions have fragmented, leading to a decrease in power since 2011 and 2012. Before 2008, the Beltr\u00e1n Leyva Organization (BLO) was part of the Sinaloa federation but split after the arrest of its leader, Alfredo Beltr\u00e1n Leyva. The organization faced setbacks with the killing of Arturo Beltr\u00e1n Leyva in 2009 and the arrest of Carlos Beltr\u00e1n Leyva. In 2010, the Beltr\u00e1n Leyva Organization broke up after the killing of Arturo Beltr\u00e1n Leyva and the arrest of Carlos Beltr\u00e1n Leyva. H\u00e9ctor Beltr\u00e1n Leyva rebranded the remnants as the South Pacific cartel. Edgar \"La Barbie\" Valdez Villarreal formed the Independent Cartel of Acapulco. Splinter organizations like Guerreros Unidos and Los Rojos emerged, with Los Rojos operating in Guerrero and relying on kidnapping and extortion for revenue. The Guerreros Unidos traffics cocaine to Chicago and operates in Guerrero, M\u00e9xico, and Morelos. They were involved in the disappearance and murder of 43 Mexican teacher trainees. In Guerrero, infighting between drug trafficking organizations has led to high levels of violence, with the Guerreros Unidos being known to traffic heroin into the United States. The BLO, a Mexican drug trafficking organization, has alliances with other cartels to move drugs into the US and maintain distribution points in cities like Phoenix, Los Angeles, Chicago, and Atlanta. It remains influential in states like Morelos, Guerrero, Nayarit, and Sinaloa. Originally based in Michoac\u00e1n, LFM split from Los Zetas in 2006 to protect Michoac\u00e1n from drug traffickers. LFM, a group formed in 2006 to protect Michoac\u00e1n from drug traffickers, gained notoriety for extreme violence and tactics inspired by Los Zetas. They projected a populist image by providing social services to rural communities. In 2010, LFM called for a truce with the Mexican government and announced disbandment. Co-founder Nazario Moreno Gonz\u00e1lez was reportedly killed in 2010, but his body was never recovered. He reappeared in a shootout in 2014, confirming his death. LFM, a group formed in 2006 to protect Michoac\u00e1n from drug traffickers, gained notoriety for extreme violence and tactics inspired by Los Zetas. Co-founder Nazario Moreno Gonz\u00e1lez nurtured a new criminal organization called the Knights Templar, claiming to be a successor of LFM. Despite LFM's official disbandment in 2010, it remained active in trafficking, kidnapping, and extortion. Remaining cells of LFM are still operational in Guerrero and Mexico states, with a group called the New Family Michoacan reported to be active in parts of Guerrero and Michoac\u00e1n. The Knights Templar, a splinter group from La Familia Michoacana, operates as a drug trafficking organization in Michoac\u00e1n. They traffic methamphetamine, cocaine, and marijuana, while also promoting their version of evangelical Christianity and claiming to support \"social justice.\" The group is known for insecurity in Michoac\u00e1n and surrounding states. In 2013, frustration with Mexican law enforcement led to the birth of self-defense organizations in Michoac\u00e1n, targeting the Knights Templar. Local business owners funded the militias to combat extortion and crime ignored by corrupt police. Some groups sought resources from competing crime syndicates like CJNG. The self-defense movement in Michoac\u00e1n emerged in 2013 to combat the Knights Templar, a criminal group involved in extortion and other crimes. Despite some ties to rival groups like CJNG, the self-defense groups have made gains in fighting the Knights Templar, who have impacted local businesses and avocado growers in the region. The Knights Templar expanded into illegal mining, including iron ore extraction from unauthorized mines. They used Mexico's largest port, L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas, for smuggling operations until a federal occupation in 2014 disrupted their activities. The Mexican government controversially integrated self-defense group members into the \"Rural Police Force\" to combat cartels and prevent paramilitary escalation. The federal police and the Rural Police Force cooperated briefly with self-defense forces in Michoac\u00e1n, leading to the arrests of self-defense leaders in 2014. This sparked tension and renewed violence in the area. The Mexican government and self-defense forces dealt heavy blows to the Knights Templar, resulting in the killing of top leaders. The Knights Templar DTO leader \"La Tuta\" Gomez was captured in 2015. In February 2015, the leader of the Knights Templar DTO, Servando \"La Tuta\" Gomez, was captured, leading to a decline in the cartel's fortunes. New groups like Los Viagras emerged, challenging the Cartel Jalisco. In March 2017, the alleged leader of Los Viagras, Jos\u00e9 Carlos Sierra Santana, was killed, prompting the Mexican government to reinforce troops to prevent further violence. The Cartel Jalisco-New Generation (CJNG) first appeared in 2011, based in Jalisco state with operations in central Mexico. The Cartel Jalisco-New Generation (CJNG) emerged in 2011 in Jalisco state, expanding its influence in central Mexico and the Tierra Caliente region. Led by former associates of slain Sinaloa DTO leader Ignacio \"Nacho\" Coronel, CJNG was initially allied with Sinaloa before splitting in 2014. The group's roots trace back to the Milenio cartel, which disbanded in 2009, leading to CJNG's formation as a by-product. The Cartel Jalisco-New Generation (CJNG) has experienced fragmentation within its crime groups. Ruben Oseguera Cervantes, also known as \"El Mencho,\" is the current leader and a top fugitive wanted by the DEA. The Mexican military dealt a blow to CJNG by capturing its leader's deputy, Victor Hugo \"El Tornado\" Delgado Renteria, in July 2013. In January 2014, the leader's son, Rub\u00e9n Oseguera Gonz\u00e1lez (El Menchito), believed to be the second-in-command, was arrested but later released due to lack of evidence. Despite being captured multiple times, El Menchito was rearrested in July 2015 and is currently held in a maximum-security prison. CJNG was declared one of the most dangerous cartels in Mexico in 2015. The Cartel Jalisco-New Generation (CJNG) is described as one of the world's most prolific and violent drug trafficking organizations by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Analysts believe CJNG operates internationally, distributing cocaine and methamphetamine along a route spanning from the Southern Cone to the United States and Canada. Within Mexico, CJNG has a presence in 14 states, covering nearly half of the country, and has recently expanded into Aguas Calientes, San Luis Potosi, and Zacatecas states. The group has also engaged in battles with rival cartels in Tabasco, Veracruz, and other regions. The Cartel Jalisco-New Generation (CJNG) has engaged in battles with rival cartels in various states in Mexico, including Tabasco, Veracruz, and Guanajuato. They have clashed with the Sinaloa federation in Ciudad Juarez and Tijuana for control of the heroin trade. CJNG has also been linked to mass graves in southwestern Mexico and shot down an army helicopter in 2015. The group aims to dominate key ports on both the Pacific and Gulf Coasts to control the global narcotics supply chain. The CJNG has expanded its operations by accessing precursor chemicals from China and Latin America, fueling its growth with U.S. demand for methamphetamine and heroin. Despite leadership losses, the group has extended its reach and maintained cohesion, taking advantage of the fragmentation of the Sinaloa organization. The drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) are now more fragmented and competitive, with new actors like Los Zetas and the Knights Templar emerging. The landscape has shifted since 2010, leading to the rise of smaller organizations like CJNG. Recently, CJNG and Los Cuinis have emerged as major drug trafficking organizations in Mexico, with CJNG being compared to the Sinaloa DTO in terms of national reach. Both groups were designated as Specially Designated Narcotics Traffickers by the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2015. Analysts suggest that traditional DTOs in Mexico are being replaced by these new powerful organizations, leading to increased violence. Surviving groups from cartel breakups are struggling to conduct transnational drug trafficking. The fragmentation of drug cartels in Mexico, following the kingpin strategy, has led to resurging violence and the emergence of new gangs and small DTOs. Government enforcement actions have resulted in the incapacitation of top leaders, but also sparked violent succession struggles and shifting alliances among criminal groups. The power balance between different groups is constantly changing, making it challenging to predict the landscape of drug trafficking in the region. The Mexican criminal landscape is complex, with rival crime networks grouped regionally. Four main umbrella groups emerged in 2014 and 2015: Tamaulipas state, Sinaloa state, tierra caliente regional group, and a group along the southeastern coast. Some see diversification of drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) as a sign of growth, while others believe it's a response to enforcement measures and changing drug consumption patterns. The Mexican criminal landscape is complex, with rival crime networks grouped regionally. Four main umbrella groups emerged in 2014 and 2015. The growing public condemnation of DTOs may be stimulated by their diversification into street crime, causing harm to Mexican civilians. Analysts refer to them as transnational criminal organizations or mafias. The crime organization landscape is fluid, with an increasing multiplication of criminal groups in Mexico. The Mexican criminal landscape is complex, with well-armed criminal groups increasing in number from six in 2006 to possibly over 20 by the end of 2014. Analysts describe these groups as organized crime groups engaged in diverse criminal activities. Mexican political scientist Eduardo Guerrero-Guti\u00e9rrez identified four types of DTOs in 2015: national cartels, regional cartels, toll-collector cartels, and drug trafficking cells, with over 200 organizations in the final category. The Mexican government's counter-DTO strategy aims to reduce DTOs' activity from a national-security threat to a law-and-order issue. However, President Pe\u00f1a Nieto failed to decrease the military's involvement in domestic policing, leading to accusations of human rights violations. Corruption remains a challenge, with politicians allegedly colluding with DTOs. The former governor of Veracruz is accused of fostering a \"state of terror\" and is among 14 governors facing corruption allegations. Some towns in Mexico have become ghost towns due to displacement, especially near the Texas border and in drug cultivation areas like Sinaloa. Violence has increased due to the splintering of criminal organizations and the rise of a post-Sinaloa cartel era with a lucrative heroin trade. Despite this, some believe the Sinaloa DTO and CJNG can still operate with impunity through bribery and corruption. Many U.S. officials are concerned about Mexico's ability to reduce violence and control criminal groups, especially the CJNG's use of bribery and corruption. Analysts criticize the government's reliance on the kingpin strategy, calling for long-term institutional reform to combat organized crime and corruption. Strengthening U.S.-Mexican security cooperation is seen as crucial for addressing these challenges. The future of U.S.-Mexican security cooperation, including the M\u00e9rida Initiative, is uncertain under Mexico's new administration, which may demand changes in the bilateral relationship."
