    "title": "SB 422",
    "content": "The people of California enact the following. The Division 26 of the Public Resources Code is amended to create the Santa Clara Valley Open-Space Authority Act, emphasizing the importance of open-space preservation and greenbelt creation in Santa Clara County to maintain the quality of life and support agricultural activities. The Santa Clara Valley Open-Space Authority Act aims to address the loss of urban properties by implementing a local funding program for open-space preservation. The creation of the Authority in Santa Clara County will facilitate timely decisions on greenbelting and property maintenance for the benefit of all individuals using open space. The Santa Clara Valley Open-Space Authority was created on February 1, 1993, with jurisdiction over all areas in the county except those within the Midpeninsula Regional Open-Space District. Cities within the jurisdiction had to pass a resolution by January 15, 1993, to be included. Failure to do so would result in exclusion from the authority. The creation of the authority is not subject to review by the Santa Clara County Local Agency Formation Commission. The Santa Clara Valley Open-Space Authority's boundaries may be altered by annexing contiguous territory in a neighboring county, following the Cortese-Knox-Hertzberg Local Government Reorganizing Act of 2000. The neighboring county's board of supervisors must pass a resolution to be included within the authority's jurisdiction before annexation can occur. The Santa Clara Valley Open-Space Authority has the power to acquire, hold, and dispose of real and personal property through various means. Priority is given to acquiring open space closest to urban areas, with remote ranchlands in the Diablo Range only to be acquired through conservation easements or grants. The Santa Clara Valley Open-Space Authority can enforce open-space easements on lands dedicated for that purpose. Any conveyance of real property for open-space use requires voter consent, except for short-term leases that maintain the land's open-space or agricultural use. Section 35153 of the Public Resources Code is amended to require voter consent for any conveyance of real property for open-space use, except for short-term leases that maintain the land's open-space or agricultural use. The authority can use eminent domain to acquire property for division purposes, with exceptions for certain types of land. Approval by a four-fifths vote of the governing board is required for eminent domain. The property owner can object to eminent domain acquisition by filing a written objection with the legislative body within 30 days of the governing board's vote. The legislative body will consider the objection at a public hearing within 45 days and can uphold it by a two-thirds vote for a city or a majority vote for a county. If upheld, the authority cannot proceed with the acquisition. If a property owner objects to eminent domain acquisition, the authority cannot proceed with the acquisition within its jurisdiction."
