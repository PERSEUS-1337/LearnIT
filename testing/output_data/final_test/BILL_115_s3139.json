    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Transit Rail Inspection Practices Act of 2018\" or the \"TRIP Act\". It pertains to public transportation safety inspections. The Transit Rail Inspection Practices Act of 2018, also known as the TRIP Act, amends Section 5329 of title 49, United States Code, to include consideration of performance-based and risk-based methodologies in public transportation safety plans. The Secretary is required to update the national public transportation safety plan as necessary. Additionally, the Act addresses the effectiveness of enforcement authorities. The Secretary will develop and share with State safety oversight agencies the process to monitor the effectiveness of enforcement authorities. State safety oversight programs must grant their agencies access to inspect rail fixed guideway public transportation systems. The State safety oversight agency must establish policies and procedures for accessing and inspecting rail fixed guideway public transportation systems, including conducting inspections without advance notice. A rail fixed guideway public transportation agency must provide data to the State safety oversight agency for identifying and evaluating safety risks. The State safety oversight agency should establish policies and procedures for data collection based on the size and complexity of the transportation system. The State safety oversight agency must incorporate policies and procedures into the State safety oversight program standard and the public transportation agency safety plan. The Secretary will assess the agency's capability to conduct inspections to ensure they are adequate for the transportation system. The State safety oversight agency must have adequate resources for risk-based inspections of rail fixed guideway public transportation systems. The Secretary will issue a special directive for the development and implementation of these inspection programs and may enforce compliance using various authorities. The Secretary of Transportation will issue special directives for risk-based inspection programs within one year of the Act's enactment. Inspection requirements for State safety oversight agencies will apply two years after the special directive is issued. The amendments made by this section do not affect the initial approval requirements for a State safety oversight program under section 5329(e)(3) of title 49, United States Code. SEC. 3. Funding for State Safety Oversight Program Grants is amended to increase the percentage from 0.5 to 0.75. This amendment applies to fiscal year 2020 and beyond. Passed the Senate on September 25, 2018."
