    "content": "Budgetary pressures have increased concern about using resources for transportation projects effectively. The federal government's role in project delivery and the delays caused by environmental review processes are key issues. This report examines sources of delay in highway and transit projects, including the environmental review process, but evidence on timelines is limited and anecdotal. The evidence suggests that major highway and transit projects take 10 to 15 years to plan and build, with delays often unrelated to environmental reviews. Delays are mainly due to securing funding, community consensus, and dealing with affected parties. Congress has options to speed up project delivery, but timelines for complex projects may not drastically shorten. The report provides an overview of the project delivery process for highway and transit projects. The report discusses the process for highway and transit projects, focusing on reasons for project delays and environmental streamlining efforts. It also identifies new legislative options for Congress to expedite project delivery, particularly for major highway, bridge, and transit projects. These projects can take 10 to 15 years to plan and build, with delays often related to funding, community consensus, and dealing with affected parties. State DOTs and transit agencies receive federal funding for highway and transit projects, with requirements set by federal law. Major highway projects involve around 200 steps grouped into planning, design, right-of-way acquisition, and construction phases. Transportation needs are identified and projects are developed within available resources. State DOTs and MPOs develop long- and short-range plans for passenger and freight movement, involving community interests. The preliminary design and environmental review phase, which is crucial in the project development process, includes considering alternatives and selecting a preferred option. The final design phase of the project development process involves identifying the preferred alternative, determining property needs, estimating project costs, acquiring right-of-way, relocating affected residents and businesses, and utilities. Property acquisition must adhere to the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Act of 1970. The state DOT awards construction contracts, oversees construction, and completes the final project. Federal-aid construction projects are subject to various federally required contract provisions. The federal government oversees construction projects, ensuring compliance with provisions like nondiscrimination and minimum wage laws. States are reimbursed by the federal government for project costs. Agencies are encouraged to work concurrently to speed up project delivery, including combining design and construction phases into a design-build contract. The design-build contract is used to speed up project delivery by identifying preliminary engineering issues, proposed road alignments, costs, and project details. This phase includes environmental assessments, surveys, analyses, studies, and permits to establish parameters for the final design. Environmental review involves NEPA documentation and compliance with other local, state, tribal, or federal laws. The NEPA process requires federal agencies to consider environmental impacts and public input before making final decisions on projects. This includes preparing an environmental impact statement (EIS) for projects with significant environmental effects. After approval of the final EIS, a Record of Decision is issued documenting the selected project alternative and public comments. If the project's impacts are unclear, the sponsor must conduct an environmental assessment. To determine significant impacts, a project sponsor must conduct an environmental assessment. If no EIS is needed, a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) is issued. The lead agencies responsible for NEPA documentation are designated, with FHWA and FTA identified for highway and transit projects. The recipient of federal funds for a project serves as a joint lead agency. The project sponsor, such as a state DOT or local agency, typically prepares NEPA documentation for highway projects, with oversight from FHWA or FTA. Most highway projects are processed as categorical exclusions, which do not have significant environmental impacts but are not exempt from NEPA requirements. Categorical exclusions under NEPA have no significant environmental impact and are excluded from preparing an EIS or EA. Only 4% of FHWA-funded projects require an EIS, with 92% processed as categorical exclusions. Some states have no projects requiring an EIS, while others have between 1 and 5 statements in preparation. Projects funded through FHWA programs are mostly processed as categorical exclusions, with only 4% requiring an EA/FONSI. The proportion of projects needing an EIS has remained steady since 1998. These projects are typically high-profile, complex, and costly, representing 15% of total funding in 2007 despite being only 4% of the total number. The second part of the environmental review process involves additional permits, approvals, reviews, or studies required by federal law, which can add complexity to the project. The environmental review process for transportation projects is often misunderstood and can be affected by unique geographic, demographic, historic, and natural conditions. Requirements may be implemented by the DOT or an outside agency with jurisdiction, leading to sometimes extensive reviews that contribute to delays. Specific requirements are project-dependent and vary based on the level of impacts to resources. Certain federal laws identified by transportation stakeholders can increase the time to complete the environmental review process for surface transportation projects. These laws include the Endangered Species Act, the National Historic Preservation Act, the Clean Water Act, and \"Section 4(f)\" of the Department of Transportation Act of 1966. The agencies authorized to implement these laws are specified, such as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the U.S. Department of Transportation. Federal agencies other than DOT may need to participate in the environmental review process for highway projects, providing scientific analysis or assessments. They may have to prioritize transportation projects over other activities like mining, timber sales, or construction projects to avoid duplication of effort according to NEPA regulations. NEPA regulations require concurrent preparation of documentation with environmental requirements. Final EIS or FONSI must show compliance with all environmental laws and provide assurance of meeting requirements. NEPA serves as an umbrella statute, integrating other environmental requirements into its process. The NEPA process integrates other environmental requirements, such as obtaining permits under laws like the Clean Water Act. Compliance with NEPA does not replace the need to comply with other laws, but serves as a framework for identifying and addressing them. The time to complete the environmental review process under NEPA is tied to demonstrating compliance with other environmental requirements. When identifying causes of project delays, it is important to distinguish between compliance with NEPA and other laws. For example, a bridge rehabilitation project may qualify for a categorical exclusion under NEPA but still require consultation with other laws like the National Historic Preservation Act. Delays in approval of the categorical exclusion could be due to requirements of NEPA or other laws. The NEPA process requires approval of a completed EIS, a finding of no significant impact, or approval of categorical exclusion before final design and property acquisition can proceed. Additional environmental review may be needed if project changes impact previously identified environmental impacts. The New Starts program provides federal funds for new fixed-guideway transit systems and expansions on a competitive basis. The New Starts program provides federal funding for new fixed-guideway transit systems and expansions. Federal funding is typically committed in a full funding grant agreement (FFGA) between the federal government and a transit agency. The process for obtaining a FFGA begins with regional planning and alternatives analysis to select a locally preferred transportation option for evaluation and approval by the FTA. The project sponsor submits the preferred alternative to FTA for evaluation and approval for entry into preliminary engineering. New Starts projects must fulfill NEPA requirements as they involve a proposed major federal action significantly affecting the environment. NEPA scoping identifies alternatives and significant environmental issues. Preliminary engineering refines the project by examining costs, benefits, and impacts of different design alternatives. FTA may approve the project for final design after preliminary engineering is complete. Final design includes preparation of construction plans and cost estimates. The final design phase includes preparation of construction plans and cost estimates. FTA may approve the project for a Full Funding Grant Agreement (FFGA), which requires notification to Congress. Small Starts projects are a simplified version of major New Starts projects, with a cost limit of $250 million and seeking $75 million or less in federal funding. The Small Starts project process is a simplified version of major New Starts projects, with a simpler alternatives analysis and combined preliminary engineering and final design phases. FTA's approval for project development requires fewer and simplified reports, and final design cannot start until the NEPA process is complete. Very Small Starts projects costing less than $50 million have a highly simplified alternatives analysis process. Until FTA issues final regulations for the Small Starts program, this process will continue. Projects costing $25 million or less are exempt from the Small Starts evaluation process. Exempt projects can submit simple applications for funding but still need to meet NEPA and environmental requirements. There is limited public data on project delivery timelines due to project diversity and record-keeping challenges. FHWA and AASHTO have provided general timeframes for the five project phases. FHWA and AASHTO have outlined timeframes for major highway projects, estimating 9 to 19 years for projects with significant environmental impacts. Most federally funded projects are smaller and can advance from planning to construction within 1 year, but may take up to 4-6 years. The reasons for project delivery delays are not clear due to a lack of systematic data. There is no consensus on the reasons for project delivery delay, as measuring delays can be subjective and controversial without clear time frames established ahead of time. Studies show that delays in highway projects are often due to non-environmental factors, even though environmental review can take a long time. In 2002-2003, FHWA conducted surveys to identify causes of delay in the environmental review process for EIS preparation. Top reasons for delay included lack of funding, low local/state priority, local controversy, resource agency review, fish/wildlife compliance, historic preservation requirements, wetlands issues, and complex projects. Delays in highway projects are often due to non-environmental factors. The second FHWA survey in FY2002 gathered data on projects taking more than five years to complete and projects requiring an EIS completed in under three years. Projects completed in under three years cited early agency coordination as the primary reason for timely completion. The primary reasons for projects taking more than five years to complete an EIS were low priority, complex project, change in scope, and historic preservation. Other reasons included poor consultant work, lack of funding, issues with city documentation, lawsuits, and changing the document from an EA to an EIS. An academic study on NEPA reviews for highway projects in Oregon found that design changes, citizen/property owner concerns, communications and staffing problems, and funding availability were common causes of delay. Some citizen concerns related to traffic, safety, and access led to design changes in projects, causing delays but potentially improving the final outcome. Staff turnover, often due to funding issues and agency reorganization, also contributed to delays by hindering communication between agencies. FHWA noted that project delays are not always straightforward, as design reviews can lead to alterations in project features. Decisions made by local governments and project modifications can lead to changes in right-of-way activities and environmental reviews, resulting in new acquisition requirements and revisions to project documentation. These changes can cause delays, impacting project schedules and budgets. Delays can also occur independently in various functional areas such as design, right-of-way, and environment. The effects of delays can cascade throughout different disciplines within the organization, leading to obscured original causes. The study conducted interviews with state DOTs to identify main reasons for project delays, including utility coordination, railroad involvement, right-of-way acquisition, interagency coordination, and lack of funding. The study did not evaluate the relative importance or quantify the effects of these factors on project delivery. The NCHRP study found that utility coordination and relocation can cause project delays, especially during construction. Utilities in highway right-of-way often need to be relocated with little compensation, making it a low priority for them. Underground utilities further complicate matters due to poor records and unknown relocation work. In dense urban areas, dealing with multiple entities for utility coordination increases the risk of delay. Railroad involvement was also cited as a common cause of delays by state DOT officials. The NCHRP study identified various factors contributing to project delays, including right-of-way acquisition, long review times from permitting agencies, disputes between transportation departments and landowners, and problems with interagency coordination during planning and environmental review stages. Delays can also occur due to utility coordination and relocation issues, especially in dense urban areas. Railroad involvement was highlighted as another common cause of delays by state DOT officials. The study highlights delays in project delivery due to long review times from permitting agencies, different priorities among agencies, studies needing to be redone, lack of communication, and industry expectations of delays. Another recent study by OCTA also identified environmental review, right-of-way acquisition, utility relocation, and railroad involvement as sources of delay. The public works construction industry accepts delays as part of the process, hindering project acceleration. Barriers include institutional factors rather than legal issues. Delays stem from federal fiscal constraints, micromanagement, risk aversion, and funding predictability. Transportation improvements require reliable funding sources for implementation and maintenance. The OCTA study highlights challenges in project delivery due to fiscal constraints and delays caused by uncertain funding and cumbersome planning processes. It suggests streamlining oversight processes to focus on accountability and good project control rather than micromanagement. Federal agencies are criticized for being risk adverse and causing delays by meticulously reviewing every possible issue without considering the consequences or costs of delay. The concern with project delivery delays is partly due to the completion of high-profile highway projects under emergency conditions, such as the rebuilding of the I-35W bridge in Minneapolis in just over a year. Representative John Mica's plan to speed up project delivery is called \"the 437 Plan.\" Other examples include the I-580 connector in San Francisco rebuilt in 26 days after a truck crash and the I-40 bridge in Webber Falls rebuilt in 65 days after being struck by a river barge. The FHWA found that lack of funding or low priority are common causes of project delays. In emergency situations, project delays due to lack of funding, low priority, local controversy, stakeholder opposition, and political support may recede. Special circumstances can simplify project complexity and environmental concerns. Federal funding for small-scale highway projects is available through various FHWA programs. A study on small-scale projects in ten states found concerns about delays in project delivery due to issues like finding local matching funds, NEPA and right-of-way processes complexity, and restrictions on using local agency forces for construction. Staff turnover at local agencies also contributed to a lack of familiarity with federal regulations. Delays in project delivery are attributed to staff turnover at local agencies, lack of familiarity with federal regulations, compliance issues, appraisal delays, and slow permit approvals. Studies on transit New Starts projects show a lack of data on completion timelines, with only 9 out of 40 projects having complete data. The process length remains inconclusive due to data limitations. The completion times of 9 transit projects varied significantly, with the shortest taking 4 years 7 months and the longest taking 14 years 2 months. Another study found that non-New Starts projects generally took less time to complete than those seeking funding from the New Starts program. These findings may not be representative of all New Starts projects. The New Starts program for transit projects faces concerns over complexity, length, and expense in the federal approval process. Despite data issues, studies suggest the process requires extensive documentation and review by the FTA, leading to delays and high costs for transportation industry stakeholders. The New Starts evaluation process has been proposed as a model for other federal programs, but complaints persist about its time-consuming nature. The FTA-sponsored study identified problems causing confusion and delays in transit projects, including unclear requirements, organizational conflicts, and inefficient technology use. The New Starts review process prioritizes projects based on submission order, leading to potential delays for smaller projects. Frequent policy changes by FTA also contribute to additional costs and project revisions. The FTA-sponsored study highlighted issues causing delays and additional costs in transit projects, such as unclear requirements and organizational conflicts. Problems like long delivery times and redundant work during project submissions were attributed to staffing issues and overlapping requirements between New Starts alternatives analysis and NEPA review. Stakeholders have suggested eliminating a separate alternatives analysis to streamline the process. Several stakeholder groups have proposed eliminating a separate alternatives analysis in the New Starts program. Project delays are often due to actions at the local level, not directly attributable to the federal program. Past legislative efforts aimed to accelerate environmental reviews of transportation projects, known as \"environmental streamlining.\" The term \"streamlining\" was used in TEA-21 but not defined in the statute or regulation. TEA-21 included streamlining provisions for timely delivery of transportation projects while protecting the environment. It directed DOT to establish a coordinated environmental review process and allowed reimbursement for expedited compliance. These provisions could be implemented voluntarily by states or codified into DOT's NEPA regulations. SAFETEA, unlike TEA-21, does not use the term \"streamlining\" but includes provisions to expedite compliance with environmental requirements like NEPA and Section 4(f). It designates DOT as the lead agency for transportation projects, specifies roles, sets decision-making deadlines, and changes requirements for transportation planning and environmental review processes. The development of long-range transportation plans must include consultations with resource agencies, environmental mitigation discussions, stakeholder involvement plans, and visualization of transportation strategies. In 2007, DOT implemented regulations for planning requirements under SAFETEA, including guidance on efficient environmental and planning linkages. A significant change was the establishment of new project development procedures for highways, transit, and multi-modal projects, replacing TEA-21's streamlining provisions. The new process is mandatory for projects requiring an EIS. The new process for projects requiring an EIS mandates project sponsors to notify DOT of project details, establishes participating agencies for NEPA process, sets a 180-day limit on judicial claims, and allows federal funds for expediting environmental review. In 2006, DOT provided guidance to assist state DOTs in implementing SAFETEA's new environmental review process, including provisions for state assumption of responsibility for categorical exclusions. California, Utah, and Alaska have entered into MOUs with FHWA under Section 6004. California, Utah, and Alaska have entered into MOUs with FHWA under Section 6004. Section 6005 established a pilot program for certain states to assume federal environmental review responsibilities, with only California participating. Section 6009 amended Section 4(f) requirements to allow for de minimis impacts to resources. Other states declined participation in the pilot program due to liability concerns. The majority of state DOT respondents supported SAFETEA's environmental requirements, but had concerns about duplication of existing procedures and potential negative impacts on schedules. Approval was seen for the 180-day statute of limitations and de minimis provisions in Section 4(f), but some felt new environmental review requirements could hinder streamlining efforts. In a 2011 report, the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) noted that NEPA-related environmental approvals were expedited by 17.9 months under the Section 6005 pilot program. Time savings were achieved by eliminating a layer of government review and consolidating NEPA reviews with Caltrans'. Caltrans attributed the shortened project delivery time to its new role as NEPA lead agency and emphasis on rapid project delivery. The report highlighted the significant role of NEPA delegation in overall project delivery time savings. Despite changes enacted in SAFETEA, transportation stakeholders still cite issues in the environmental-review process, such as lengthy NEPA documents, DOT's legal sufficiency reviews, outside agency review delays, and potential duplication of analysis. DOT's NEPA regulations address these issues, but coordination between environmental review and transportation planning processes remains a challenge. Many proposals have been suggested to expedite the environmental review process for highway and transit projects, including giving state DOTs more autonomy and authorizing funding for activities to speed up the process. Stakeholders have primarily advocated for legislative options over additional regulatory requirements to address delays in project delivery. The proposal to abolish federal surface transportation programs and shift responsibility to states, known as \"devolution,\" is being considered by Congress. Proponents suggest retaining certain programs like the Interstate Highway System. Another approach is delegating federal oversight responsibilities to states to expedite project delivery. The proposal to delegate federal oversight responsibilities to states for project delivery has been suggested as a pilot program. This could involve states implementing performance-based management programs in exchange for more autonomy in project development. Another option is creating an office within the Department of Transportation to accelerate project delivery, as proposed in the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 2009. Expedited Project Delivery offices were proposed in FHWA and FTA to oversee timely completion of funded projects, focusing on large and complex ones. These offices would provide leadership in identifying and solving project issues, especially related to environmental reviews. Annual reports to Congress were required. The proposed Expedited Project Delivery offices in FHWA and FTA aimed to improve project delivery by providing leadership in problem-solving and issuing annual reports to Congress. However, questions arose regarding their authority to enforce recommendations and the funding needed for their implementation. One approach to expedite project delivery is to enhance partnerships between federal agencies and grant recipients, potentially through establishing partnering plans, funding collaboration awards, or creating specialized centers for project delivery. This could involve more partners beyond state DOTs, such as other state and local agencies. Partnering grants could also be considered to support innovative contracting techniques. Additionally, there is a suggestion to reward states and metropolitan areas for timely project completion while upholding review standards and public involvement. One suggestion to expedite project delivery is to exempt projects from federal requirements if the federal funding is relatively small, such as less than $1 million or a certain percentage of total project costs. This would allow projects to be administered under state regulations, potentially speeding up delivery times for smaller projects. One option to improve project delivery is to certify compliance with federal requirements for funding recipients and allow projects to proceed without further approval if federal funds are one-third or less of project costs. Another suggestion is to enhance internal resources of agencies involved in project delivery by providing greater federal funding assistance for technology and data like geographic information systems. Additionally, expanding the delegation of DOT's authority under NEPA to states could be considered in surface transportation reauthorization. This could make permanent SAFETEA's Pilot Program and allow delegation of NEPA authority to any consenting state. After the establishment of programs allowing states to assume federal authority under NEPA, two main factors were identified that may deter states from assuming that authority. One factor is that states would have to waive sovereign immunity and consent to federal court jurisdiction, making them solely liable for compliance. Some suggest a process where states can approve NEPA documentation but liability remains with DOT. Legislation could provide states with more autonomy in implementing NEPA. Some stakeholders are concerned about DOT regulations related to rights-of-way acquisitions in states assuming federal authority under NEPA. NEPA requires federal agencies to consider impacts before taking action, preventing the use of federal funds for acquisitions before completing the NEPA process. States risk losing future federal funding if they purchase property before the process is complete. The DOT regulations under NEPA require federal agencies to consider impacts before taking action, preventing the use of federal funds for acquisitions before completing the NEPA process. States risk losing future federal funding if they purchase property before the process is complete. Additionally, there are concerns about the state assuming federal authority, which would limit their ability to make ROW acquisitions and enforce deadlines on outside agencies for permits and approvals. The Department of Transportation (DOT) has limited authority to enforce deadlines on other agencies involved in the NEPA process due to jurisdictional laws like the Clean Air Act or Endangered Species Act. Each project's laws and agencies vary, making it challenging for DOT to establish binding deadlines. One potential option in reauthorization could be to continue the process allowing DOT to approve federal funds for state, tribal, or federal agencies supporting activities. SAFETEA did not provide additional funding for expediting transportation projects, requiring states to use their normal allocation of federal funds. Despite increased consideration of environmental issues in planning processes, integration with other planning efforts has not significantly sped up project delivery. One proposed solution is to create an Integrated Planning Pilot Project in reauthorization. The Integrated Planning Pilot Project, part of the Special Experiment Program authority for FHWA, aims to streamline environmental review and improve highway project delivery. Other initiatives like the EDC Initiative and EPL encourage innovative methods and best practices to shorten project delivery times. The EDC initiative aims to shorten project delivery times through various methods, including innovative contracting such as FHWA's SEP-14 and SEP-15. New options for accelerating highway projects include acquiring right-of-way, relocating affected residents and businesses, and managing utilities. Construction bids traditionally follow right-of-way acquisition. The proposal suggests allowing construction bidding and work to start before completing right-of-way acquisition, contingent on a risk analysis. There are discussions about streamlining the relocation process for residents and businesses, potentially by allowing states to use their own procedures if certified by FHWA. Delays due to utility relocation could be addressed by improving coordination. One option to address delays from utility relocation is to improve partnerships between DOTs and utilities by revising federal guidance. Congress has made changes to programs like New Starts and SAFETEA to speed up project delivery. Another option is to research ways to enhance coordination between project developers and utility companies. To increase private participation and risk-taking in project development, FTA has offered training workshops and project delivery tools. Congress may consider simplifying the New Starts process by reducing steps and moving up federal funding decisions. One proposal is to approve entry into the New Starts program as a signal of intent to fund a project. Approval into the program would signal the federal government's intent to fund a project if certain conditions are met. There are proposals to streamline the process with Project Development Agreements (PDAs) and fast-track low-risk projects. Critics are concerned about potential reduction in evaluation rigor. Critics are concerned that simplifying the evaluation process for the Small Starts program may lead to federal support for less beneficial projects and a potential oversaturation of project proposals. This could result in quick funding approval for projects that may later face funding shortages from Congress. The downsides of fast-tracking New Starts projects include potential problems not being detected early, charges of favoritism, and sponsors with little experience in project development. The FTA has the authority to make changes to improve the approval process, such as defining project stages and improving project reviews. Congress may oversee the implementation of these improvements. The FTA may reduce project evaluation time with more staff for New Starts proposals, but funding increase may be challenging. Frequent policy changes by FTA cause delays and extra costs for project sponsors. Suggestions include applying changes to future submissions and Congress directing FTA on this issue. Congress may need to revisit provisions in STAA for New Starts approval process changes in surface transportation reauthorization legislation. The STAA provisions aimed to streamline the approval process for transportation projects by eliminating the need for FTA approval at multiple stages and reducing it to one step with the approval of a FFGA. It also sought to remove the alternatives analysis requirement under the New Starts program and increase the threshold for major projects from $75 million to $100 million in federal assistance. Additionally, it would have allowed for fast-tracking of certain projects and exempted those requesting $25 million or less in federal assistance. Projects requesting $25 million or less in federal assistance would be exempt from program requirements, allowing them to be advanced using a special warrant."
