    "content": "Ownership and use of federal lands have been a source of controversy for decades, with conflicting public values raising questions about the extent of federal government ownership, how to balance different land uses, whether to designate protected areas, and how to manage fees for land and resource use. Congress continues to address these issues through legislative proposals, program oversight, and funding for federal land management agencies. This report provides an overview of federal land management and the agencies involved. The report provides an overview of federal land management, including the agencies involved, how federal lands are managed, and the funding sources for these agencies. It is divided into nine sections, covering topics such as federal lands financing, the four major federal land management agencies, their history, organizational structure, and management responsibilities. The report covers federal land management, including agencies involved, management responsibilities, land acquisition procedures, and statutory authorities. It includes sections on the National Wilderness Preservation System, National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, and National Trails System. The federal government owns and manages approximately 650 million acres of land in the United States. Table 1 provides data on federal land acreage administered by four federal land management agencies in each state and the District of Columbia. The federal government owns and manages approximately 650 million acres of land in the United States. Table 1 shows the total federal land acreage administered by four federal land management agencies in each state and the District of Columbia. The figures in Table 1 do not include lands administered by the Department of Defense or other federal agencies, leading to an understatement of total federal land. There is significant variation in the federal presence within states, with percentages ranging from 0.2% in Connecticut to 80.8% in Nevada. Some states have less than \u00bd million acres managed by federal agencies, while others have over 10 million acres within their borders. The federal government owns and manages a significant amount of land in the United States, particularly in the Western states. The management of these lands is often controversial due to competing land uses. These lands have played a crucial role in American history, contributing to the strength of the federal government and providing revenue for various needs. The formation of the federal government was influenced by the control over western lands. The federal government's control over western lands, known as the \"western\" lands, between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River, was crucial in strengthening the centralized federal government under the U.S. Constitution. Land laws like the Land Ordinance of 1785 and the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 established land surveying and territorial governance systems, leading to statehood. States initially hesitant to cede these lands eventually did so, granting constitutional powers to the federal government to regulate federal property and create new states. The new Congress, starting in 1789, enacted land statutes similar to those by the Continental Congress, reflecting two visions: reserving federal lands for national use and selling others for development. Policy clashes between East and West arose, with easterners seeing lands as national property and westerners as vital for local development. Settlement of lands was promoted to pay debts and strengthen the nation, accelerated by federal acquisitions like the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 and the Oregon Compromise in 1846. During the 1800s, Congress passed laws to encourage settlement of the West by transferring federal lands to private ownership. Approximately 816 million acres of public domain lands were transferred, with most transfers occurring before 1940. The Homestead Act of 1862 and Desert Lands Entry Act of 1877 were examples of laws enacted. Homestead entries peaked in 1910 but dropped significantly after 1935, eventually being eliminated in 1986. During the late 1800s, laws were enacted to legitimize existing uses on federal lands, recognizing local variations and customs. The General Mining Law of 1872 acknowledged mineral claims, while early land disposal laws allowed states to determine water rights for settlers. Concerns about rapid development led to laws protecting scenic treasures and resources for future use. The preservation and conservation movement emerged in the late 1800s to protect lands and resources for future use. Yellowstone National Park, established in 1872, was the world's first national park, protected by the U.S. Army from poachers. Forest reserves were created in 1891 to address concerns about timber harvests affecting water supplies. These actions laid the foundation for federal agencies managing natural resources on federal lands. In 1905, forest reserves management merged with forestry research in the new Forest Service under the Department of Agriculture. The National Park Service was established in 1916 to oversee parks and monuments. The National Wildlife Refuge System formed in 1966, and the Bureau of Land Management was created in 1946 to manage public rangelands. Conservation efforts in the 20th century focused on retaining and managing federal lands. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 declared that remaining public domain lands would generally remain in federal ownership, leading to the Sagebrush Rebellion in the late 1970s. Efforts to provide state or local control over federal land have been unsuccessful, with unique authorities for acquiring and disposing of federal lands described in subsequent chapters. Ownership of federal lands continues to be a debated issue, with some advocating for increased disposal to state or private ownership, while others support retention by the federal government. There are also discussions on acquiring additional land and determining the optimal division of resources between acquiring new lands and maintaining existing ones. The focus is on whether federal lands should primarily produce national benefits or benefits for localities and states. The decision-making process for these issues is also a key point of contention. The debate over federal lands ownership and management involves questions of local control, federal role, land development, preservation, and recreation. Differences exist on traditional commercial development, protection levels, and recreation restrictions. Four agencies oversee 617.5 million acres of federal lands. Four agencies, including the Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service, and National Park Service, administer the majority of federal land totaling 617.5 million acres. The Bureau of Land Management has jurisdiction over 39%, the Forest Service over 30%, Fish and Wildlife Service over 14%, and National Park Service over 12% of the federal acreage. The four major federal land management agencies, NPS, FWS, BLM, and FS, have different missions and purposes. NPS aims to preserve unique resources and provide for enjoyment, while FWS focuses on conservation of plants and animals. BLM and FS also have specific missions related to land management. The BLM and FS have similar management responsibilities for their lands, focusing on sustained yields of multiple uses including recreation, grazing, timber, minerals, watershed, wildlife and fish habitat, and conservation. Merging the two agencies has been proposed due to their similar missions, but historically, different uses have been emphasized by each agency. The BLM manages most rangelands and administers mineral development on federal lands, while the FS manages most federal forests and has a cooperative program for nonfederal forest landowners. Congress also protects certain resource values like wilderness and wild and scenic areas. Congress has established land systems with management guidelines for federal lands to protect wilderness, wild and scenic rivers, and national trails. Each of the four major federal land management agencies administers these areas with their existing missions or system constraints. Despite diverse missions, one overarching issue will likely affect all lands and resources. Global climate change will impact federal lands, resources, and agencies by affecting temperatures, precipitation patterns, and plant and animal distributions. Managing lands for diverse outputs will become more challenging due to conditions like drought, wildfires, and invasive species. This may require new procedures and tools, leading to debates on federal land management. Financial issues persist for federal agencies, but the sale or lease of lands can help recover some costs. The federal land management agencies generate revenues from the use or sale of lands and resources, but none consistently collect more money than they expend. Major revenue sources include land sales, energy and mineral leases, timber sales, recreational activity fees, and livestock grazing fees. FY2007 revenues collected by these agencies are summarized, along with discussions on annual appropriations, trust funds, land acquisition funding, and programs compensating state and local governments for tax-exempt federal lands. The federal land management agencies generate revenues from various sources such as land sales, energy leases, timber sales, and grazing fees. There are ongoing debates about whether administratively set prices for federal resources subsidize certain users, particularly in the case of livestock grazing and hardrock minerals. Additionally, concerns have been raised about \"below-cost\" timber sales and the funding for these agencies is included in the annual Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill. The FS, NPS, FWS, and BLM are agencies funded through the Interior bill, with significant appropriations for FY2008. Funding for DOI wildland fire management has increased due to severe fire seasons, leading to borrowing from other accounts for fire suppression. Legislation in the 110th Congress aimed to modify funding for wildfire suppression operations, as federal land management agencies have used borrowing from other accounts to fund fire suppression. This has led to funding shortfalls in accounts like land acquisition. Trust funds and special accounts with mandatory spending authority are also utilized by these agencies. The federal land management agencies have special accounts with mandatory spending authority, allowing them to spend receipts without annual appropriations from Congress. These accounts receive funds from various sources like excise taxes and timber sales. The Fish and Wildlife Service has the largest mandatory spending authority, with two accounts generating the majority of the total budget authority. The Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Account, established by the Pittman-Robertson Act, receives funding from excise taxes on fishing and hunting equipment. Most of the $296.2 million is distributed to states for wildlife restoration activities. In FY2007, the FS had mandatory spending totaling $798.8 million in 23 accounts, with a significant portion going towards compensation to states and counties for tax-exempt federal lands. Recreation fees accounted for $61.0 million, and timber sales were also a major source of funding. In FY2007, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) had numerous mandatory spending programs totaling $389.2 million. State and county compensation programs accounted for $144.5 million (37%) of the total budget authority. Other accounts included mineral programs, timber sales, and recreation, with the largest funding coming from BLM land sales, mostly in Nevada, totaling $155.8 million. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) had the largest funding in FY2007 from land sales in Nevada, totaling $155.8 million. The National Park Service (NPS) had the lowest budget authority of the four agencies at $304.5 million, with recreation fees accounting for 55% of the total. NPS also received $60.7 million from concession franchise fees and concessions improvement deposits. The Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act, created as a demonstration program to test user fees, now allows agencies to retain most fees at collecting sites through 2014. For FY2007, recreation fees totaled $248.8 million, with the largest source of funding for federal land acquisition being the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which can be credited with revenues up to $900 million annually. The Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) has accrued money mainly from offshore oil and gas development. For FY2008, $897 million came from offshore development, $1 million from the federal motorboat fuels tax, and $2 million from surplus property sales. LWCF has been used for federal land acquisition, state recreation programs, and other federal conservation or recreation-related programs. The fund operates differently from a private trust fund as Congress must appropriate the funds for spending. Approximately $31 billion has been credited to LWCF through FY2008, with about half of that amount appropriated. Annual appropriations from LWCF have varied, with total appropriations decreasing in recent years. Total LWCF appropriations have decreased from $488 million in FY2004 to $256 million in FY2008. The FY2008 appropriation included funds for federal land acquisition, state grants, FWS Cooperative Endangered Species Grants, and the FS's Forest Legacy Program. Debates persist over the level of appropriations and fund usage. The FWS's Migratory Bird Conservation Fund (MBCF) is another significant source of funding for federal land acquisition, with receipts from duck stamp sales providing a substantial portion of FWS land acquisition funding. In FY2007, the FWS had $43.7 million in budget authority from the MBCF. In FY2007, the FWS had $43.7 million in budget authority from the MBCF for land acquisition. The BLM has a program funded by sales of BLM land in Nevada, allowing money to be used for land acquisition, capital improvements, and state/local government purposes. Since 2000, 26 land auctions in Nevada have generated $3.29 billion, with $3.24 billion distributed, including $351.6 million for land acquisition. In FY2007, the FWS had $43.7 million for land acquisition. The BLM in Nevada generated $3.29 billion from land auctions since 2000, with $3.24 billion distributed, including $351.6 million for land acquisition. Congress has mechanisms to compensate state and local governments for tax revenues lost due to federal property exemptions, such as revenue-sharing programs for federal lands. The FS pays 25% of its gross revenues to states for roads and schools in counties with national forests. In FY2007, the FS paid $377.4 million in total payments to counties for roads and schools in areas with national forests. The Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000 modified the FS revenue-sharing program due to declining timber revenues and the end of the \"spotted owl payments\" program. In 2000, the Self-Determination Act allowed counties to replace the 25% payment with the average of the three highest payments to the state between 1986 and 1999. 15%-20% of these payments must be spent on county programs or federal land projects. The program was extended in FY2007 and accounted for 88% of FS payments. It was further extended from FY2008-FY2011 with changes to the allocation formula and transition payments for certain states. The share of revenues going to state and local entities varies from 0% to 90% depending on individual statutes. For example, states and counties receive a percentage of revenues from grazing and timber sales on BLM lands, with some areas receiving up to 75% of revenues. Payments from timber sales have decreased since the late 1980s, impacting the funds received by these entities. The BLM revenue-sharing payments are permanently appropriated, with 11 separate payment accounts; for FY2007, budget authority was $144.5 million, of which $117.1 million (81%) was for the O&C and CBWR lands. The FWS has a revenue-sharing program, but payments depend on the history of the land. Payments for refuges reserved from the public domain are based on 25% of net revenues, while payments for refuges created on lands acquired from other landowners are based on the greatest of: 25% of net revenues, 0.75% of fair market value of the land, or $0.75. The National Wildlife Refuge Fund is used to make payments to local governments for the tax-exempt status of federal lands. Payments are based on 25% of net revenues, 0.75% of fair market value of the land, or $0.75 per acre. Despite annual appropriations, payments have consistently been below the authorized level. The Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) Act, created in 1976, is the main federal program for compensating local governments. PILT payments are made in addition to revenue-sharing payments for federal lands. In 1994, Congress amended the PILT Act to increase authorized payments, adjust for inflation, and account for future inflation. The formulae used to calculate payments for counties with federal lands include eligible acres times $2.29 per acre or the county's payment ceiling. Payments are determined by the lesser of these two options and subtracting previous year's payments under other programs. The PILT Act was amended in 1994 to increase authorized payments and adjust for inflation. Counties receive payments based on eligible acres times $2.29 per acre or the county's payment ceiling, whichever is less. Congress must appropriate funds annually, but appropriations have fallen short of the increased authorization since 1994. The National Forest System (NFS) is administered by the Forest Service (FS) in the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and includes national forests, national grasslands, and other designations. NFS lands are mainly in the West (87%). Additional funding for FY2008 was provided through mandatory spending in the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. The National Forest System (NFS) administered by the Forest Service (FS) includes national forests, grasslands, and other designations. NFS lands are concentrated in the West (87%) and are managed for multiple uses like outdoor recreation, livestock grazing, timber harvesting, watershed protection, and wildlife habitats. Congress granted the President authority to establish forest reserves in 1891, with the purpose of improving and protecting forests, securing water flows, and providing timber for U.S. citizens. Initially, the reserves were managed by the Division of Forestry in the Department of the Interior's General Land Office. The National Forest System (NFS) was established in 1905 by combining the Division of Forestry with the USDA Bureau of Forestry, renamed the Forest Service. President Theodore Roosevelt expanded forest reserves in 1906 and 1907. Congress limited the President's authority to add to the System in certain states in 1907, but later passed the Weeks Law in 1911 to authorize additions through the purchase of private lands. The NFS has grown slowly from 154 million acres in 1919 to 192.8 million acres in 2007 through purchases and donations of private land. The National Forest System (NFS) has grown to 192.8 million acres in 2007 through purchases, donations, and land transfers. It includes 155 national forests, 20 national grasslands, and 123 other areas. Each national forest unit is administered by a forest supervisor, organized into nine administrative regions headed by regional foresters. The Chief of the Forest Service, a career employee, reports to the USDA Secretary through the Under Secretary for Natural Resources and Environment. The National Forest System (NFS) consists of 192.8 million acres managed by the Forest Service through nine administrative regions. Inholdings, private lands within NFS boundaries, can pose challenges for land management due to conflicting land uses and access restrictions. The National Forest System (NFS) consists of 192.8 million acres managed by the Forest Service through nine administrative regions. Landowners object to possible federal restrictions on land use and public access. Management goals for national forests were established in 1897 and further articulated in the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960, emphasizing outdoor recreation, range, timber, watershed, and wildlife purposes. The act directs land and resource management for the best combination of uses. The National Forest System (NFS) consists of 192.8 million acres managed by the Forest Service through nine administrative regions. Management goals for national forests were established in 1897 and further articulated in the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960, emphasizing outdoor recreation, range, timber, watershed, and wildlife purposes. The act directs land and resource management for the best combination of uses, considering sustained yield and coordination of resources for multiple use. Other statutes such as the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the Endangered Species Act (ESA) also apply to forest management. The Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act (RPA) of 1974, as amended by the National Forest Management Act (NFMA) of 1976, guide FS planning and management for long-term foresight in the use of the nation's forest resources. The Forest Service manages the National Forest System (NFS) through long-term planning processes guided by the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act (RPA) and the National Forest Management Act (NFMA). NFMA requires comprehensive land and resource management plans for each NFS unit, incorporating an interdisciplinary approach and economic analysis. Planning regulations were issued in 1979, revised in 1982, and further debated in the 1990s. The Clinton Administration proposed new regulations in 2000 to emphasize ecological sustainability, but concerns about implementation and biological sustainability led to debates during the Bush Administration. The Bush Administration proposed new regulations in response to concerns about biological sustainability, supplanting the Clinton regulations. Final regulations balancing ecological sustainability with economic and social considerations were issued in 2005, exempting NFMA plans from NEPA and ESA. These rules were successfully challenged for reducing environmental protection without adequate public comment and ESA consideration. The Administration reissued the rules in 2008 after court-ordered public comment, which have also been challenged in court. The Forest Service allows for multiple uses within national forests. The Forest Service (FS) has historically provided timber for the wood products industry, but timber sales have significantly decreased since the 1990s due to various reasons, including litigation to protect the northern spotted owl. Commercial timber harvests from FS lands are now harder to track due to stewardship contracting. National forests also offer livestock grazing and recreation opportunities, with grazing levels generally declining. BLM lands provide more grazing than national forests, while national forests have higher recreation use. Fees from recreation are important funding sources, but some users object to paying twice through taxation. Congress has created special designations for certain areas within the NFS. The NFS includes various special designations such as wilderness areas, wild and scenic rivers, national trails, national game refuges, wildlife preserves, national recreation areas, scenic areas, national monuments, and other congressionally designated areas. Resource development is more restricted in these areas, and management of FS roadless areas continues to be controversial. Climate change effects on forests, including national forests, are a concern. The effects of climate change on national forests are a major concern, as plant communities may not be able to adapt quickly enough. This vulnerability can lead to drought, insects, diseases, and wildfires. Land managers must address how to mitigate damages and assist in plant migration. Recent focus has been on forest health and wildfires, especially in the intermountain West, where degraded forest health and biomass accumulation have worsened due to drought and climate change. The effects of climate change on national forests are a major concern, with dying trees, heavy undergrowth, and dense stands of small trees exacerbated by drought and increasing numbers of homes in the wildland-urban interface. Advocates call for rapid action to improve forest health through prescribed burning, thinning, and salvaging dead trees. Critics argue that current fuel reduction measures are sufficient and that expedited processes for treatments are a way to reduce public oversight of commercial timber harvesting. President Clinton requested additional funds for fire suppression efforts and fuel treatment in 2000. In 2002, President Bush proposed the Healthy Forests Initiative to expedite fuel reduction treatments for federal forests. The Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 was enacted to address forest health and fire suppression efforts. Despite these efforts, fuel reduction activities have been insufficient, leading to record-breaking fire seasons in 2006 and 2007. Fuel reduction activities are below needed levels to significantly reduce fuel loadings, leading to escalating fire control expenditures. Presidential authority to reserve lands for forests has been modified over time, with national forests in the East established between 1910 and 1951. Presidential authority to proclaim forest reserves from the public domain was restricted over time. The 1897 Act established management direction for reserves, and the 1907 Act renamed them as national forests. New reserves in six western states were prohibited, but President Theodore Roosevelt reserved 16 million acres before the law was signed. The authority to establish new national forests was repealed in 1976, now requiring an act of Congress. The Secretary of Agriculture can add lands to the NFS under various authorities, including the Weeks Law of 1911. The Weeks Law of 1911 (amended by NFMA) authorizes the Secretary to acquire forested lands in watershed areas for stream flow regulation and timber production. The National Forest Reservation Commission was terminated in 1976. Other laws allow land acquisition for specific purposes, such as access corridors under FLPMA and environmentally sensitive lands in Nevada under the Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act. The Secretary of Agriculture has various authorities to acquire and dispose of lands, including sensitive lands in Nevada and nonfederal lands. The Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act of 1937 allows for the acquisition of submarginal lands for conservation. The Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act permits the acquisition of inholdings. The Secretary also has the authority to dispose of National Forest System lands, although these powers are rarely used. The President was authorized in 1897 to revoke, modify, or suspend forest reservations and return lands better suited for agriculture or mining to the public domain. NFMA prohibits the return of reserved or withdrawn lands to the public domain without an act of Congress. The Secretary can dispose of lands chiefly valuable for agriculture under the 1911 Weeks Law, and transfer up to 640 acres for townsites under the 1958 Townsites Act. The 1983 Small Tracts Act authorizes the Secretary to dispose of certain lands by sale or exchange, valued at no more than $150,000, for various purposes such as inefficient administration, inadvertent trespass, or road rights-of-way not needed by the federal government. In Title II of P.L. 106-577, Congress authorized the FS to transfer up to 80 acres of NFS land for a nominal cost to public school districts for educational purposes. Various acts such as the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act, Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act, Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act, Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Research Act, Healthy Forests Restoration Act, Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act, and National Forest Management Act are relevant to forest management. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) manages 255.8 million acres of land in the United States, mostly in the West and Alaska. These lands include diverse resources such as fuels, minerals, timber, wildlife habitat, and cultural sites. Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne designated BLM lands as the \"National System of Public Lands\" in 2008. The Secretary designated BLM lands as the \"National System of Public Lands\" to emphasize their interconnectedness in providing various benefits. This designation does not change how the lands are managed. BLM was created in 1946 by merging the General Land Office and the U.S. Grazing Service, with the latter established in 1934 to manage lands for livestock grazing. The Taylor Grazing Act of 1934 aimed to address overuse and deterioration of public rangelands. The Taylor Grazing Act of the early 1930s aimed to manage public lands until their final disposal, with growing concerns about resource conditions leading to federal retention. Congress debated for decades on whether to retain or dispose of public lands, culminating in the 1976 Federal Land Policy and Management Act. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA) consolidated BLM responsibilities and established national policy for federal land retention. This led to a \"revolt\" among some westerners in the late 1970s and early 1980s. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, there was a \"Sagebrush Rebellion\" among westerners hoping for federal land transfers. Approximately 1.3 billion acres of federal land have been transferred to individuals, businesses, and states since the 1780s. The last major transfer of BLM land was in 1980 with the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is required by law to transfer ownership of over 155 million acres of federal lands to the State of Alaska and Alaska Natives. Approximately 134 million acres have been conveyed so far. The BLM headquarters in Washington, DC, is led by a Director who reports to the Secretary of the Interior. The BLM has transitioned to a three-tier structure with state, district, and field offices to facilitate decision-making closer to the resources and users. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) administers geographic areas through state offices, district offices, and field offices. There are national support centers for fire and aviation, training, and operations. BLM maintains land and mineral records, conducts surveys, and manages public lands. The BLM is improving public access to land and mineral records by making them available online. They are converting survey records and land descriptions to digital format. A joint project is underway to develop a National Integrated Land System with the goal of providing comprehensive information on land status. FLPMA established the framework for managing BLM lands, emphasizing the importance of inventorying and planning for future land use. FLPMA established the BLM as a multiple-use, sustained-yield agency, ensuring fair market value for public land use. The management aims to protect various values and provide for wildlife habitat, outdoor recreation, and human occupancy. Some lands may be withdrawn or managed for specific purposes. The BLM inventories and develops land use plans for its lands, with a focus on multiple uses. A multiyear effort began in 2001 to update plans due to increased demands for energy resources, off-highway vehicle use, and other factors. By 2007, about 50 new or revised plans were completed, with more planned for the future. The BLM plans to complete 27 new or revised plans in 2008 and 24 plans in 2009. Public values BLM lands for various uses like open spaces, cultural resources, energy development, and more. The agency manages federal energy and mineral resources on approximately 700 million acres of land. A study estimated that 279 million acres have potential for oil or natural gas resources. In 2006, 37% of coal, 11% of natural gas, and 5% of oil in the US were derived from BLM managed lands. 60% of the 279 million acres with potential for oil or natural gas were inaccessible, including lands in National Park System, Wilderness System, and ANWR. Another 23% were accessible with restrictions, leaving 17% accessible under standard lease terms. Three approaches to developing federal mineral resources include locating mining claims, leasing lands for leaseable minerals, and sale of common mineral materials. The Bureau of Land Management managed lands in the US produced 37% of coal, 11% of natural gas, and 5% of oil. In FY2007, on-shore mineral revenues were $3.9 billion, mainly from higher oil and gas prices. There is ongoing debate about energy and mineral development on federal lands, with support for increased production but also environmental concerns. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 encouraged energy production on federal lands. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 encouraged energy production on federal lands, including the development and patenting of hardrock minerals. There is ongoing debate about the impact of mining regulations on the environment and the level of mining activity. The General Mining Law of 1872 allows claimants to develop minerals without paying royalties, sparking discussions on potential changes to the law. The Bureau of Land Management created the National Landscape Conservation System in 2000 to protect unique and environmentally sensitive areas. The National Landscape Conservation System, established in 2000 by the Bureau of Land Management, consists of various types of units covering approximately 27 million acres. These areas receive special recognition, management, and resources. Different authorities govern the management of specific areas within the System, such as designated wilderness areas managed according to FLPMA and the Wilderness Act. Additionally, wilderness study areas totaling 13.8 million acres are managed by the BLM to preserve their wilderness suitability until final legislation determines their status. The System focuses on 15 national monuments, 13 national conservation areas, and 4 similar areas. The Bureau of Land Management's National Landscape Conservation System includes 15 national monuments, 13 national conservation areas, and 4 similar areas. BLM management prioritizes resource conservation and outdoor recreation, with activities like hunting, fishing, hiking, and camping permitted. The agency collects fees for recreation permits and charges recreation fees on some lands. Discussions on preservation and recreation policies are ongoing. Recreation matters on BLM lands are a growing concern, with debates on protective designations, land use impacts, and access issues. Balancing high-impact activities like off-highway vehicle use with low-impact uses such as backpacking is a challenge. Conflicts over land use are expected to persist due to population growth near BLM lands. Livestock grazing is allowed on 160 million acres of BLM land in some western states. Grazing is permitted on 160 million acres of BLM land, with cattle and sheep grazing authorized by the Taylor Grazing Act, FLPMA, and PRIA. These acts converted public rangelands to exclusive permits and established range management provisions. The grazing fee formula has been continued under executive order. The BLM's grazing regulations were temporarily halted in 2008 due to legal violations. Changes in the regulations would have allowed shared ownership of range improvements, permittees to acquire water rights, and reduced public consultation requirements. Recent laws now allow for automatic renewal of grazing permits. Discussions have arisen regarding the restriction or elimination of grazing on federal land for environmental and recreational reasons. The federal government's grazing fee for private livestock on federal lands has been controversial. Other range issues include invasive plant species, riparian area management, and wild horse and burro management under the Wild, Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971. The BLM seeks to reduce wild horse and burro populations through adoption, sale, and fertility control, which has been a contentious issue for years. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) faces challenges in managing wild horses and burros on federal lands, including debates on reducing animal populations and funding for their care. The agency also deals with severe fire seasons by coordinating fire management programs with other agencies through the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, ID. The National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, ID focuses on implementing the national fire plan and the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003. Challenges include funding sufficiency for fire suppression and the impact of fires on resource conditions. Suggestions have been made to establish a separate fund for major wildfire suppression efforts. The impact of fires on resource conditions is a compounding factor in areas experiencing drought, invasive species, and other changes. The sufficiency of current fuels reductions and treatments to reduce the risk of wildland fire on federal lands is also a concern. BLM lands are often intermingled with other federal or private lands, creating a mixed ownership grid pattern known as \"checkerboard.\" FLPMA addresses problems arising from this ownership pattern and provides for land exchanges, acquisitions, disposals, and remedies for title problems. Debate continues over the amount of land owned by BLM and how it should be managed. The BLM has broad authority to acquire lands under FLPMA, including through purchase, exchange, donation, or eminent domain. Congress is concerned about private land acquisition, land exchange programs, and the impact of public ownership on state taxes and authorities. The BLM may acquire land to protect threatened areas, especially inholdings. The BLM acquires land or interests in land to protect natural and cultural resources, enhance public recreation, restore land health, and improve management. Land exchanges, though amended in 1988 to expedite the process, can still be time-consuming and costly due to valuation and resource inventory issues. Concerns about fair market value and public benefit have led to changes in exchange processes. The BLM can dispose of public lands through various authorities, with exchanges being a primary method. The BLM acquires land for various purposes such as protecting natural resources and enhancing public recreation. Means of acquisition include exchanges, sales under FLPMA, sales/exchanges under the Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act, patents under the General Mining Law of 1872, and transfers to other governmental units. Sales of public land must meet specific criteria and proposals for tracts over 2,500 acres require Congressional approval. The Federal Land Transaction Facilitation Act allows for the sale/exchange of land identified for disposal under BLM's land use plans, with proceeds deposited into a separate Treasury account. The General Mining Law of 1872 allows access to certain minerals on federal lands. Mining claims can be patented with evidence of minerals and sufficient developmental effort. Congress has prevented issuing mineral patents since FY1995 through an annual moratorium. The Recreation and Public Purposes Act authorizes the Secretary to acquire land for various purposes. The Recreation and Public Purposes Act allows the Secretary to dispose of public lands for recreational or public purposes, with conditions and acreage limitations. The BLM also has land disposal authorities, such as the Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act. State and local governments have priority to acquire lands, with proceeds used for various purposes including acquiring environmentally sensitive lands in Nevada. Revenues from SNPLMA land sales in Nevada have exceeded expectations, totaling $3.29 billion through September 30, 2008. Proposals are being considered to expand the purposes for which the funds can be used. FLPMA mandates a review of public land withdrawals in the 11 western states to determine their continued use. The BLM is prioritizing the review of approximately 70 million withdrawn acres, with about 26 million acres expected to be returned for various uses. The BLM has completed reviewing approximately 10 million withdrawn acres, with over 9 million acres having their withdrawals revoked. The review process will continue for several years, as the lands need to be considered in BLM's planning process and supported by documentation under NEPA. Various federal acts govern these land withdrawals. The National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS) is managed by the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and is dedicated to conserving animals and plants. Other activities like hunting, fishing, and grazing are allowed if they align with the refuge's purpose. Congress prioritized wildlife-dependent recreation in 1997 for the NWRS, which is seen as offering intermediate protection compared to BLM and FS lands. The National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS) managed by the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) allows some commercial uses but can have more restrictive public access compared to NPS lands. The first refuge was established in 1903 at Pelican Island, FL by President Theodore Roosevelt. There are 548 refuges totaling 92.9 million acres in various states and territories, with a significant increase in acreage due to the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA). Alaska now has 76.8 million acres of refuge lands\u201479.7% of the System, including designated wilderness areas. The NWRS also includes Waterfowl Production Areas and Wildlife Coordination Areas, totaling 96.4 million acres. The National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS) manages 96.4 million acres, including various types of lands. The NWRS is divided into three tiers, with regional offices and a national office in Washington, DC. The FWS is led by a director and assistant directors overseeing different programs. Budget issues have impacted refuge management. Budget issues in the National Wildlife Refuge System have led to cuts in funding for programs aimed at aiding endangered species, reducing invasive species infestation, protecting water supplies, habitat restoration, and ensuring staffing at less visited refuges. The Northeast Region has attempted to address this by consolidating management and increasing the number of refuges that are not staffed full-time (termed \"de-staffing\"). The National Wildlife Refuge System is facing budget cuts, leading to reduced funding for various programs. The Northeast Region has implemented de-staffing and service consolidation to manage resources more effectively. This could result in reduced visitor services, trail maintenance, and increased reliance on volunteers. Other regions are also developing plans to address budget constraints. The purpose of the NWRS is to conserve wildlife, with varying options for alternative resource use within the areas. The National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act of 1997 addressed management controversies within the FWS. The National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act of 1997 clarified the purpose of the NWRS as conservation, management, and restoration of fish, wildlife, and plant resources. It designated wildlife-dependent recreational uses as priority public uses and required enhanced consideration for these activities in planning and management. Some groups argued that resulting regulations did not allow for sufficient public access. Wildlife refuges provide habitat for various plant and animal species, emphasizing migratory waterfowl and endangered species. Refuges may consist of single blocks or scattered parcels. Research on wildlife conservation is conducted by the FWS. Energy and mineral activities are permitted in certain refuges. Hunting, fishing, and recreational uses are allowed if compatible with the refuge's purposes. Refuges set aside for migratory birds limit waterfowl hunting to 40% of the area, with exceptions granted by the Secretary. Waterfowl Production Areas (WPAs) primarily provide breeding habitat for migratory waterfowl, totaling 3.3 million acres as of 2007. 700,000 acres are federally owned, while 2.6 million acres are managed by private landowners. These areas are mainly located in North Central states, with less conflicting resource use due to smaller tract sizes and exemption from federal mining laws. The Wildlife Conservation Areas (WCAs) totaling 250,000 acres are primarily owned by the FWS and managed by state wildlife agencies. There is ongoing debate over hunting and fishing on refuge lands, with bills introduced both in support and opposition. The backlog of maintenance needs for federal land management agencies has also been a focus of Congress and the Administration. The funding for deferred maintenance projects in the National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS) increased from $48.1 million in FY2002 to $66.5 million in FY2004, dropping to $44.1 million in FY2007. The maintenance backlog is expected to be a topic of debate in future appropriations. Some interest groups suggested including NWRS maintenance in an economic stimulus package in late 2008. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge has been a focal point of controversy over energy development. Many proponents of development are interested in ending statutory restrictions on growth of the NWRS. General authority to expand the NWRS is provided in laws such as the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956, and Endangered Species Act. The FWS can add lands to the Refuge System without specific congressional action. Some units are created by specific Acts of Congress or executive order, while the FLPMA authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to withdraw lands for additions to the NWRS, subject to congressional approval for withdrawals exceeding 5,000 acres. The primary FWS land acquisition authority is the MBTA, allowing the Secretary to recommend areas for bird conservation to the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission. Acquisitions can be made through purchases, rentals, gifts, or donations, with condemnation authority as a last resort. Non-federal lands can be accepted as donations or purchased to expand specific NWRS units. In FY2007, refuge lands were acquired through various means such as purchases, transfers, and agreements. Western refuges are typically formed from public domain lands, while eastern refuges are acquired lands. Funding for refuge land purchases primarily comes from the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund (MBCF) and the Land and Water Conservation Fund. MBCF focuses on wetlands for migratory waterfowl, while LWCF covers a range of NWRS purposes. MBCF funds, supported by duck stamp sales and import duties, are used for acquiring suitable areas for migratory bird refuges. The acquisitions must be approved by the Governor or appropriate State agency. The predictability of MBCF funding is crucial for the FWS budget. The MBCF funding is crucial for the FWS budget as it provides stable funding for acquiring lands for migratory bird refuges. Congress appropriates funds from the LWCF for FWS land acquisition, but the disposal of NWRS lands requires congressional approval or specific conditions outlined in FLPMA. Disposal of acquired lands is allowed only under certain circumstances, such as authorized land exchanges or approval from the Migratory Bird Conservation Commission. The National Park Service manages 391 units, including 58 formally designated National Parks. Other federal land categories include National Wildlife Refuges, established under various acts such as the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980 and the Endangered Species Act of 1973. These acts govern land acquisition, management, and conservation efforts. The National Park Service manages 391 units, including 58 National Parks, as part of the Park System which covers 84.3 million acres in 49 states and U.S. territories. The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980 doubled the acreage of the Park System. The National Park Service manages 391 units, including 58 National Parks, covering 84.3 million acres in 49 states and U.S. territories. The NPS has a mission of facilitating access and serving visitors while protecting the natural, historic, and cultural integrity of the lands it manages. Yellowstone National Park was established in 1872 as the first national park under the exclusive control of the Secretary of the Interior. The concept of national parks, including Yellowstone National Park, was initially focused on preserving natural wonders and resources. Over time, the National Park System evolved to encompass a variety of natural and cultural resources, serving as a model for conservation worldwide. In 1906, Congress enacted the Antiquities Act to authorize the President to declare historic and prehistoric structures as national monuments. National parks and monuments were established from public domain lands in the West, administered by the Department of the Interior. Unified management of federal parklands was lacking before a system emerged. The National Park Service was created in 1916 by President Woodrow Wilson to protect national parks and monuments. The agency's purpose is to conserve scenery, natural and historic objects, and wildlife for future generations. President Franklin D. Roosevelt further expanded the agency's responsibilities in 1933. The National Park Service, established in 1916 by President Woodrow Wilson, was further expanded by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933. Roosevelt transferred national monuments and military sites to the NPS, marking a significant development in creating a national system of park units. Today, 60% of park areas managed by the NPS are designated as symbols of the nation's culture, history, and prehistory. The NPS oversees 391 units of the National Park System, with the Director nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. The agency is headquartered in Washington, DC, with key administrative officers overseeing operations. The National Park Service is overseen by the Interior Department's Assistant Secretary for Fish, Wildlife, and Parks. It has over 20,000 employees who protect and preserve diverse natural and historic areas. The National Park Service Advisory Board advises on management policies and park additions. Regional offices are headed by regional directors, with a reorganization in the 1990s focusing on downsizing and streamlining. The National Park Service underwent downsizing and streamlining in the 1990s to shift resources from central offices to field units. Regional and cluster support offices provide administrative functions and specialized staff services to park units, overseen by park superintendents with broad discretionary authority. Park units in Alaska have relatively few personnel despite their large size. The National Park Service manages a diverse collection of park units with over 20 different designations, ranging from national parks to monuments. Congress established that all units in the system are of equal value. The National Park Service manages a diverse collection of park units with over 20 different designations, ranging from national parks to monuments. Congress established that all units in the system are of equal value. In 1978, Congress amended the law to reassert the System-wide equal standard of protection for all areas administered by the NPS. Some Members of Congress have sought to \"upgrade\" park areas to \"National Park\" status. The NPS mission is to conserve, preserve, protect, and interpret natural, cultural, and historic resources for public enjoyment. The NPS also contributes to meeting the public demand for outdoor recreation and encourages scientific research in park units. Management direction is provided in general statutes and in statutes that create and govern individual units. Activities such as mining are generally prohibited in National Park System units, but some exceptions exist under specific laws like the Mining in the Parks Act of 1976. Congress has authorized certain natural resource uses in specific units, such as oil and gas development in national preserves and hunting in national recreation areas. Other uses are addressed in separate laws, like rights-of-way through Park System units. The goal is to balance public recreation with protecting the integrity of the lands. The challenge for park managers and congressional committees lies in balancing public use of Park System lands for recreation with protecting park resources. Motorized recreation in NPS units raises debates on economic and environmental impacts, safety, access levels, and existing regulations. Stakeholders have concerns about economic damage, access restrictions, resource damage, and pressure for more motorized access. Litigation continues over regulations governing motorized use in parks. Efforts to regulate motorized access in National Parks, including snowmobiles and personal watercraft, are ongoing. Climate change poses challenges for NPS leaders as it could impact park resources and values. Congress has expanded the number of park units and management responsibilities over the years. The National Park Service faces challenges due to increased management responsibilities and high visitation, leading to budget shortfalls and a multi-billion dollar maintenance backlog. Efforts to address these issues have been hindered by diverted funds for security and protection of iconic parks. President Bush initiated a plan in FY2002 to eliminate a $4.9 billion maintenance backlog. The National Park Service initiated a plan in FY2002 to address a $4.9 billion maintenance backlog, which has since nearly doubled to a midpoint estimate of $9.6 billion in 2007. Congressional leaders have bundled various park-related bills into omnibus measures for quicker passage. Efforts to designate special areas have led to the creation of 40 national heritage areas over the last three decades, aimed at conserving and promoting resources outside the National Park System. The National Park Service supports heritage areas outside the federally owned National Park System by providing assistance in attaining designation and offering seed money, recognition, and technical assistance. There are debates over the standardization of National Heritage Area (NHA) legislation, with proponents arguing that NHAs protect resources and traditions, promote tourism, and prevent costly additions to the Park System, while opponents believe NHA designation is not an appropriate federal activity and could be costly for the government. The National Park Service relies on donations from private benefactors and park support organizations to supplement its annual appropriations. Balancing this support with core responsibilities and avoiding overreliance on private donations is a management challenge. The NPS has developed policy regulations to guide park managers in dealing with donations. Some argue for more aggressive pursuit of outside funding for parks through marketing naming rights and corporate advertising, while others criticize commercialization and privatization influences. Concerns have been raised about park managers' entrepreneurial efforts potentially detracting from resource protection. An example cited is a corporate-sponsored festival on the National Mall in 2003. In 2003, a corporate-sponsored festival on the National Mall featured large advertising banners using iconic monuments as a backdrop. Congress later limited commercial advertisement on the Mall. In 2006, President Bush proposed the National Park Centennial Initiative to improve parks for the NPS's 100th anniversary in 2016, seeking up to $3 billion in new funds through public/private efforts. Concerns were raised about potential commercialization and privatization influences on parks. Congress provided $24.6 million in seed money in 2008. In 2006, the NPS issued an environmental impact statement on bioprospecting, allowing commercial research in Park System areas under benefit-sharing agreements. The National Park System requires research permits for sample collection, prohibits resource harvesting, and allows commercial use of research findings. The creation of new park units is standardized by the National Parks Omnibus Management Act of 1998. The Secretary of the Interior investigates areas for potential inclusion in the System and submits recommendations to Congress annually. The Secretary submits annual recommendations to Congress for areas to study for potential inclusion in the National Park System. The NPS assesses areas for national significance, feasibility, and representation of themes not adequately represented in the System. Studies require congressional authorization, but preliminary assessments can be conducted by the NPS. The NPS conducts preliminary assessment activities for areas recommended by the Secretary to Congress for potential inclusion in the National Park System. Studies must consider certain factors and be completed within three fiscal years after funds are made available. The President can proclaim national monuments on federal land under the Antiquities Act of 1906, with about 120 monuments created to date. Some national monuments have been controversial, including those proclaimed by Presidents Carter and Clinton. Many controversial monuments, like those by Carter and Clinton, have become accepted designations later. Acts of Congress establish National Park System units, set boundaries, and authorize NPS to acquire nonfederal lands. Land acquisition is funded by the Land and Water Conservation Fund. Provisions in P.L. 101-628 require the Secretary to report on authorized but unacquired lands within unit boundaries every three years. The Secretary is authorized to make minor boundary adjustments for preservation, protection, interpretation, or management of National Park System units. Non-NPS lands within adjusted boundaries can be acquired through land exchanges, but property administered as part of the National Park System cannot be conveyed for exchange. Units established by Acts of Congress can only be disposed of by Acts of Congress. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act (FLPMA) prohibits the Secretary from modifying or revoking any presidential withdrawal creating a national monument. National Park System lands can only be changed or disposed of by an act of Congress. Various acts such as the Mining in National Parks Act, National Park Service General Authorities Act, and Yellowstone National Park Act provide guidelines for the management and preservation of national parks. The National Wilderness Preservation System, National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, and National Trails System were established by Congress to protect special features on federal lands managed by different agencies. These systems do not create new agencies but direct existing ones to administer designated lands within statutory parameters. Wilderness is defined as undeveloped federal land primarily affected by natural forces, untouched by human activity, and valued for solitude and primitive recreation. Eligible lands for inclusion in the System generally exceed 5,000 acres. The National Wilderness Preservation System, established in 1964 by the Wilderness Act, includes lands with over 5,000 acres or those that can be managed to maintain their pristine character. The act designated 9.1 million acres of national forest lands as wilderness, with reviews completed within 10 years for wilderness recommendations to Congress. The FS also reviewed all NFS roadless areas and presented wilderness recommendations in 1979. A similar review of BLM lands was required by the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. The BLM finalized wilderness recommendations in 1991, with over 107 million acres in the National Wilderness Preservation System across 44 states, representing 16% of federal land. Alaska holds the majority of wilderness acres at 57.6 million (54%), followed by 45.4 million acres in 11 western states. The remaining 4.6 million acres are in other states, with no single agency managing the Wilderness System. The Wilderness System is managed by four agencies, with the FS overseeing 35.5 million acres of designated wilderness. NFS wilderness land is mostly in Alaska and the western states. NPS manages 43.6 million acres of designated wilderness, with significant areas in Alaska, California, Washington, and Florida. The FWS manages 20.7 million acres of wilderness, with significant areas in Alaska and Arizona. The BLM currently manages 7.7 million acres of wilderness, with a large portion in the California desert. Congress has the authority to designate wilderness areas as part of the National Wilderness Preservation System. Congress has designated many wilderness study areas, with varying lengths of protection depending on the law. The System was expanded significantly in 1980 with the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act. In 1979, Congress addressed wilderness designations for FS lands within states, leading to the enactment of 21 wilderness laws in the early 1980s. The compromise allowed the FS to release lands while maintaining wilderness attributes. The 103rd Congress expanded the System, adding NFS wilderness areas in Colorado and BLM and NPS wilderness areas in the California Desert. Congress is still considering expanding the Wilderness System, with over 29 million acres recommended for inclusion. Wilderness areas are managed to protect natural conditions, with restrictions on permanent improvements and motorized access. Congress has enacted standards and prohibitions for wilderness protection, balancing development and preservation. Wilderness designations remain controversial, conflicting with some groups' desires while meeting others' values. The Wilderness Act allows for exemptions to standards and prohibitions, such as continued motorboat use in designated areas. Controversies arise over the protection of roadless areas, with a focus on BLM lands in Utah. One key issue is whether the BLM can designate wilderness study areas with automatic protections beyond the original WSAs identified under FLPMA. In 1996, President Clinton's Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt identified an additional 2.6 million acres in Utah with wilderness qualities using \u00a7 201 of FLPMA. Utah filed suit alleging flaws in the process, leading to a settlement in 2003 that prohibited administrative creation of WSAs under \u00a7 603 and any other authority. The management of FS roadless areas has also been controversial. The management of FS roadless areas nationwide has been controversial, with conflicting court rulings leading to uncertainty. Various laws such as the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980, California Desert Protection Act of 1994, and The Wilderness Act have been established to protect designated areas for present and future generations. The National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, created in 1968, aims to preserve free-flowing rivers for enjoyment and benefit. The National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, established in 1968, aims to preserve rivers for present and future generations. Three classes of rivers were designated under the act: Wild rivers, Scenic rivers, and Recreational rivers, each with specific characteristics and levels of development allowed. The National Wild and Scenic Rivers System was established in 1968 to preserve rivers. Congress designated rivers into the system through congressional designation or state nomination. The system saw expansions in 1972, 1976, and 1978, with significant additions in Alaska in 1980. In 1981, five rivers in California were approved, increasing the system's mileage by 20%. The Reagan Administration added five rivers in 1984, followed by a large addition in 1988 with more than 40 river segments in Oregon. In 1988, over 40 river segments in Oregon were designated, adding 1,400 miles. In 1992, 14 Michigan river segments totaling 535 miles were added. The National Wild and Scenic Rivers System now includes 166 river units with 11,944.2 miles in 38 states and Puerto Rico. Land areas along designated rivers are managed by federal agencies, with local jurisdictions making land use decisions in wild and scenic corridors. The boundaries of these areas are identified by the Interior or Agriculture Secretary. Federal agencies have limited authority to manage lands within wild and scenic river corridors, with a quarter-mile wide corridor on each side of the river. Recent designations include citizen advisory boards for local participation in management plans. Management of lands within wild and scenic river corridors involves input from local jurisdictions and aims to protect aesthetic, scenic, historic, archaeologic, and scientific features. Activities like road construction, hunting, fishing, and mining may be permitted as long as they align with the values of the area being protected. The National Wild and Scenic Rivers System adds rivers through Congress or state nomination with approval from the Secretary of the Interior. Congress identifies potential rivers for inclusion, and the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture assess their suitability. State-nominated rivers must be designated for protection under state law, approved by the Secretary of the Interior, and managed by a state agency. Less than 10% of federal wild and scenic river designations are state-nominated, which can be more complex due to diverse land ownership. The designation and management of lands within federal wild and scenic river corridors have been controversial, with debates over private land impact, activities within the corridor, and local input in management plans. Initially involving federal land, more segments now include private lands. Congress addresses these issues by encouraging management plans before designation and avoiding condemnation. The National Trails System Act of 1968 established the National Trails System, including National Scenic Trails like the Appalachian and Pacific Crest Trails. These trails provide outdoor recreation opportunities and promote the preservation of access to outdoor areas and historic resources. The National Trails System Act of 1968 established various types of trails, including National Historic Trails, National Recreation Trails, and Connecting or Side Trails. Trails have served as routes for commerce and migration in the early history of the United States, and since the early 20th century, they have been constructed to provide access to scenic terrain. The concept of the first interstate recreational trail, now known as the Appalachian National Scenic Trail, was introduced in 1921. In 1958, Congress established the National Trails System to provide better opportunities for outdoor recreation as the population expanded. In 1958, Congress established the Outdoor Recreation Resources Review Commission (ORRRC) to study national outdoor recreation needs. A 1960 survey found that 90% of Americans participated in outdoor recreation, with walking for pleasure being popular. President Lyndon B. Johnson called for more trails like the Appalachian Trail in his 1965 message to Congress. In response, the National Trail System Act was enacted in 1968, starting with two scenic trails including the Appalachian National Scenic Trail and the Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail. The National Trail System Act of 1968 established the Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail, spanning 2,665 miles from Canada to Mexico. Over the years, the system expanded to include 26 national trails covering 60,000 miles, administered by the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Agriculture. The National Trail System Act of 1968 established 26 national trails covering 60,000 miles, with administration split between the NPS, FS, and BLM. These trails offer recreation, conservation, and enjoyment of scenic, historic, natural, or cultural qualities. Motorized vehicle use is generally prohibited, except for specific circumstances on the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail. The trails follow travel routes of national historical significance. The National Trail System Act of 1968 established 26 national trails covering 60,000 miles, with administration split between the NPS, FS, and BLM. These trails offer recreation, conservation, and enjoyment of scenic, historic, natural, or cultural qualities. The trails follow routes of national historical significance and must meet specific criteria for designation, including historical significance, evidence of national importance, and potential for public recreational use or historical interest. Examples include the Mormon Trail and the Oregon Pioneer Trail. The Park Service administers the national recreation trails program, coordinating nonfederal trails, while the FS administers national recreation trails within national forests. Recreation trails can include land and water segments, marked highways, and sites forming a chain along the historic route. Recreation trails, managed by public and private agencies at various levels, provide opportunities for different recreational activities. In 1990, the Secretary of the Interior designated the Timm's Hill Trail in WI and the Anvik Connector in AK to connect to national trails. Trails on national forest lands are administered by the Secretary of Agriculture. Federal land managing agencies coordinate funding for National Trails System to avoid duplication and enhance effectiveness. Since 1992, over $1 billion has been provided for bicycle and pedestrian projects. Other funding sources include challenge cost-share projects, cooperative agreements, charitable foundations, corporations, permits and fees, excise taxes, and dedicated funds. National scenic and historic trails are designated by Acts of Congress. The National Trails System includes scenic trails, national historic trails, and national recreation trails. The Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture can recognize connecting and side trails with consent from relevant authorities. The Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historic Trail was established by the 109th Congress. The Secretaries can acquire lands for the Trails System through various means, including cooperative agreements, donations, purchases, exchanges, and condemnation. States are encouraged to administer nonfederal lands through cooperative agreements or acquisition by local governments. Legislation has been considered to give federal land management agencies authority to purchase land from willing sellers for resource protection. Congress authorized nine national scenic and historic trails between 1978 and 1986, but prohibited federal authority for land acquisition. Trails authorized since 1986 typically have included land acquisition authority. The major acronyms used in this report include ANILCA, ANWR, BLM, DOD, DOI, ESA, EIS, FLPMA, FS, FWS, LWCF, MBCF, NEPA, NFMA, NFS, NHA, NPS, NWRS, O&C, PILT, PRIA, and RPA. The Public Rangelands Improvement Act of 1978 defines terms related to federal lands, including acquired lands, entry, federal land, homesteading, impoundment, and inholdings. Homesteading laws were mostly repealed in 1976. The Land and Water Conservation Fund is a federal source of funds for acquiring new lands for recreation and wildlife purposes. It is funded by receipts from offshore oil and gas sales. Land withdrawal restricts the use of public lands, while leaseable minerals like oil, gas, and coal can be developed through federal leasing systems. Mining claims allow for the appropriation of public land for mineral extraction. Mining claim is a mineral entry on public land allowing possession and mineral development. Multiple use land is federal land used for various purposes. A patent is a document granting legal title to public lands. Payments in Lieu of Taxes program provides payments to local governments with federal lands. Public domain land is federal land obtained from original states or foreign sovereigns. Public land refers to public domain lands subject to disposal laws. The curr_chunk discusses various terms related to public land management, including rangeland, release language, reservation, and right-of-way. These terms are defined in the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA) and are important for understanding the management of federal lands. The curr_chunk explains terms related to public land management, such as subsurface mineral estate, surface estate, sustained yield, water right, wetlands, and wilderness. These terms are crucial for understanding the management of federal lands. The curr_chunk explains terms related to public land management, including wilderness, wildlife refuge, and withdrawal, which are crucial for understanding the conservation and protection of federal lands."
