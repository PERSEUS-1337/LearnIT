    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"American Servicemember and Citizen Protection Act of 2002\". The Congress finds that a diplomatic conference was held in Rome in 1998 to adopt a Convention on the Establishment of an International Criminal Court. The Statute of the International Criminal Court would take effect upon ratification by 60 member states. As of April 1, 2002, 57 member states have ratified the Statute of the International Criminal Court. The United States Senate has not ratified the statute, despite a designee of former President Clinton signing it on behalf of the US. President George W. Bush has indicated he will not submit the statute to the Senate. The Statute of the International Criminal Court has not been ratified by the United States Senate, making it not the supreme law of the land according to the Constitution. The United States has not consented to the treaty as per the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. The Statute of the International Criminal Court is considered unauthorized by the Charter of the United Nations and contravenes the principle of government by consent. The International Criminal Court's jurisdiction over US citizens without consent violates principles of government by consent, separation of powers, federalism, and trial by jury guaranteed by the US Constitution. The International Criminal Court is deemed illegitimate and poses a threat to United States citizens, especially members of the Armed Forces, by subjecting them to politically motivated prosecutions. US citizens, including the military, deserve full protection under the Constitution they defend. The President should rescind the approval of the International Criminal Court statute on behalf of the United States and prevent its establishment. No US funds can be used for the ICC, and measures should be taken to protect US Armed Forces members and citizens. Actions taken by the International Criminal Court against US Armed Forces members or citizens are considered acts of aggression or offenses against the law of nations. Violators of these actions may face fines up to $50,000, imprisonment up to 5 years, or both."
