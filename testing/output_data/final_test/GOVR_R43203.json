    "content": "An administrative agency must interpret ambiguous terms in congressional delegations of authority to implement Congress's intent. The Chevron test limits courts' role in reviewing agency interpretations, deferring to agencies if their interpretation is reasonable. This allows federal agencies, not courts, to resolve ambiguities in implementing their authority. The report discusses the Chevron decision, when Chevron deference applies, agency statutory interpretations not receiving deference, and the City of Arlington v. FCC case clarifying Chevron deference. In 1970, Clean Air Act amendments established a federal-state program to reduce air pollution, requiring the EPA to set national air quality standards and states to create implementation plans. In 1977, Congress amended the Clean Air Act to impose requirements on states failing to meet national air quality standards set by the EPA. States had to implement a permit program for regulating new or modified major stationary sources of air pollution, with strict conditions for permit approval. The EPA defined a \"stationary source\" as an entire plant, not individual equipment, treating multiple pollutant-producing structures collectively as one source. The EPA defined a \"stationary source\" as an entire plant, treating multiple pollution-creating structures collectively. The NRDC challenged this definition in court, arguing that individual equipment should be treated separately under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977. The EPA defined a \"stationary source\" as an entire plant, treating multiple pollution-creating structures collectively. The NRDC challenged this definition in court, arguing that individual equipment should be treated separately under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977. Chevron U.S.A., Inc., and other industry groups intervened in support of the EPA. The D.C. Circuit, in an opinion by Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg, sided with the NRDC, setting aside the EPA regulations. The court ruled that the nonattainment program's purpose was to improve air quality expeditiously, not just maintain current standards. The EPA's definition of a \"stationary source\" was challenged in court by the NRDC, arguing for individual equipment treatment under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977. Chevron U.S.A., Inc. intervened and petitioned the Supreme Court, which unanimously reversed the D.C. Circuit decision. The Court emphasized that it is the agency's role, not the judiciary's, to interpret statutes delegated by Congress. The Supreme Court established the Chevron two-step test for reviewing agency's statutory interpretation, emphasizing that it is the agency's role, not the judiciary's, to interpret statutes delegated by Congress. The Supreme Court established the Chevron two-step test for reviewing agency's statutory interpretation, emphasizing that it is the agency's role, not the judiciary's, to interpret statutes delegated by Congress. If Congress has not directly addressed a question, the court must determine if the agency's interpretation is permissible based on the statute's ambiguity. The Court applied this test to a case where the definition of \"source\" was not clearly defined in the statute or legislative history. The Supreme Court applied the Chevron two-step test to a case involving the ambiguous definition of \"source\" in the statute. The Court found that the language and legislative history did not provide a clear interpretation, allowing the EPA to balance economic growth with pollution control objectives. The EPA's plantwide definition of \"source\" was deemed permissible to avoid hindering plant modernization. The EPA's plantwide definition of \"source\" was upheld by the Court, balancing economic growth with pollution control objectives. The EPA's interpretation was considered a reasonable accommodation of competing interests and was deemed permissible to avoid hindering plant modernization. The Supreme Court favored a restrained judicial role and granted deference to agency interpretation of ambiguous statutes. Congress delegates authority to agencies to clarify ambiguity, and courts should respect this decision. Interpreting statutory ambiguity is seen as a policy decision best left to agencies and legislators. Agencies and legislators are best suited to balance considerations and resolve debates regarding ambiguous delegations. Agencies have technical expertise and are in a better position to make policy decisions in complex regulatory schemes. Courts lack expertise, as acknowledged in Chevron, and should defer to agency interpretations. Administrative agencies are politically accountable through the democratic process. The Chevron two-step test allows administrative agencies to implement policy judgments through permissible interpretations of statutes. If Congress has clearly spoken on an issue, the agency must follow the statutory text. However, if the statute is ambiguous, the court defers to the agency's permissible construction, which is subject to democratic accountability. The Chevron test requires courts to defer to an agency's permissible interpretation of a statute if it is ambiguous, rather than imposing their own construction. This decision has been seen as a significant shift in the balance of power towards the administrative state. The Supreme Court established that courts should use traditional tools of statutory construction to determine Congress's intention. This includes analyzing the statute's structure, using dictionaries, and considering the legislation's purpose. The use of legislative history in statutory interpretation, particularly in the Chevron step one analysis, remains a controversial subject. The debate between judges centers on using legislative intent versus the text of a statute to interpret laws. The Chevron test involves considering legislative history in the first step, with challenges to agency interpretations typically won at this stage. Courts must defer to agency interpretations if deemed permissible, unless unreasonable. The Chevron test requires courts to defer to an agency's interpretation if it is deemed permissible, even if it differs from the court's own interpretation. The Supreme Court has provided limited guidance on how to determine if an agency's interpretation is reasonable under Chevron step two. The Chevron test requires courts to defer to an agency's interpretation if it is deemed permissible under Chevron step two. Courts consider whether the agency's position aligns with the statute's purpose. The Seventh Circuit suggests that at this stage, the court evaluates if the agency's action is rationally related to the statute's objectives. The D.C. Circuit upheld an EPA regulation under Chevron step two, noting that the agency's interpretation must be reasonable in light of the statute's language, history, and policies. The court found that the EPA's reading of the statute was reasonable and balanced the competing Congressional goals of the Clean Water Act. Kennecott Utah Copper Corp. v. United States Department of the Interior exemplifies the Chevron step two approach, where the court determined the agency's interpretation of an ambiguous statutory provision was permissible. The case involved the Department of the Interior's regulations on the statute of limitations for oil spill damages, specifically when a rule is considered \"promulgated.\" The agency's interpretation allowed for an extension of time for businesses. The court in Kennecott Utah Copper Corp. v. United States Department of the Interior found that the term \"promulgated\" was ambiguous. However, they determined that the agency's interpretation was not reasonable and that Congress did not intend to allow the agency to prolong the limitations period for damages. The second step of Chevron tends to overlap with arbitrary and capricious review under the Administrative Procedure Act. The D.C. Circuit has noted that the arbitrary and capricious review and Chevron step two tests overlap. Courts have suggested that Chevron step two should be analyzed under the State Farm test. The State Farm test requires agencies to show that their decision-making process considered necessary facts and alternatives, while Chevron step two focuses on whether the final decision aligns with the statute's terms. The Supreme Court has set limitations on agency interpretations eligible for Chevron deference. The Chevron decision set limitations on agency interpretations eligible for Chevron deference, including that deference is only accorded to interpretations of statutes specifically administered by the agency. This excludes interpretations of statutes that apply broadly across multiple agencies. The Court has established criteria for Chevron deference, stating that only interpretations reached through certain procedures qualify. Informal agency interpretations lacking the \"force of law\" do not warrant deference, while formal adjudications and notice-and-comment rulemaking do. The thoroughness of the procedures used by the agency in reaching its interpretation may determine deference. In United States v. Mead Corp, the Court ruled that a U.S. Customs Service letter ruling did not qualify for Chevron deference. Chevron deference depends on Congress delegating authority to the agency to make rules with the force of law. The process of agency interpretation and Congress's intent to delegate authority are key factors in determining Chevron deference. Notice-and-comment rulemaking or formal adjudication are not always necessary for an agency interpretation to receive Chevron deference. The necessary delegation of authority for Chevron deference can be shown in various ways, such as through agency's power to engage in adjudication or rulemaking. The \"force of law\" standard from Mead is not clearly defined, with additional factors complicating the determination of Chevron deference eligibility. In Barnhart v. Walton, the Court emphasized the importance of the legal question's interstitial nature. The Supreme Court clarified that agency jurisdictional determinations qualify for Chevron deference in City of Arlington v. FCC, resolving a long-running dispute. Justice Scalia expressed concerns about the Mead standard and its implications for future cases. In City of Arlington v. FCC, the Supreme Court ruled that agency jurisdictional determinations, like other statutory interpretations, warrant deference under Chevron. The case involved the FCC's declaratory ruling on siting applications for wireless service facilities under the Telecommunications Act of 1996. The FCC specified a \"reasonable\" timeframe for state and local governments to make determinations on siting applications, which was challenged by the city of Arlington. The city of Arlington sued the FCC over its authority to interpret the TCA provision. The Supreme Court considered whether the agency had the authority to issue the ruling. Arlington argued that Chevron should not apply in this case as it is a legal issue, not a technical one. The question was whether the FCC had the authority to interpret the phrase \"reasonable period of time.\" The Supreme Court considered whether the FCC had the authority to interpret the phrase \"reasonable period of time.\" Justice Scalia stated that the distinction between 'jurisdictional' and 'nonjurisdictional' interpretations is a mirage, and the agency must stay within its statutory authority. The Court applied the \"Chevron two-step\" test to determine if the agency's interpretation was valid. The Supreme Court applied the \"Chevron two-step\" test to determine if the agency's interpretation of a statute with regard to its statutory jurisdiction is permissible. Justice Scalia argued that courts should not waste time distinguishing between 'jurisdictional' and 'nonjurisdictional' interpretations, as all agency interpretations should receive Chevron deference. Chief Justice Roberts, along with Justices Kennedy and Alito, dissented, advocating for courts to determine if Congress gave an agency authority. Justices Kennedy and Alito argued that courts should determine if Congress gave an agency authority before applying Chevron. The dissent believes Chevron should only be used after confirming the agency's statutory powers. Even without Chevron deference, courts may still give weight to agency interpretations based on Skidmore v. Swift. Skidmore involved a case about \"waiting time\" as \"working time\" under the Fair Labor Standards Act. The Supreme Court considered whether periods of inactivity during emergencies constituted \"working time\" under the FLSA. The Court acknowledged the value of agency determinations, though not binding, due to their expertise and investigations. The Supreme Court recognized the importance of agency expertise and investigations in determining \"working time\" under the FLSA. The Skidmore deference emphasizes the value of agency rulings, interpretations, and opinions as a body of experience for courts and litigants to consider for guidance. The degree of deference given by a court depends on the thoroughness, validity, and consistency of the agency's reasoning. The Skidmore deference emphasizes the importance of agency expertise in court decisions, with the degree of deference correlating to the strength of the agency's reasoning. Factors such as thoroughness, validity, consistency, agency care, formality, past interpretations, and relative expertness are considered. Skidmore deference acknowledges that an agency's interpretive choice should be respected due to its expertise, influencing a court's review based on the quality of the interpretation. Compared to Chevron deference, Skidmore deference is of a lesser degree."
