    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 1841 of the Water Code is amended to require measurement and reporting of water diversion and use by authorized persons under permits, licenses, registrations, or certifications for specific water uses. The board shall adopt initial regulations as emergency measures for the immediate preservation of public peace, health, safety, and welfare. These regulations will remain in effect until revised. Adoption of initial regulations under this article is exempt from certain sections of the Public Resources Code. Section 1840 of the Water Code is amended. Section 1840 of the Water Code is amended to require individuals diverting 10 acre-feet of water per year or more to install and maintain a device for measuring diversion rates. (A) A device must continuously monitor water diversion rate and quantity, and be maintained. Evidence of installation must be provided to the board with the first report. The device's proper functioning must be demonstrated in reports every five years or upon board request. (B) Regulations under Section 1841 should consider accurate measurement devices and methods for total amount and rate of water diversion, with acceptable error ranges, including electricity records and pump tests. The permittee or licensee must maintain records of all diversion monitoring, including date, time, diversion rate, and total water diverted. The board may modify requirements if strict compliance is infeasible, unreasonably expensive, affects public trust uses, or results in water waste. The board may increase the reporting threshold for water diversion in a watershed if the benefits outweigh the costs. Diverters must report the quantity and rate of water diverted annually. Compliance with the requirements of this section is mandatory for all registrations, permits, or licenses, including reporting the maximum diversion rate by month and any relevant information."
