The Congress finds that since the 1940's, the Federal Government conducted secret radiation experiments in the United States without informed consent for research purposes, not for medical benefits. The Federal Government failed to inform individuals tested about the harmful effects of radiation experiments, causing harm and health problems. Congress presumes that these experiments led to excess cancers and diseases, putting innocent individuals at risk unknowingly. The Government should take responsibility for the lives and health of those involved.
