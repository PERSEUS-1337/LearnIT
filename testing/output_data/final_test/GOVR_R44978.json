    "content": "Congress uses an annual appropriations process to fund discretionary spending for federal government agencies through 12 regular appropriations bills each fiscal year. If these bills are not enacted by October 1, continuing resolutions (CRs) provide temporary funding. CRs can be extended until all regular appropriations bills are completed or the fiscal year ends. None of the FY2018 regular appropriations bills were enacted. H.R. 601, a temporary CR, provides continuing appropriations for all 12 regular annual appropriations bills from October 1, 2017, through December 8, 2017. It also includes provisions for foreign assistance, disaster relief, and a temporary suspension of the public debt limit. Signed into law on September 8, 2017, this report analyzes the funding provided in H.R. 601. The report analyzes the funding provided in H.R. 601, a temporary CR that provides continuing appropriations for all 12 regular annual appropriations bills from October 1, 2017, through December 8, 2017. It includes provisions for foreign assistance, disaster relief, and a temporary suspension of the public debt limit. The report summarizes the overall funding provided, budget enforcement issues, and specific provisions in the CR organized by appropriations act title. The CR provides funds for projects and activities specified in previous appropriations acts, with a duration for budget authority and funding rates based on total annual budget authority. The CR provides continuing budget authority for projects and activities funded in FY2017 by the regular appropriations acts, including statutory limits on discretionary spending for FY2018 as established by the Budget Control Act of 2011. The CR extends budget authority limits for FY2018, including exemptions like OCO/GWOT, disaster relief, and emergency requirements. Funds must be used under the same terms as FY2017 appropriations acts, with restrictions on initiating new activities without available budget authority. The goal is to protect Congress's authority to allocate annual funding as desired. The Continuing Resolution (CR) extends budget authority limits for FY2018 until December 8, 2017. It allows for funding of projects and activities based on FY2017 appropriations acts, with the possibility of superseding by a regular appropriations act before December 8. Funding ceases for projects not included in subsequent appropriations acts. The CR aims to preserve Congress's authority to allocate annual funding as desired. The Continuing Resolution (CR) for FY2018 extends budget authority limits until December 8, 2017. It includes provisions for maintaining program levels under current law and an across-the-board decrease in funding for most projects. However, certain appropriations like OCO/GWOT, disaster relief, and emergency requirements are exempt from this decrease. FY2018 appropriations are subject to discretionary spending limits on defense and nondefense categories as per the BCA. The Budget Control Act (BCA) sets limits on discretionary spending for defense and nondefense categories. If spending exceeds these limits, sequestration involves across-the-board cuts. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) calculates adjustments to the spending limits annually. For FY2018, the caps are $549.057 billion for defense and $515.749 billion for nondefense. OMB evaluates enacted discretionary spending to ensure compliance with the limits. For FY2018 discretionary spending, OMB evaluates spending relative to the limits set by the Budget Control Act. The evaluation and any necessary enforcement occur within 15 days after the congressional session ends. The Congressional Budget Office estimates annualized budgetary effects of interim CRs, with defense at $551.489 billion and nondefense at $518.109 billion. The Congressional Budget Office estimates annualized budget authority in the CR of $1,183.058 billion for FY2018 discretionary spending, with $551.489 billion for defense and $518.109 billion for nondefense. The authority to determine if a sequestration is needed rests with OMB, and adjustments can be made before the statutory spending limits are enforced. The Continuing Resolutions (CRs) typically include provisions specific to certain agencies, accounts, or programs. These provisions can designate exceptions to funding formulas, create new laws, or renew expiring provisions. Anomalies are used to preserve Congress's authority to appropriate funds as needed, even with short-term funding. The Continuing Resolutions (CRs) include provisions specific to agencies, accounts, or programs, establishing new policies that may expire when the CR ends. Anomalies and provisions changing law can be requested by the President and modified by Congress during appropriations drafting. This section of the report summarizes agency-, account-, or program-specific provisions alphabetically organized by appropriations act title for 11 of the 12 regular appropriations acts covered in Section 101. The Continuing Resolutions (CRs) contain provisions specific to agencies, accounts, or programs, establishing new policies that may expire when the CR ends. Summaries provide brief explanations of the provisions, including additional information like whether a provision was requested by the President. Section 116 of the CR increases funding for the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, a domestic food assistance program for low-income elderly, using a base of approximately $238.1 million instead of the FY2017 funding level of $236.1 million. This anomaly is included to maintain current caseload and participation while accounting for increased food costs. The Continuing Resolution (CR) makes technical corrections for fund computation and extends funding levels for various programs, including the FDA Innovation Account and the Emergency Conservation Program. However, it does not extend disaster funding for agricultural land rehabilitation programs. The CR also allows the Census Bureau to access funds from the Periodic Censuses and Programs account. The Continuing Resolution allows the Census Bureau to access funds from the Periodic Censuses and Programs account to maintain the 2020 census schedule. It also includes provisions prohibiting the Department of Defense from funding new starts or accelerating production rates for major programs. Additionally, it extends the authorization for the Office of Security Cooperation with Iraq. The FY2012 National Defense Authorization Act allows for an extension of funding for the Uranium Enrichment Decontamination and Decommissioning Fund until December 8, 2017. The Department of Energy is authorized to apportion funds to avoid disruption of projects at federal uranium enrichment facilities in Kentucky, Ohio, and Tennessee. DOE must notify Congress of fund usage within three days. Section 121 of the CR extends the authority for the Reclamation States Emergency Drought Relief Act to the CR's expiration date, allowing the Bureau of Reclamation to undertake activities to minimize drought damages in 17 Reclamation States and Hawaii. Section 122 allows DOE's Power Marketing Administrations to credit offsetting collections at alternative rates. The language in this section grants congressional approval of the District of Columbia general fund and capital budgets for FY2018 through December 8, 2017. It allows the District to expend locally raised funds only for programs and activities that received funding the previous year. District officials may spend locally raised funds at the rate set forth in the Fiscal Year 2018 Local Budget Act of 2017. The provisions in Section 124 of the D.C. Act 22-99 change the basis for calculating the rate of operations for certain accounts in FY2018. The rates for General Services Administration, District of Columbia Federal Payment, and National Archives and Records Administration are adjusted based on specified amounts appropriated for expenses related to the presidential inauguration and transition. Section 124 of the D.C. Act 22-99 adjusts the rates for certain accounts in FY2018 based on specified amounts appropriated for expenses related to the presidential inauguration and transition. This includes provisions for National Archives and Records Administration operating expenses and restrictions on funds for General Services Administration expenses related to the presidential transition. The Trump Administration's budget request for FY2018 aimed to shift costs for shared functions from the Department of Homeland Security to specific components within the Executive Office of the President. The Administration requested a section in the FY2018 annual appropriations for DHS to adjust funds and staffing levels for four operational components to maintain levels from FY2017. This provision was expanded to include Transportation Security Administration and U.S. Secret Service, different from previous appearances. The FY2018 annual appropriations for DHS include a provision for adjusting funds and staffing levels for four operational components, including the U.S. Secret Service. This provision is solely for personnel costs to maintain staffing levels and extends special procurement authorities for research and development activities at DHS. It also grants special hiring authorities for critical positions in the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2010, extended through FY2017, allows faster funding for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund. The NFIP borrowing limit of $30.425 billion is extended through the CR. The Administration supports this provision for supplemental appropriations post-Hurricane Harvey. The CR extends the NFIP borrowing limit of $30.425 billion and authorizes fund transfers from FLAME accounts for wildfire suppression purposes. The CR extends the NFIP borrowing limit and authorizes fund transfers from FLAME accounts for wildfire suppression purposes. FLAME funds can be transferred to any Forest Service or DOI account if funds were previously used for suppression operations. Fire borrowing occurs when WFM and FLAME funds are depleted. The appropriations to FLAME accounts are designated as emergency spending and not subject to across-the-board reductions. This provision reduces the basis for calculating the rate of operations for the NPS budget account by $4.2 million. The CR extends the authority for five agencies to collect recreation fees on federal lands through September 30, 2019. In FY2016, these agencies collected approximately $377 million in fees, which can be retained and spent without further appropriation. The CR extends the authority for agencies to collect recreation fees on federal lands through September 30, 2019. The collected fees can be retained for on-site improvements. Section 132 extends the Eisenhower Memorial Commission's authorization to establish a memorial for President Eisenhower. Section 133 provides $3.0 million to the EPA for water infrastructure projects. Section 134 of the CR extends EPA's authority to collect fees under FIFRA, including pesticide maintenance fees and registration service fees. It also prohibits EPA from collecting fees for pesticide tolerances. Section 135 extends the duration of the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity (NACIQI) through December 8, 2017, tasked with assessing accreditation in higher education and institutional eligibility for federal student aid programs. Section 135 extends the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity (NACIQI) through December 8, 2017, for assessing accreditation in higher education and institutional eligibility for federal student aid programs. GEPA Section 422 does not apply to NACIQI, which would have terminated on September 30, 2017. Section 136 ensures $80 million in cost-of-living adjustments for Head Start and Early Head Start grantees in FY2017 is included in the formula for each grantee's \"base grant\" for FY2018, allowing program enhancements to be maintained. Section 137 extends the period for certain funds allocated to state workforce agencies for UI upgrades. Section 138 directs NIH to reimburse research institutions for indirect costs based on FY2017 rules. The FY2018 Trump Administration budget proposed capping indirect cost rates for NIH grants at 10%. Section 139(a) makes funds in the CHIP Child Enrollment Contingency Fund unavailable for obligation. Section 139(b) rescinds $2.7 billion in mandatory spending for FY2017 CHIP allotments to states. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA) allocated funds for FY2017 CHIP allotments to states. Sections 301(a) and 301(b)(3) of MACRA provided appropriations totaling $17.55 billion for FY2017. Additionally, $2.7 billion in unobligated national allotments was rescinded. Multiple appropriations laws have rescinded a total of $42.8 billion from the CHIP Program from FY2011 through FY2017. Section 101(a)(8) continues funding for programs in the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services. The funding for programs in the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriations act continues based on the FY2017 omnibus. Exceptions to the formula include certain funding instructions and additional appropriations from the second FY2017 CR. The NIH Innovation Account and the Account for the State Response to the Opioid Abuse Crisis are subject to a 0.6791% across-the-board reduction. Amounts appropriated to these accounts are subtracted from budget control estimates. Section 101(a)(8) applies FY2016 requirements to the transfer of funds previously appropriated to the Prevention and Public Health Fund. The FY2018 CR transfers PPHF funds to HHS agencies as per FY2016 appropriations, with a $1 million reduction for CDC. FY2018 funds in the NIH Innovation Account are based on FY2017 appropriation, not the account amount. The NIH Innovation Account was created to fund four projects authorized by the Cures Act: Precision Medicine, Brain Research, Cancer Research, and Regenerative Medicine. The NIH director can transfer funds between accounts for specified purposes. FY2018 funds from the 21st Century Cures Act support grants to states. The 21st Century Cures Act created an account to fund grants for addressing the opioid abuse crisis. Funds must be appropriated for expenditure, with the FY2018 CR based on the FY2017 appropriation. Section 195 allows for apportioning salaries for Senate cybersecurity. 2 U.S.C. \u00a74577 limits spending on employees in the first quarter of a fiscal year. Unobligated funds for VA Major Construction would be rescinded. The Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013 rescinded funds for the VA Major Construction account related to Hurricane Sandy, to be reappropriated until September 30, 2022. This is in addition to FY2017 and CR FY2018 funding levels for the same account. The CR would fund some VA accounts for FY2018 based on FY2017 appropriations, with an across-the-board rescission of 0.6791%. The VA is funded through a combination of budget year and advance appropriations, with seven accounts funded as advance appropriations. P.L. 114-223 provided $170.32 billion in advance appropriations for FY2018. The CR for FY2018 would not include the Medical Community Care account and the additional $50 million for the Medical Services account. Section 142 extends authorization for HUD's Mark-to-Market program through the CR, renewing expiring project-based Section 8 rental assistance contracts to preserve property affordability. The program was created in 1997 and has been extended multiple times by Congress. The President's FY2018 budget request and FY2018 HUD appropriations bills also included an extension of the program."
