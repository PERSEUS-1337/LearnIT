    "content": "Congress plays a key role in U.S. trade policy by regulating foreign commerce and granting authority to the President for trade agreements. Decisions on trade liberalization impact both domestic and foreign interests, leading Congress to carefully assess the economic effects. Additionally, Congress provides assistance programs for workers and firms affected by market opening. Various economic models provide differing estimates of the potential changes in U.S. employment that could result from a trade agreement with South Korea. These models are sensitive to assumptions and limited by a lack of data in some areas. Various economic models provide differing estimates of the potential changes in U.S. employment that could result from a trade agreement with South Korea. Advocates and opponents of the KORUS FTA cite these studies to support their positions. Estimates range from as many as 280,000 jobs gained to 159,000 jobs lost over a ten-year period. The Obama Administration suggests the FTA would support 70,000 export jobs, while other estimates suggest the U.S. could lose 345,017 jobs over the same period without the agreement. The economic models provide varying estimates of potential changes in U.S. employment due to a trade agreement with South Korea. Estimates range from 280,000 jobs gained to 159,000 jobs lost over a ten-year period. However, these estimates do not directly link changes in trade to employment changes and only focus on goods-producing employment, not the overall impact on the economy. The KORUS-FTA includes provisions on trade in goods, services, and investment, but due to complexities and lack of data, the estimates may not accurately reflect the agreement's total economic effects. The estimates selected for analysis regarding the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement's impact on the economy include reports from the U.S. International Trade Commission, the University of Michigan, the U.S.-Korea Business Council, and the Economic Policy Institute. Additionally, estimates derived by the USITC and released by the Obama Administration and the Senate Finance Committee Trade Subcommittee are also considered. Congress has shown interest in trade agreements to reduce barriers to U.S. trade in goods, services, and agriculture. This report examines estimates on the impact of trade agreements on the U.S. economy, focusing on employment effects. It discusses the findings, assumptions, methodologies, and limitations of these estimates, emphasizing that employment estimates do not fully capture the overall economic impact of trade agreements. Estimating employment effects of trade agreements is imprecise and sensitive to assumptions. While agreements cover goods, services, and investment, most employment estimates focus on goods and may not fully represent total impact. It's challenging to estimate employment effects of liberalizing trade in services and reducing barriers to investment. Negotiations to reduce barriers in services could have a significant positive effect on the U.S. economy. The United States is competitive in service sectors and direct investment abroad spurs exports. Estimates of employment from FTAs do not capture all benefits for the economy. Economic trade models analyze consumer and corporate behavior, assuming changes in tariffs will impact prices over time. In the KORUS-FTA, some tariffs will change. In the KORUS-FTA, changes in traded goods are aggregated over ten years, with some tariffs dropping to zero immediately and others phased in over time. Models treat changes in trade in services as external factors. Estimates of the agreement's impact on employment over the next decade are based on the assumption of full employment, reflecting the relative magnitude of changes in employment expected over ten years. The U.S. economy is expected to return to full employment over the next decade, with wage rates adjusting. Estimates of employment effects under the KORUS-FTA are based on the assumption of current economic conditions operating at less than full employment. Trade models used in free trade agreement analysis play a significant role in generating these estimates. Trade models like CGE models are used to analyze free trade agreements and their effects on nearly 100 countries. These models incorporate data on trade and domestic economic variables but sacrifice some precision due to the large amount of data involved. While originally developed to analyze multi-country trade agreements, the lack of precision may be a drawback in certain situations. Trade models like CGE models are used to analyze free trade agreements and their effects on nearly 100 countries. These models may lack precision when estimating the impact of bilateral trade agreements, especially in terms of exchange rate changes. Movements in exchange rates can significantly affect trade patterns between countries in a bilateral agreement. Between January 2005 and February 2011, the South Korean won depreciated against the dollar and euro due to various factors such as the financial crisis, drop in capital inflows, and cautious international markets. The won experienced a 44% depreciation against the dollar and a 30% depreciation against the euro between January 2008 and January 2009. Despite some recovery, the won faced another bout of depreciation due to financial problems in Europe and concerns over North Korea. By February 2011, the won remained 19% and 10% below its January 2008 value relative to the dollar. Since February 2011, the South Korean won remained 19% and 10% below its value in January 2008 relative to the dollar and the euro, respectively. Changes in the won's value could impact prices of goods to and from South Korea. Estimates of the potential effects of the KORUS FTA on U.S. employment range from 280,000 jobs gained to a loss of 159,000 jobs if the agreement is adopted. Six estimates, including two standard economic modeling estimates and two from the USITC, will be discussed in detail. The estimates of the potential effects of the KORUS FTA on U.S. employment vary, with two standard model estimates focusing on economy-wide trade effects and sectoral shares. Other approaches indirectly estimate employment effects, considering the dynamic nature of the U.S. economy where jobs are constantly created and replaced due to macroeconomic developments and technological advancements in different industries and sectors. The most successful sectors attract capital and labor, while lagging sectors face competitive challenges. Economic transformation through technology and communication has led to global supply chains. How firms adapt to these changes will impact their long-term viability. Job openings at the plant level may be affected. The Bureau of Labor Statistics tracks job gains and losses in the economy, revealing dynamics in employment changes. In 2010, 15% of U.S. employment was in goods-producing industries, 68% in services-producing industries, and 17% in the government sector. Job openings at the plant level may come from new business openings, expansions, or increased exports, while job losses can result from various factors like bankruptcy, personal choice, or production shifts. The job turnover process affects 18-20% of total economy jobs each year, with a higher impact on the goods-producing sector (24%-27%) compared to the services sector (17%-18%). Economic expansions or recessions can amplify job turnover, as seen during the severe recession in 2008-2009. During the severe recession in 2008-2009, jobs supported by exports were significantly impacted, representing a small share of total jobs in the economy. Within the goods-producing sector, export-related jobs accounted for a higher percentage compared to the services sector. The global economic recession and financial crisis in 2008-2009 led to a sharp reduction in global trade, affecting jobs supporting exports. During the economic recession and financial crisis, global trade sharply declined, leading to a loss of about 1.8 million jobs supported by trade. This represented a decrease from 8% to 6% of total employment. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that during the last two years of the economic expansion in 2005-2007, 3.6 million workers were displaced from their jobs, with only 67% finding full-time employment and 22% matching their previous income level. In the current globalized economy, international trade involves a complex set of transactions beyond just trading goods and services. International trade involves a complex set of transactions, including the exchange of goods, services, and financial products between nations. Trade allows countries to maximize resources and improve their standard of living by specializing in certain goods and trading with others. Nations export to import goods they do not produce. International trade involves nations exporting goods and services they do not produce efficiently in order to import what they need. The benefits of trade include gains for consumers and producers, as well as long-term growth. Most economists believe that the overall effect of international trade on the economy is positive, as it strengthens competitive industries and promotes productivity. Trade liberalization helps to remove barriers and enhance the competitiveness of industries. Increased trade and trade agreements aim to boost competitiveness and productivity by shifting labor and capital to more productive activities. Estimating employment effects involves considering microeconomic and macroeconomic viewpoints. In a dynamic economy like the U.S., job composition constantly changes with some sectors growing and others declining. International trade is one of many factors influencing output and job composition. Firms face competitive pressures from trade and other factors, impacting their viability and choices. Trade agreements impact firms' responses to competitive pressures, affecting their viability in the marketplace. The macroeconomic viewpoint considers the direct and indirect economic effects of trade, including changes in employment and production. Trade agreements lower tariffs on imported goods, leading to more efficient domestic production and lower prices for consumers. Trade agreements lower tariffs on imported goods, making the economy more efficient. Consumers benefit from lower prices and increased real incomes. However, trade agreements do not affect the total number of jobs in the U.S. economy, but can impact the composition of employment, especially as the economy nears full employment. The U.S. economy is expected to return to full employment, influenced by factors like productivity growth, population growth, and technological innovation. Changes in these factors, along with fluctuations in the business cycle and currency values, can outweigh the effects of trade agreements on industry-wide job gains or losses. Shifts in production from labor-intensive to capital-intensive products may result in more labor being released, potentially leading to challenges for those displaced from labor-intensive jobs. Economists recognize that greater specialization in the economy can lead to labor dislocations when workers lack the skills for new capital-intensive jobs. Adjustment costs from shifting labor and capital between industries can be significant, especially in the short run. Governments consider these costs when negotiating trade agreements, facing opposition from groups that would bear heavy costs from trade liberalization. The costs of trade liberalization are especially burdensome for labor groups lacking advanced education and training. Quantifying the impact of international trade on employment composition is complex. While trade agreements may benefit certain sectors, they are not a primary source of employment in the US. Exchange rates and the business cycle can have a greater impact on the economy. Data gaps, particularly in the services sector, hinder analysis. Significant data gaps in the services sector hinder the ability to model the effects of trade agreements that lower barriers to trade in services. The services sector accounts for a large portion of the U.S. economy and increased trade in services could offer substantial gains. Concerns over the impact of trade agreements on employment often focus on labor compensation rates between countries, but competitiveness is also influenced by productivity levels. Compensation differences between the United States and South Korea may impact competitiveness, but productivity levels also play a crucial role. Estimates of employment effects from trade agreements like the KORUS FTA often do not consider productivity. These agreements aim to lower trade barriers, promote investment, and enhance trade in goods and services. Quantifying barriers in services and predicting the agreement's impact on potential are challenging tasks. The USITC used a standard approach and economic model to estimate the long-term trade effects of the KORUS FTA with South Korea, focusing on changes in exports and imports. The analysis addressed the impact of lowering tariffs on traded goods over a 10-year period, but did not consider employment effects. The USITC used the Global Trade Atlas Project (GTAP) to estimate trade changes from tariff rate adjustments under the KORUS FTA. It projected a $3.3 billion to $4.0 billion increase in U.S. exports to South Korea over the first decade, with a $6.4 billion to $6.9 billion increase in imports. The University of Michigan used a world trade model to estimate the effect of tariff rate reduction on export and import prices. They projected a $9.2 billion increase in U.S. exports to Korea and a $6.9 billion increase in imports. The model assumes no overall change in jobs, but rather changes in employment composition among sectors. The University of Michigan projected changes in job composition among sectors due to tariff rate reduction, with estimates indicating potential job gains in the agricultural sector and job losses in government services, trade, transportation, textiles, transportation equipment, metal products, and machinery. Economic theory suggests that sectors with comparative advantage in factors of production are likely to gain employment from increased trade. The United States has a comparative advantage in capital-intensive products, services, and agricultural products for exports, while developing countries excel in labor-intensive products for imports. Estimates suggest that the KORUS FTA could support an additional 70,000 U.S. workers through new exports, based on data from the ITC. Economic theory indicates that sectors with a comparative advantage in production factors are likely to gain employment from increased trade. The ITA cautioned against using data on jobs supported by exports to estimate net changes in employment from increases or decreases in exports. Estimates vary on the potential job creation from the KORUS FTA, with the White House stating it would support 70,000 jobs and the ITC suggesting it could create 280,000 jobs. The Trade Subcommittee analyzed the agreement under different scenarios. In one scenario, assuming fixed labor and capital, the KORUS-FTA would require reallocation of resources from other sectors, resulting in slight increases in output and employment. In another scenario, with underutilized labor and capital, the agreement could potentially expand employment by 0.16%. The KORUS-FTA agreement has the potential to expand employment by 0.16%, or approximately 280,000 American jobs, by drawing labor and capital from sectors with unemployed resources. U.S. exports to South Korea would increase by 4.4% and imports from South Korea by 1.3%. The assumptions about the U.S. economy operating at less than full employment drive the estimate of employment gains, but it is reasonable to expect the economy to return to full employment levels in the next ten years. The U.S.-Korea Business Council estimated the employment effects of the KORUS-FTA using a different approach, focusing on the impact on U.S. trade with South Korea if the proposed FTAs with the EU and Canada were implemented. The Council assumed underutilized capital and labor in the economy to derive their results. The U.S.-Korea Business Council assumed underutilized capital and labor in the economy to estimate the impact of FTAs with Canada, the EU, and South Korea on U.S. output and trade. They compared scenarios with and without the U.S.-South Korea FTA to derive the difference in the impact on U.S. output and trade. The Council estimated that the US could lose 345,000 export jobs if the KORUS FTA is not implemented, assuming Canada and the EU would substitute for $35.1 billion in exports to South Korea. This scenario provides insights into the impact of not implementing the KORUS-FTA amidst numerous FTAs being negotiated globally. The Council estimated that not implementing the KORUS FTA could lead to a loss of 159,000 U.S. goods-producing jobs. Trade agreements involve trade diversion and trade creation, but the model does not capture the trade-creating effects of the FTAs. The Economic Policy Institute also estimated the potential negative impact of the KORUS FTA. The Economic Policy Institute estimated that the KORUS FTA could lead to a loss of 159,000 U.S. goods-producing jobs by using an unconventional approach based on past trade agreements with Mexico and China. The EPI study estimated that the KORUS FTA would increase imports, leading to a trade deficit, and result in job losses in the United States. The study used trade proxies, such as U.S. trade with Mexico and China, to make these estimates, despite readily available data on U.S. trade with South Korea. The EPI study estimated that the KORUS FTA would increase imports, leading to a trade deficit and job losses in the United States. Differences in exchange rates among China, Mexico, and South Korea were noted, with the devaluation of the peso boosting U.S. imports from Mexico. The South Korean won is determined by market forces. The EPI estimate also projected job losses due to an increase in the U.S. trade deficit with South Korea. The ITA warned that estimating jobs gained or lost from trade is unreliable. A joint effort by DOC, BEA, and BLS found that on average $166,000 in goods exports, $216,000 in services exports, or a weighted average of $180,000 supported one job in each sector. Some estimates of FTA employment effects have been derived from this report. The ITA has cautioned against using data to estimate job gains or losses from trade agreements. The composition of U.S. imports differs from exports, with some imports serving as inputs for further processing. The employment estimate should not be used as a multiplier for jobs associated with exports or imports. The ITA cautions against using job estimates from exports or imports as multipliers for trade agreements. Averages from IO analysis should not be used to estimate employment changes from trade agreements. The ITA advises against using job estimates from exports or imports as multipliers for trade agreements, as averages from IO analysis are not reliable for estimating employment changes. Factors such as prices, resource utilization, and productivity vary across different types of exports, making it difficult to accurately predict changes in employment based on trade volume. Data reflecting actual changes in employment due to tariff reductions are not available according to the ITA. The ITA advises against using job estimates from exports or imports as multipliers for trade agreements, as averages from IO analysis are not reliable for estimating employment changes. Data reflecting actual changes in employment due to tariff reductions are not available according to the ITA. The ITA also indicated that estimates of the average number of jobs associated with exports cannot be adjusted for fluctuations in manufacturing capacity over the course of the business cycle. During periods of slack business activity, increased output, such as exports, would tend to increase employment, lower unemployment, and increase labor force participation. The 112th Congress passed legislation implementing the KORUS FTA, sparking debates on its impact on U.S. employment, especially in certain sectors. Concerns arise in communities with high unemployment rates or plant closings due to foreign competition. The KORUS FTA could pose challenges for U.S. employment. Analysis of potential effects raises questions about the accuracy of estimates due to varying assumptions and methodologies in economic modeling. Good models use reasonable assumptions, while some may use non-standard approaches to generate specific results. Accuracy in economic modeling is crucial given the current state of data availability. The accuracy of economic models in estimating the impact of the KORUS-FTA on employment is limited due to varying assumptions and methodologies. The key assumption is the expected level of labor utilization in the U.S. economy over the ten-year phase-in period. Models can provide rough estimates of employment changes but cannot predict precise shifts. The existence of unutilized labor and capital allows for long-term estimates of output and employment gains under the fully-implemented KORUS-FTA. Estimates of employment effects of new FTAs can be subjective and misleading, focusing narrowly on goods sectors and neglecting services and investment areas. They do not account for exchange rate changes and overlook the broader benefits for the economy as a whole. Estimates of employment effects of new FTAs may not accurately reflect the overall impact on the economy. Policymakers should consider a range of estimates that clearly state assumptions and inform about the broad implications of such agreements. Reliable data on specific sectors would be beneficial for assessing the magnitude of these agreements. Policymakers could benefit from initiatives to improve data on the impact of international trade on the economy, including information on services, worker dislocations, global supply chains, and barriers to U.S. services. Appendix B outlines the standard assumptions of economic models used to estimate the effects of trade agreements on U.S. employment. This includes steps such as estimating the impact of changes in tariff rates on goods prices. Estimating the impact of changes in goods prices on sales and consumer responsiveness. This includes considering the level of substitutes available and the impact on output or employment. Models incorporate assumptions to reduce variability in these estimates. To reduce variability in estimates, basic assumptions are made in models. These assumptions include the direct translation of tariff rate changes to price changes and the assumption that exchange rates will remain constant. However, in reality, tariff rates may not be adjusted immediately and prices may not adjust at the same rate. Additionally, changes in exchange rates are often not considered in estimates. Consumer choices may not always shift based on price changes resulting from tariff reductions, impacting the expected employment changes associated with a trade agreement. Trade agreements can create trade by increasing efficiency in production and real incomes, leading to greater consumption of goods. Holding employment constant in economic models helps estimate the impact of trade agreements on employment or wages. The economic models used to estimate the impact of trade agreements on employment focus on changes in the composition of employment associated with the agreement. These models do not typically estimate changes in wages but aim to highlight the impact on various sectors of the economy. Some models hold wages constant and allow for changes in employment to estimate the number of jobs gained or lost in different sectors. The estimates usually aggregate the total effects over a decade to derive an overall change. The assumptions made in estimating the impact of trade agreements on employment can compromise the validity of the results due to changes in the economy over time. Estimates do not consider business cycle effects or other transformational effects. Converting changes in tariffs to changes in employment involves several steps that are often not explicitly explained."
