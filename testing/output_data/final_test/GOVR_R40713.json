The Obama Administration seeks public input on the rulemaking process. The report evaluates how well the Unified Agenda alerts the public about upcoming proposed rules. The report discusses options for improving transparency and participation in the rulemaking process, including the Obama Administration's open government initiative. President Obama issued a memorandum directing agencies to make the federal government more transparent. The Obama Administration issued a memorandum directing agencies to increase transparency, participation, and collaboration in the federal government. This included using new technologies to provide information online, offering more opportunities for public participation in policymaking, and soliciting feedback to improve collaboration. The public was invited to offer comments and suggestions on increasing openness and transparency in government. The notice highlighted the use of \"twenty-first century tools\" to enhance government transparency and openness. Comments were sought on improving rulemaking, a crucial function of federal agencies that issue thousands of final rules annually. Rulemaking is described as vital for understanding expectations from government. Federal agencies issue 3,000 to 4,000 final rules annually on various topics. The rulemaking process is governed by the Administrative Procedure Act and other statutes. Agencies develop draft proposed rules, send them for review, publish a notice of proposed rulemaking, obtain comments, and develop a draft final rule. The rulemaking process involves developing draft proposed rules, sending them for review, publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking, obtaining comments, and developing a draft final rule. The final rule is reviewed by the agency and OIRA before being published in the Federal Register. Final rules generally take effect at least 30 days after publication, with variations depending on the agency and rule significance. OIRA only reviews \"significant\" regulatory actions from non-independent agencies. The rulemaking process involves critical decisions and resource investment before the publication of proposed rules. Agencies gather information, draft rules and preambles, and address analytical requirements during the development phase. The process officially starts when a Regulation Identifier Number (RIN) is assigned. The rulemaking process involves critical decisions and resource investment before the publication of proposed rules. Agencies take at least two years to issue an NPRM for 10 out of 12 rules developed by DOT, EPA, and FDA. Some rules were under development for six years before being published. Changes to proposed rules in response to public comments become less likely after review and approval within agencies and OIRA. The group at Texas A&M University noted that changes to proposed rules in response to public comments may not be fundamental due to sunk costs and the need for a second round of public comment. This can be unattractive as agencies are already under pressure to issue rules in a timely manner. The difficulty of changing proposals also increases the incentive to develop proposals that do not need to be changed. The importance of public input during the rule-development process is highlighted, with pre-NPRM consultation being most effective. Various mechanisms such as ANPRMs, negotiated rulemaking, and public hearings are utilized by agencies like the EPA and OSHA. Early involvement is emphasized, as seen in OIRA's review of rules before formal submission. Once a regulatory proposal is formally submitted to OMB, there is strong organizational momentum behind it, with agency staff dedicating years to data collection and analysis. Any changes suggested during OMB review are likely to face resistance and may only have marginal impact on the agency's strongly held views. Both former administrators have noted that OIRA's impact on draft rules occurs before formal submission for review. Pre-NPRM public participation in rulemaking was promoted during the Obama Administration, using blogs and social media for input on proposed rules. The approach involved co-creating rules with public input before drafting them. The potential benefits of public participation in rulemaking include expanding government engagement with citizens and improving regulations. Federal agencies have been required to notify the public about upcoming regulatory actions for over 30 years, as outlined in Executive Order 12044 issued by President Jimmy Carter in 1978. Agencies must publish a semiannual agenda of significant regulations under development or review to provide adequate notice to the public. The agency's semiannual agenda must be approved by the head of each agency before publication. It should describe regulations under consideration, legal basis, status of previous regulations, and contact information for agency officials. Agencies are required to provide early public participation opportunities in rulemaking, including publishing advance notices of proposed rulemaking. Since 1983, the Regulatory Information Service Center (RISC) within GSA has published a semiannual Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions, compiling information on agencies' regulatory activities. The report highlighted the importance of agencies providing early public participation opportunities in rulemaking, such as advance notices of proposed rulemaking. The Regulatory Information Service Center (RISC) compiles the semiannual Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions for OIRA. The Unified Agenda is a systematic and widely-used method for agencies to alert the public about upcoming rules, helping them fulfill transparency requirements such as the Regulatory Flexibility Act and Executive Order 12866. Each agenda entry must contain a regulation identifier number. The Unified Agenda is a method for agencies to inform the public about upcoming rules, fulfilling transparency requirements. Each agenda entry must contain a regulation identifier number, a brief summary of the action, legal authority, deadline, and contact information. The purpose is to involve the public and resolve conflicts early. Entries are organized by agency and associated with rulemaking stages. The Unified Agenda is a tool for agencies to inform the public about upcoming rules. It includes different stages like proposed rules, final rules, long-term actions, and completed actions. Each entry must have a regulation identifier number and a brief summary. The purpose is to involve the public early in the rulemaking process. The National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program aims to improve the management of facility-specific information for regulated sources. The EPA is updating regulations to ensure accurate and consistent data collection, as the current system no longer meets national needs. The EPA is updating regulations for the NPDES program as the current system no longer meets national needs. The Unified Agenda entry indicated EPA's intention to issue a proposed rule in November 2009, with a priority level of \"other significant.\" It is unclear how widely known the Unified Agenda is outside academia and interest groups, and there are no studies on the relationship between proposed rules and entries in the Unified Agenda. The Unified Agenda allows agencies to withdraw or propose regulations not listed, and agency actions may occur before or after the dates listed. It does not legally bind agencies to adhere to schedules or confine regulatory activities to listed regulations. CRS examined proposed rules reviewed by OIRA in 2008 to see how agencies used the Unified Agenda to notify the public about upcoming rules. The Unified Agenda allows agencies to withdraw or propose regulations not listed, and agency actions may occur before or after the dates listed. It does not legally bind agencies to adhere to schedules or confine regulatory activities to listed regulations. CRS examined proposed rules reviewed by OIRA in 2008 to see how agencies used the Unified Agenda to notify the public about upcoming rules. Significant rules under development for some time are more likely to have been preceded by a Unified Agenda entry, excluding rules from independent regulatory agencies like the SEC and FCC. OIRA reviewed significant proposed rules to determine if agencies had published a \"proposed rule\" entry in the Unified Agenda before the NPRM was published. The Unified Agenda allows agencies to notify the public about upcoming rules, with agencies publishing entries before NPRMs. For about three-quarters of proposed rules, agencies published Unified Agenda entries before NPRMs, indicating approval within agencies and parent departments. For two-thirds of proposed rules, agencies published Unified Agenda entries before OIRA reviews, but one-quarter of rules had no prior notification. Examples of NPRMs without prior Agenda entries include USDA's rule on cattle disposition, DOC's rule on steel imports, and DOD's rule on TRICARE. The curr_chunk discusses various rules issued by different government departments, such as the Department of Defense, Department of Education, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Homeland Security, Department of the Interior, Department of Justice, Department of Labor, and Department of Transportation. These rules cover a range of topics including academic achievement, prescription drug plan payments, firearms in national parks, occupational health risks assessment, and fuel economy standards for passenger cars and light trucks. The agencies issued various rules on different topics, including fuel economy standards for passenger cars and light trucks. The Unified Agenda was used to notify the public about upcoming proposed rules, with varying levels of utilization by different agencies. For example, HHS and EPA extensively used the Unified Agenda, while DOD had a lower percentage of proposed rule entries. The Unified Agenda was utilized by agencies to notify the public about upcoming proposed rules. DOD and OPM published entries for a percentage of their NPRMs, with examples of multiple entries preceding the related NPRM. For instance, DOT's proposed rule on a \"National Registry of Certified Medical Examiners\" had entries in several editions of the Agenda before its publication. The public was alerted in advance about proposed rules published by agencies between 2001 and 2008. However, some entries in the Unified Agenda were considered late notices, such as EPA's proposed rule on \"Oil Pollution Prevention\" and DHS's proposed rule on \"Changing the Period of Time for Admission for TN Nonimmigrants.\" The Unified Agenda entries for proposed rules by various agencies between 2001 and 2008 were sometimes considered late notices, with examples such as EPA's rule on \"Oil Pollution Prevention\" and DHS's rule on \"Changing the Period of Time for Admission for TN Nonimmigrants.\" Additionally, there were instances where agencies published entries in the Unified Agenda after OIRA's review had already begun, giving the public little time to react. The Obama Administration has initiated efforts to increase transparency in the policymaking process, seeking public input on improving the rulemaking process. Observers note that the most crucial stage occurs before a proposed rule is published in the Federal Register, possibly even before it is submitted to OIRA for review. The Obama Administration aims to increase transparency in the rulemaking process by seeking public input. The White House plans to allow public comments on proposed rules during development. The Unified Agenda, published biannually since 1983, helps the public stay informed about upcoming rules. The Unified Agenda, published biannually since 1983, provides a systematic method for federal agencies to alert the public about upcoming proposed rules. Data shows that agencies frequently use the Agenda to accomplish this goal, with about three-quarters of significant proposed rules being preceded by a \"proposed rule\" entry. By reviewing the most recent edition of the Unified Agenda, the public can often know in advance when a proposed rule is about to be published. However, about one-quarter of proposed rules did not have a \"proposed rule\" entry before publication. The Unified Agenda, published biannually since 1983, serves as a systematic method for federal agencies to notify the public about upcoming proposed rules. While about three-quarters of significant proposed rules are typically preceded by a \"proposed rule\" entry in the Agenda, approximately one-quarter of proposed rules are not. In such cases, issuing agencies may inform the public through other means, such as public meetings or direct notifications to affected parties. Additionally, some proposed rules may need to be developed quickly, leading to their exclusion from the Unified Agenda. For example, the USDA issued a proposed rule in August 2008 in response to a petition received in April 2008, which was not included in the previous edition of the Unified Agenda. The USDA and DOI had to submit their rule entries to the Unified Agenda in November 2008, as they were unable to do so in the previous May 2008 edition due to various reasons. In some cases, agencies did not use the Unified Agenda to inform the public about upcoming rules. For example, DOC issued a proposed rule on steel import monitoring in December 2008, but it was only mentioned in the Unified Agenda after the rule was published. HHS and DOI also had similar delays in listing their proposed rules in the Unified Agenda. The NPRM was published by DOI to update regulations related to firearms in national parks. DOJ published a proposed rule on the classification of steroids, and VA published a proposed rule on grants for hiring nurses. Federal agencies varied in their use of the Unified Agenda for these rules. Some agencies, such as EPA and HHS, consistently publish proposed rule entries in the Unified Agenda before NPRMs, while others, like DOC, DOD, and OPM, do so less frequently. Congress and Presidents have established rules for agencies to develop proposed rules with transparency and public participation. If improvements are deemed necessary, various policy options are available for enhancing transparency and public participation in the rulemaking process. Various policy options are available to enhance transparency and public participation in the rulemaking process, including pre-NPRM communications, blogs, social media, tracking systems, and disclosing expected issuance of proposed rules. The public can sign up to receive notices about upcoming regulatory actions within specific areas. Options to improve the visibility of the Unified Agenda to enhance transparency and participation in rulemaking process are available. Improving the visibility of the Unified Agenda could enhance transparency and participation in the rulemaking process. Suggestions include identifying the Agenda in the OMB \"open government\" directive, providing links to Agenda entries on agency websites, and using press releases to publicize upcoming proposed rules. This could help level the playing field between the public and specialized interest groups. Another option is to enhance federal agencies' use of the Unified Agenda as a transparency mechanism. Improving federal agencies' use of the Unified Agenda as a transparency mechanism could enhance the rulemaking process. Agencies should be required to publish \"proposed rule\" entries in the Agenda before submitting draft rules to OIRA, or provide explanations for not doing so. This requirement could be enforced by OIRA under Executive Order 12866. The Unified Agenda could be improved by enforcing a requirement for agencies to publish \"proposed rule\" entries before submitting draft rules to OIRA. This could lead to increased transparency and participation but may also have negative effects. Another option is to increase the frequency of Unified Agenda publication by Congress or the President. The Unified Agenda could be enhanced by requiring agencies to publish \"proposed rule\" entries before submitting draft rules to OIRA, increasing transparency and participation. However, this may have negative effects. Increasing the frequency of Unified Agenda publication by Congress or the President could also improve transparency. The agency has transitioned to using an electronic docketing system at Regulations.gov. Agencies are currently not allowed to establish a rulemaking docket until an NPRM is published in the Federal Register. Allowing agencies to establish dockets when the first Unified Agenda entry is published could include public comments on forthcoming proposed rules in the docket. However, comments on Agenda entries may be less specific and useful compared to comments on proposed rules. The public can provide valuable information and perspectives to agencies before rules are finalized or published in the NPRM. Advance notice of proposed rules allows the public more time to prepare comments, especially when comment periods are short. A revitalized Unified Agenda could improve inter-agency coordination and prevent duplication of efforts."
