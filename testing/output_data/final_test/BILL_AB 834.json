    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 89002 of the Government Code prohibits the dissemination of public advertisements featuring a candidate for elective office within 90 days before the election. The bill amends Section 82015 of the Government Code and is in line with the Political Reform Act of 1974. No reimbursement is required by this act as it pertains to creating, eliminating, or changing penalties for crimes or infractions. Section 82015 of the Government Code is amended to define \"contribution\" as a payment, loan forgiveness, or promise to pay, unless made for political purposes. Payments made at the request of a committee or candidate are considered contributions unless full consideration is received. Payments made to a candidate are presumed to be unrelated to their candidacy if they are for personal purposes or made by a governmental agency or nonprofit organization. Payments made for legislative, governmental, or charitable purposes, not considered gifts or contributions, must be reported by elected officers if they exceed $5,000 in a calendar year. The report must include details such as the payor's name and address, payment amount, dates, payee information, goods or services provided, and the specific purpose or event. Payments exceeding $5,000 in a calendar year for legislative, governmental, or charitable purposes must be reported by elected officers. Details such as payor's name, payment amount, dates, payee information, and purpose/event must be disclosed. Once the $5,000 threshold is reached from a single source, all payments made by that source in the calendar year must be reported within 30 days. State agencies and local agencies must forward these reports to the Commission and the officer with whom elected officers file their campaign statements, respectively. For reporting purposes, payments exceeding $5,000 in a calendar year for election-related activities must be disclosed. This includes communications advocating for a candidate, soliciting contributions, and coordinating campaign activities. Campaign activities such as recruiting volunteers, preparing budgets and finance statements, and voter communications with express advocacy are key responsibilities. Contributions made for a different candidate or committee not controlled by the candidate are not considered contributions to the candidate. Payments made at the request of a Public Utilities Commission member for legislative, governmental, or charitable purposes are not considered contributions. However, these payments must be reported within 30 days if they exceed $5,000 in a calendar year from the same source. The report must include details such as the payor's name and address, payment amount, dates, payee information, goods or services provided, and the purpose of the payment. The Public Utilities Commission must disclose all payments exceeding $5,000 from a single source within 30 days of reaching the threshold for a calendar year. The Commission will then forward these reports to the Fair Political Practices Commission. Contribution includes purchasing tickets for fundraising events, candidate's own money used for campaign expenses, granting discounts or rebates not available to the public, and payment of compensation for services rendered on behalf of a candidate or committee. Contribution includes transfers of value between committees, excludes previously reported amounts from enforceable promises, and excludes payments for meetings or events under $500 made by occupants of homes or offices. The definition of \"contribution\" includes payments for fundraising events at a lobbyist's home or office, but excludes volunteer services and personal travel expenses. The definition of \"contribution\" includes payments for communications that advocate for a candidate or measure and are made at the request of the candidate or committee. It also includes payments to multipurpose organizations."
