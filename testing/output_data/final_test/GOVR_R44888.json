    "content": "The 115th Congress is focused on evaluating support for federal research and development (R&D) activities amidst concerns about federal debt and budget deficits. The government plays a crucial role in supporting R&D efforts for scientific breakthroughs and new technologies. This includes areas such as national defense, health, safety, environment, and energy security, as well as advancing knowledge and innovation. The federal government funds R&D activities to support various missions of agencies. Each agency develops its R&D budget internally, subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget and Congress. The federal R&D budget is an aggregation of activities from different agencies. Congress plays a key role in defining the nation's R&D priorities and funding levels. Some members express concerns about federal spending due to the deficit, while others support increased R&D investment for future competitiveness. Budget caps may limit R&D funding, requiring reallocation of resources across disciplines and agencies. President Trump's FY2018 R&D budget request faces challenges in reallocating resources between programs and agencies due to funding complexities. The report analyzes the R&D funding request from various perspectives and for multiagency initiatives, as well as the budget requests of federal departments and agencies accounting for nearly 99% of total federal R&D funding. The proposed FY2018 budget was released on May 23, 2017, with government-wide, multiagency, and individual agency analyses provided in the report. The report provides analyses of the President's FY2018 R&D budget request, including a new definition for development. The Trump Administration is using a revised definition for development in its R&D calculations, excluding some activities previously categorized as development. Adjustments to FY2016 R&D data were not provided based on this new definition. Additional information and analysis will be included as Congress acts on the budget request. President Trump's FY2018 R&D budget request includes adjustments for development funding excluded under a new definition. The request totals $151.244 billion, a 2.0% increase from FY2016. Adjusted for inflation, the request represents a 1.9% decrease in constant dollars from FY2016. The FY2018 adjusted R&D request represents a 1.9% decrease in constant dollars from FY2016. The President's R&D request includes funding for existing and new initiatives, analyzed by agency and the character of work supported. Congress makes decisions on R&D funding through authorization and appropriations processes. Data on R&D by agency for FY2016 and FY2018 is provided in Table 1. The President's FY2018 budget request allocates over 96% of federal R&D funding to eight key agencies, with the Department of Defense receiving the largest share at 45.4%. Other major recipients include the Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Energy, NASA, NSF, USDA, DOC, and VA. This report analyzes the R&D budget requests for these agencies, as well as for DHS, DOI, DOT, and EPA. The President's FY2018 budget request would result in decreased R&D funding for most federal agencies compared to FY2016 levels. Only a few agencies would see an increase in funding, such as the Department of Veterans Affairs, Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Trust Fund, and the Smithsonian Institution. The Department of Defense would receive the largest dollar increase in R&D funding, while agencies like HHS, DOE, USDA, NSF, and EPA would experience significant declines in their budgets. President Trump's FY2018 budget request includes decreased R&D funding for most federal agencies compared to FY2016 levels. NASA R&D would decline by $415 million (3.1%), with significant decreases in basic research and applied research funding. Development funding would increase by $10.981 billion (14.5%) above the FY2016 level. The FY2018 budget request includes a $10.981 billion increase in development funding, not reported as R&D. Public investments in basic research are justified by the belief that the private sector underinvests in it from a societal perspective. The federal government is a major supporter of basic research, funding 45.4% of U.S. basic research in 2014. Business is the primary funder of applied research in the United States, accounting for 51.7% in 2014. Business also provides the majority of funding for development, accounting for 82.4% in 2014. In terms of federal R&D funding, agencies contribute to basic research, applied research, development, and facilities. The federal budget reflects national priorities such as spaceflight, energy sources, and counterterrorism efforts. In the President's FY2018 budget, the Department of Health and Human Services, mainly NIH, would be the largest federal funder of basic research and applied research. In the President's FY2018 budget request, DOD would be the primary federal funder of development, accounting for 86.6% of total federal development funding. Multiagency R&D initiatives like NITRD, NNI, and U.S. Global Change Research Program receive annual budget supplements with objectives, activities, and funding levels. Other initiatives may be eliminated at the President's discretion. The President's FY2018 budget is silent on funding levels for non-statutory initiatives, which may be eliminated at the President's discretion. The Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) program, established in 1991, coordinates federal R&D investments in areas such as supercomputing, cybersecurity, and software engineering. In FY2017, 21 agencies were NITRD members. In FY2017, 21 agencies were NITRD members, and non-member agencies also participate in NITRD activities. NITRD efforts are coordinated by the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) Subcommittee on Networking and Information Technology Research and Development. Additional information can be obtained at https://www.nitrd.gov. The U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) coordinates federal research on global change. In FY2017, the US Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) involved 13 departments and agencies, coordinated by the NSTC Subcommittee on Global Change Research. The National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) was launched in FY2001 to advance understanding and control of matter at the nanoscale. The NNI included 11 federal departments and agencies in FY2017. The National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) in FY2017 involved 11 federal departments and agencies dedicated to nanotechnology R&D. NNI efforts are coordinated by the NSTC Subcommittee on Nanoscale Science, Engineering, and Technology (NSET). Additional information can be found at http://www.nano.gov. Presidential initiatives without statutory foundations include the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership and the National Robotics Initiative. The curr_chunk discusses various federal initiatives such as the Advanced Manufacturing Partnership, Cancer Moonshot, BRAIN Initiative, Precision Medicine Initiative, Materials Genome Initiative, and clean energy R&D funding doubling efforts. It also provides an in-depth analysis of R&D in 12 federal departments and agencies. The agencies are presented based on the size of their R&D budgets, comparing FY2018 request levels to FY2017 enacted levels. The curr_chunk discusses annual appropriations for federal agencies provided through regular appropriations bills, with a focus on R&D funding. It highlights challenges in identifying R&D funding within agency budgets and notes discrepancies in R&D data between agency analyses and the president's budget. The House completed action on all regular appropriations bills for the 2018 fiscal year, while the Senate had not. Congress enacted the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018, providing funding through December 8, 2018. The House completed action on all regular appropriations bills for the 2018 fiscal year, while the Senate had not. Congress enacted the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018, providing funding through December 8, 2018. Subsequently, three additional continuing resolutions (CRs) were passed providing appropriations through February 8, 2018. This report will be updated as Congress takes additional actions to complete the FY2018 appropriations process. Congress supports research and development activities at DOD through RDT&E funding to develop future military hardware and software. RDT&E funds are appropriated in various parts of the defense appropriations bill, including the Defense Health Program. The Defensewide Operations and Maintenance appropriations request supports research on various medical conditions. The Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction Program aims to destroy lethal chemical agents and munitions. The National Defense Sealift Fund supports the naval reserve fleet and U.S. flagged merchant fleet. The RDT&E funding for the naval reserve fleet and U.S. flagged merchant fleet is requested in the Navy's Procurement request and appropriated in Title V of the appropriation bill. The Joint Improvised-Threat Defeat Fund also contains RDT&E monies, administered by the Joint Improvised-Threat Defeat Organization. Funding for RDT&E has also been requested and appropriated for efforts in the Global War on Terror and Overseas Contingency Operations. The term Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terror (OCO/GWOT) has been used in appropriations bills, with RDT&E funds going to specified Program Elements. Various transfer funds like the Iraqi Freedom Fund and Afghanistan Security Forces Fund have been included in OCO/GWOT-related requests. Congress typically makes a single appropriation into these funds and authorizes transfers to other accounts, including RDT&E. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget uses the term Overseas Contingency Operations for funding allocations. The Trump Administration is requesting $83.328 billion for DOD's Title IV RDT&E PEs for FY2018, which is $9.547 billion above the FY2017 level. The House passed a bill including $84.306 billion for Title IV RDT&E funding, representing a 14.3% increase over FY2017. The House bill includes $1.000 billion in RDT&E funding in both base and OCO funding under a new account entitled National Defense Restoration Fund. Additionally, the Administration's FY2018 request includes funding for Defense Health Program, Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction program, and National Defense Sealift Fund. The FY2018 RDT&E funding includes $1.340 billion, a decrease of $762 million from FY2017 enacted level but an increase of $667 million above the FY2018 request. The Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction program receives $839 million, up $323 million from FY2017. The National Defense Sealift Fund remains at zero, equal to FY2017, and $19 million below the FY2018 request. The Inspector General for RDT&E is allocated $3 million, equal to both FY2017 and FY2018 requests. RDT&E funding is distributed among military departments and DOD agencies, and can be categorized by budget activity. The DOD's Science and Technology program (S&T) consists of budget activities 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3, focusing on basic research, applied research, and advanced technology development. Budget activities 6.4 and 6.5 concentrate on developing specific weapon systems, while 6.6 provides management support. Budget activity 6.7 supports system improvements in existing operational systems. Congressional policymakers are interested in DOD S&T program funding for developing new technologies and science. The DOD's Science and Technology program (S&T) includes budget activities focusing on basic research, applied research, and advanced technology development. Some in the defense community view supporting S&T activities as crucial for maintaining U.S. military superiority. The FY2018 request for Title IV S&T funding is $13.224 billion, with basic research receiving special attention, especially from universities. DOD's basic research budget is mainly spent at universities and is a significant funding source in certain areas. The Trump Administration is requesting $2.229 billion for DOD basic research for FY2018, which is slightly less than the FY2017 enacted level. The House proposes $2.280 billion in funding, higher than the request. The Department of Health and Human Services focuses on enhancing health and well-being through R&D funded by the National Institutes of Health. The Department of Health and Human Services funds R&D through various agencies including CDC, CMS, FDA, AHRQ, HRSA, and ACF. The primary agency for biomedical and behavioral research is the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which aims to enhance health and reduce illness. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) consists of the Office of the Director (OD) and 27 institutes and centers (ICs) that focus on specific diseases and research areas. Each IC manages its own research programs in coordination with the OD. NIH supports a wide range of basic and clinical research, training, and health information dissemination. About 10% of the NIH budget funds intramural research projects conducted by nearly 6,000 NIH scientists. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) funds research projects conducted by 6,000 scientists. Over 80% of NIH's budget supports research at universities, hospitals, and other institutions. Funding primarily comes from the Labor, HHS, and Education appropriations bill, with additional funding for Superfund-related activities. Additional mandatory funding is provided for type 1 diabetes research. Total funding for NIH includes discretionary and mandatory sources. President Trump's FY2018 budget proposes a $7.4 billion decrease in funding for NIH activities, with each Institute receiving less compared to FY2017. The budget suggests eliminating the Fogarty International Center but allocating $25 million for international research. It also plans to merge the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality with NIH to create the National Institute for Research on Safety and Quality (NIRSQ) with a budget of $272 million. The FY2018 budget proposes funding for NIRSQ to support key research activities, including administrative support for USPSTF and dissemination of study results. Funding includes $60 million for Superfund-related research, $150 million for type 1 diabetes research, and $780 million transferred to NIH from the PHS Program Evaluation Set-Aside. The PHS Program Evaluation Set-Aside allows the Secretary to use a portion of eligible appropriations to study federal health programs and make improvements. While the PHS Act limits the tap to 1% of eligible appropriations, recent LHHS appropriations have specified a higher amount (2.5% in FY2017) and directed funding to various HHS programs. NIH, as the largest PHS agency, has historically been a major donor of program evaluation funds. The FY2018 Trump budget requests $14.2 billion for NIH research project grants (RPGs), with a proposed cap on indirect costs at 10%. Direct costs have averaged 72% of grant awards, while indirect costs have averaged 28%. The budget would decrease the average annual cost of an RPG award by 20% to $389,000. Congress typically does not specify funding amounts for specific diseases or research areas. The NIH budget allows flexibility for funding different research areas, with specific amounts allocated to each IC. Funding is subject to peer review and discretionary appropriation. Recent changes include increased funding for Alzheimer's disease and the establishment of the NIH Innovation account. The FY2018 budget includes $496 million for the Innovation account, with allocations for projects like the Precision Medicine Initiative and the BRAIN Initiative. The House Appropriations Committee-reported version of the FY2018 LHHS appropriations bill recommends a total of $35.184 billion for NIH, including funding for various initiatives such as the Precision Medicine Initiative, the BRAIN Initiative, cancer research, and regenerative medicine using adult stem cells. This amount would provide NIH with a $1.1 billion increase over the FY2017 enacted amount and $8.58 billion more than the FY2018 Trump budget request. The report accompanying the bill stated concerns about the Trump Administration's proposed cap on indirect costs. The House Appropriations Committee directs NIH to continue reimbursing institutions for indirect costs according to current rules and procedures, prohibiting further caps on F&A cost reimbursements. They also provide increased funding for the Fogarty International Center and reject the proposed consolidation of NIH and AHRQ. Additionally, there is a recommended increase in funding for Alzheimer's disease research within NIA. The Senate Appropriations Committee-reported version of the FY2018 LHHS appropriations bill recommends a total of $36.311 billion for NIH, including increases for Alzheimer's disease research. The committee rejects the administration's proposals to cap Facilities and Administrative costs, eliminate the Fogarty International Center, and merge AHRQ with NIH. The FY2018 LHHS appropriations bill recommends $36.311 billion for NIH, with increased funding for Alzheimer's disease research. The bill rejects proposals to cap Facilities and Administrative costs, eliminate the Fogarty International Center, and merge AHRQ with NIH. Additionally, the budget includes a $414 million increase for Alzheimer's disease research, bringing the total to $1.828 billion. The NIH budget prioritizes fundamental science enhanced by technological advances, with a focus on basic research like the BRAIN Initiative. The BRAIN Initiative, funded by the NIH, aims to develop tools for studying brain functions to understand brain disorders better. The House recommends $86 million, while the Senate proposes $400 million for the initiative. Another project, the Single Cell Analysis Program, focuses on understanding how single cells function to identify rare cells or drug-resistant cells. The National Cancer Institute uses cryo-electron microscopy to observe key molecules in cancer cells at the atomic level. Using cryo-electron microscopy to observe key molecules in cancer cells at the atomic level may aid in developing more targeted therapies. NIH is also supporting research on correcting genetic mutations causing sickle cell disease and combating opioid addiction and antimicrobial resistance. The House proposes an increase of $30 million for these efforts. The House and Senate are both increasing funding for antimicrobial resistance research, with the Senate proposing a higher increase. Cancer immunotherapy, supported by the Cancer Moonshot initiative, is a priority area receiving funding. The NIH is directed to transfer $300 million to the National Cancer Institute for the Cancer Moonshot. Additionally, the Precision Medicine Initiative aims to collect data from a large group of volunteers for research purposes. The House and Senate are increasing funding for research studies on health, genetic, environmental data, and novel therapeutics. NIH is engaged in vaccine research for various diseases, including the Zika virus and a universal influenza vaccine. NIH aims to be an efficient steward of taxpayer funds and increase transparency in resource allocation. NIH is focused on enhancing reproducibility of scientific research and investing in a diverse research workforce. The agency has funding opportunities for new investigators and aims to normalize success rates between early and experienced scientists. The Department of Energy was established in 1977 to combine energy-related programs and defense-related nuclear programs. The Department of Energy (DOE) conducts basic scientific research in various fields, including nuclear physics, energy production, and national security. It operates 17 national laboratories, accounting for 40% of DOE expenditures. The FY2018 budget request for DOE is $10.172 billion, a 22.6% decrease from FY2017. The House bill proposes $12.033 billion in funding. The Senate committee recommendation for DOE funding is $13.075 billion, with $5.393 billion allocated for the Office of Science. This is a decrease from the FY2017 appropriation of $5.392 billion. The largest program within the Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences, would receive $1.555 billion, a 16.9% decrease from the previous year. The House bill would provide reduced funding for the BES program, including cuts to synchrotron light sources operations. The Senate bill would allocate more funding, maintaining support for EPSCoR and the two energy innovation hubs. The request for High Energy Physics is $673 million, a decrease of 18.5% from FY2017. This includes funding for Muon to Electron Conversion Experiment and Long Baseline Neutrino Facility/Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment. Biological and Environmental Research funding is $349 million, a decrease of 43.0% from FY2017. The request for Biological and Environmental Research funding would rename the Climate and Environmental Sciences program to Earth and Environmental Systems Sciences, with a decreased share of the total budget. Funding for Earth and Environmental Systems Modeling would decrease significantly, while Climate Model Development and Validation would receive no funding. The House bill would provide $582 million, while the Senate bill would provide $633 million, with a balanced allocation between Biological Systems Science and Earth and Environmental Systems Sciences. The request for Nuclear Physics is $503 million, a 19.2% decrease from FY2017. Funding includes $80 million for ongoing construction of FRIB and no further funding for CEBAF upgrade.

The request for Fusion Energy Sciences is $310 million, a decrease of 18.4% from FY2017. The DOE budget for Fusion Energy Sciences is $310 million, down 18.4% from FY2017. This includes $63 million for U.S. contributions to ITER. The Senate bill proposes $232 million for Fusion Energy Sciences, with no funding for ITER, citing concerns about prioritizing other Office of Science projects. The request for DOE national security R&D is $3.982 billion, a 5.9% increase from FY2017. The bulk of the increase would be in Weapons Activities, including funding for Enhanced Capabilities for Subcritical Experiments, Stockpile Responsiveness program, and exascale computing facilities. Naval Reactors funding would increase by $60 million. The House bill would provide $4.036 billion, with additional funds for Nuclear Nonproliferation R&D. The Senate bill would provide $3.865 billion, with no funds for Stockpile Responsiveness. The bill would provide $3.865 billion, with significant reductions in funding for DOE energy R&D across various areas such as energy efficiency, renewable energy, fossil energy, and nuclear energy. Notable decreases include coal carbon capture and storage, natural gas technologies, small modular reactor licensing technical support, the Integrated University Program, and the Supercritical Transformational Electric Power (STEP) R&D initiative. The House bill proposes $2.620 billion for DOE energy R&D, with significant reductions in funding for energy efficiency, renewable energy, nuclear energy, and termination of ARPA-E. The Senate bill does not provide funding for ARPA-E. The Senate bill proposes $3.660 billion for DOE energy R&D, with decreases in funding for energy efficiency, renewable energy, fossil energy R&D, and nuclear energy. It includes $330 million for ARPA-E, $24 million more than FY2017. NASA conducts research in various fields and has development programs for future spacecraft and space technology. NASA's budget for R&D in FY2018 is about $15.950 billion, a decrease from the previous year. The House committee recommends $16.737 billion, while the Senate committee recommends $16.324 billion. NASA's R&D funding is allocated to five accounts: Science, Aeronautics, Space Technology, Exploration, and ISS/Commercial Crew. The FY2018 request for Science is $5.712 billion, with decreases in funding for Earth Science and the James Webb Space Telescope. The House committee bill proposes a decrease in funding for the James Webb Space Telescope by $36 million (6.3%) and an increase in funding for Planetary Science and Astrophysics. The reduction in Earth Science funding would come from eliminating four items in the Earth Systematic Missions program. In Planetary Science, funding for an orbiter mission to Jupiter's moon Europa would increase from $275 million to $425 million in the FY2018 request. The House committee bill proposes $5.859 billion for Science, with $50 million less for Earth Science and $191 million more for Planetary Science. It recommends $495 million for Europa missions. The Senate committee bill offers $5.572 billion for Science, with $167 million more for Earth Science and $318 million less for Planetary Science. It includes funds for PACE, CLARREO Pathfinder, and DSCOVR. The FY2018 request for Aeronautics is $624 million, with $79 million for a low-boom supersonic flight demonstrator.

The Senate committee bill includes $700 million, with $130 million allocated for Restore-L to target a launch in 2019. NASA is encouraged to share expertise with DARPA. The FY2018 Exploration budget request is $3.934 billion, a 9.0% decrease primarily funding Orion development. The House committee bill proposes $4.550 billion for Exploration, expressing concern about schedule slips and directing NASA to submit a report on schedule milestones for EM-1 and EM-2. The Senate committee bill would provide $4.395 billion for the same purpose. Launch readiness dates for SLS carrying Orion are expected to slip to 2019 for EM-1 and FY2023 for EM-2. The report recommends funding to ensure crewed launches and prepare for future missions. The request for Commercial Crew is $732 million, a 38.2% decrease, while the ISS request is $1.491 billion, a 3.8% increase from FY2016. The reduction in Commercial Crew funding aligns with plans for the transition to operations. A domestic commercial crew transport capability to the ISS is expected by September 2018. The House committee bill proposes $64 million less for Space Operations, without specifying allocations. The Senate committee bill offers $11 million more for Space Operations. The Senate committee bill provides $11 million more for Space Operations, including the requested amount for Commercial Crew but not specifying an allocation for the ISS. The National Science Foundation (NSF) supports basic research and education in non-medical sciences and engineering, established in 1950 to promote science progress, national health, prosperity, welfare, and defense. NSF is a key federal supporter of U.S. university research, especially in mathematics and computer science, and plays a significant role in federal STEM education programs and student aid. The National Science Foundation (NSF) has six appropriations accounts: Research and Related Activities (RRA), Education and Human Resources (EHR), Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction (MREFC), Agency Operations and Award Management (AOAM), the National Science Board (NSB), and the Office of Inspector General (OIG). Appropriations are provided at the account level, with program-specific direction included in appropriations acts or accompanying reports. FY2017 funding was directed for programs within the RRA, EHR, and MREFC accounts. Requested funding for FY2018 is compared to FY2016 actual funding levels. The report compares account funding to FY2017 enacted funding and R&D funding to FY2016 actual levels. R&D funding is included in the RRA, EHR, and MREFC accounts, which make up 95% of the total requested funding for NSF. The budget request specifies R&D funding for research and physical assets. Actual R&D obligations are known after funding allocations. Funding amounts for FY2016 actual, FY2017 enacted, and FY2018 requested levels are reported by account in Table 9. The Trump Administration is requesting $6.653 billion for the NSF in FY2018, a decrease from the FY2017 enacted amount. The request would decrease budget authority in three accounts: RRA, EHR, and MREFC. Funding for research grant awards would decrease, resulting in 800 fewer grants awarded. R&D activities account for approximately 81% of NSF's total funding, with $5.370 billion requested for R&D activities in FY2018. The Trump Administration is requesting $6.653 billion for the NSF in FY2018, a decrease from the FY2017 enacted amount. The total request includes $4.950 billion for the conduct of R&D, with 86% for basic research and 14% for applied research. Funding for R&D facilities and major equipment supports construction, acquisition, planning, design, and post-construction operations and maintenance. The Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, Defense, Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, Legislative Branch, and Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act, 2018 (H.R. 3354) and the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018 (S. 1662) propose funding for the NSF in FY2018. The total amount allocated is $7.340 billion in H.R. 3354 and $7.311 billion in S. 1662, including both R&D and non-R&D funding. NSF's budget justification highlights seven agency-wide investments to promote interdisciplinary research. Compared to FY2016, there is a slight decrease in funding. In FY2018, funding for NSF includes a slight increase for the INCLUDES initiative and decreases for six other investments, ranging from 12% to 70%. The committee report recommends specific funding levels for various programs. The committee report recommends maintaining the FY2017 funding level for I-Corps Research, despite the Trump Administration's proposed 11% decrease in funding for RRA in FY2018. The FY2018 request includes decreases for all RRA subaccounts except for USARC, with the largest percentage decrease for Integrative Activities (26%) and the largest decrease in dollars for MPS ($129 million, 9.6%). Additionally, the FY2018 request includes $100 million for the EPSCoR program, a 37.5% decrease from the previous year. The FY2018 request includes $100 million for the EPSCoR program, a 37.5% decrease from the previous year. Policymakers have debated congressional funding directives within RRA, with some asserting legislators' role in establishing funding priorities by scientific field, while others argue for scientists managing NSF to determine funding distribution based on research needs and possibilities within each field. The FY2018 budget request includes $4.839 billion for R&D within the RRA account, with $4.602 billion allocated for research activities. H.R. 3354 proposes $6.034 billion for RRA, while S. 1662 suggests $5.918 billion. The Senate committee recommends at least $160 million for EPSCoR. The FY2018 budget request includes a $119 million decrease for EHR, totaling $761 million, the largest reduction among NSF's appropriations accounts. H.R. 3354 proposes $880 billion for EHR, matching the FY2017 level. S. 1662 suggests $862.4 million, $17.6 million below FY2017, and $101.8 million above the FY2018 request. The Division of Graduate Education would see the largest decrease in funding at 20.5%, receiving $221 million. Education would receive a $57 million decrease, with the Division of Graduate Education seeing the largest decrease at 20.5%, receiving $221 million. EHR programs like the Graduate Research Fellowship and National Research Traineeship are of interest to policymakers, with proposed reductions in funding for FY2018. Funding for FY2018 for various EHR programs includes CyberCorps, Advancing Informal STEM Learning, STEM + Computing Partnerships, HBCU-UP, TCUP, LSAMP, and HSI. The Senate committee recommends specific funding levels for HBCU-UP, TCUP, and LSAMP programs. The Senate committee report recommends specific funding levels for various EHR programs in FY2018, including $35 million for HBCU-UP, $14 million for TCUP, $46 million for LSAMP, and $15 million for HSI. The requested funding for R&D within EHR is $348 million, with a decrease from the FY2016 actual amount. The MREFC account supports large construction projects and scientific instruments, with the Trump Administration seeking just over $183 million for FY2018. In FY2018, the requested MREFC funding of $183 million would support three main projects, including the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST). Most of the funding ($105 million) would go towards the Regional Class Research Vessels (RCRV) program to build ships for science in U.S. coastal waters. Congress directed NSF to provide $122 million for three RCRVs, impacting current and future funding requirements. The House's H.R. 3354 would allocate $77.8 million for MREFC in FY2018, $131 million below FY2017, with $57.8 million for LSST and $20 million for DKIST. The Senate's S. 1662 proposes $182.8 million for MREFC, equal to the FY2018 request, including funding for DKIST, LSST, and three RCRVs. Other initiatives in the FY2018 NSF budget request include $389 million for the National Nanotechnology Initiative. The FY2018 budget proposes decreased funding for various research programs, including a $122 million (24%) cut for NSF, a $157 million (12.9%) cut for the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development program, and a $85 million (25.6%) cut for the U.S. Global Change Research Program. The U.S. Department of Agriculture supports agricultural research through intramural and external research funding. The USDA's research and education activities focus on traditional agricultural production techniques, organic and sustainable agriculture, bioenergy, nutrition, food safety, animal and plant health, pest and disease management, economic decision-making, and social sciences. The four agencies involved are the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS), and Economic Research Service (ERS). The FY2018 budget proposes $2.793 billion for USDA's research agencies, a reduction of $98 million from the previous year. The Senate-reported bill (S. 1603) would provide $2.834 billion for agricultural research, $41 million more than the House bill, and a 2% reduction from FY2017. The Administration's budget request was for $2.508 billion, a reduction of $382 million (-13.2%) from FY2017. USDA's Agricultural Research Service operates 90 laboratories nationwide with 6,600 employees and focuses on food and fiber production, new product development, and agricultural commodity uses. The House-passed bill for FY2018 would provide reduced funding for ARS salaries and expenses and buildings and facilities compared to FY2017 levels. The Senate-reported bill offers more funding for salaries and expenses but nothing for buildings and facilities. The Administration requested a significant reduction in funding for ARS salaries and expenses, proposing budget cuts across all programmatic areas and eliminating several research projects. The House and Senate bills reject proposals to close 5 laboratories and terminate 12 research projects in the ARS program. The House bill encourages reallocating resources as projects mature. The Senate bill agrees with the Administration's request for no appropriation for ARS buildings and facilities, while the House bill would provide $60 million. This follows previous appropriations of $99.6 million in FY2017 and $212 million in FY2016. The National Institute of Food and Agriculture provides federal funding for research, education, and extension projects in partnership with various institutions. For FY2018, the House-passed bill would provide $1.344 billion for NIFA, while the Senate-reported bill would provide $1.373 billion. The House-passed bill for FY2018 would provide $1.344 billion for NIFA, while the Senate-reported bill would provide $1.373 billion. The Agriculture and Food Research Initiative (AFRI) would remain at $375 million in both bills, with slight differences in funding for other research programs compared to the Administration's request. The House-passed and Senate-reported bills maintain formula-funded programs in research and extension. The Administration proposed a 15% reduction in McIntire-Stennis cooperative forestry research funding. The President's request aims to eliminate funding for various federal STEM education programs at USDA. Previous budget requests suggested moving these programs away from USDA, but appropriations have kept them in place. Both bills prioritize funding for NIFA and AFRI. The House-passed and Senate-reported bills maintain USDA programs at FY2017 levels, with a focus on NIFA's competitive grant funding for research enhancement awards. The National Agricultural Statistics Service would receive increased funding for FY2018 to conduct the Census of Agriculture. The Administration's request includes additional expenses for the Agricultural Census. The Administration requested a reduction in funding for the NASS Agricultural Estimates program, with the House-passed bill proposing a larger decrease. The Senate-reported bill aims to maintain the core statistical program at FY2017 levels with a slight reduction. The Economic Research Service supports analysis on agriculture, rural development, and commodity markets. The House-reported bill aligns with the Administration's request for reduced funding for FY2018. The Senate-reported bill aims to maintain the FY2018 appropriation for the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration at the FY2017 level of $87 million. The Administration's budget proposed reductions in research areas such as drought resilience, international agriculture, bioenergy, and consumer food purchases. NIST's mission is to promote U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness through measurement science and technology advancements. NIST's responsibilities include developing and maintaining national measurement standards, ensuring compatibility with other nations, and providing funding through three accounts. The President is requesting $725.0 billion for NIST in FY2018, a decrease of $229.0 million from FY2017. The House passed the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill, 2018 with $870.0 million allocated. The House-passed bill for NIST includes $870.0 million in funding, a decrease of $84.0 million from FY2017. The Senate committee-reported bill includes $944.0 million for NIST, up $219.0 million from the request. The President's FY2018 request includes $600.0 million for R&D, a decrease of $90.0 million from FY2017. The House-passed bill includes $660.0 million for the STRS account. The House-passed bill for NIST includes $870.0 million in funding, a decrease of $84.0 million from FY2017. The Senate committee-reported bill includes $944.0 million for NIST, up $219.0 million from the request. Specific areas identified for NIST attention include disaster resiliency, textile research, football helmet safety, Internet of Things (IoT) security, cybersecurity, and nanostructured metals. The Senate committee also recommends support for cybersecurity, the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence, forensic sciences, metals-based additive manufacturing, regenerative medicine standards, and NIST's Urban Dome program. The Senate committee recommends support for the NIST Baldrige Performance Excellence program with $2.2 million in funding. The President's request for the ITS account for FY2018 is $21.0 million, a significant decrease from the previous year. This includes funding for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership program wind down and the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation. The NNMI funding includes support for the National Institute for Innovation in Manufacturing Biopharmaceuticals and NIST's coordination role in the network. The House-passed bill includes $110.0 million in funding for the ITS account, with $105.0 million for the MEP program and $5.0 million for the NNMI. The Senate committee-reported bill includes $145.0 million for the ITS account, rejecting the Administration's proposed elimination of the MEP program and funding it at $130.0 million. The Senate committee-reported bill funds the MEP program at $130.0 million, $25.0 million more than the House bill. It provides $15 million for the NNMI, $10 million below FY2017 level. The President requests $104.0 million for the NIST CRF account for FY2018. The House bill includes $100.0 million for the CRF account, while the Senate bill includes $104.0 million. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) conducts scientific research in various areas such as ecosystems, climate, global climate change, weather, and oceans. It was created in 1970 to unify environmental programs and protect the environment. NOAA's main challenge is connecting research programs to broader science needs. NOAA's Research Council developed a five-year plan to guide R&D efforts. NOAA's R&D plan for 2013-2017 aims to address gaps in knowledge and capabilities identified in their Next Generation Strategic Plan. The plan is organized into four long-term goals and three enterprise objectives. Key questions are used to frame R&D objectives and tasks. One main challenge is integrating diverse perspectives and expertise. The FY2018 R&D funding request for NOAA is $671.6 million, a decrease from the previous year. The funding breakdown includes $365.8 million for research, $64.2 million for development, and $241.6 million for R&D equipment. R&D funding in FY2017 was 14.9% of NOAA's total discretionary budget. The R&D plan emphasizes the need to understand the earth system holistically and integrate diverse perspectives and expertise. The President's request for R&D funding at NOAA is $671.6 million for FY2018, with $365.8 million allocated for research, $64.2 million for development, and $241.6 million for R&D equipment. NOAA's administrative structure includes five line offices and two major funding categories: Mission Support and the Office of Marine and Aviation Operations. OMAO is responsible for NOAA's ships and aircraft collecting data for environmental missions. Table 12 shows R&D funding levels for FY2017 and FY2018. R&D funding is part of overall budget items, making it hard to pinpoint exact allocations. OAR conducts most of NOAA's R&D activities, with a proposed $350.0 million for FY2018, a decrease from FY2017. OAR focuses on weather, climate, and oceans research. OAR conducts research in weather, air chemistry, climate, and oceans. Partnerships with NOAA and research institutes support these efforts. The President's FY2018 request for cooperative institutes is $150.5 million, a decrease from FY2017. The House-passed bill would fund laboratories and institutes with $169.2 million, while the Senate committee-reported bill proposes $171.0 million. The President's FY2018 request includes funding reductions for OAR R&D, specifically for the National Sea Grant Program and Climate Research. The National Sea Grant College Program, consisting of 33 university-based state programs, supports scientific research for coastal communities. The FY2018 request would terminate federal support for the National Sea Grant College Program and Sea Grant Marine Aquaculture Research. Funding levels for these programs in FY2017 were $63.0 million and $9.5 million respectively. The House-passed bill would fund the National Sea Grant Program at $63.0 million and marine aquaculture research at $7.0 million. The Senate committee-reported bill would fund the National Sea Grant Program at $65.0 million and marine aquaculture research at $11.5 million. Climate research funding levels vary between the President's FY2018 request, the House-passed bill, and the Senate committee-reported bill. The Senate committee-reported bill allocates $158 million for climate research, $30 million more than the House-passed bill and equal to the FY2017 enacted funding level. The President is proposing a $1.184 billion budget for VA R&D in FY2018, a decrease of $61.7 million from FY2017. VA R&D represents 1.4% of the agency's overall budget request and is funded through two accounts. The allocation of funding for R&D in appropriations legislation is uncertain unless provided at the exact request level. The FY2018 VA R&D budget proposal includes $640 million for Medical and Prosthetic Research, a decrease of $33.4 million, and $544 million for research supported by the Medical Care Support account, a decrease of $28.4 million. Priorities for FY2018 include suicide prevention, pain management, opioid addiction, Gulf War Veterans Illness research, and the Million Veteran Program for precision medicine. The VA Prosthetics R&D program, managed by the Veteran Health Administration's Office of Research and Development, conducts research at VA Medical Centers nationwide. The program aims to improve Veterans' health through various research services, including Biomedical Laboratory R&D, Clinical Science R&D, and Health Services R&D. These services focus on understanding life processes, testing new treatments, and promoting effective healthcare strategies. Rehabilitation R&D at VA focuses on improving the quality of life for disabled veterans with various impairments. VA researchers can seek funding from external sources, but VA itself cannot provide research grants to non-VA entities. The Senate Appropriations Committee and the House passed bills providing increased funding for VA's Medical and Prosthetic Research account in FY2018. Funding for research projects in designated areas important to veteran patients is detailed. The Department of the Interior (DOI) has a wide range of responsibilities including mapping, geological, hydrological, and biological science, wildlife conservation, and historic preservation. The Administration is requesting $11.7 billion in funding for DOI in FY2018, with $816.4 million requested for R&D, a decrease from the previous year. The President's FY2018 DOI R&D funding request includes 5.3% for basic research, 77.5% for applied research, and 17.1% for development. The U.S. Geological Survey conducts basic research within DOI. Funding for DOI R&D is typically included in appropriations line items with non-R&D activities, making it unclear how much is specifically allocated to R&D. R&D funding levels are determined after DOI components allocate their appropriations to specific activities. The Education, State and Foreign Operations, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, Defense, Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, Legislative Branch, and Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act, 2018 (H.R. 3354) would provide $11.9 billion for DOI, a $200 million increase over the FY2017 enacted amount. USGS accounts for over two-thirds of all DOI R&D funding, with funding allocated under seven activity/program areas. The President's FY2018 budget request for USGS is $922.2 million, with $560.9 million designated for R&D, a decrease from the FY2017 level. The FY2018 budget for DOI would provide $11.9 billion, a $200 million increase from FY2017. USGS, receiving over two-thirds of DOI R&D funding, would see a decrease in funding across various programs, including cuts to Ecosystems, Climate and Land Use Change, Energy, Minerals, and Environmental Health, Natural Hazards, Water Resources, Core Science Systems, and Science Support. Funding would be eliminated for certain programs deemed more appropriately funded by partners, while maintaining support for the development of the Landsat 9 satellite. The House passed H.R. 3354 with $1.039 billion for USGS, a $46 million decrease from FY2017. Funding includes $22.4 million for Landsat 9 satellite development and increases for ground systems. The President's FY2018 request includes R&D funding for various DOI components, with decreases for some and increases for others. In FY2018, research funding for DOI components decreased significantly compared to FY2017. BLM maintained $24.3 million, NPS decreased to $25.5 million, BSEE decreased to $24.5 million, BIA decreased to $5.0 million, WFM decreased to $3.0 million, and OSMRE did not request any R&D funding for FY2018. The Department of Transportation's research and development activities focus on improving mobility, reducing congestion, promoting safety, and preserving the environment. Funding for DOT R&D is often included in appropriations line items with non-R&D activities, making it unclear how much is allocated to R&D without precise funding levels. R&D funding levels are determined after DOT agencies allocate their appropriations to specific activities. The Administration is requesting $898.8 million for DOT R&D activities in FY2018, a decrease of $10.5 million from the previous year. Three DOT agencies would account for 87% of DOT R&D under the FY2018 request. House and Senate Appropriations Committees have reported out appropriations for DOT, FAA's R&D activities focus on improving national capacity and safety. The President's FY2018 request for FAA's R&D activities is $361.5 million, a decrease of $25 million from FY2017. The request includes $150 million for the agency's Research, Engineering, and Development (RE&D) account, with a focus on improving aircraft safety through research in various fields. The House committee print would provide $170 million for FAA's RE&D account, an increase of $20 million above the FY2018 request. The Senate Appropriations Committee's S. 1655 would allocate $179 million for FAA's RE&D account, a 1.4% increase from FY2017, $29 million above the FY2018 request, and $9 million above the House-reported level. The President's request for FHWA's R&D activities is $333 million, a 4.6% increase from FY2017, with a focus on improving highway transportation needs. The President is requesting $85.6 million in R&D and R&D facilities funding in FY2018 for NHTSA, focusing on automation, advanced vehicle safety technology, crashworthiness, and reducing unsafe driving behaviors. This includes $79 million for research on connected, integrated, and automated transportation systems. The President's FY2018 request includes DOT R&D funding for various agencies, with slight decreases or level funding compared to FY2017 enacted levels. The Department of Homeland Security has identified five core missions. The Department of Homeland Security has five core missions: prevent terrorism, secure borders, enforce immigration laws, safeguard cyberspace, and ensure resilience to disasters. The Directorate of Science and Technology (S&T) is responsible for coordinating DHS R&D activities, with a budget of $570 million in FY2018, a 16.0% reduction from FY2017. Other components like the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) and U.S. Coast Guard also conduct R&D related to their specific missions. The House committee recommendation for DHS R&D funding is $580 million, including $11 million more than the request for the S&T Directorate. The S&T Directorate is the primary DHS R&D organization, led by a Senate-confirmed Under Secretary for Science and Technology. The Administration's FY2018 request for the S&T Directorate R&D account is $373 million, a decrease of 20.8% from FY2017. The House bill would provide $11 million more than the requested amount for Research, Development, and Innovation and University Programs to ensure S&T's ability to maintain 10 Centers of Excellence. DNDO is responsible for nuclear detection research, development, testing, evaluation, acquisition, and operational support, as well as coordinating federal nuclear forensics programs and the U.S. portion of the global nuclear detection architecture. The Obama Administration's FY2017 budget proposed to incorporate DNDO and other activities into a new CBRNE Office. The FY2018 budget does not repeat this proposal. The FY2018 request for DNDO includes $144 million for R&D, a 7.0% decrease from FY2017. The House bill would provide the requested amount. The EPA funds R&D activities for environmental pollution control laws. Congress has funded EPA through the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations act since FY2006. The EPA receives funding for its R&D activities through appropriations bills, with the Science and Technology (S&T) account being a major source for scientific research. This account funds R&D conducted by the EPA and other entities receiving grants. The EPA's Office of Research and Development (ORD) manages R&D activities funded by the Science and Technology (S&T) account, including research on cleaning up contaminated sites. The House passed the Make America Secure and Prosperous Appropriations Act, 2018 (H.R. 3354) encompassing all 12 appropriations bills for FY2018. The House expanded H.R. 3354 to serve as an omnibus bill for FY2018, including funding for EPA. The Senate draft proposed $7.91 billion for EPA, higher than the President's request but less than FY2017 appropriations. The House-passed bill, Senate draft, and President's request for the FY2018 EPA appropriations included rescinding unobligated balances from prior years in varying amounts. P.L. 115-31 rescinded $90.3 million in FY2017. The House and Senate specified proportions for allocation from EPA's S&T, EPM, and STAG accounts, while the President's request only proposed a total rescission amount without specifying allocations. Additionally, the House and Senate proposed increasing the S&T base appropriations by $15.5 million transferred from the Superfund account. The House and Senate proposed increasing the S&T base appropriations by $15.5 million transferred from the Superfund account, the same as in FY2017. The total proposed for the S&T account in the House-passed bill would be $104.3 million less than FY2017 enacted appropriations. This amount is a $176.2 million increase above the President's FY2018 budget request. The Senate draft proposed a total of $676.5 million for the S&T account, which is $52.8 million more than the House-passed bill. The Senate draft proposed a $52.8 million decrease below the FY2017 enacted level but a $213.3 million increase above the FY2018 request for the S&T account at EPA. Concerns were raised during budget hearings about proposed reductions in funding for scientific research programs. The FY2018 budget request aimed to reduce funding for nine of the ten EPA appropriations accounts, including the S&T account. The FY2018 budget proposed reductions in funding for ten EPA appropriations accounts, including the S&T account. A comparison of appropriations levels for the S&T account in House-passed H.R. 3354, the Senate draft, and the President's FY2018 budget request is presented. Information for direct comparisons with all S&T program areas and activities is not readily available. The President's FY2018 budget request modified program area titles and funding comparisons for EPA appropriations accounts. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees adopted the changes, with proposed funding for S&T account being less than or the same as FY2017 appropriations. The House and Senate draft propose $79.3 million for Operations and Administration, a $11.0 million increase from FY2017. The increase would support a new activity called \"Workforce Reshaping\" for agency-wide restructuring and reallocation of resources, including retirement incentives and relocation costs. Funding decreases are seen in the S&T account for \"Research: Chemical Safety and Sustainability\" and \"Research: Sustainable and Healthy.\" The proposed reductions in funding for \"Research: Chemical Safety and Sustainability\", \"Research: Sustainable and Healthy Communities\", and \"Clean Air\" would be no more than 15% below the FY2017 enacted levels. The reductions are not as significant as those proposed in the FY2018 budget request, with the largest decrease in funding for Research: Sustainable and Healthy Communities. This reduction is primarily due to the elimination of funding for the Science to Achieve Results (STAR) program and streamlining of research activities. The House-passed bill and Senate draft would maintain funding for the STAR program, with proposed reductions in other activities within the program being less than those in the FY2018 request. Both the House-passed H.R. 3354 and Senate draft allocate $4.1 million for \"Research: National Priorities\" in the S&T account for FY2018, the same as enacted for FY2017. These funds would support high-priority water quality and availability research through competitively awarded grants to not-for-profit organizations, independent of the STAR grant program. The President's FY2018 budget request did not include funding for \"Congressional Priorities\" in the S&T or other EPA appropriations accounts. The House-passed H.R. 3354 and Senate draft include provisions restricting EPA's use of FY2018 funds for regulatory actions. Contact information for CRS experts on R&D funding is provided in the report."
