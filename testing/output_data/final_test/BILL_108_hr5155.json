The US grants pharmaceutical companies a monopoly through patent protection, leading to higher drug prices compared to other developed countries. Additionally, the number and quality of new pharmaceuticals are decreasing. The FDA reports that over 70% of new drugs approved in the last decade do not offer significant improvements over existing treatments. Drug research quality has been compromised by pharmaceutical manufacturers, leading to distorted findings, bias, conflicts of interest, and secrecy. Establishment of National Institute for Biomedical Research and Development under Part C of the Public Health Service Act to address issues in drug research quality. The National Institute for Biomedical Research and Development aims to develop drugs, biological products, and devices to increase their medical efficacy and availability at reasonable prices. The Director monitors research results to identify discoveries suitable for further development and approval by the FDA. The National Institute for Biomedical Research and Development focuses on developing drugs, biological products, and devices for human use. The Director conducts research, training, and other activities to identify candidate discoveries and carry out research and development. Financial assistance is awarded for research in this area. The Director of the National Institute for Biomedical Research and Development prioritizes candidate discoveries and maintains an Internet site for public information on research activities. The Director prioritizes candidate discoveries and maintains an Internet site for public information on research activities, including raw data, findings, and patents. Any person can file a civil action in a US district court to protect Federal ownership of patents on candidate discoveries or against the Secretary for failing to protect such patents. The court can enforce compliance with Federal ownership provisions in these cases. A civil action can be filed in a US district court to protect Federal ownership of patents or to order the Secretary to perform a duty related to such ownership. Limitations include providing notice to the Secretary before filing a civil action and not being able to file if the Secretary is already prosecuting a civil action to protect the patent. In a civil action under subparagraph (A), the Secretary may intervene as a matter of right and the district court may award costs of litigation to any party. The court may also require the filing of a bond or equivalent security. This paragraph does not restrict any rights of a person or class of persons. The paragraph discusses the restrictions on seeking enforcement of provisions related to Federal ownership of patents on candidate discoveries, as well as the application process for approval by the Food and Drug Administration. The Director of the Institute can grant a nonexclusive license to a private entity for commercial marketing of a discovery. If the application is approved by the FDA, the Director will seek to provide nonexclusive licenses for commercial marketing of the discovery. The Director of the Institute can establish 10 laboratories within the National Institutes of Health, headed by an Associate Director, to be equitably distributed among various regions of the United States. The Director of the Institute can establish 10 laboratories within the National Institutes of Health, to be equitably distributed among various regions of the United States. Every ten years, a comprehensive review of the laboratory's performance will be conducted, with the possibility of termination and transfer of duties, funds, and assets to remaining laboratories. The Director of the Institute can establish laboratories within the National Institutes of Health, conduct reviews every ten years, and provide cash awards for significant advances in research and development activities related to diseases. Definitions for biological products, drugs, and devices are also provided. The Director of the Institute can allocate funds for research and development activities related to diseases, with specific amounts authorized for fiscal years 2004 to 2008. Additionally, a portion of the funds will be reserved for rewards for significant advances in research."
