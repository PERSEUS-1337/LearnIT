    "content": "Since the breakdown of the Six-Party Talks in December 2008, North Korea has engaged in provocative acts challenging the Obama Administration and the international community. This included launching a long-range ballistic missile in April 2009, leading to UN condemnation. North Korea then announced its withdrawal from the talks, restarted nuclear facilities, and conducted an underground nuclear test in May 2009. On May 25, 2009, North Korea conducted an underground nuclear explosion, leading to UNSC Resolution 1874 on June 12 imposing sanctions on North Korea's arms sales and financial transactions related to its weapons programs. The resolution aims to curb financial benefits to North Korea's regime and weapons program, with limited economic impact unless China cooperates extensively. The Obama Administration formed an interagency team led by Philip S. Goldberg to coordinate sanctions efforts against North Korea in response to UNSC Resolution 1874. Ambassador Goldberg also took over as Assistant Secretary of the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR) while continuing his role as Coordinator for Implementation of the resolution. Resolution 1874 condemns North Korea's nuclear test and demands a halt to further tests and ballistic missile activities. It calls for the abandonment of nuclear weapons, a return to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, and imposes sanctions on arms transfers and economic measures. Resolution 1874 condemns North Korea's nuclear test, demands a halt to further tests and ballistic missile activities, and imposes sanctions on arms transfers and economic measures. The resolution calls on states to refrain from providing assistance that could aid North Korea's proliferation efforts and to deny financial services that could support prohibited programs. Specific guidelines for inspecting and interdicting ships transporting banned materials are included in the resolution. Resolution 1874 outlines guidelines for inspecting and interdicting ships carrying banned materials, calling on all states to inspect cargo to and from North Korea in their territory. The resolution does not authorize the use of force without the flag state's consent but allows for the seizure of prohibited items. If a suspect ship is on the high seas, member states are urged to request the right to board and inspect, with the flag state obligated to direct the vessel to port for inspection if refused. The resolution authorizes the seizure of banned items and prohibits bunkering services for ships with suspected cargo. North Korea reportedly ships goods under its own flag using small vessels that would need refueling. The sanctions committee designated three North Korean companies in April 2009 and additional entities in July 2009. No further designations have been made since then. Resolution 1874 established reporting mechanisms for the implementation of sanctions on North Korea, including an arms embargo and financial measures. The Sanctions Committee and Panel of Experts were tasked with evaluating compliance and noncompliance cases. The U.N. Secretary-General was to establish a Panel of Experts to analyze reports and make recommendations for implementing Resolutions 1874 and 1718. Resolution 1874 established reporting mechanisms for sanctions on North Korea, including an arms embargo and financial measures. A panel of experts was appointed to gather information and make recommendations for improved implementation. The panel is investigating seized shipments and noncompliance cases, providing interim reports to the Security Council. The panel of experts appointed to enforce sanctions on North Korea reported in November 2009 that the sanctions had impacted North Korea's trading activity. However, they also found that North Korea was actively evading the sanctions through various methods such as using intermediaries and false manifests. Multiple cases of noncompliance with UNSC Resolution 1874 were reported in 2009, including the seizure of luxury items bound for North Korea and a shipment of conventional weapons by ANL Australia. In 2009, multiple cases of noncompliance with UNSC Resolution 1874 were reported, including the seizure of weapons bound for North Korea in the UAE, South Korea, Thailand, and South Africa. The Obama Administration faced decisions on enforcing the resolution and applying new sanctions against North Korea. The Obama Administration is focusing on enforcing the ban on WMD-related North Korean financial transactions and considering reinstating North Korea on the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism. Pressure may be applied to China if they do not enforce Security Council sanctions. Estimates suggest North Korea could lose billions if sanctions are enforced. The enforcement of sanctions on North Korea could result in significant financial losses, with estimates ranging from $2 billion to $4 billion. Resolution 1874 calls on U.N. members to take enforcement steps, particularly targeting North Korea's state trading companies that facilitate the transfer of WMD and technology. To effectively enforce sanctions, key countries must act forcefully and interpret the resolution's language liberally, including freezing bank accounts used for these transactions. Governments and banks in various countries may need to freeze bank accounts of trading companies involved in legitimate commerce and money laundering activities related to North Korea's smuggling of counterfeit products. Resolution 1874 requires a liberal interpretation to apply financial sanctions, with the Obama Administration urging other governments to do the same. Ambassador Philip Goldberg and Under Secretary of the Treasury Stuart Levey visited China and Malaysia in July 2009 to coordinate sanctions. Ambassador Goldberg and his delegation visited China, Malaysia, South Korea, Japan, Thailand, and Singapore to coordinate sanctions against North Korea. They emphasized the need to restrict activities of North Korean trading companies and urged compliance with Resolution 1874 provisions. The U.N. Security Council's sanctions committee designated three North Korean companies in April 2009. Japan and the United States are emphasizing the denial of financial services to North Korea, especially access to foreign banks by North Korean trading companies. The U.N. Security Council sanctions committee designated three North Korean trading companies, an Iran-based company, and North Korea's General Bureau of Atomic Energy for sanctions in July 2009. The U.S. Treasury Department had previously imposed sanctions on one of the North Korean trading companies, Namchongang Trading Corporation, and the Iran-based Hong Kong Electronics. In late June 2009, officials disclosed that the Department was targeting 17 North Korean trading companies and banks for U.S. and international sanctions. The UNSCR Panel of Experts discussed North Korea's use of trading companies, such as the Korea Mining Development Trading Corp. The Resolution 1874 provisions allow the U.S. and allies to access North Korean ships to shut down WMD-related ship traffic, contingent on cooperation from other countries. China, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, India, and Pakistan play crucial roles in enforcing sanctions on North Korean ships, especially in the Pacific and Indian Ocean regions. The U.S. Navy shadowed the North Korean ship Kang Nam as it traveled south from North Korea. The Kang Nam was shadowed by the U.S. Navy as it headed south from North Korea towards the South China Sea. South Korean officials believed it was bound for Burma with arms, but it turned back before reaching international waters. In late July, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stated that Burma pledged to abide by U.N. sanctions on North Korea. Several intercepted shipments of North Korean weapons bound for Iran were believed to be intended for Hezbollah. Israeli intelligence officials and non-government experts intercepted shipments bound for Hezbollah and Hamas, containing North Korean components for rockets. The Iranian Revolutionary Guards supplied these rockets to the terrorist groups. Additionally, South Africa seized tank components destined for the Republic of Congo, originating from North Korea. Resolution 1874 is vague on implementing air cargo provisions, but experts suggest North Korea uses air traffic for transferring WMDs. Inspections of North Korea's air cargo focus on traffic between North Korea and Iran, known for collaboration in ballistic missile development. North Korea earns $1.5 billion annually from missile sales, with a significant portion coming from collaboration with Iran through the Pyongyang-Tehran air route. North Korea and Iran utilize the Pyongyang-Tehran air route for transferring missiles and weapons of mass destruction technology. Chinese airspace is used for aircraft, which refuel at Chinese airports. Resolution 1874 lacks specific procedures for inspecting North Korea-related air cargo. China is responsible for searching aircraft on the Pyongyang-Tehran route. The Obama Administration raised air traffic concerns with Chinese officials in 2009. Chinese officials have not publicly responded to air traffic issues involving North Korea and Iran. The seizure of a North Korean arms-filled aircraft in Bangkok in 2009 highlighted the lack of Chinese cooperation in intercepting North Korea-Iran air traffic. The aircraft flew through Chinese airspace without being directed to land for inspection. Additionally, a Chinese ship transported North Korean arms seized in Dubai without Chinese intervention. The Ilyushin aircraft, originating from Dalian, China, was intercepted in Shanghai with weapons bound for Iran, including rocket launchers, rockets, and missiles likely intended for Hezbollah. The interception likely resulted in North Korea losing tens of millions of dollars in income. Resolution 1874 reaffirmed the ban on luxury goods exports to North Korea, which are favored by the elite supporting the Kim Jong-il regime. Chinese traders report high demand for luxury goods from North Korea, with exports estimated between $100 million and $160 million in 2008. Most of China's exports to North Korea are financed through trade credits, making them largely cost-free to the North Korean government. This sanction may not be effectively enforced. The DPRK economy is divided into two parts - one controlled by the military and elite, with industrial capacity and priority for resources, and the other consisting of agriculture, services, and light manufacturing. The economy is isolated and struggling, with a significant portion of the population facing starvation. The DPRK is facing a severe food crisis, with a large portion of its population in need of outside aid. The economy is struggling due to outdated equipment, lack of raw materials, and unreliable electricity. Despite economic challenges, the military and ruling elite have enough resources to continue their nuclear and missile programs. North Korea's nuclear and missile programs are being funded at the expense of essential food imports for its population. The regime prioritizes military advancements over providing for its people, leading to a \"guns and butter\" dilemma where resources are diverted from basic necessities to military endeavors. The additional sanctions in U.N. Resolution 1874 target outside resources flowing into North Korea associated with prohibited activities, creating a humanitarian disaster. Despite past instances of international aid during crises caused by Pyongyang's policies, the Western world may not provide assistance this time. The Western world's reluctance to provide aid to North Korea due to \"aid fatigue,\" global financial crisis effects, and negative responses to Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions could lead to a decrease in essential food and fuel inflows for the population on the brink of starvation. In 2007, North Korea received $97.6 million in official development assistance, with $32.5 million from major aid donors. In 2007, North Korea received $97.6 million in official development assistance from major aid donors, including the United States, European Community, Germany, France, Australia, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Nations. However, U.S. assistance has now stopped, and the European Community has limited its funds to humanitarian aid and food security assistance. The United Nations World Food Programme has scaled back its humanitarian food assistance for North Korea, with operations at only 15% of planned levels in March 2009. In 2008, South Korea provided $54.1 million in humanitarian aid to North Korea, mostly through non-governmental organizations. The North Korean economy grew by 3.7% in 2008, with agricultural output increasing by 8.2% due to better weather. However, the country still faces challenges in feeding its people due to declines in humanitarian aid and previous years of negative economic growth. The agricultural sector in the DPRK has somewhat recovered, but basic nutrition adequacy remains questionable for millions. U.N. Resolution 1874 prohibits member states from providing financial support for trade with the DPRK that could contribute to its nuclear or missile programs. In 2008, China exported $2.0 billion in goods to the DPRK, with only a small portion potentially linked to prohibited activities. Dual-use item exports like food, fuel, machinery, and electronics are hard to trace for compliance with sanctions. The $100 million to $160 million in Chinese exports of \"luxury\" goods to North Korea may be crucial for maintaining elite loyalty to the regime and military policies related to nuclear and missile programs. China's financial support for trade with DPRK is largely facilitated through trade credits from Beijing. Financing specific inputs for North Korea's nuclear and missile programs with Chinese trade credits seems unlikely, especially after U.N. Resolution 1874. Without cooperation from Chinese officials, attempting to identify Chinese trade finance supporting exports of prohibited items would be nearly futile. The $1.3 billion deficit in the DPRK's trade with China in 2008 was likely financed by long-term credits or loans from Beijing, along with other sources such as rising Chinese foreign direct investment, DPRK export earnings, illicit activities, or foreign exchange from the Kaesong Industrial Complex. North Korea also had an $83 million trade deficit with Russia in 2008. North Korea's trade deficit with Russia was $83 million in 2008. The DPRK is not eligible for trade finance from international financial institutions like the World Bank or Asian Development Bank. Industrialized nations did not provide bank credits for trade to North Korea from 2005-2007. Non-bank trade credits totaled $6 million in 2005, $110 million in 2006, and $17 million in 2007. Western commercial banks' loans to DPRK were relatively small, with consolidated claims totaling $2.0 billion in December 2008. Settlements totaled $2.0 billion, down from a peak of $4.2 billion in June 2008. Reporting banks with claims on North Korean entities were from Europe, mainly France. The impact of U.N. sanctions on lending activity to North Korea is uncertain, with an upper limit of around $2 billion from Western nations. Financial sanctions solely targeting prohibited activities may not have a significant monetary effect, as the total amounts are not large. The impact of financial sanctions on North Korea's nuclear or missile activities is minimal. The 2005 Banco Delta Asia sanctions demonstrated that financial institutions tend to close North Korean accounts when faced with choosing between the US and DPRK. Even small amounts like $25 million are crucial to Pyongyang. A strategy similar to BDA sanctions could warn institutions that any prohibited financial activity related to UN sanctions could lead to scrutiny and possible sanctions. This could result in institutions terminating all transactions with North Korea due to difficulty in distinguishing between legitimate and prohibited transactions. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) issued an advisory for U.S. financial institutions to take risk mitigation measures against deceptive financial practices by North Korea. They advised enhanced scrutiny on correspondent accounts and avoiding providing financial services for North Korea's luxury goods procurement. FinCEN supplied a list of North Korean banks to assist in applying enhanced scrutiny. The U.N. sanctions ban exports of North Korean arms, including small arms and light weapons. Recent purchases of small arms from DPRK by Brazil, United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia, and Mexico are relatively insignificant. The small arms export ban may not heavily impact DPRK's economy but could affect military-owned factories' ability to acquire raw materials and technology. Between one-half and three-quarters of the DPRK's imports and exports are with China, with the majority of China's imports from North Korea consisting of non-prohibited items like ores, coal, iron/steel, apparel, fish, and minerals. China's major exports to North Korea include mineral fuels, machinery, electrical machinery, apparel, plastic, vehicles, man-made filaments, and cereals. China's exports to North Korea include electrical machinery, knit apparel, plastic, vehicles, man-made filaments, and cereals. These exports are crucial for the North Korean economy. China also exports petroleum to North Korea and has imposed sanctions by reducing crude oil shipments after the DPRK's nuclear test. Additionally, China tightened inspections of weapons-related exports and cancelled a joint venture for producing vanadium. China intercepted a shipment of 70 kg of vanadium hidden in a truckload of fruit crossing the border into North Korea. The U.N. sanctions on North Korea include exports of luxury goods, but Chinese exports of luxury goods to North Korea have shown little change following the resolutions. Pyongyang tends to go on a buying spree in China in December, with surges in imports of luxury items in 2006 and 2008. In 2008, North Korea imported various items totaling $50.4 million, including articles of leather, fur, crustaceans, shellfish, exercise equipment, and motor vehicles. There was a spike in luxury goods purchases in December 2009, followed by a decline in January 2010 and a slight recovery in February. The economic impact of Resolution 1874 on North Korea is uncertain, depending on China's cooperation and the effectiveness of financial sanctions. President Obama mentioned North Korea's track record at a press conference on June 16. President Obama stated at a press conference on June 16 that North Korea's history of proliferation makes it unacceptable for them to be recognized as a nuclear power. DNI Admiral Dennis Blair testified that North Korea has sold ballistic missiles to Middle Eastern countries like Iran and assisted Syria in building a nuclear reactor. North Korea not only exports missile technology but also collaborates with Iran in missile development. Resolution 1874 aims to prevent North Korea from spreading its weapons of mass destruction and missile technologies to other countries. The measures authorized under Resolution 1874 aim to halt the supply of North Korea's nuclear programs by sanctioning relevant entities, sharing sensitive information, and stopping suspicious shipments. While some analysts doubt the effectiveness in preventing proliferation of nuclear material, others believe that implementation of the resolution could discourage North Korea from shipping or procuring sensitive goods. Increased monitoring and sharing of information about North Koreans' activities abroad may also improve U.S. intelligence related to WMD programs. The Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) has facilitated international cooperation on WMD interdiction issues. Increased international vigilance, stopping of shipments, and financial pressures may limit North Korea's nuclear programs and proliferation activities. China's willingness to curb traffic is crucial in this regard. The impact of sanctions on North Korea's domestic situation is difficult to gauge precisely. Recent behavior suggests North Korea is determined to be a nuclear state, even at the cost of angering allies. Financial sanctions target the country's elite and military enterprises, but the regime has shown resilience in maintaining power despite past sanctions. Despite past sanctions, North Korea's regime has remained in power by keeping its elite circle satisfied with limited resources. Some believe effective sanctions could impact internal power struggles as elites compete for resources. The 2005 sanctions on Banco Delta Asia seemed to target the regime, leading to North Korea's return to nuclear negotiations. However, others argue that such sanctions may only strengthen hardliners' resolve, especially considering the reported contemplation of a power transfer in Pyongyang following Kim Jong-il's stroke in August. Kim Jong-il's reported stroke in August 2008 raised concerns about succession in North Korea. Despite provocative behavior during his illness, Kim has regained power and is overseeing the anticipated succession to his son Kim Jong Eun. The regime is strengthening the National Defense Commission and making constitutional adjustments, indicating a transition to a new leader. Decision-making in Pyongyang remains opaque, with uncertainties about how elites may consider Beijing's reaction. In the past, North Korean elites relied on China for survival, but recent provocations may have strained relations. China's enforcement of sanctions could increase, but some analysts believe China may be hesitant to pressure North Korea due to internal power struggles. UNSC Resolution 1874 builds on previous restrictions from Resolution 1718, passed after North Korea's first nuclear test in 2006. Resolution 1718 was passed to curb financial inflows to North Korea's regime and weapons programs, leading to the regime's return to Six-Party Talks. Despite being considered ineffective in penalizing North Korea economically, the swift passage and unanimous support of the resolution may have influenced the regime's decision. The sanctions regime under Resolution 1718 had weak transparency, no military enforcement options, and no defined list of prohibited products. China and South Korea did not rigorously implement the resolution, with both countries accounting for a significant portion of DPRK trade. China's exports to North Korea even increased after 2006, indicating lax enforcement. Exports from China to North Korea increased after 2006, with a 13% rise in 2007 and a 41% increase in 2008. Despite sanctions, Chinese enterprises continued normal trade with North Korean counterparts. Most sanctioned North Korean trading companies and banks operated in China in 2009. South Korea reduced humanitarian aid to North Korea after a test, but overall trade between the Koreas increased by 33% after Resolution 1718. Trade between North and South Korea increased by 33% after Resolution 1718, mainly due to the expansion of the Kaesong Industrial Complex in North Korea. The complex generates millions of dollars for the North Korean government through rental fees and workers' wages."
