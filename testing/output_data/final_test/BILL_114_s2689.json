    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Reliable and Effective Growth for Regenerative Health Options that Improve Wellness\" or the \"REGROW Act.\" It clarifies that existing pathways to market for cellular therapies under FDA regulations are not restricted or modified. Additionally, a new section 351B is added to the Public Health Service Act for approval of cellular therapies. The REGROW Act establishes a program for conditional approval of cellular therapeutic products based on safety and preliminary evidence of effectiveness without phase III investigations. Conditionally approved products must meet certain requirements for a 5-year period, including being manufactured and used in compliance with regulations. The REGROW Act allows for conditional approval of cellular therapeutic products if they meet specific criteria, including being minimally manipulated, produced for a specific indication, and used to achieve a similar function in the recipient as in the donor. The sponsor must also submit safety and effectiveness data within 5 years of approval. The REGROW Act allows for conditional approval of cellular therapeutic products under specific criteria. The sponsor must submit an application for approval demonstrating potency, purity, safety, and efficacy. Continued use may be permitted until the Secretary completes the review. Annual reports and adverse event reports must be submitted during the conditional approval period. The REGROW Act allows for conditional approval of cellular therapeutic products under specific criteria. The sponsor must submit an application demonstrating potency, purity, safety, and efficacy. The individual administering the product must inform users that it has been conditionally approved without proof of efficacy. Stem cell banking requirements are also outlined for eligibility to provide cells for approved uses. The REGROW Act amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to include clearance and approval processes for cellular therapeutics. It introduces new classification criteria for cellular therapeutics under section 515B. The REGROW Act introduces new classification criteria for cellular therapeutics under section 515B, focusing on in vitro performance testing for device clearance based on the Public Health Service Act. The classification regulation does not mandate clearance for specific cell types unless unique to the device's intended use. If no predicate exists or a class III device is low risk, the Secretary may justify a lower classification. The REGROW Act introduces new classification criteria for cellular therapeutics under section 515B, focusing on in vitro performance testing for device clearance. If a class III device is low risk, the Secretary may justify a lower classification for review and marketing. Additionally, cellular components fall under the jurisdiction of the agency center for premarket review of biological products. SEC. 4. GUIDANCE; AMENDED REGULATIONS. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may issue draft guidance on cellular therapeutics and devices within a year of this Act. Final guidance must be issued within 180 days after the comment period. If necessary, regulations under title 21 may be amended. The Secretary must amend regulations under title 21 to clarify section 351B of the Public Health Service Act within 1 year of enactment. The process includes issuing proposed regulations, allowing a 60-day comment period, and publishing final regulations at least 30 days before they take effect. Public meetings are required for implementing the Act and related amendments. The Secretary must hold a public meeting within 90 days to discuss regulatory policies on cell and tissue products, aiming to promote innovation and regulatory certainty in the development of regenerative medicine products. The Secretary will collaborate with stakeholders to establish standards for regenerative medicine products, promoting regulatory predictability in manufacturing processes."
