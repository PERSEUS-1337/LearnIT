    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Sensible Accounting to Value Energy Act of 2011\" and includes definitions for key terms. The \"Sensible Accounting to Value Energy Act of 2011\" defines key terms including \"covered agency\" as an executive agency or any other federal agency, \"covered loan\" as a loan secured by a home issued by a covered agency, and \"homeowner\" as the mortgagor under a covered loan. The term \"mortgagee\" under a covered loan includes the original lender, affiliates, servicers, and subsequent purchasers. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. The term \"servicer\" refers to the person or entity responsible for servicing the loan. The term \"servicer\" refers to the person or entity responsible for servicing a covered loan, as defined in the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974. SEC. 3. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. Congress finds that energy costs for homeowners are a significant part of their budgets, varying based on house size and efficiency. The current loan affordability test does not consider expected energy costs, impacting the value of the house. The Act aims to enhance mortgage underwriting accuracy. The Act aims to improve mortgage underwriting accuracy by including energy costs in the process, reducing energy consumption, and creating energy efficiency jobs. Covered agencies must consider energy utility costs as a regular expense in loan affordability tests and include energy savings in the loan-to-value metric to reflect the value buyers place on energy efficiency. The Act aims to include energy costs in mortgage underwriting to improve accuracy, reduce energy consumption, and create energy efficiency jobs. Covered agencies must consider energy utility costs in loan affordability tests and adjust debt amounts for inclusion of expected energy costs. The Act includes enhanced energy efficiency underwriting criteria to consider energy utility costs in loan affordability tests and adjust debt amounts for expected energy costs. The Secretary will develop guidelines for covered agencies to implement enhanced loan eligibility requirements that consider energy costs for loan applicants. This includes factoring in expected energy costs when assessing the applicant's ability to repay the loan. The Secretary will develop guidelines for covered agencies to implement enhanced loan eligibility requirements that consider energy costs for loan applicants. This includes factoring in expected energy costs such as electricity, natural gas, oil, and other fuel when assessing the applicant's ability to repay the loan. Regulations will include instructions for calculating estimated energy costs if no energy efficiency report is provided. The mortgagee will determine estimated energy costs for the property based on size and average per square foot energy cost for properties in the region. The Residential Energy Consumption Survey may be used for this purpose. If an energy efficiency report is provided, its findings will be considered by the mortgagee. The mortgagee will use an energy efficiency report to estimate the energy costs of the property, incorporating additional sources of information as determined by the Secretary. The report must estimate specific energy costs for the property and be prepared according to rules and regulations. The energy efficiency report for the property must be prepared according to rules and guidelines set by the Secretary, using the Residential Energy Service Network's Home Energy Rating System (HERS) by a certified individual. Alternative methods approved by the Secretary, in consultation with other stakeholders, may also be used. The energy efficiency report required for a property must undergo a third-party quality assurance procedure. Mortgagees must disclose expected energy costs to loan applicants as estimated in the report and include the report in loan documentation for borrowers. Covered agencies are prohibited from modifying underwriting criteria to negate the requirements or benefits. The enhanced loan eligibility requirements under this section must not impose additional costs or penalties on covered loans using energy efficiency reports. Covered agencies must implement these requirements within 3 years of the Act's enactment, applying to all covered loans for home sales or refinancing. The enhanced loan eligibility requirements must be met for any loan used for home sales, available on qualifying residential real property, and provide guidance for underwriting methods. SEC. 5. ENHANCED ENERGY EFFICIENCY UNDERWRITING VALUATION GUIDELINES. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, in consultation with the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, will develop guidelines for determining maximum loan amounts based on property value for loans on properties with energy efficiency reports. Additionally, regulations will be issued for estimating energy savings on such properties. The guidelines will include requirements for enhanced energy efficiency underwriting valuation. Valuation guidelines under subsection (a) require using energy efficiency reports to determine estimated energy savings of the property. The savings should be added to the appraised value for loan-to-value ratio unless the appraisal already includes energy efficiency value. Regulations will be established by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development for this purpose. The estimated energy savings are determined by calculating the difference in energy costs between the average comparable house and the subject property, using the energy efficiency report. The savings period is based on the equipment's estimated life, and the present value of future savings is discounted using the average interest rate on 30-year mortgages. Guidelines will be issued by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to ensure consideration of energy-efficient features. State-certified appraisers must have timely access to relevant information from lenders for appraising energy and water efficiency improvements in properties. This includes labels, ratings, blueprints, construction costs, incentives, and third-party verifications. State-certified appraisers need access to financial information for appraising energy and water efficiency improvements in properties, following privacy regulations. State-certified appraisers need access to financial information for appraising energy and water efficiency improvements in properties, following privacy regulations. The guidelines issued under subsection (a) include limitations to protect against under or over valuation of energy savings or duplicative counting of energy efficiency features in property valuation for loan amounts. The Secretary may modify or apply additional protections after a 7-year period following program implementation. The Secretary may modify or add exceptions to the appraisal approach to ensure accurate market value. Covered agencies must implement guidelines within 3 years for covered loans on residential properties. SEC. 6. MONITORING.\n\nEach covered agency must issue an annual report on the number of covered loans using enhanced eligibility requirements and energy efficiency appraisal guidelines, including default and foreclosure rates.\n\nSEC. 7. RULEMAKING. The Secretary will establish regulations in consultation with the Secretary of Energy and stakeholders, including State energy offices, to implement the Act effectively and prevent circumvention. Additionally, there will be an additional study conducted. The Secretary will establish an advisory group within 18 months to advise on enhanced energy efficiency underwriting criteria. Recommendations may include factors like transportation and water costs. Legislative recommendations will be forwarded to Congress for consideration."
