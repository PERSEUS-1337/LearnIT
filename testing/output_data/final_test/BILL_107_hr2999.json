    "content": "The \"First Things First Act\" is the short title of this legislation, with the purpose outlined in Section 2. The \"First Things First Act\" aims to delay certain amendments to the Internal Revenue Code until critical national priorities are achieved, including aid for 9/11 victims, securing Social Security and Medicare funds, providing prescription drug benefits to Medicare beneficiaries, funding school modernization, and reducing worst-case housing needs for US citizens since 2001. SEC. 3. MODIFICATION OF THE HIGHEST MARGINAL INCOME TAX RATES. Amendment to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 regarding reductions in rates after June 30, 2001. The highest marginal income tax rates were modified for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2000. The corresponding percentages for different taxable years were adjusted, with the highest rate being 39.6% for years starting in 2001 and beyond. The repeal of certain sections of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 eliminates the phaseout of overall limitation on itemized deductions, termination of personal exemptions, estate and generation-skipping transfer taxes, and step-up in basis at death. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 will be applied as if these sections had never been enacted. SEC. 6 increases the estate tax deduction for family-owned business interest from $675,000 to $4,000,000. The effective date for this amendment is for estates of decedents dying after the enactment of the Act.
