Exceptions are allowed for unfair trade practices and sudden surges of fairly traded goods. U.S. trade remedy laws include antidumping duties, countervailing duties, and safeguards enforced by the ITA and USITC. Antidumping laws provide relief to domestic industries from imports sold in the U.S. market at unfair prices. Dumping occurs when goods are exported for less than their domestic price. The Antidumping Agreement defines dumping as selling products at less than their normal value in another country. Dumping is the sale of goods abroad for less than the price they would have commanded in the home market. Economists have long written about this practice, dating back to Adam Smith in 1776. Alexander Hamilton also expressed concern about the potential negative impact of dumping on domestic development. Dumping, the sale of goods abroad below domestic market prices, became a common economic strategy as more countries industrialized in the late-nineteenth century. This practice drew scholarly and political attention, with some officials encouraging manufacturers to sacrifice profits to secure trade in foreign markets. The U.S. Department of Commerce and Labor continued to advise manufacturers on this strategy, leading to the reemergence of state-directed trade. The reemergence of state-directed trade policies in the late-nineteenth century led to accusations of unfair dumping practices, where surplus goods were sold abroad at lower prices. British and Canadian industries protested dumping from German, French, and American manufacturers. Despite challenges in calculating the prevalence of dumping, experts agree that there was a modest increase in the practice due to various factors. During the late-nineteenth century, state-directed trade policies led to accusations of unfair dumping practices, with surplus goods sold abroad at lower prices. Various factors contributed to the increase in dumping, including higher tariffs and changes in domestic demand. Countries began taking action to prevent dumping, with Canada enacting the world's first modern antidumping law in 1904, followed by other industrialized nations. The United States, Britain, and other countries enacted antidumping statutes allowing officials to adjust tariffs in response to goods sold at abnormally low prices. The League of Nations Secretariat commissioned studies on antidumping laws, with the U.S. law having roots in late-nineteenth-century antitrust legislation. Dumping was seen as a strategy to harm development and maintain monopolistic dominance. In 1916, Congress passed the Antidumping Act to penalize those selling goods in the U.S. below market value. The Antidumping Act of 1921 established a more globally common administrative procedure for imposing additional duties on imports to prevent the establishment of an industry in the United States. This law became the basis for Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1947, setting the global standard for antidumping measures. The U.S. model of antidumping, based on the Antidumping Act of 1921, has become the global standard. The law requires antidumping duties if imported merchandise is sold in the U.S. at less than fair value and if an industry in the U.S. is materially injured. The statutory authority for antidumping investigations is found in the Tariff Act of 1930. The U.S. model of antidumping, based on the Antidumping Act of 1921, requires antidumping duties if imported merchandise is sold below fair value and causes material injury to a U.S. industry. The AD duty is determined by the difference between the normal value and export price of the merchandise. International agreements like GATT and the WTO's Antidumping Agreement govern the use of AD laws, allowing duties to be imposed when dumping threatens industry injury. The Antidumping Act of 1921, based on the U.S. model, requires antidumping duties if imported merchandise is sold below fair value and causes injury to a domestic industry. The WTO's Antidumping Agreement provides detailed guidelines on determining dumping, injury to domestic industries, evidence requirements, and dispute settlement procedures for members. The International Trade Administration (ITA) initiates antidumping investigations based on petitions filed by domestic industry representatives, with investigations typically starting within 20 days of receiving a petition. Violations of the Antidumping Agreement may lead to WTO dispute settlement proceedings. The USITC initiates an investigation within 20 days of receiving a petition to determine injury to domestic industry. If a negative preliminary determination is made or imports are negligible, proceedings end. The ITA conducts a preliminary investigation on dumping if USITC's determination is affirmative, with a deadline of 140 days for a determination, extendable to 190 days in complex cases. If dumping is found, ITA estimates a weighted-average dumping margin. The ITA conducts a preliminary investigation on dumping if USITC's determination is affirmative, estimating dumping margins for exporters. If the determination is negative, investigations continue without suspending duties. The ITA must make its final determination within 75 days of the preliminary determination. A hearing can be requested before the final determination is issued. If the final determination is negative, proceedings end, and any suspension of liquidation is terminated. If affirmative, the ITA orders suspension of liquidation and directs CBP to continue or resume collection of cash deposits. Congress enacted the critical circumstances provision to provide prompt relief to domestic industries suffering from large volumes of imports and to deter exporters from increasing exports during investigations. If critical circumstances are alleged in an antidumping case, the ITA determines if there is a history of dumping or if the importer knew the merchandise was sold at less than fair value and likely to cause material injury. The ITA determines critical circumstances in antidumping cases based on history of dumping or importer's knowledge of sales below fair value likely causing injury. If affirmative, suspension of liquidation is retroactive to 90 days before order or publication date. If final determination on subsidies or dumping is affirmative, retroactive duties are ordered on unliquidated entries. If the ITA makes an affirmative determination of critical circumstances, the USITC's final determination must assess if the imports are likely to undermine the AD order. If both agencies agree on critical circumstances, AD duties apply to goods with retroactive suspension. Negative determinations result in termination of retroactive actions and release of bonds, securities, and cash deposits. The ITA or USITC may terminate an investigation if the petitioner withdraws the petition or if the ITA self-initiated it. The ITA can also suspend an antidumping investigation for a suspension agreement with foreign exporters. An example is the recent agreement with Mexican growers associations regarding fresh tomatoes, where the US agreed to suspend the investigation in exchange for a promise not to sell below a reference price in the US. During an administrative review of an antidumping order, the ITA recalculates dumping margins and may adjust AD duties. Suspension agreements are also monitored and reviewed for compliance. The ITA must make preliminary and final determinations within specific timeframes. New exporters can request expedited reviews, and interested parties can request \"changed circumstances\" reviews at any time. During sunset reviews, the ITA and USITC determine if dumping and injury to the domestic industry would likely continue if an order is revoked or a suspension agreement terminated. If both determinations are affirmative, the duty or agreement remains; if negative, the order is revoked or the agreement terminated. During the early years of the GATT, only a few countries, including the United States, the European Union, Canada, and Australia, utilized antidumping measures infrequently. Various reasons have been suggested for this, such as the ambiguity in Article VI of the GATT, which lacked a clear methodology for determining dumping and conducting AD investigations. Additionally, high tariff rates among GATT members may have reduced the need for industries to seek protection through antidumping measures. During the early years of the GATT, only a few countries utilized antidumping measures infrequently. Reasons included ambiguity in Article VI of the GATT and high tariff rates among members. In the United States, the Antidumping Act of 1921 was enacted during a period of high tariff rates, limiting the usefulness of AD duties. Administrative changes were made to address perceived indifference in making fair value determinations. Developing countries with higher tariff rates could impose non-tariff barriers, making AD measures unnecessary. In the decades following the establishment of the GATT, many developing countries joined the rules-based trading order, leading to a reduction in tariffs. This reduction may have contributed to an increase in the use of antidumping (AD) measures as an alternative form of protection. Before the 1990s, the US, EU, Canada, and Australia were responsible for most AD actions, while many developing countries lacked AD laws. However, since the 1990s, the number of countries with AD laws has multiplied, with a significant shift in the major users of AD measures. India's use of antidumping (AD) measures has significantly increased over the years, ranking second behind the United States in 2019 with 275 AD measures in force. Between 2008 and 2018, India ranked first in the number of AD measures imposed per year. The total number of AD measures globally has increased by over 600%, from 264 measures in 1994 to 1,860 in 2018, with China, the United States, and India being top users of AD investigations and measures. China, the United States, and India are top users and targets of AD investigations and measures, primarily imposed on heavy industrial products. AD laws are adopted following market integration and trade liberalization, blunting the impact of new imports. Developing countries may turn to AD measures to protect domestic industries after reducing tariffs post-trade negotiations. Since entering the WTO, India, Brazil, China, and Argentina collectively reduced tariffs by 63% on average. However, they significantly increased their use of AD measures, with a 4,800% rise from 1995 to 2018. AD measures are seen as an attractive form of protection, with the US having 384 AD orders in place affecting imports from 53 countries, including one dating back to 1977. The United States has been imposing anti-dumping duties on pressure sensitive tape from Italy since 1977. It has significantly increased its use of AD measures compared to other original users like the EU, Canada, and Australia. The US currently has the highest number of AD measures in force in its history, with China being the largest user of AD measures against the US. The United States has the highest number of anti-dumping measures in force in its history, with China being the largest user against the US. India, Brazil, Mexico, and Canada are also top targets. The reasons for targeting the US are uncertain, possibly related to trade liberalization or retaliation. Critics argue that anti-dumping measures are trade distorting and rare predatory pricing. AD duties have a significant impact on trade, with scholars noting that they lead to shifts in production and trade patterns. These duties are estimated to affect 3% to 8% of a country's total imports, making them costly commercial policies. Despite the negative view held by many economists, Congress has been supportive of AD duties, and reform efforts have been limited. Despite the negative view of antidumping (AD) practices by many economists, Phillip Swagel, the director of the Congressional Budget Office, referred to AD as the \"third rail of trade policy.\" Critics argue that AD laws are economically inefficient, but some concede that AD may play a role in promoting trade liberalization. Congress must weigh the economic costs of dumping against its potential support for trade liberalization. Congress could influence Commerce to adjust de minimis thresholds for dumping findings, potentially reducing or increasing policy use. The US advocated for robust dispute settlement provisions in WTO negotiations, resulting in the inclusion of the Dispute Settlement Understanding. However, recent administrations have criticized the WTO's dispute settlement system. The WTO's dispute settlement system, particularly the Appellate Body, has faced criticism. The United States has blocked new AB members, affecting the system's functionality. Congress may need to reevaluate U.S. AD policies to maintain a functional dispute settlement system. U.S. AD policies have been frequently disputed, with DS Panels and the AB finding conflicts with international commitments. Other WTO members also face challenges with the dispute settlement system. The United States, along with other WTO members, has struggled to defend challenges to their implementation of the ADA. One contentious issue is the calculation method known as \"zeroing,\" used to determine dumping margins for imposing antidumping measures on exporters. The ITA typically averages comparisons between export prices and normal values, aggregating individual transactions to calculate dumping margins. If the export price exceeds the normal value, it results in a dumping margin. The United States adjusts negative values to zero in certain circumstances when calculating dumping margins for antidumping measures. The use of 'zeroing' can increase antidumping duties and create duties where none would have been imposed. For example, applying zeroing to a simplified scenario resulted in an aggregate dumping margin of $55, leading to a weighted average dumping margin. The United States uses zeroing to calculate dumping margins for antidumping measures, which can increase duties and create new duties. Economists in 2010 suggested that eliminating zeroing could remove half of U.S. AD measures. The U.S. Trade Representative argues that zeroing allows focusing on transactions with dumping, collecting duties only on dumped imports. This method is seen as a common-sense way to calculate dumping that harms domestic industries. Opponents argue that zeroing artificially increases dumping margins, making it difficult for firms to avoid dumping. This could lead to more products being subject to antidumping duties. The United States is the only country actively using zeroing, and it may not be necessary for effective antidumping policy. One economist estimated that zeroing could add 3-4% to U.S. antidumping duties, costing around $150 million per year. Since 1995, over 30 WTO decisions have deemed zeroing in U.S. antidumping investigations inconsistent with the ADA. The U.S. has been a respondent in over 150 WTO disputes, with many involving zeroing. In finalized cases, the U.S. has either lost or settled, costing around $150 million annually in antidumping duties. Nearly half of U.S. cases found non-compliant with WTO obligations involved dumping. U.S. criticism towards WTO's AB focused on ADA implementation errors. USTR identified six areas of AB errors, mostly related to trade remedies like dumping. The AB's zeroing prohibition hinders addressing dumped imports causing harm to domestic industries. The USTR's critique of the WTO AB, particularly regarding trade remedies like antidumping, has influenced its decision to block AB appointments. Congress may address the role of antidumping in straining the U.S.-WTO relationship, potentially through revising the WTO's DSU or directing Commerce to address concerns raised by WTO members and the Appellate Body. The EU and Canada have stopped using zeroing in antidumping investigations, addressing concerns raised by WTO members and the Appellate Body."
