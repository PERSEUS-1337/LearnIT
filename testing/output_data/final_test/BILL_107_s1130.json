    "content": "The Act titled \"Fusion Energy Sciences Act of 2001\" is cited in Section 1. Section 2 contains findings related to the Act. The Congress finds that economic prosperity is linked to affordable energy supply, environmental quality is tied to energy production, and population growth will increase energy consumption and stress on the environment. Pursuing fusion energy aggressively now is crucial for long-term economic and environmental needs. Fusion energy is expected to be safe, economical, and use an unlimited fuel source. Recent reviews by the Committee of Advisers on Science and Technology, the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board, and the National Academy of Sciences strongly support the Fusion Energy Sciences Program. They emphasize the need for the program to advance towards a magnetic fusion burning plasma experiment to achieve practical fusion energy production and integrate the fusion science community into broader scientific research. The Fusion Energy Sciences Program budget is insufficient to support necessary science and innovation for current experiments, hindering the construction of a burning plasma experiment by the United States or key participation in an international effort. The Fusion Energy Sciences Program budget is inadequate for supporting essential science and innovation, which is impeding the development of a burning plasma experiment in the United States or significant involvement in an international initiative. The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with FESAC, must develop a plan for a US fusion experiment to advance scientific understanding of fusion plasmas. The plan must address key burning plasma physics issues and include details on the experiment's scientific capabilities and relevance to practical fusion energy goals. The plan will be reviewed by the National Academy of Sciences and submitted to Congress by July 1, 2004. The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with FESAC, must develop a plan for a US fusion experiment to advance scientific understanding of fusion plasmas, including details on scientific capabilities, estimated cost, and potential construction sites. Additionally, the Secretary may develop a plan for US participation in an international burning plasma experiment if it is cost-effective and scientifically beneficial. The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with FESAC, must develop a plan for a US fusion experiment to advance scientific understanding of fusion plasmas. The Secretary may also conduct research and development necessary to fully develop the plans described in this section. The Secretary of Energy, in consultation with FESAC, is required to develop a plan for a US fusion experiment to advance scientific understanding of fusion plasmas. The Secretary, in consultation with FESAC, must develop a plan within 6 months to strengthen the Fusion Energy Sciences Program, utilize existing facilities better, enhance fusion science theory, fund new research facilities based on innovation and cost-effectiveness, and improve communication within the fusion science community. The plan aims to strengthen the Fusion Energy Sciences Program by enhancing collaboration, optimizing experimental design, and utilizing inertial confinement fusion facilities for research and development. Authorization of appropriations for the Fusion Energy Sciences Program includes $320,000,000 for fiscal year 2002 and $335,000,000 for fiscal year 2003."
