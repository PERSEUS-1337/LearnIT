    "content": "The \"Private Property Rights Act of 1997\" may be cited as such. The Congress recognizes the importance of private property ownership for the nation's well-being, the need to protect property from government takings without compensation, and the impact of federal agency actions on property value. Owners of taken property should be properly compensated. Owners of private property taken by a Federal agency action should have the right to seek relief in Federal district court. The Federal Government's policy is to protect public health, safety, and welfare while minimizing takings of private property. The Act defines \"agency\" as any department or instrumentality of the US government, \"agency action\" as any decision made by an agency, and \"owner\" as the person with property rights affected by a taking. The term \"taking of private property\" refers to any action that requires compensation under the fifth amendment to the United States Constitution. SEC. 5. REQUIREMENT FOR PRIVATE PROPERTY TAKING IMPACT ANALYSIS. Private property taking impact analysis is required before agency actions likely to result in a taking of private property, except in cases of eminent domain, property held in trust by the United States, or actions related to treaty negotiations with foreign nations. The curr_chunk discusses exceptions to private property taking impact analysis, including law enforcement actions, communication with State or local land-use planning agencies, military facilities or activities on Federal property, and military or foreign affairs functions. The curr_chunk discusses the content of a private property taking impact analysis, including the specific purpose of the agency action, likelihood of property taking, need for compensation, and alternative actions to achieve the intended purposes. The curr_chunk outlines the requirements for a private property taking impact analysis, including the agency's intended purposes, likelihood of property taking, and potential liability of the Federal Government. Agencies must submit this analysis to the Office of Management and Budget and make it available to the public, property owners, and other affected parties. Before taking final agency action, alternatives to minimize private property taking must be fully considered. Civil action can be taken if necessary. Civil action can be taken against an agency if private property is taken, with jurisdiction in either the United States District Court or the United States Court of Federal Claims. Additionally, guidance and reporting requirements are outlined. The Attorney General provides legal guidance to agencies for compliance with the Act. Agencies must submit reports on agency actions, taking impact analysis, taking claims, and compensation awards. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Attorney General must publish an annual compilation of agency reports in the Federal Register. SEC. 9. PRESUMPTIONS IN PROCEEDINGS. There is a rebuttable presumption that costs, values, and estimates in a private property takings impact analysis are outdated and inaccurate if the analysis was completed more than 5 years before the action or proceeding, and if they have not been modified within the 5-year period preceding the action or proceeding. SEC. 10. RULES OF CONSTRUCTION. SEC. 10. RULES OF CONSTRUCTION. This Act does not limit any rights or remedies, or determine property value conclusively. SEC. 11. EFFECTIVE DATE.
