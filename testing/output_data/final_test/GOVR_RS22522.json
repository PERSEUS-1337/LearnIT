    "content": "Based on WTO precedent, criteria for establishing adverse effects contributing to serious prejudice include subsidies covering a substantial share of production costs, importance of the subsidized commodity in world markets, and a causal relationship between the subsidy and adverse effects. WTO challenges focus on production- and trade-distorting programs that cause adverse effects in certain markets. USDA data is used to identify commodities vulnerable to WTO challenges based on subsidy dependence levels. In evaluating subsidy dependence, U.S. program crops received significant subsidy payments, with some commodities exceeding 10% of cash receipts. In FY2000, rice and cotton subsidies amounted to 174% of cash receipts, while sorghum, wheat, and corn payments ranged from 66% to 110% of cash receipts. According to USDA data, rice, cotton, sorghum, wheat, and corn received substantial subsidy payments, with some exceeding 10% of cash receipts. Market revenue covered operating costs for crops with the most program support, but not total production costs. Subsidies were necessary for these commodities to cover total costs, with rice reaching 146% of total costs with subsidies. The aid of subsidies is crucial for a significant portion of U.S. production to be economically sustainable. The impact of subsidies on production decline remains unanswered. The substantial contribution of subsidies towards covering production costs implies a high chance for adverse rulings for major commodities. Direct payments are the largest commodity subsidy payments, while other programs like counter-cyclical payments and marketing loan program payments vary. The Step 2 cotton user marketing program has been terminated, and there are purchase programs for milk and sugar to remove supplies from the market when prices fall. The United States utilizes subsidies like direct payments, counter-cyclical payments, and crop insurance to support major crops. Some argue that U.S. marketing loan provisions could be seen as export subsidies, but the U.S. maintains they operate within WTO guidelines. The United States defends its farm programs as WTO-compliant, with no challenges to benefits received by U.S. producers. Federal crop insurance costs have risen due to increased subsidies, with future projections exceeding $4 billion annually by 2015, potentially drawing scrutiny from trade competitors. The crop insurance program in the United States heavily subsidizes five main crops - corn, wheat, soybeans, cotton, and sorghum. These crops receive 75% of the total insurance coverage, with the remaining 25% going to other crops. The program appears actuarially sound when considering total premiums and indemnity payments, but excluding federal subsidies, the loss ratio is much higher. The most heavily subsidized commodities are also major U.S. agricultural exports, playing a significant role in the global market. During 2002-2005, U.S. agricultural exports dominated world production and trade, with cotton accounting for 20% and 40%, rice for 2% and 13%, wheat for 9% and 25%, sorghum for 18% and 83%, and soybeans for 38% and 44% respectively. Studies show U.S. agricultural support programs negatively impact international market prices, disadvantaging non-subsidized products. The remedy to a successful WTO legal challenge of a subsidy program depends on the nature of the subsidy\u2014prohibited versus actionable. Prohibited subsidies must be withdrawn without delay according to a time period specified by the panel. If withdrawal is not accomplished within the specified time frame, then the Dispute Settlement Body shall grant authorization to take retaliatory countermeasures. With respect to actionable subsidies, the remedy is to remove the subsidy's adverse effects or withdraw the subsidy. The subsidizing party has options to remove adverse effects of a subsidy, such as eliminating the program, reducing subsidy amounts, or making compensatory payments. Failure to follow recommendations may lead to retaliatory countermeasures authorized by the DSB. U.S. subsidized crops are potentially vulnerable to WTO legal challenges. Several U.S. farm programs, including foreign market development programs, may face WTO legal challenges as prohibited subsidies. A partial policy reform to reduce U.S. amber box spending by 60% would only have a modest impact on international markets due to the significant role the United States plays in world commodity markets. This makes U.S. subsidy programs vulnerable to WTO challenges under SCM Article 5 and 6.3. The potential for WTO legal challenges to U.S. farm programs, including foreign market development programs, exists due to the significant role the United States plays in world commodity markets. To decrease exposure to these challenges, decoupling payments from producer or consumer behavior is suggested. Options for decoupling include fully decoupled direct payments, whole-farm revenue-insurance-type programs, and conservation or \"green\" payments, which could qualify as green box programs and fall outside WTO spending limits."
