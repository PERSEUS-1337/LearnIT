    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Poison Control Center Enhancement and Awareness Act Amendments of 2003\". The Congress recognizes the importance of poison control centers in preventing injuries and deaths from poisoning, especially among children. Poisoning is a significant cause of unintentional deaths in the United States, with millions of poison exposures and thousands of fatalities annually. Stabilizing funding and increasing accessibility to these centers is crucial for public health. The tragic events of September 11, 2001, and the anthrax cases of October 2001, have led to increased utilization of poison control centers for accurate medical information on diseases and complications. The 2001 Presidential Task Force on Citizen Preparedness recommended using these centers for public education on potential terrorism threats. Increased demand on poison centers for emergency information in the event of a terrorist attack involving biological, chemical, or nuclear toxins will significantly raise call volume. Title XII of the Public Health Service Act is amended to include a new section on maintaining a national toll-free number for poison control. The Secretary will assist poison control centers in establishing a nationwide toll-free phone number. Private toll-free numbers for poison control can still operate. $2,000,000 is authorized annually for this purpose. Additionally, a national media campaign will be established to promote poison control center utilization. The Secretary will establish a national media campaign to educate the public and healthcare providers about poison prevention and the availability of poison control resources. This will include monthly television, radio, and newspaper public service announcements. Evaluation measures will be established to assess the impact of the campaign annually. The Secretary will establish a national media campaign to educate the public and healthcare providers about poison prevention and the availability of poison control resources. Evaluation of the campaign will be done annually. Authorization of appropriations for this program is set at $600,000 for fiscal years 2000 through 2005 and as needed for fiscal years 2006 through 2009. Grants will be awarded to regional poison control centers to ensure financial stability and develop standardized prevention and control programs. Patient management guidelines for toxic exposures will also be developed. The bill aims to enhance poison control data collection systems, improve national toxic exposure surveillance, expand toxicologic expertise within poison control centers, and increase their capacity to handle high call volumes during national crises. The Secretary can only grant funds to certified poison control centers. The Secretary can grant a waiver of certification requirements for noncertified or newly established poison control centers if they can demonstrate they will obtain certification within a reasonable period of time. The Secretary can grant a waiver for poison control centers to obtain certification within a reasonable period. The waiver can be renewed but cannot exceed 5 years. Funding for poison control centers should supplement, not replace, other funds. Centers must maintain their expenditure levels when utilizing grant proceeds. The Secretary may require a matching contribution for grants under this section. $25,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2000-2004, and $27,500,000 for fiscal years 2005-2009. SEC. 1274 states that no easing of restrictions in Federal law regarding the use of funds for reports. SEC. 4 repeals the Poison Control Center Enhancement and Awareness Act."
