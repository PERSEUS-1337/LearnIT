    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 1797.5 of the Fish and Game Code is amended to define terms related to conservation banks, including \"bank,\" \"bank enabling instrument,\" \"bank sponsor,\" and \"conservation bank.\" Conservation banks are sites managed to conserve habitat for threatened species with provisions for credit issuance. The curr_chunk discusses the measures required to mitigate adverse impacts on fish and wildlife resources from authorized activities. This includes compensating for impacts, reducing adverse effects, mitigating environmental effects, establishing mitigation in advance, and protecting habitat connectivity. The curr_chunk defines terms related to conservation easements and mitigation banks, including the meaning of a conservation easement, mitigation bank, person, and prospectus. It also amends Section 1930 of the Fish and Game Code. The Legislature recognizes the importance of preserving diverse habitats for the state's natural resources and citizens. Connectivity between wildlife habitats is crucial for biodiversity, and efforts to maintain high-quality habitat can create strongholds for wildlife. Fragmented habitats pose a threat to wildlife species, and there is an opportunity to incentivize private landowners to preserve natural areas. Preservation efforts have been disjointed across various sectors. The importance of wildlife corridors and habitat connectivity for biodiversity and ecosystem health is recognized by various groups and agencies. Efforts to protect these corridors could be enhanced through the establishment of a statewide policy. The Wildlife Conservation Board, with funding from various sources, will investigate and prioritize areas in the state essential as wildlife corridors and habitat linkages, considering climate change impacts. Collaboration with the department aims to complete a statewide analysis to support conservation planning and climate change adaptation efforts. The state promotes voluntary protection of wildlife corridors and habitat strongholds to enhance resiliency to climate change, protect biodiversity, and allow for species migration. Measures include acquiring or protecting corridors, installing wildlife-friendly fencing, and siting conservation banks in areas that provide habitat connectivity. The state promotes voluntary protection of wildlife corridors and habitat strongholds to enhance resiliency to climate change and protect biodiversity. Efforts include providing roadway structures for fish passage and wildlife movement. The Legislature acknowledges existing initiatives working towards achieving these goals. For clarification, subdivision (c) does not impose new regulations or alter existing requirements under the Fish and Game Code or the California Environmental Quality Act. Definitions for \"habitat stronghold\" and \"wildlife corridor\" are provided, emphasizing the importance of high-quality habitat and habitat linkages for wildlife resilience and movement."
