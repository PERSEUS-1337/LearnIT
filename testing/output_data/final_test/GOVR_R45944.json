    "content": "Brexit, the UK's exit from the EU, is the main issue in UK politics. A 2016 referendum showed 52% in favor of leaving. Negotiations with the EU began in 2017, but disagreements in Parliament delayed the original March 2019 exit date. The withdrawal agreement was rejected, and a no-deal scenario was opposed. In April 2019, EU leaders granted the UK an extension until October 31, 2019. Negotiators reached a new withdrawal agreement on October 17, 2019, but faced challenges in UK Parliament approval. Another extension was granted until January 31, 2020. A general election on December 12, 2019, saw Johnson's Conservative Party win decisively. The UK and EU ratified the withdrawal agreement in January 2020, leading to the UK's official withdrawal from the EU on January 31, 2020. Brexit is not yet over as the UK and the EU determine their future relationship. Congress is interested in Brexit's implications for the global economy, U.S.-UK and U.S.-EU relations, and transatlantic cooperation. The Administration notified Congress of intent to negotiate a U.S.-UK free trade agreement post-Brexit, but the final agreement's form and approval process are uncertain. Congressional legislation may be needed to implement the potential FTA. The US is prioritizing trade negotiations with the UK post-Brexit, but the process may take time. Congress is concerned about the impact of Brexit on Northern Ireland, with Speaker Pelosi stating no trade agreement if it weakens the peace process. The House has reaffirmed support for the Good Friday Agreement in light of Brexit. The December 2019 UK election resolved a political deadlock over Brexit, leading to Theresa May's resignation and Boris Johnson becoming Prime Minister. Johnson, a key figure in the campaign to leave the EU, previously served as UK Foreign Secretary and Mayor of London. Members of Congress support a US-UK trade agreement post-Brexit, with concerns about Northern Ireland's peace process. Boris Johnson, former UK Foreign Secretary and Mayor of London, aimed to negotiate a new Brexit deal with the EU, removing the controversial Northern Ireland backstop provision. This move was to prevent a hard border with customs checks on the island of Ireland and ensure Brexit would not affect the EU single market rules. Prime Minister Johnson strongly opposed the backstop arrangement in the rejected withdrawal deal, citing concerns about UK sovereignty and trade deals. Parliament passed legislation in September 2019 requiring a deadline extension from the EU unless a new agreement was reached or approved for a no-deal Brexit. The government also lost its parliamentary majority. The government lost its parliamentary majority in September 2019 due to defections and expulsions of MPs working to prevent a no-deal Brexit. Prime Minister Johnson failed to secure an early general election before the October 31 Brexit deadline. On October 17, 2019, the European Council endorsed a new withdrawal agreement between the EU and the UK government. The new withdrawal agreement, endorsed in October 2019, includes changes to the Protocols on Ireland/Northern Ireland. Under the agreement, Northern Ireland will be in the UK customs territory but practically in the EU customs union, creating a customs border in the Irish Sea. Key elements involve alignment with EU regulatory rules to eliminate the need for regulatory checks on trade between Northern Ireland and Ireland. The new withdrawal agreement, endorsed in October 2019, includes changes to the Protocols on Ireland/Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland will be in the UK customs territory but practically in the EU customs union, creating a customs border in the Irish Sea. Customs compliance checks will be conducted at ports away from the Northern Ireland-Ireland border, with no checks at the border. The Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly must consent to renew the arrangement four years after it comes into force. The entire UK, including Northern Ireland, will leave the EU customs union at the end of the transition period in December 2020. The changes were based on a proposal by Prime Minister Johnson and discussions with Irish Prime Minister Varadkar, resembling the \"Northern Ireland-only backstop.\" Some analysts suggest that the changes in the new withdrawal agreement resemble the \"Northern Ireland-only backstop\" initially proposed by the EU in 2018. The DUP opposes the provisions for Northern Ireland in Johnson's renegotiated agreement, especially the customs border in the Irish Sea. Parliament delayed the vote on the agreement to pass necessary legislation for Brexit implementation. Prime Minister Johnson reluctantly requested an extension from the EU to comply with UK law, despite his strong opposition to doing so. The EU granted the extension through January 2020, as Parliament had not yet approved a new withdrawal agreement. The EU granted a Brexit deadline extension until January 31, 2020. Parliament agreed to hold an early general election on December 12, 2019. Prime Minister Johnson's priority was to win the election and pursue Brexit plans. The Conservative party won decisively with 365 seats in the House of Commons. The UK general election resulted in a substantial defeat for the Labour Party, losing 59 seats. The Scottish National Party gained 13 seats, indicating a resurgence of the pro-independence movement in Scotland. The UK government ratified the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, leading to the UK's withdrawal from the EU by January 31, 2020. On January 31, 2020, the UK completed its 47-year membership in the EU. An 11-month transition period began, during which the UK will follow EU rules and remain in the single market and customs union. Prime Minister Johnson opposes extending the transition period, aiming to conclude an FTA with the EU by the end of 2020. If no agreement is reached, UK-EU trade will be governed by WTO rules. Negotiations on the future UK-EU relationship are expected to cover a comprehensive partnership including security, foreign policy, energy, and data sharing. Doubts exist regarding the feasibility of concluding such extensive negotiations within 11 months. Temporary side deals may address certain areas like road transportation and aviation. The revised protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland is anticipated to come into effect. The revised protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland is expected to take effect at the end of the transition period. Implementation details, including customs checks, will be decided by the Joint Committee during the transition period. Both parties aim to protect the Good Friday Agreement, while the EU seeks to safeguard its single market and the UK seeks to preserve its constitutional integrity. Brexit creates uncertainty for the future UK-EU trade relationship. The UK was the second largest economy in the EU28 in 2018, with the EU as its largest trading partner. The UK's largest trading partner is the EU, with Germany, the Netherlands, France, Ireland, and Spain being key trading partners within the EU. UK-EU trade is highly integrated through supply chains and services. During the transition period, the UK remains in the EU customs union, allowing tariff-free trade with other EU members. During the transition period, the UK is part of the EU customs union, allowing tariff-free trade with other EU members. The UK also remains in the EU single market, enabling the free movement of goods, services, capital, and people, with common rules and standards to reduce nontariff barriers. The single market within the EU allows for tariff-free trade and the free movement of goods, services, capital, and people. It provides businesses with the ability to sell goods and services more freely across EU member states, with significant market access for services as well. Professionals can move freely between member states and benefit from mutual recognition of qualifications. The UK and EU are negotiating a Free Trade Agreement post-Brexit, with the UK likely to no longer be part of the EU single market and customs union. The political declaration aims for a comprehensive trade partnership, with the UK seeking a high-quality trade deal. EU FTAs vary in trade liberalization, with draft negotiating directives including tariff- and quota-free trade on goods and services. The UK and EU are negotiating a Free Trade Agreement post-Brexit, with the UK seeking to diverge from EU rules for more flexibility in trade negotiations. The EU offer includes tariff- and quota-free trade on goods, services, digital trade, and regulatory cooperation, but is conditional on commitments to a \"level playing field.\" The Johnson government aims to conclude the deal by the end of the transition period, despite concerns about the ambitious timetable. EU officials have warned that the tight schedule may limit the scope of the talks. Analysts are skeptical that an ambitious trade agreement can be negotiated and approved by the EU and UK governments by the end of the transition period. Advocates of a soft Brexit argue that the UK should maintain close economic and trade ties with the EU through a customs union, which would limit the UK's control over its trade policy. The UK is expected to leave the EU customs union at the end of the transition period, making a future customs union arrangement with the EU unlikely. The Johnson government opposes a soft Brexit to maintain control over trade policy and negotiate free trade agreements independently. If no trade deal or customs union is agreed upon post-Brexit, the UK would regain control over its national trade policy. If a trade deal or customs union is not reached with the EU post-Brexit, the UK would lose preferential access to the EU market. This would result in tariffs and nontariff barriers, increasing costs for UK-EU trade. The impact of Brexit on the UK economy depends on future trade relationships and new trade deals. A free trade agreement could mitigate costs, but it may take years to negotiate. New trade deals signed by the UK with countries outside of the EU could boost economic growth, but may not be enough to offset the loss of UK's EU membership. Higher tariffs in UK-EU trade could raise costs for consumers and affect sectors like agriculture and manufacturing. Brexit will lead to higher costs for UK importers due to potential tariffs on EU imports. A preferential trading arrangement may not eliminate all tariffs, and exporters will need to certify the origin of goods. The UK will be considered a \"third country\" by the EU, leading to challenges in regulatory alignment. The extent of UK's willingness to maintain alignment with the EU is uncertain and poses a key challenge. Brexit will lead to new administrative and customs procedures for UK-EU trade, potentially causing delays and backlogs at ports. Businesses in the UK are preparing for Brexit by stockpiling inventories and adjusting operations. Smaller companies may face challenges in dealing with the transition. The UK businesses, especially smaller companies, are concerned about the potential effects of a no-deal Brexit scenario. The automobile sector, heavily reliant on trade with the EU, could face significant challenges with new tariffs and regulatory checks. Autos and chemicals industries in the UK face new regulatory checks for safety and quality standards in the EU market. UK chemicals exports to the EU could incur tariffs of up to 6.5% without a trade arrangement. UK companies would need to transfer their chemical registrations to an EEA-based entity to maintain market access. London's financial services sector, the largest in Europe, could also be impacted by Brexit. London's financial services sector, the largest in Europe, faces challenges post-Brexit. The EU will no longer allow financial passporting, potentially requiring UK and EU businesses to restructure. Some banks are already moving jobs and assets to other European cities like Amsterdam, Dublin, Frankfurt, and Paris. Financial companies are moving over \u00a31 trillion in assets from the UK to the EU as part of Brexit contingency planning. The EU is the largest export market for UK business services, accounting for 39% of these exports. Cross-border data flows are crucial for UK-EU services trade, but after the transition period, the EU will need to assess UK compliance with data protection regulations. The UK's data protection standards align with EU regulations under the GDPR. Potential data transfer restrictions post-Brexit could impact UK companies, including tech, healthcare, and service providers. The UK government's \"Global Britain\" concept emphasizes increased trade and international engagement. Brexit supporters aim for an independent trade policy tailored to UK interests. The UK is seeking continuity in its trade ties post-Brexit by negotiating its own WTO schedule of commitments on goods, services, and agriculture. This is necessary as the EU schedule currently applies to all EU members, including the UK. The UK is working on developing its own schedule for market access commitments outside the EU, including reallocating tariff-rate quotas for agricultural products. Bilateral discussions with the EU have raised concerns from some WTO members about potential access reductions. The UK continues to apply the EU schedule during the transition period and is in the process of joining the WTO Government Procurement Agreement. The UK has delayed submitting its instrument of accession for the GPA and is working to replicate existing EU trade deals with non-EU countries. It was part of over 40 trade agreements with around 70 countries through its EU membership, but will lose preferential access to these markets after the transition period. The UK has signed 20 \"continuity\" deals covering around 50 countries, including Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Iceland, Norway, and South Korea, accounting for about 8.3% of total UK trade. The UK is also negotiating sector-specific regulatory agreements and mutual recognition agreements. The UK is negotiating mutual recognition agreements (MRAs) with Australia, New Zealand, and the United States in certain sectors. Discussions with Japan on an MRA are ongoing. The UK is pursuing new trade deals with countries like Australia, China, India, and New Zealand. A priority is signing an FTA with Japan, as Japan is one of the UK's largest investors. Japan seeks to negotiate new terms with the UK instead of \"rolling over\" the EU-Japan FTA. Major carmakers like Nissan, Toyota, and Honda have manufacturing factories in the UK. Brexit poses challenges for Northern Ireland, the only part of the UK sharing a border with an EU member state. The goal is to prevent a hard border with customs checks and infrastructure. The history of political violence in Northern Ireland complicates post-Brexit border arrangements with the Republic of Ireland. The 30-year sectarian conflict in Northern Ireland (1969-1999) between unionists (Protestants) and nationalists (Catholics) was resolved with the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, which relied on EU membership for both the UK and Ireland to support the peace settlement. The EU provided a framework for human rights, equality, and nondiscrimination, and facilitated the removal of security checkpoints along the 300-mile border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. The disappearance of the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland after joining the customs union was crucial for the peace process, but Brexit raised concerns about a hard border returning and destabilizing the region. The potential return of a hard border post-Brexit could pose security risks in the border regions, with concerns about violent dissident groups targeting border infrastructure and threatening the peace process. During the Troubles, the border areas were known for conflict between British soldiers, militant nationalist groups like the IRA, and militant unionist groups. Remilitarization of the border is feared if violence escalates. Many experts fear that violence in border regions could lead to remilitarization and spread beyond. Dissident republican groups like the New IRA and Continuity IRA have increased activity, targeting police officers and attempting bombings in areas like Londonderry/Derry. Maintaining an open border is crucial for trade, economy, and community relations in Northern Ireland and Ireland. Economic development is seen as vital for lasting peace in Northern Ireland. Establishing customs checkpoints in Northern Ireland poses logistical difficulties and concerns for border communities due to the impact on daily travel. There are numerous road crossings along the border, with only a fraction open during the Troubles. Since the Brexit referendum, UK, Irish, and EU leaders have worked to prevent a hard border. In the December 2017 UK-EU agreement, the UK pledged to uphold the Good Friday Agreement and avoid a hard border in Ireland. The backstop became a major issue in gaining UK Parliament approval for the withdrawal agreement due to the UK government's pursuit of a hard Brexit. Prime Minister Johnson opposed the backstop but wanted to avoid a hard border. Some argued that security concerns about the border were exaggerated. Some argued that security concerns about the Irish border were exaggerated, with hard Brexit supporters contending that the issue was being exploited by the EU and those preferring a soft Brexit. The Good Friday Agreement commits the UK to normalizing security arrangements, but does not explicitly require an open border. The Irish government and many in Northern Ireland, along with most UK officials, argued that an open border was essential for peace and fulfilling provisions in the Agreement for north-south cooperation on various issues. Some hard Brexit advocates questioned the relevance of the Good Friday Agreement in light of the Irish border question. The Good Friday Agreement's relevance is questioned due to the stalemate in Northern Ireland's government. Despite UK's commitment to the accord, concerns about a hard border have lessened after Johnson's election victory. Uncertainty remains about the UK-EU future relationship post-Brexit. The Northern Ireland border provisions are expected to remain unchanged during negotiations. The Johnson government has effectively transformed the backstop into the definitive future arrangement for Northern Ireland, leaving it in the EU's single market and customs union. The post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland will be subject to the consent of the Northern Ireland Assembly in 2024, with details still to be worked out by UK and EU negotiators. Brexit has deepened political and societal divisions in Northern Ireland. The DUP opposed Northern Ireland provisions in the renegotiated withdrawal agreement, feeling it treated Northern Ireland differently and undermined the union. With the Conservative Party's majority, the DUP lost influence and couldn't block the agreement. Many unionists feel abandoned by Prime Minister Johnson's deal, as demographic changes in Northern Ireland have led to a perceived loss of unionist traditions and dominance. The new post-Brexit border arrangements could further enhance this sense of loss. The potential border and customs arrangements for Northern Ireland post-Brexit could deepen unionist disenfranchisement, especially if it aligns more closely with the Republic of Ireland economically. This unease may escalate political instability and loyalist violence. Concerns arise about a hard border if the Assembly fails to renew post-Brexit agreements aligning with EU rules, requiring new provisions between the UK and EU. The DUP argues that the renegotiated withdrawal agreement undermines the Good Friday Agreement by allowing the Assembly to consent to border arrangements for an additional four years through a simple majority. The 2019 UK election results, where the DUP lost seats and unionists no longer hold a majority in Parliament, may improve the prospects for reestablishing Northern Ireland's devolved government. The DUP and Sinn Fein agreed to a deal to restore the devolved government in Northern Ireland, addressing key issues and promising additional UK financial support. The new Assembly convened the following day, with a power-sharing deal in place. Minister Michelle O'Neill establishes Brexit subcommittee to assess implications for Northern Ireland. UK government commits to including Northern Ireland Executive representatives in UK-EU Joint Committee meetings. Brexit could have serious negative economic consequences for Northern Ireland, as it heavily depends on the EU market, especially Ireland, for exports. Trade with Ireland is crucial for small- and medium-sized companies in Northern Ireland. In 2017, sales to other parts of the UK exceeded Northern Ireland exports and were three times higher than exports to Ireland. Small- and medium-sized companies in Northern Ireland were key in exports to Ireland, while large- and medium-sized firms dominated sales to the rest of the UK. Concerns existed about the impact of a no-deal Brexit on integrated labor markets and industries, particularly the agri-food sector. A no-deal Brexit could have ended 32% of Northern Ireland's exports to Ireland due to EU sanitary checks at the border, impacting farmers and manufacturers. Despite relief over avoiding a no-deal Brexit, concerns remain about the renegotiated withdrawal agreement. The DUP and others in Northern Ireland fear the negative impact of the renegotiated withdrawal agreement on the economy. Concerns include uncertainty about customs arrangements, potential regulatory divergence, reduced business investment, consumer spending, and trade. The deal could lead to increased costs and administrative burdens for Northern Ireland firms exporting goods to the UK under EU customs rules. There are also worries about the lack of agreement on a future trade relationship between the UK and the EU by the end of the transition period. Brexit could have economic ramifications for Northern Ireland, including potential customs and regulatory divergence with the EU. This could lead to more checks on goods traded between Northern Ireland and the UK, impacting foreign direct investment and access to EU funding and agricultural aid. UK officials aim to safeguard Northern Ireland's interests post-Brexit. Brexit has economic implications for Northern Ireland, with potential customs and regulatory differences with the EU. Supporters of Prime Minister Johnson's deal believe it will benefit Northern Ireland's economy. Sinn Fein sees Brexit as a catalyst for increased support for a united Ireland. The Good Friday Agreement allows for a border poll in Northern Ireland to determine its constitutional status, with the UK Secretary of State having the authority to call for it based on the consent principle. Recent elections have sparked discussions on the potential for Irish unification. The Good Friday Agreement allows for a border poll in Northern Ireland to determine its constitutional status. Experts believe conditions for a poll do not currently exist, despite 2019 election results. Majority in Northern Ireland support remaining part of the UK, with election results attributed to frustration with political parties rather than support for a united Ireland. Some surveys suggest views on Northern Ireland's status may be shifting due to Brexit. Views on Northern Ireland's status may be shifting, with a poll showing 46% favoring unification with Ireland. Changing demographics and post-Brexit arrangements could increase support for a united Ireland in the longer term. Irish unification would require Ireland's consent and approval, but concerns remain about economic costs and potential loyalist violence. In the Irish parliamentary election on February 8, 2020, Sinn Fein secured the largest percentage of the vote for the first time in history, focusing on domestic issues like housing and healthcare. Despite their pledge to prepare for Irish unification, the party's success was attributed more to the electorate's desire for political change rather than their stance on a united Ireland. Sinn Fein's electoral success in the Republic of Ireland is seen as driven by a desire for domestic political change. The UK is viewed as the United States' closest ally due to shared history, values, and economic relationship. President Trump has expressed support for Brexit and has personal relationships with leading Brexit supporters. President Trump and his administration have shown strong support for Brexit and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Nigel Farage, a close friend of Trump, publicly criticized Theresa May's handling of Brexit. Senior Administration officials, including John Bolton and Mike Pence, have reiterated support for a no-deal Brexit and a quick U.S.-UK trade deal. Trump celebrated Johnson's election win, emphasizing the potential for a new trade deal between the U.S. and UK. Vice President Pence reiterated US support for UK leaving EU, urging Ireland and EU to work towards an agreement respecting UK's sovereignty for an orderly Brexit. President Trump has had positive views on UK, with tensions over policy differences. US and UK under Trump and May cooperated closely on counterterrorism and Syria conflict. UK defended Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. The UK government has defended the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate agreement, disagreeing with the Trump Administration's decisions to withdraw from them. Despite the close relationship between President Trump and Prime Minister Johnson, there are no clear indications that the UK might align with the US on contentious issues like the Iran deal or climate change post-Brexit. The UK allowed Huawei to build parts of its 5G network despite US security concerns, but Prime Minister Johnson supports the Middle East Peace Plan announced by the Trump Administration. The Trump Administration's Peace Plan was supported by the UK government, despite disagreements on other issues. Brexit has sparked debates on the UK's future international influence, with the Conservative Party envisioning a Global Britain with strong economic ties and global engagement. Critics argue Brexit may diminish the UK's global influence without EU partnership. Developments in the UK's global role and influence will impact its partnership with the United States, especially in security and defense. Close cooperation is expected to continue in counterterrorism, intelligence, and NATO. The UK remains committed to being a leading country in NATO post-Brexit and is a key partner in combating the Islamic State. With the world's sixth-largest military expenditure of $56.1 billion in 2018, the UK is a significant player in global security. The UK, one of seven NATO countries meeting defense spending benchmark, spent $56.1 billion in 2018. Brexit raises concerns about UK's military power and US security partnership. Negative economic effects could impact defense spending and capabilities. Brexit may affect US strategic interests in Europe and EU developments. Brexit could impact EU's military integration projects under the Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP), potentially leading to divergence between EU and US on security issues. UK's withdrawal may hinder efforts to develop EU foreign and defense policies. US officials urge EU to focus beyond inward treaties. The EU is urged to focus on shared external challenges rather than internal treaties and institutions, with Brexit causing internal preoccupation. The UK is a significant trade and economic partner for the US, with WTO terms governing US-UK trade post-Brexit. The UK can negotiate trade agreements during the transition period. The United States and the UK established a bilateral working group in July 2017 to prepare for a potential post-Brexit bilateral FTA. The Trump Administration notified Congress in October 2018 of its intent to negotiate a trade agreement with the UK. Trade negotiations are a priority for the US, but they may take time. The United States and the UK have signed MRAs covering various sectors to ensure continuity of trade. Analysts question the priority and sequencing of U.S.-UK trade agreement negotiations. Some experts believe a U.S.-UK FTA is more feasible than a U.S.-EU FTA due to the \"special relationship\" and trade similarities. The UK has been a leading voice for trade liberalization in the EU. Many U.S. and UK businesses see an FTA as a way to enhance market access and align regulations closer to the U.S. than the EU. However, there are concerns about obstacles and opposition to weakening UK regulations. Some groups oppose efforts to weaken UK regulations, including concerns about U.S. demands for market access, food safety regulations, and drug pricing. Key issues in U.S.-UK FTA negotiations involve financial services, investment, and e-commerce. Aligning UK rules with the EU could lead to past U.S.-EU trade negotiation issues resurfacing. Frictions over tariffs, digital services tax, and Huawei's involvement in the UK's 5G network are also complicating factors. The UK's 5G network development involves Huawei, with potential pushback on U.S. tariffs. Congress supports a U.S.-UK FTA, but concerns exist over Brexit's impact on Northern Ireland peace. The final FTA's form and congressional approval are uncertain, with ongoing consultations and oversight. UK Prime Minister Johnson's December 2019 election victory allowed Brexit to proceed after three and a half years. The UK's December 2019 general election enabled Prime Minister Johnson to move forward with Brexit. The UK officially left the EU in January 2020, entering a transition period until the end of 2020 for negotiations on the future UK-EU relationship. Many uncertainties remain, including the implementation of the withdrawal agreement and the possibility of reaching a future relationship agreement within the transition period. The aftermath of Brexit will continue to be a major focus in UK politics and for the EU. Under former UK Prime Minister Theresa May, the UK pursued a hard Brexit, aiming for full sovereignty over lawmaking and negotiating a free trade agreement with the EU. The implications of Brexit on U.S.-UK and U.S.-EU relations, foreign policy, security cooperation, global economy, and trade are of interest to Congress. The topic of a prospective U.S.-UK FTA and its impact on Northern Ireland and the peace process are also areas of congressional concern. In November 2018, EU and UK negotiators finalized a 585-page draft withdrawal agreement and a 26-page political declaration on the future relationship. The withdrawal agreement included guarantees for EU and UK citizens' rights, a financial settlement of \u00a339 billion, a transition period until 2020, and a backstop provision for the UK to remain in the EU customs union. The backstop provision in the UK-EU withdrawal agreement aimed to address the Irish border issue and ensure no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It was crucial for protecting cross-border trade, maintaining peace in Northern Ireland, and upholding EU single market rules. The future UK-EU relationship was outlined in a nonbinding political declaration, emphasizing an economic partnership with separate markets and the development of an independent UK trade policy. The backstop provision in the UK-EU withdrawal agreement was a major obstacle to securing Parliament's approval due to concerns about the UK's ability to have an independent trade policy. Critics argued that as long as the UK remained in the EU customs union, it would not be able to conduct its own trade policy, a key selling point for Brexit supporters. Supporters of a hard Brexit objected to the backstop, fearing it would leave the UK bound to EU rules indefinitely. Many unionists in Northern Ireland strongly opposed the UK-EU withdrawal agreement due to concerns about the backstop provision, which would maintain regulatory alignment between Northern Ireland and the EU. Advocates of a soft Brexit argue that permanent membership in the EU single market would be economically beneficial, while others in opposition parties voted against the deal in hopes of triggering an early general election or a second referendum on EU membership. Between January 2019 and March 2019, the House of Commons rejected the withdrawal agreement three times and held nonbinding \"indicative\" votes on various options, including staying in the EU single market, leaving without a deal, cancelling the withdrawal process, and holding a public vote. No proposal received a majority. The Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland in 1998 aimed to resolve the conflict between unionists and nationalists, leading to a political settlement and an international treaty between the UK and Irish governments. The Good Friday Agreement established the consent principle for Northern Ireland's status within the UK, requiring majority approval for any changes. It also included provisions for future border polls to determine the region's constitutional status. The Good Friday Agreement established devolved government in Northern Ireland with power-sharing between unionist and nationalist parties, provisions for decommissioning paramilitary weapons, and new institutions for cross-border cooperation. Despite improved security, full implementation has been challenging. The Good Friday Agreement established power-sharing in Northern Ireland between unionist and nationalist parties, with key challenges including decommissioning and police reforms. The hard-line Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn Fein reached a landmark deal in 2007, leading to successive power-sharing governments. Despite tensions, analysts view the agreement's implementation as largely complete. Tensions and distrust persist among unionist and nationalist communities in Northern Ireland, with the peace process remaining fragile. The collapse of the previous devolved government in 2017, led by the DUP and Sinn Fein, was due to a renewable energy scandal involving DUP leader Arlene Foster. Frictions over issues such as the Irish language, same-sex marriage, and Brexit continue to divide the two parties. The DUP and Sinn Fein are at odds over Brexit, with Sinn Fein strongly opposing it while the DUP supports it. Negotiations for a new devolved government in Northern Ireland have stalled, partly due to disagreements over an Irish Language Act. The DUP's support for the Conservative Party government in the UK Parliament has increased distrust between Sinn Fein and the DUP, making reaching an agreement more challenging. Brexit has consumed UK and Northern Ireland politicians' time, overshadowing negotiations for a new devolved government. Journalist Lyra McKee was shot and killed by the New IRA in April 2019, sparking public outcry. Talks for a new devolved government remained deadlocked amid Brexit uncertainty. UK and Irish governments launched new talks with political parties in December 2019. Negotiations with DUP, Sinn Fein, and other parties aimed at restoring Northern Ireland's devolved government followed UK's 2019 general election. The election results favored moderate parties, leading to a deal between DUP and Sinn Fein on January 10, 2020, to restore the government. The new Assembly in Northern Ireland elected a new Executive, with Arlene Foster as First Minister and Michelle O'Neill as Deputy First Minister. The power-sharing deal addresses key issues such as the Irish language, health, education, police numbers, and political transparency. Both the UK and Irish governments pledged additional financial support. Despite reduced violence post-Good Friday Agreement, Northern Ireland still faces challenges in peace and reconciliation due to its divided society. Challenges in Northern Ireland include sectarian tensions, peace walls separating communities, dealing with the legacy of violence, paramilitary activity, economic development, and concerns about Brexit impacting the peace process and future development."
