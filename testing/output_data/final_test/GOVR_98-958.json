    "content": "Extradition is the formal surrender of a person by a State to another State for prosecution or punishment. The United States has extradition treaties with over a hundred nations, but not with all countries. Extradition has become crucial in combating international terrorism and drug trafficking. Its origins can be traced back to antiquity, with the idea that every state should grant extradition freely or punish wrongdoers themselves. The evolution of modern extradition treaties and practices began in the 18th and 19th centuries. The first U.S. extradition treaty was included in Jay's Treaty of 1794 with Great Britain, containing key features of contemporary extradition pacts. The United States relies on bilateral and multilateral agreements for extradition, with expenses borne by those making the requisition. The 1933 Montevideo Convention on Extradition and the Extradition Agreement Between the United States and the European Union are examples of such agreements. The U.S. relies on bilateral and multilateral agreements for extradition, with expenses covered by the requesting party. The U.S.-EU extradition treaty is implemented through bilateral instruments with each EU Member State, replacing conflicting provisions in earlier treaties. The U.S. is also part of multilateral agreements aimed at deterring and punishing transnational criminal activity and human rights abuses, requiring signatories to prosecute or extradite individuals involved in specified conduct. Extradition treaties are binding contracts between parties, obligating states to arrest and deliver individuals accused of specified crimes. The United States follows federal law to fulfill its extradition treaty obligations, while some countries may extradite based on comity. In 1996, Congress authorized the extradition of fugitive aliens without requiring an extradition treaty. This was demonstrated when legislation was passed to implement international agreements with the International Tribunals for Yugoslavia and Rwanda as executive agreements. The United States pledged to surrender individuals charged or found guilty by the tribunal, even without a formal extradition treaty in place. The United States authorized the extradition of fugitive aliens without needing a treaty in 1996. Legislation was passed to implement agreements with the International Tribunals for Yugoslavia and Rwanda. The government attempted to surrender a resident alien to the International Tribunal for Rwanda, facing legal challenges regarding constitutional separation of powers requirements. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the ruling that extradition could be done with authorization from either a treaty or an authorizing statute. The United States does not require extradition authorization to come in the form of a treaty, as confirmed by the Supreme Court's decision to not review a ruling on this matter. There have been debates on the applicability of extradition treaties with former colonies or successor states. Despite periodic renegotiations, the US has older treaties that pre-date changes in governmental status, leading to challenges in extradition cases. Extradition treaties between countries typically include a list of specific extraditable crimes, such as murder, assault, rape, and other serious offenses. Successor governments usually honor these treaty obligations, making extradition efforts challenging but generally successful. The curr_chunk lists specific extraditable crimes including sexual offenses, unlawful abortion, procuration, kidnapping, robbery, burglary, larceny, embezzlement, and obtaining property by deceit or force. The curr_chunk lists various crimes such as bribery, extortion, fraud, false statements, arson, and offenses related to counterfeiting or forgery. The curr_chunk discusses offenses such as endangering transportation safety, piracy, property damage, tax evasion, and spreading false information affecting commodity prices. Unlawful abuse of official authority resulting in harm to individuals or property, including false statements about economic conditions of commercial entities through public channels or official communications. Most modern extradition treaties feature a dual criminality approach, making all felonies extraditable. These treaties also include provisions denying extradition for military and political offenses, with the exception of offenses like desertion that have no civilian equivalent. The exception is relatively recent and unnecessary in treaties listing specific extraditable offenses. The political offense exception in extradition treaties has been a common feature for almost a century and a half. While the military offense exception has been infrequent and untroubled, the political offense exception has proven more troublesome. American courts typically require fugitives to demonstrate that alleged crimes were committed in order to avoid extradition. Contemporary extradition treaties often address the political offense exception by excluding terrorist offenses, extending the exception to politically motivated prosecutions, and incorporating enumerated offenses. Multinational agreements may limit the reach of political exceptions and specify that certain activities are not considered political. Several nations have abolished capital punishment and may deny extradition in capital cases, even without specific treaty provisions. Some countries oppose capital punishment or the associated procedures, leading to reluctance in extraditing individuals in capital cases. This opposition is often supported by multinational agreements, even if extradition treaties do not address this issue explicitly. Dual criminality in extradition treaties addresses the reluctance to extradite a fugitive for conduct considered innocent by the host nation. Historically, extradition treaties have handled dual criminality in various ways, such as listing extraditable offenses or requiring dual criminality provisions. Today, most international agreements prevent extradition if the offense is not recognized as punishable by both nations. The United States favors honoring extradition requests if possible, believing dual criminality does not require identical crime names or liability scopes in both countries. Dual criminality may be satisfied when a foreign country seeks to extradite a fugitive from the United States. When a country seeks to extradite a fugitive from the United States, dual criminality may be satisfied by federal or state law. Some extradition treaties address jurisdictional elements and allow for attempts or conspiracies to be extraditable offenses, including tax and customs crimes. Crimes are typically defined by the laws of the place where they occur, with exceptions allowing nations to outlaw and punish conduct occurring elsewhere. The United States claims broader extraterritorial application for its criminal laws due to terrorism and drug trafficking. Negotiating new treaty provisions for extradition has had mixed success, with some treaties allowing extradition regardless of where the offense was committed, while others permit denial based on conflicting views on extraterritorial jurisdiction. The United States faces challenges in extraditing its own nationals due to extraterritorial jurisdiction. Recent treaties suggest progress in overcoming this obstacle. U.S. extradition agreements typically include provisions allowing extradition of all persons, with judicial and executive interpretation considering nationals under this category. Additionally, some treaties state that neither party is obligated to extradite its own citizens or subjects. Congress has enacted legislation to address issues arising from judicial interpretations. The United States has enacted legislation to address challenges in extraditing its own nationals, overcoming obstacles related to extraterritorial jurisdiction. Treaty provisions vary on the extradition of citizens, with some allowing extradition at the discretion of the executive authority. Variants of these provisions include exemptions based on nationality for nonviolent crimes or listed offenses, as well as conflicting obligations under multinational agreements. The extradition of U.S. nationals can be complex due to conflicting obligations under multinational agreements. Extradition treaties may include clauses to prevent double punishment or double jeopardy. The new model limits extradition exemptions to fugitives convicted or acquitted of the same offense. The extradition treaties may preclude extradition if prosecution for the offense charged has become barred by lapse of time under the applicable law. US courts generally hold that a time-bar of one state does not bar extradition if the treaty does not mention the effect of a lapse of time. Some extradition treaties specify that the passage of time does not prevent extradition, while others leave it to the discretion of the requested state. In cases governed by U.S. law, statutes of limitations and due process determine if delays affect prosecution, and speedy trial provisions govern post-indictment delays. U.S. extradition treaties also address expenses, legal representation, evidence transfer, and fugitive transit. Contemporary U.S. extradition treaties often include provisions regarding expenses, legal representation, and the transit of fugitives through third countries. The distribution of costs is typically outlined in the treaty, with the country seeking extradition responsible for translation and transportation expenses, while the country of refuge covers other costs and legal representation. The extradition treaties allow for the transfer of evidence even if the fugitive is unavailable for extradition, and permit transportation of a fugitive through third countries without following formal extradition procedures. The Constitution limits the judicial power of the United States to certain cases and controversies, causing discomfort when federal courts intervene in executive or legislative processes. The extradition process involves the discretion of the Secretary of State following judicial certification. Courts have rejected the suggestion that it violates the separation of powers, likening it to issuing search or arrest warrants. A foreign country initiates extradition by submitting a request to the State Department, sometimes informally asking for provisional arrest to prevent the fugitive from fleeing. The extradition process involves the Secretary of State's discretion after judicial certification. The Department of Justice handles the arrest procedure for the fugitive, with the Assistant United States Attorney obtaining a warrant and the fugitive being brought before a judge for a hearing to determine extraditability. Bond is typically opposed by the government in extradition cases. The extradition process involves a hearing to determine extraditability, followed by notification to the foreign government for transfer of the fugitive. The fugitive can petition for a writ of habeas corpus, and extradition may be stayed by court order. Extradition treaties may authorize provisional arrest requests. Extradition treaties may allow provisional arrest of a fugitive before a formal extradition request. The fugitive is typically not eligible for bail except in rare circumstances. The extradition hearing process involves determining the validity of the extradition treaty, confirming the identity of the individual sought, verifying the extraditability of the offense, ensuring double criminality, and establishing probable cause. An extradition hearing is a preliminary examination to determine if there is probable cause to hold a defendant for the commission of an offense, following specific treaty requirements and statutory procedures. It is not a final trial to convict or acquit the accused, but rather to justify their surrender to the demanding nation. The extradition hearing is held to determine probable cause for the offense covered by the treaty. Rules of criminal procedure do not apply, and evidence like warrants and depositions are admissible. Affirmative defenses are irrelevant, hearsay is allowed, and rights to a speedy trial or due process may be delayed. Due process will prevent extradition of informants. Extradition hearings determine probable cause for offenses covered by treaties. Due process prevents extradition of informants promised confidentiality and provided evidence for probable cause. The \"noninquiry rule\" certifies extradition without examining the requesting country's justice system or potential mistreatment of the extraditee. The extradition process involves a certification by the court to the Secretary of State if legal requirements are met, with limited review available under habeas corpus. Appellate courts only assess if there is any evidence supporting the magistrate's probable cause determination. The extradition process involves limited review under habeas corpus, with appellate courts assessing evidence of probable cause. Treaties or statutes may modify limitations on review, such as the U.N. Convention Against Torture and the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998. Arguments have been made that these laws operate as exceptions to the noninquiry rule, but have had limited success in appellate courts. The Fourth Circuit and Ninth Circuit had differing opinions on the review of fugitive torture claims under FARRA. The Secretary of State has discretion in deciding whether to release or surrender a fugitive for extradition. Treaty and statute outline the surrender procedure, including the release of the prisoner if not claimed within a specified time. Extradition treaties outline surrender procedures, including releasing the prisoner if not claimed within a specified time. The Department of State handles extradition requests for trial or serving a criminal sentence, governed by the laws of the country of refuge and the extradition treaty. The Justice Department's Office of International Affairs approves extradition requests for fugitives from federal charges or convictions. The process involves determining the fugitive's extraditability based on the country of refuge and the existence of an extradition treaty. Extradition is dependent on the existence of a treaty that permits it, with common impediments including citizenship, dual criminality, statutes of limitation, and capital punishment issues. Some treaties allow countries to refuse extradition of their citizens, and the extraditability of a crime depends on the nature of the offense and where it was committed. Timing and location of the crime also play a role in extradition decisions. Timing is crucial in extradition cases within the U.S., with speedy trial requirements and limitations on prosecution. Some treaties prohibit extradition for capital offenses, while others allow it with the assurance that the death penalty won't be imposed. Provisional arrest can be requested by prosecutors to prevent flight, even before formal extradition documentation is prepared. The Justice Department advises cautious use of provisional arrest due to potential pressures. The Criminal Resource Manual provides guidelines for prosecutors applying for provisional arrest in extradition cases, including the required documentation such as prosecutor's affidavit, identification evidence, certified documentation of conviction, and relevant statutes. The required documentation for extradition cases includes certified copies of arrest warrants, indictments, evidence of identity, and guilt, which are forwarded to the State Department for approval. After extradition, the fugitive may be subject to limitations such as the doctrine of specialty, which allows them to be tried only for offenses described in the extradition treaty or the offense they were charged with during extradition proceedings. This limitation is included in many treaties to ensure a fair trial process. The doctrine of specialty limits prosecution to offenses described in the extradition treaty or charged during extradition proceedings. It may not prevent prosecution for additional counts of the same offense or affect federal sentencing guidelines. The rule does not bar prosecution for crimes committed post-extradition, but its benefits are disputed among circuits. Some courts have ruled that a fugitive lacks standing to claim specialty violation if extradited under a non-treaty agreement. The surrendering State may consent to trial for crimes other than those for which extradition was had, even without an extradition treaty. Waiver or \"simplified\" treaty provisions allow a fugitive to consent to extradition without a hearing, which is a less controversial alternative. Removal of aliens under immigration law is different from extradition, as it is based on the sovereign authority of the removing country. The United States has the authority to remove nonnationals who do not meet legal criteria for entry or stay in the country. This process, similar to deportation, is used when extradition is not possible. U.S. immigration procedures are less accommodating and are typically used for aliens wanted for extradition. In some cases, the U.S. may deposit the alien in a country other than the one seeking extradition. In cases where extradition is not possible, the United States may resort to denaturalization, deportation, or \"irregular rendition\" as alternatives. Irregular rendition involves kidnaping or deceit and is usually reserved for terrorists or drug traffickers. Kidnaping a defendant overseas for trial does not affect U.S. jurisdiction, nor does it typically lead to liability under the Federal Tort Claims Act or the Alien Tort Statute. The United States may resort to irregular rendition, involving kidnaping or deceit, when extradition is not possible. This method can strain diplomatic relations and lead to foreign prosecution of individuals involved. Controversy has arisen over renditions to countries with harsh interrogation techniques, especially during the George W. Bush Administration. The United States engages in irregular renditions when extradition is not feasible, often involving noncitizens seized outside the country. Legal limitations are fewer for noncitizens, but conspiring to commit torture via rendition is prohibited. If extradition is not an option, trial within the country of refuge is considered. Trial within the country of refuge is considered when extradition from the United States is not possible, especially when the fugitive's nationality is a factor or when the crime can be prosecuted by either country. This alternative can be complex, costly, and may go against U.S. policy objectives."
