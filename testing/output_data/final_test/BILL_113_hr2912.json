    "content": "The \"Afghanistan Suspension and Debarment Reform Act\" allows the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction to have suspension and debarment authority under certain circumstances. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 is amended to include a process for suspension and debarment referrals by the Inspector General to the lead agency. The Interagency Committee on Debarment and Suspension and congressional committees are notified in such cases. The Inspector General refers potential suspension or debarment cases involving Afghan or foreign nationals/companies to the lead agency. If the Inspector General cannot determine the lead agency, the Interagency Committee resolves the issue as per the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009. Foreign nationals or companies in Afghanistan receiving funds from covered prime contracts or subcontracts fall under specific definitions outlined in the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009. The lead agency must accept or decline a suspension or debarment case within 30 days of referral under a covered prime contract. If the lead agency declines or fails to respond, the Interagency Committee will make a determination. The Interagency Committee must determine within 45 days if the Inspector General will lead a case referred to them. If the lead agency accepts the case, they have 60 days to decide on suspension or debarment. The Interagency Committee must decide if the Inspector General will lead a case within 45 days. If accepted, the lead agency has 60 days to determine suspension or debarment. If the lead agency declines, they must provide written notification and rationale to congressional committees within 15 days. The Inspector General or their designee may suspend or debar a person from Federal Government procurement or nonprocurement activities in accordance with regulations, including the Federal Acquisition Regulation and Office of Management and Budget guidelines. The Inspector General or their designee may grant an exception allowing a person debarred or suspended to participate in a specific contract, grant, or procurement activity. A written notification and rationale for the exception must be submitted to congressional committees. The committees specified are the Committees on Foreign Affairs and Oversight and Government Reform in the House of Representatives, and the Committees on Foreign Relations and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs in the Senate. The term 'Interagency Committee on Debarment and Suspension' refers to the committee established under Executive Order No. 12549. The amendments made by this Act, as specified in sections 4 and 5 of Executive Order No. 12549, must be published in the Federal Register within 30 days of submission. These amendments will take effect upon the enactment of the Act. The Comptroller General of the United States will conduct a study on the authority and process provided under a specific Act and submit a report to Congress with recommendations on the suspension and debarment system of the Federal Government within one year of the enactment of this Act."
