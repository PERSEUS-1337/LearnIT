    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Illegal Transshipments Enforcement Act of 2002\". It includes findings and a stated purpose. Congress finds that the United States textile and apparel sector, employing approximately 1,000,000 workers, is severely impacted by smuggling and transshipment of products, leading to job losses and billions of dollars in illegal activities. China and other Asian countries have a history of illegally shipping goods to the US, with a new trend involving duty evasion through countries with free trade agreements. The United States textile and apparel industry is harmed by agreements with lax enforcement in in-transit or in bond programs. A 1999 report highlighted the risks of goods passing through the US without sufficient information for admissibility decisions. Existing statutes, regulations, and sentencing guidelines are inadequate to deter criminal or civil violations related to the import and export of goods and contraband. Criminal sanctions for fraud schemes do not provide a deterrent, as violators see them as minor obstacles. Criminals can evade federal clearance and inspection processes through underreporting or misreporting. The lack of inspectors and criminal investigations has not kept pace with the increasing trade volume. The lack of effective cargo control and limited inspections due to short staffing and technology have negative economic consequences. The purpose of the Act is to establish new guidelines to deter commercial fraud in the United States, especially in textile and apparel products. SEC. 3. Customs enforcement for in-transit goods and cargo theft. The Secretary of the Treasury mandates inspections for 1 out of every 10 containers imported into the US, prearrival electronic filing of documentation, technology screening for goods in transit, and exportation document requirements. The Commissioner of the Customs Service establishes procedures to physically verify in-transit goods exiting the United States and coordinates with foreign Customs Services for verification. Random inspections are conducted on at least 1 out of every 10 transit goods. Random inspections of 1 out of every 10 containers carried on various transportation modes are required for in-transit goods. Security checks for employees involved in import/export are mandatory. Penalties for violations involving textile goods must not be reduced. Establishing penalties for mis-description of textile and apparel products on entry documents, manifests, or in-bond/in-transit documentation is considered fraud and will not be mitigated. The penalty is the domestic value of the goods. Increasing the number of field agents, import specialists, and inspectors dedicated to fraud and cargo enforcement to 25% of total Customs Service employees is recommended. Cargo enforcement teams should be established with agents, inspectors, and import specialists dedicated to this function. Establish a cargo fraud enforcement unit in the Customs Service headquarters composed of special agents, inspectors, and import specialists dedicated to managing and overseeing the program. Inspections at ports should be conducted, with rail inspection facilities established near border entry points for container traffic. SEC. 4. PUNISHMENT OF CARGO THEFT. SEC. 4 amends Section 659 of title 18, United States Code by removing the term \"with intent to convert to his own use,\" adding new categories like \"trailer\" and \"air cargo container,\" and increasing the penalty from one year to three years for cargo theft. The amendment to Section 659 of title 18, United States Code removes the term \"with intent to convert to his own use,\" adds new categories like \"trailer\" and \"air cargo container,\" and increases the penalty from one year to three years for cargo theft. Additionally, it establishes an affirmative defense for individuals who bought, received, or possessed goods with the intent to report the matter to law enforcement or the owner. The United States Sentencing Commission will review and amend the Federal Sentencing Guidelines to enhance them in accordance with the changes made to Section 659 of title 18, United States Code."
