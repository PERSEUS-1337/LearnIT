    "content": "On April 9, 2018, the Senate approved H.R. 3445, the African Growth and Opportunity Act and Millennium Challenge Act Modernization Act, authorizing the MCC to conduct regional compacts. The MCC Board approved a $35 million program for Togo focusing on information technology and land tenure reforms, with a directive to monitor citizen rights. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 provided $905 million for the MCC, while the Trump Administration's FY2019 budget request included $800 million, a decrease of $105 million. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) received $800 million in the FY2019 budget request, a decrease of $105 million from previous levels. Timor-Leste was selected for a compact, The Gambia for a threshold program, and several countries were reselected to continue developing their compacts. The MCC focuses on linking economic development to free market principles and democratic policies through reform measures. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) implements a competitive selection process based on free market and democratic policies, with funds segregated from U.S. foreign policy objectives. Recipient countries develop program proposals with civil society involvement, implement MCC-funded programs, and focus on poverty reduction through economic growth. Compact projects are limited to five years with upfront funding, emphasizing measurable impact and public transparency. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) was established in 2004 as an independent government entity with a commitment to reach an annual aid level of $5 billion, which was never fully met. The agency is led by a Chief Executive Officer and overseen by a Board of Directors chaired by the Secretary of State. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) was established in 2004 with a commitment to reach an annual aid level of $5 billion. The MCC is chaired by the Secretary of State and includes the Secretary of the Treasury, the USAID Administrator, the U.S. Trade Representative, the Corporation's CEO, and four individuals from the private sector appointed by the President. The 115th Congress may consider MCC funding, reauthorization, and operational issues. The MCC's unique country selection process involves identifying candidate countries, formulating eligibility criteria, and selecting compact and threshold program-eligible countries. The pool of possible candidate countries for Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) funding is limited to those below the World Bank's upper-middle income threshold. For FY2018, this includes 83 countries with a Gross National Income (GNI) per capita of $3,955. Country income levels play a crucial role in both financing and competitive selection processes, with a maximum of 25% of compact assistance available in a fiscal year. The MCC legislative authority limits compact assistance to 25% for lower-middle-income countries, discouraging their selection. The high volatility of a country's income level data causes uncertainty, with countries transitioning between income levels facing funding caps. This abrupt shift disrupts the compact development process, leading to a diminishing pool of eligible candidates for funding. To address the issue of income category changes, recent appropriations legislation redefined low-income countries as the bottom 75 countries in the low- and lower-middle-income rankings, expanding eligibility for funding. This change aims to prevent funding caps for countries transitioning between income levels, ensuring a larger pool of well-governed candidates for lower-income funding. Countries below the World Bank's cut-off ceiling for lower-middle-income countries are defined as lower-middle income in MCC terms. In FY2018, 74 countries are considered low income and 9 countries are considered lower-middle income. The FY2017 appropriations language requires a graduated transition for countries moving between income levels. Under the MCC authorization, countries may be candidates only if they meet certain criteria. For FY2018, the MCC listed 66 low-income countries and 9 lower-middle-income countries as candidates for funding. Countries must meet specific criteria to be eligible for MCC assistance, and some are excluded due to legislative prohibitions. Low-income countries compete with each other, as do lower-middle-income countries, for compact eligibility. The original income level definitions in the MCC authorization still apply. In FY2018, 75 candidate countries are competing for MCC assistance based on performance in governance, human rights, education, and economic freedom. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) selects countries for assistance based on their performance in governance, human rights, education, and economic freedom. Indicators are used to measure a nation's record in these areas, with data points reflecting factors like inflation rates and government effectiveness. MCC faces challenges in measuring performance due to data availability constraints. Each year, the Corporation provides Congress with an overview of its activities. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) annually sends Congress an overview of criteria and methodology for determining candidate countries' eligibility for assistance. Indicator scores have become a priority for some countries, known as the \"MCC effect,\" prompting reforms to meet MCC criteria. Periodically, new indicators are introduced or existing ones are modified. The MCC periodically introduces new indicators and modifies existing ones to improve quality and better reflect congressional intent. Changes in the selection process, such as lowering the inflation rate threshold and replacing indicators, aim to make it more challenging for countries to pass the eligibility test. For example, the MCC replaced a \"country credit rating\" with an indicator on the \"cost of starting a business\" to encourage governments to take action to improve their scores. This led to a decrease in the median for the category of \"days to start a business\" as candidate countries implemented business start-up reforms. In FY2008, the MCC combined indicators for \"days to start a business\" and \"cost of starting a business\" into one \"business start-up\" indicator. Lawmakers included additional criteria in the 2004 MCC authorizing legislation, such as recognizing rights of people with disabilities, respecting worker rights, sustainable management of natural resources, and social investments in women and girls. The MCC used supplemental data and qualitative information to assess compact eligibility based on these factors, leading to the development of new indicators. In FY2005, a new indicator for girls' primary education completion rates replaced a broader measure used in FY2004. In FY2008, indicators for sustainable natural resource management policies were adopted. Significant changes to selection methods were made in FY2011 for FY2012 process and continued in FY2018. Modifications and additions were made to indicators under all three baskets, including a new \"freedom of information\" indicator and split \"natural resource management\" indicator. The MCC made changes to its indicators, including splitting the natural resource protection indicator and adding a child health indicator. The indicator for girls' education was adjusted for lower-middle-income countries. Two new indicators were added to the Economic Freedom category. The MCC publishes a scorecard of candidate country performance after releasing the performance criteria. The MCC publishes a scorecard of candidate country performance based on performance indicators. Countries must meet absolute thresholds for certain indicators like \"inflation rate\" and \"political rights\" to qualify for compact assistance. Passing at least half of the 20 indicators is required, with two \"hard hurdles\" including the \"control of corruption\" indicator. To qualify for compact assistance from the MCC, countries must pass certain hurdles, including the \"control of corruption\" indicator and either the \"civil liberties\" or \"political rights\" indicator. Countries must also pass at least one indicator in each of the three baskets to avoid eligibility concerns. The MCC Board has discretion in selecting countries based on performance trends, data availability, and recent policy actions. Countries being considered for second compacts by the MCC are evaluated based on their history of implementing the first compact and their income status. The MCC Board announced in 2009 that countries moving from low to lower-middle-income status would be judged relative to both income groups for three years to mitigate negative effects on the selection process. This supplemental information is used alongside performance evaluations. The MCC Board evaluates countries for compact eligibility based on their history of implementing previous compacts and income status. Passing qualifying indicators does not guarantee selection due to limited funding. Reasons for non-selection include scoring poorly in certain indicators. For example, the Philippines failed to qualify in FY2005 due to low scores in health expenditures and fiscal policy. In FY2006, Bhutan and Vietnam did not meet the criteria for selection due to low scores on political rights and civil liberties. Uganda passed 12 out of 16 indicators but was not chosen for unexplained reasons. Some countries have been deemed compact eligible despite not meeting all qualifying factors, with the MCC Board considering recent policy changes or positive trends. For example, in FY2004, countries like Georgia, Mozambique, and Bolivia were selected despite failing the corruption indicator. In FY2004, Mozambique was chosen for MCC funding despite failing on corruption and \"investing in people\" indicators. The Board considered supplemental data showing commitment to fighting corruption. Cape Verde scored poorly on \"trade policy\" but showed progress towards joining the WTO. Lesotho had issues with \"days to start a business\" but improved business formation processes. Georgia was invited for a second compact despite failing in \"investing in people.\" The MCC Board considered a proposal for a second compact despite previous failures in the \"investing in people\" indicator. Jordan, a possible choice for funding, faced criticism for low scores in political rights and civil liberties. Despite being a large recipient of U.S. aid and not a democracy, Jordan performed well in other indicators. The MCC Board has a history of selecting and then de-selecting countries for aid based on qualifying scores and other factors. The Gambia and Sri Lanka were both eliminated from consideration due to deteriorating conditions and civil strife, respectively. Jordan, despite criticism for its political rights and civil liberties, remains a potential recipient of MCC assistance. In the selection round, the MCC Board decided not to reselect Bolivia, Timor-Leste, and Ukraine for compact eligibility due to various reasons such as corruption indicators and political tensions. Benin and Sierra Leone were also not reselected for failing the \"control of corruption\" indicator. Tanzania was suspended from further consideration for a second compact due to behavior raising concerns about adherence to development standards. Some countries have remained compact eligible despite failing performance indicators. For example, Indonesia failed indicators in FY2010 and FY2011 but remained eligible by being judged as a lower-income country. Liberia and Morocco also remained eligible despite failing half the indicators, with the expectation to pass before compact approval. The MCC has seen improvements in compact countries' performance indicators over the years. Despite initial failures, many countries remained eligible for compacts. Only a few countries failed indicators in recent years, showing progress in meeting requirements. The MCC argues that performance indicators are imperfect measures of a country's policies and can fluctuate due to various factors. Shifts in income groups and introduction of new criteria can impact a country's scores. In FY2018, the MCC Board selected Timor-Leste, Sri Lanka, and Tunisia for compacts, and Burkina Faso, Lesotho, Mongolia, and Senegal for second compacts. The Gambia was chosen for a threshold program. Timor-Leste's positive scorecard performance led to its elevation to compact status. Mongolia improved its \"control of corruption\" indicator to qualify for a compact agreement. Lesotho's status decision was deferred in FY2016. In FY2015, Lesotho was made eligible for MCC assistance, but its status decision was deferred in FY2016 due to governance concerns. Despite being allowed to develop a compact, no new financial resources were provided. Improved performance on the FY2018 scorecard led to the restoration of Lesotho's eligibility. The Philippines, eligible in FY2016, decided not to move forward with a second compact due to concerns about the rule of law and civil liberties. MCC compacts are grant agreements lasting five years, proposed by selected countries and approved by the MCC Board. Currently, there are 33 compacts in 27 countries worth over $11.7 billion. Projects focus on infrastructure, with 26% of funding allocated to the transport sector. Active compacts are in 9 countries, with 2 more set to enter into force in the next two years. In 2017, MCC funding was allocated as follows: 26% for transport, 17% for agriculture, 16% for energy, 14% for health, education, and community services, 9% for water supply and sanitation, 6% for governance, and 1% for financial services. Sub-Saharan Africa received the majority of MCC spending. Guidelines and procedures are followed by all MCC compact countries for project development. Eligible countries can prepare and negotiate program proposals with the MCC. The MCC funding allocation in 2017 was distributed across various sectors, with Sub-Saharan Africa receiving the majority. Eligible countries can prepare and negotiate program proposals with the MCC, with compact development expected to take about 27 months. Compact proposals must demonstrate a strong link between economic growth, poverty reduction, and receive funding through a competitive selection process. The MCC expects proposals to discuss a country's strategy for economic growth, how MCC aid will overcome impediments, and the goals to be achieved during implementation. The compact development process involves public/private dialogue, program management, donor activities, project examples, financial planning, and country commitment to MCC indicators. Countries appoint an entity to coordinate proposal formulation and maintain contact with the MCC. Political commitment from country leadership is crucial for compact success. The compact development entity, in collaboration with MCC economists or consultants, conducts an analysis to identify key constraints to economic growth and poverty reduction. This process includes nationwide discussions to ensure country-ownership and public participation in developing MCC programs. In Namibia, the National Planning Commission identified 500 issues through public discussions. The compact development entity identified 500 issues through public discussions on unlocking economic development. Burkina Faso's consultations involved 3,100 people in all 13 regions. Concept papers are developed based on these ideas, with feedback from MCC to stay within parameters. Compact proposals are the eventual results, often exceeding budget capacity, leading to further prioritization and elimination of options. Tanzania suggested a $2 billion package, with irrigation and education options eliminated. Namibia's initial proposal of $415 million was reduced to $305 million by eliminating irrigated agriculture and roads projects. The MCC provides precompact development grants to assist countries in preparing compact proposals. For example, Jordan received a $13.34 million grant for feasibility studies. The MCC conducts due diligence reviews on compact proposals, assessing costs, impacts, and economic rates of return. Sustainability issues must be addressed, such as establishing road funds or fuel levies for maintenance. Honduras increased its road maintenance budget as a condition of its compact. The MCC conducts due diligence reviews on compact proposals, assessing costs, impacts, and economic rates of return. The MCC negotiates a final compact agreement prior to its approval by the MCC Board. When the compact enters into force, the clock begins on compact implementation and the total funds proposed are formally obligated. MCC has increasingly front-loaded planning activities before compact signing, including feasibility studies and project design. In Burkina Faso, early action on staff and planning allowed 60% of procurement to be initiated before compact entry-into-force. The accountable entity, known as the MCA, oversees compact management with government and nongovernment officials on its board. The MCA in Tanzania was a government parastatal established under presidential decree. In Tanzania, the MCA was a government parastatal established under the Ministry of Finance, while in Namibia, it was a unit within the National Planning Commission. MCA staff handle fiscal and procurement duties, which can be contracted out or done in-house. The MCA ensures accountability through audits, monitoring, and evaluation, and also oversees environmental, gender, and social requirements in the compact agreement. The MCA faces challenges due to a strict five-year timetable and limited budget in most developing countries. The MCC procurement processes in developing countries are time-consuming and challenging, causing delays in implementation. The MCA signs numerous contracts each year to procure equipment, construct infrastructure, and obtain technical expertise. To ensure transparency and prevent corruption, MCC-approved rules mandate competitive bidding from all firms based on World Bank procedures. The MCC-approved rules for procurement involve transparent, competitive bidding from firms of all nationalities. U.S. firms have won the most contracts, accounting for roughly 12% of the total value. MCC-supported procurements are fixed-price contracts, with strict standards and guidelines in place. Independent evaluation panels are selected for each procurement, ensuring technical expertise and approval from the MCC. Several countries have adopted this methodology for their own procurements. Several countries, including Cape Verde and Honduras, are implementing MCC guidelines for procurement in their public procurements. The MCC has a small in-country staff and hires independent engineering consultants for oversight of infrastructure projects. Close cooperation and guidance from MCC Washington headquarters is provided throughout implementation to reduce corruption risks. Funding is transferred directly to contractors periodically after project performance evaluations. Payment for MCC contracts is made by the U.S. Treasury, not the compact country. Impact and performance evaluations are conducted on each project component within a compact, with results made public. Changes to compact plans may be necessary due to external factors like currency fluctuations and rising costs. The MCC faced funding challenges for infrastructure projects, leading to scaled-back plans and reallocations of funds. Projects in Ghana, Tanzania, and Mozambique were affected by increased costs and insufficient allocations. The MCC is implementing measures to address potential changes in projects. Changes in country policy performance may have serious consequences, leading to potential suspension or termination of MCC programs. Countries must maintain a level of performance close to that which made them eligible for MCC assistance. The CEO has the authority to suspend or terminate aid if certain criteria are not met. The CEO has the authority to suspend or terminate MCC aid if the receiving country engages in activities contrary to US national security interests, shows a pattern of inconsistent actions, or fails to adhere to its compact responsibilities. This policy applies to all MCC assistance provided through compacts and threshold agreements. Termination can occur if the government's actions are inconsistent with eligibility criteria. The MCC has strict foreign assistance restrictions in place, including aid limitations for countries experiencing a military coup. Violations of performance rules can result in warnings, program holds, suspension, or termination by the Board of Directors. Termination can occur if a government's actions are inconsistent with eligibility criteria. The MCC Department of Policy and Evaluation reviews possible violations of MCC standards and presents recommendations to the Board of Directors for decisions on holding, suspending, or terminating programs. The Board may not always follow the recommendations. The MCC has suspended or terminated programs in cases such as Niger, Yemen, and Mauritania due to governance criteria violations or aid prohibitions on governments deposed by a coup. Eligibility for compacts was suspended in Mauritania (2008) and the Gambia (June 2006) due to governance concerns. Compacts were terminated in Nicaragua (June 2009), Honduras (September 2009), Madagascar (May 2009), and Armenia (2008) for various reasons. The Mali compact was put on hold in March. The MCC Board suspended the Malawi compact in March 2012 due to actions inconsistent with democratic governance criteria. The suspension was lifted in June 2012 after improvements in democratic behavior. The MCC takes violations of its performance standards seriously, as shown by previous instances of program suspension and termination. The MCC has faced challenges in ensuring democratic governance criteria are met by compact-eligible countries. Despite past instances of non-compliance, the MCC plans to allocate funds for new compacts in FY2018, including one for Mongolia focusing on water-related issues. The MCC plans to allocate funds for new compacts in FY2018, including ones for Senegal, Sri Lanka, and Burkina Faso. Senegal's compact focuses on energy infrastructure, Sri Lanka's on transportation and land access, and Burkina Faso's on energy quality and cost. These compacts are expected to be considered by the Board in 2018 and 2019. The MCC plans to allocate funds for new compacts in FY2018 for Senegal, Sri Lanka, and Burkina Faso, focusing on energy infrastructure, transportation, land access, and energy quality. A constraints analysis for Tunisia identified issues for a $292 million compact, including market controls, labor regulations, and water scarcity. Threshold programs aim to assist candidate countries in becoming compact eligible by addressing qualifying indicators like corruption concerns. The MCC did not select new countries for threshold eligibility in FY2010 and did not request funding for the program in FY2011. A new approach was announced in September 2010, focusing on resolving policy constraints to economic growth. Threshold programs now prioritize reforms in problem sectors to assess a country's capacity for future compacts. Congress limited threshold program funding to not more than 10% of 2004 MCC allocations. In the MCC authorizing legislation, Congress limited threshold program funding to 10% of 2004 MCC appropriations. Since FY2012, 5% of new MCC appropriations have been allocated for threshold assistance. The MCC advocated for restoring the 10% cap for more flexibility. FY2014 and FY2016 appropriations included provisions affecting threshold program eligibility, such as prohibiting countries with previous compact programs from participating. The MCC opposed the threshold eligibility granted to Honduras for FY2012 and suggested that such programs may be preferable to no engagement. Madagascar, a former compact country, could be a good candidate for a threshold program but is currently prohibited by appropriations provision. Tunisia, previously granted threshold eligibility, graduated to upper-middle-income status and no longer qualifies as a candidate country. In FY2017, the MCC advocated for the removal of a provision restricting its authority, allowing Tunisia to qualify for compact eligibility. As of April 2018, 29 threshold programs totaling over $600 million were being conducted in 27 countries, with some countries progressing to receive compacts. Funding levels for threshold programs vary, with countries like Guyana receiving $6.7 million and Indonesia receiving $55 million. Currently, only Honduras, Guatemala, Sierra Leone, Togo, and Kosovo are actively receiving threshold assistance. Sierra Leone, Togo, and Kosovo are actively receiving threshold assistance. The Gambia is the only threshold-eligible country. Mauritania and Yemen lost their threshold eligibility, Niger had its program suspended. The MCC released a strategy document in 2016 outlining priority goals. The MCC plans to improve its analysis during compact development, integrate environmental and social factors in poverty reduction strategies, push for partner government reforms, and broaden public and private partnerships for more impact. The MCC aims to explore multicountry investments, work with local governments and other U.S. government agencies, foster public-private partnerships, engage with foundations and corporations, and encourage U.S. companies to participate in compact procurements. It will focus on data, results measurement, transparency, and development effectiveness, improve its ability to measure systemic impacts and track gender and social inclusion goals, identify countries with high poverty rates accurately, and share its data-driven approach with other organizations. The MCC also promises to maximize internal efficiency, productivity, and maintain a high-functioning staff. The MCC aims to improve its efficiency and effectiveness by strengthening its staff and management capabilities. Concerns have been raised about its funding, operations, project sustainability, procurement, and corruption risk. The MCC has not reached the expected funding level of $5 billion per year, with enacted appropriations often below the President's request. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget request included $800 million for the MCC. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget request included $800 million for the MCC, a cut of $105 million from FY2017 levels. The House and Senate both proposed funding levels for the MCC in FY2018, with the House matching the Administration's request and the Senate providing $905 million, $105 million more than requested. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 provided $905 million for the MCC, the same as in FY2017. The Trump Administration's FY2019 budget request included $800 million for the MCC, a cut of $105 million from FY2018 levels. Proposals have been made to expand the MCC's partnerships and activities to better meet its poverty reduction mandate. The MCC Board supports developing regionally oriented partnerships, especially in South Asia, to potentially increase returns on investments and support trade. The MCC proposed legislation in its FY2016, FY2017, and FY2018 budget presentations to allow for concurrent compacts in individual countries, arguing that the existing authorization limiting them to one compact at a time hinders regionally oriented programs. Bills supporting regional-purpose compacts were introduced in Congress, with H.R. 3445 being approved in 2018 to modernize the African Growth and Opportunity Act and Millennium Challenge Act. The MCC proposed legislation to allow for concurrent compacts in individual countries to facilitate regionally oriented programs. H.R. 3445 was approved in 2018 to modernize the African Growth and Opportunity Act and Millennium Challenge Act, enabling the possibility of regional concurrent compacts. Nepal, currently developing its first compact, is a potential candidate for a regional concurrent compact due to its close relationship with India. The MCC is exploring the possibility of regional concurrent compacts to strengthen economic impact, especially with countries like Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Benin, Niger, Senegal, Burkina Faso, Malawi, and Zambia. However, challenges remain such as timing, budget limitations, and the risk of suspension or termination affecting partner countries. The MCC is considering regional concurrent compacts with countries like Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Benin, Niger, Senegal, Burkina Faso, Malawi, and Zambia. Challenges include timing, budget constraints, and the risk of suspension or termination for partner countries with good policy records. Upper-middle-income countries are currently excluded from MCC programs, but observers argue that wealth distribution is uneven, and the distinction between lower-middle-income and upper-middle-income countries is arbitrary. The MCC faces challenges with timing, budget constraints, and the risk of suspension for partner countries with good policy records. Mongolia's move to upper-middle-income status did not alleviate poverty, leading to debates on redefining income exclusion criteria. Critics argue for a new measure to address significant poverty in relatively wealthier countries. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) focuses on poverty reduction through funding low-income countries. There are suggestions to address poverty at local government levels, requiring new authorization legislation. MCC emphasizes measurable results through cost-benefit analyses and economic rates of return to determine funded projects. Data is collected during implementation to monitor performance, and independent evaluations are conducted at project completion. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) focuses on poverty reduction through funding low-income countries. It emphasizes measurable results through cost-benefit analyses and economic rates of return to determine funded projects. The MCC tracks program outputs and reports quarterly on progress made in achieving performance indicators. Cumulatively from 2004 to September 2017, the agency claims various achievements such as training farmers, building educational facilities, roads, formalizing land rights, and constructing electricity lines. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) has achieved significant outcomes in various projects, including an increase in new registered businesses in Albania and improved enrollment in primary schools in Burkina Faso. The Port of Cotonou modernization project in Benin has resulted in annual savings and decreased customs clearance time. The long-term impact of MCC activities focuses on poverty reduction through increased incomes among the poor. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) has achieved significant outcomes in various projects, such as increased new registered businesses in Albania and improved enrollment in primary schools in Burkina Faso. Independent impact evaluations of compact projects aim to explore the relationship between MCC investments and outcomes to provide lessons for future compacts. Evaluations focus on changes directly attributable to project interventions, while performance evaluations assess program implementation, design, achievements, and decision-making. The first impact evaluations of farmer training programs in five compact countries showed that individual outputs met or exceeded targets, with increases in farm income in three countries. However, household income increases were not identified, possibly due to reallocating income sources or difficulty in measurement. MCC is exploring alternative methods for future evaluations. The MCC is seeking alternative methods to measure household income for future compacts. A 2013 impact evaluation in Georgia showed increased industrial investment near a road construction project, but no impact on household-level income, consumption, or services. Reasons for the lack of impact include poor choice of comparison road, short time frame for measurement, and focus on beneficiaries living near the road. Early impact evaluations have helped MCC improve project design and future evaluations. The MCC claims an impact beyond standard results through the \"MCC effect,\" where countries implement reforms to meet performance indicators. Examples include Yemen's reforms after suspension, Niger passing an indicator by establishing a protected area, and Lesotho improving women's rights due to MCC encouragement. Local compact implementation mechanisms are also highlighted. The establishment of local compact implementation mechanisms, such as the MCAs, has influenced some governments' procurement policies and served a capacity-building function. Countries like Cape Verde and Honduras have adopted the MCC transparent procurement methodology for general use, with Honduras making its local MCA compact implementing institution permanent. These results are reported anecdotally and could be of significant development value if documented and measured appropriately. The GAO has reviewed the MCC's record in predicting and achieving compact outcomes. A 2007 report raised concerns about overestimating impacts in Vanuatu, with projected income rise overstated. The MCC's projections did not establish the extent of benefit to rural poor, and maintenance of projects post-completion was questionable. The MCC defended that the compact would help Vanuatu, despite differing views on the degree of benefit. The GAO reports questioned the quality of data and work on transportation projects in various countries, including Georgia and Benin, funded by the MCC. Sustainability concerns were raised for these projects, emphasizing the importance of assessing the long-term success of development assistance programs. The MCC often conditions compact aid on country adoption of policy reforms to enhance sustainability, such as reforming tariff schedules for electric power services and establishing road funds for upkeep. However, GAO reports questioned the effectiveness of MCC sustainability efforts in completed compacts, citing instances like Cape Verde's road fund meeting only half of maintenance requirements. In Cape Verde, the road fund met only half of maintenance requirements, and water fees for infrastructure maintenance were not collected in one watershed. In Honduras, the national road maintenance budget increase was insufficient. Municipalities responsible for farm-to-market roads lacked resources for maintenance. MCC's compact with Georgia required road maintenance funding, but the government struggled to keep roads operational. Benin's port authority's ability to operate key components was also questioned. The USAID OIG has highlighted sustainability concerns as a top challenge for MCC management. In FY2017, it was noted that the MCC had not provided timely training for Moldovan water user associations to operate compact-funded irrigation systems. The MCC responded by stating that the OIG's concerns were based on outdated information. Actions taken by the MCC to address sustainability included providing training to water user associations, offering post-compact technical support, and securing funding from the government of Moldova for continued operation of the compact implementing agency. The government of Moldova provided funding to continue operation of the local compact implementing agency for two more years. The MCC is concerned about corruption in MCC-funded programs and aims to prevent corrupt contracting to safeguard U.S. aid dollars. Congressional interest in government efforts to combat corruption influences MCC judgment of compact eligibility and implementation. The MCC programs aim to prevent corrupt contracting to safeguard U.S. aid dollars by requiring transparency, competitive processes, and separation of technical and financial elements in bids. They review each decision made by the procurement entity and provide funds directly to contractors. The degree of corruption control is a key indicator for compact funding eligibility, with countries needing to perform above the median level. Passing the indicator does not imply no corruption, but rather a performance level above the median compared to other countries. The MCC Board uses discretion in selecting countries for funding based on various factors, including corruption indicators and recent government actions to address corruption. Countries near or below the median level of corruption may still be selected if mitigating factors are present. Additionally, countries passing the corruption indicator may face scrutiny for alleged corruption incidents. The MCC Board uses discretion in selecting countries for funding based on corruption indicators and recent government actions. In FY2014, Benin and Sierra Leone were dropped from compact consideration due to failing grades on the \"control of corruption\" indicator. Tanzania was warned that its declining corruption score must be reversed with concrete steps for a second compact to be approved. In September 2015, the MCC Board stated that Tanzania needed to pass the corruption indicator for its compact to be considered. Tanzania passed the FY2016 scorecard but its reselection was suspended due to unresolved governance concerns. Kosovo was moved from compact-eligible to threshold eligible status in FY2017 due to a failing grade in corruption. Mongolia, despite not passing the corruption indicator in FY2017, remained compact-eligible but needed to show improvement. Mongolia passed the indicator in FY2018. The MCC has 11 active Board-approved or signed compacts, with key developments provided below. Benin II's $375 million compact focuses on electric power infrastructure. Cote d'Ivoire's $525 million compact targets constraints in education and transport. The $277 million, five-year second compact with El Salvador consists of three projects. One project will address constraints in the investment climate by developing an independent institution for regulatory improvement and building government capacity for public service delivery. Another project will focus on human capital development, education policy reform, and addressing skills needed by the workforce. The second compact with El Salvador includes projects to improve education quality, address labor market needs, and infrastructure development. El Salvador will contribute $88 million to project implementation. The second compact with Georgia focuses on education improvements, skills development, and modernizing science, technology, and math teaching. The compact with Ghana addresses electric power problems through investments in power generation and distribution. The $257 million compact with Liberia targets constraints to economic growth, including lack of reliable electricity and inadequate road infrastructure. The energy project ($201.6 million) will upgrade hydropower facilities and establish an independent regulator, while the roads project ($21.1 million) will create maintenance centers and a road fund administration. The government of Ghana is expected to contribute 7.5% of total funding towards compact implementation. The $350.7 million Malawi compact, signed in April 2011, focuses on electric power sector to reduce outages, costs, and improve the economic environment. It includes upgrading generation and distribution capacity and reforming power supply institutions. The compact was initially put on hold due to concerns about antidemocratic actions by the government but was reinstated by MCC in June 2012. The MCC reinstated its compact with Malawi in 2012 due to a change in leadership and steps towards restoring democracy. The Morocco II compact focuses on secondary education, workforce development, and land policy. The Nepal compact focuses on electric power and transport projects. The Nepal compact focuses on electric power and transport projects, including constructing high voltage transmission lines and substations, strengthening regulatory bodies, improving road maintenance, and addressing water scarcity and trade barriers. The Zambia compact, worth $354.8 million, focuses on water and sanitation in the Lusaka area. The majority of funds will be used for infrastructure rehabilitation, with additional funds allocated for management and policy improvements. The Climate-Resilient Communities project, valued at $96.5 million, aims to enhance livestock value and sales, improve local market infrastructure, and boost agriculture through various initiatives like fertilizer utilization and watershed protection. The MCC is undertaking threshold programs in Guatemala and Honduras. In Guatemala, a $28 million program focuses on increasing government revenue and improving secondary education. In Honduras, a $15.6 million program aims to enhance government financial management.
