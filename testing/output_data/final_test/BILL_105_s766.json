    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Equity in Prescription Insurance and Contraceptive Coverage Act of 1997\". Congress finds that approximately 60 percent of pregnancies in the US are unintended, and contraceptive services are essential for family planning. Studies show that investing in family planning saves public funds in pregnancy and healthcare costs. Contraceptives help reduce the need for abortion and lower rates of infant mortality and maternal morbidity. The National Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality found that using contraception could reduce infant mortality by 10%. Most women in the US rely on private employment-related insurance for medical expenses, but coverage for prescription contraceptives is often excluded. Private insurance offers limited coverage for contraceptives, with only half of traditional plans and preferred provider organizations, 20% of point-of-service networks, and 7% of health maintenance organizations providing coverage. Women of reproductive age spend 68% more than men on out-of-pocket health care costs, mainly due to contraceptives and reproductive health care services. The lack of contraceptive coverage in health insurance leads to unintended pregnancies, as many effective forms of contraceptives become financially out of reach for women. The Institute of Medicine Committee on Unintended Pregnancy recommends reducing financial barriers to contraception by increasing coverage in health insurance policies. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 is amended to include new standards relating to benefits for contraceptives. Group health plans and health insurance issuers cannot exclude benefits for FDA-approved prescription contraceptive drugs or devices, or generic equivalents, if they cover other outpatient prescription drugs. They also cannot exclude benefits for outpatient contraceptive services if they cover other outpatient health care services. Health insurance issuers cannot deny eligibility based on an individual's use of covered items or services, provide incentives to accept less coverage, penalize healthcare professionals for prescribing contraceptives, or offer incentives to individuals. The text prohibits health care professionals from receiving incentives to withhold contraceptive drugs or services from covered individuals. It also clarifies that group health plans can impose cost-sharing for contraceptive drugs. The text ensures that cost-sharing for contraceptive drugs under a health plan cannot exceed the cost-sharing for other outpatient prescription drugs covered by the plan. The text mandates that cost-sharing for outpatient contraceptive services in a health plan must not be higher than cost-sharing for other outpatient health care services covered by the plan. Additionally, it requires group health plans and health insurance issuers to cover experimental or investigational contraceptive drugs, devices, or services. The text mandates that cost-sharing for outpatient contraceptive services in a health plan must not be higher than for other outpatient health care services. It also requires coverage for experimental or investigational contraceptive drugs, devices, or services, with limitations on prescription volume and provider restrictions. The text outlines restrictions on outpatient contraceptive services, including limitations on healthcare professionals, utilization review, second opinions, and preauthorizations. It also specifies notice requirements for group health plans regarding these restrictions.
