    "content": "India is a federal republic with a population of over one billion. Executive power lies with the prime minister and cabinet, while the president has limited executive powers. The Lok Sabha is the main governing body with representatives from all states and union territories. The Rajya Sabha can review legislation but not veto it. National and state legislators serve five-year terms. The political landscape is dominated by two major parties. In recent years, India has seen a shift towards coalitional politics with two major parties, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leading the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and the Congress Party as the key opposition. The 1999 Lok Sabha elections solidified the BJP's position, and in 2004, a national election was held with the NDA calling for early elections to capitalize on positive economic news. In the 2004 Indian elections, the Congress Party led by Sonia Gandhi unexpectedly defeated the ruling NDA coalition. Gandhi declined the position of prime minister and nominated Manmohan Singh, a renowned economist, for the role. Singh became India's first non-Hindu Prime Minister. The election also saw a strong showing by a leftist alliance led by the Communist Party. The 2004 Indian elections saw the Congress Party led by Sonia Gandhi defeating the ruling NDA coalition. A leftist alliance led by the Communist Party of India (Marxist) won 62 seats, mostly from West Bengal and Kerala. The Left Front, although not part of the new UPA government, is supporting it from outside. Investor fears of a coalition government with communists impacting economic reform led to significant stock market losses. The market recovered after assurances from Congress Party leaders of a \"pro-growth, pro-savings, and pro-investment\" government. The 2004 Indian elections resulted in the Congress Party defeating the ruling NDA coalition. Analysts noted that the BJP-led coalition received slightly more votes than the Congress-led alliance. However, significant losses for the NDA-allied Telugu Desam Party and the BJP were seen as a rejection of the NDA's \"India Shining\" campaign. Voters may have felt the NDA was not addressing core issues like power, roads, and water, leading to a rejection of neo-liberal economic reforms. The 2004 Indian elections saw the Congress Party defeating the ruling NDA coalition, with analysts noting a rejection of neo-liberal economic reforms and Hindu nationalism. Sonia Gandhi's decision to pass on the prime ministership was influenced by criticism of her foreign origin and threats from Hindu nationalist groups. The dynastic Congress Party, led by Sonia Gandhi, faced a decline in support due to neglect of grassroots organizations, lack of responsiveness to key groups, rise of regional parties, and corruption allegations. This marked a significant period of time where Congress was out of power in New Delhi. Sonia Gandhi's leadership of the Congress Party faced challenges due to corruption allegations and criticism of her campaign skills. Despite some concerns about her influence, her popularity surged in May 2004. The party sought alliances with secular forces to counter the BJP's development agenda, which was seen as a cover for divisive policies. The new Prime Minister's cabinet ministries are being led by Congress stalwarts, while the BJP's rise in national politics was fueled by Hindu nationalism. Some elements of the BJP, linked to extremist Hindu nationalist groups, were blamed for communal violence incidents. The BJP tried to shift its image from right-wing Hindu nationalist to conservative and moderate during its time in power. The BJP has a moderate wing focused on governance and development, and a hardline wing concerned with Hindu nationalism. Former PM Atal Vajpayee is seen as the leading moderate, while Lal Advani leads the hardline faction with ties to extremist groups. The party's image has shifted from right-wing Hindu nationalist to conservative and moderate, but anti-Muslim riots in Gujarat in 2002 damaged its reputation. The BJP's recent victories were seen as a success of development politics associated with Vajpayee, but the national election results were a setback for the Hindu nationalist project. There was blame on complacency and a call for a new party to represent Hindu interests. The rift between moderates and hardliners was evident in a debate over the removal of Gujarat's Chief Minister, Narendra Modi. The RSS chief rebuked the suggestion for Modi to step down, indicating BJP's hardline stance in opposition. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) holds a significant number of parliamentarians but is mainly influential in West Bengal and Kerala. Despite past rivalry with Congress, they cooperated against BJP in 2004 due to a commitment to secularism. Concerns were raised about communist influence in New Delhi affecting economic reforms, but Indian industrial leaders reassured foreign investors that they are not \"Cuba-style communists.\" Investors reassured that Left Front members are not \"Cuba-style communists\" and are likely to support UPA reform agenda. Regional and caste-based parties gaining importance in Indian politics, with Congress forming alliances with parties like Rashtriya Janata Dal and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam. UPA's ministerial appointments reflect influence of regional parties, focusing on rural issues and center-state relations. Prime Minister Singh emphasizes development as a central priority. Prime Minister Singh prioritizes development in the UPA government, focusing on reducing poverty and increasing employment. Privatization is not part of UPA ideology, and major public sector concerns will not be sold off. The appointment of Palaniappan Chidambaram to head the Finance Ministry and the UPA Common Minimum Program emphasize economic growth and increased investment. The UPA's first budget, released on July 8, was praised by Indian industrial groups for being progressive and forward-looking, with a significant increase in defense expenditures. Prime Minister Singh and External Affairs Minister Natwar Singh have indicated their commitment to economic reforms. The new External Affairs Minister, Natwar Singh, and Prime Minister Singh are focusing on India's immediate neighbors in their foreign policy. They are engaging in the Sri Lankan conflict and assisting Nepal with communist rebels. The India-Pakistan peace initiative remains unaffected by the change in government, with both sides committed to continuing the process. The UPA government will base its relationship with Pakistan on the 1972 Simla Agreement and abide by subsequent accords. Bilateral counternarcotics cooperation and measures to reduce the risk of accidental nuclear war have been agreed upon between India and Pakistan since the new government took office. The new Indian government, under Prime Minister Singh, is focused on improving relations with China and Japan, as well as addressing internal issues such as repealing the controversial Prevention of Terrorism Act. The government is also committed to preventing communal violence and promoting secularism. The UPA government in India aims to address communal violence and promote secularism following the violence in Gujarat in 2002. They also plan to modernize the military and maintain a credible nuclear weapons program while pursuing confidence-building measures with neighboring nuclear states. It remains unclear how the government will differ from its predecessor in terms of relations with the United States. J.N. Dixit has been critical of U.S. involvement in Iraq, nonproliferation policy, and Pakistan's designation as a \"major non-NATO ally.\" The Congress-led government states it has no plans to send Indian troops to Iraq, but may become more critical of the U.S. due to communist party influences. However, they aim for closer relations with the U.S. while opposing unilateralism in global affairs. The UPA government aims for closer relations with the U.S. while opposing unilateralism in global affairs. Joint statements from recent meetings emphasize continued cooperative bilateral relations."
