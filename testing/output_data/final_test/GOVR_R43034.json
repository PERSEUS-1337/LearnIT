    "content": "Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis praised America's constitutional structure for allowing states to experiment with social and economic policies. However, state laws conflicting with federal law are considered void due to the Supremacy Clause. The complexity of determining conflicts between state and federal laws is highlighted in the ongoing debate over marijuana legalization. In late 2012, Colorado and Washington became the first states to legalize, regulate, and tax small amounts of marijuana for personal use by individuals over 21. This contrasts with federal law, where marijuana remains a criminal offense. Despite state laws in Washington and Colorado legalizing marijuana use, individuals can still face federal prosecution under the Controlled Substances Act. President Obama indicated in 2012 that federal enforcement priorities do not target recreational marijuana users in states where it is legal. The Deputy Attorney General's August 2013 memorandum instructed federal prosecutors to focus on specific marijuana-related criminal activities, such as distribution to minors and revenue flow to criminal enterprises, while implying that individuals complying with state laws may not be prosecuted federally. Washington Initiative 502, approved by voters in November 2012, legalizes marijuana possession in Washington state for individuals over 21. The possession of small amounts of marijuana is not a violation of state law, allowing for possession of up to one ounce of dried marijuana. However, federal law still prohibits marijuana use, and the approach towards marijuana enforcement could change with a new Administration. The Washington Initiative 502 legalizes marijuana possession for individuals over 21 in private. Possession, delivery, distribution, and sale by licensed producers, processors, and retailers are not criminal offenses. The Initiative establishes a three-tiered licensing system for production, processing, and retail sales, with regulatory control by the state Liquor Control Board. The Washington Initiative 502 legalizes marijuana possession for individuals over 21 in private and establishes a three-tiered licensing system for production, processing, and retail sales. The state Liquor Control Board adopted rules for implementing the Initiative, including license qualifications, application process, fees, packaging and labeling restrictions, recordkeeping, security requirements, and advertising restrictions. Washington will impose a 25% excise tax on each marijuana sale within the distribution system, from producer to processor, processor to retailer, and retailer to consumer. The Washington Initiative 502 legalizes marijuana possession for individuals over 21 in private and establishes a three-tiered licensing system for production, processing, and retail sales. The state imposes a 25% excise tax on each marijuana sale within the distribution system, with taxes deposited into the Dedicated Marijuana Fund for social and health services. Recreational marijuana retail stores have yet to open in Washington, but the application review process is ongoing. Unlike Initiative 502, Colorado Amendment 64 provides a general framework for marijuana legalization, leaving regulatory implementation to the Colorado Department of Revenue. In November 2012, Colorado voters approved Amendment 64 to legalize marijuana for individuals over 21. It allows possession, use, and cultivation of small amounts for personal use. The law prohibits public consumption and sets regulations for marijuana-related facilities. Amendment 64 in Colorado allows for the licensing of marijuana facilities, with local governments having the authority to regulate or prohibit them. Governor John Hickenlooper established the Amendment 64 Implementation Task Force to address legal and policy issues related to the implementation of the amendment. The Task Force was created to address legal and policy issues related to implementing Amendment 64 in Colorado. They issued a final report with 58 recommendations, including establishing a \"vertical integration\" model, imposing a 15% excise tax, restricting commercial licenses to state residents, and setting limits on out-of-state marijuana purchases. To implement Amendment 64 in Colorado, the General Assembly passed three bills signed into law by Governor Hickenlooper on May 28, 2013. The Department of Revenue and State Licensing Authority adopted regulations for retail marijuana facilities on September 9, 2013. Colorado voters approved a 25% tax on retail marijuana on November 5, 2013, with a 15% excise tax for public school construction and a 10% sales tax for funding. On December 23, 2013, the Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division issued recreational marijuana licenses to 348 businesses. These businesses were approved to produce and sell marijuana, but they also needed licensing approval from local governments. On January 1, 2014, 40 licensed retail marijuana stores opened to sell marijuana to individuals over 21 years old. The Controlled Substances Act was enacted by Congress in 1970 to regulate controlled substances for medical, scientific, research, and industrial purposes. The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) regulates the use of controlled substances for medical, scientific, research, and industrial purposes. It categorizes substances into five schedules based on medical use, abuse potential, and safety. Schedule I substances have no accepted medical use, while Schedules II-V have recognized medical uses. Those handling controlled substances must register with the DEA. Under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), registrants must adhere to strict requirements for drug security, recordkeeping, and production quotas to prevent theft and diversion. Violations of the CSA can result in federal civil and criminal penalties for manufacturing, distributing, importing, or possessing controlled substances. Schedule I drugs, with high abuse potential and no accepted medical use, can only be used for government-approved research studies and not dispensed under a prescription. Under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), only DEA-licensed doctors can prescribe controlled substances for legitimate medical purposes. The CSA allows for substances to be controlled, decontrolled, or rescheduled based on federal regulations and rulemaking proceedings initiated by the DEA or HHS. Congress can also change the scheduling status of a drug through legislation. Marijuana remains classified as a Schedule I controlled substance under the CSA, leading to severe restrictions and federal penalties for unauthorized cultivation, distribution, or possession. Possession of marijuana typically results in a misdemeanor with up to one year imprisonment and a minimum $1,000 fine. Repeat offenses trigger higher fines and longer imprisonment terms. The federal government imposes mandatory minimum penalties for drug offenses, with fines and imprisonment terms varying based on the type of offense. Cultivation or distribution of marijuana carries more severe penalties, including up to five years imprisonment and a fine of up to $250,000. State laws legalizing marijuana may face legal challenges due to conflicts with federal law under the Supremacy Clause. The Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution elevates federal law above state laws, leading to preemption when conflicts arise. The Supreme Court recognizes three types of preemption: express, conflict, and field preemption. Express preemption occurs when federal statutes explicitly supersede state laws, while conflict preemption arises when there is a clash between federal and state laws. Preemption can be implied by a court if there is evidence that Congress intended to supplant state authority. This can occur through field preemption, where federal regulation is pervasive, or conflict preemption, where state law conflicts with federal law. The evaluation of preemption is based on determining congressional intent, which can result in the preemption of all, some, or no state laws related to a federal law. In Section 708 of the CSA (21 U.S.C. \u00a7903), Congress specified the extent to which federal law preempts state drug laws. The provision clarifies that federal law does not intend to entirely occupy the regulatory field or replace traditional state authority in the area of controlled substances. The CSA does not wholly supplant state authority in regulating controlled substances. States can pass laws on marijuana as long as they do not conflict with federal law. Courts differ on the standard for determining conflict with the CSA. The CSA preempts state laws if they conflict with federal law, based on either impossibility or obstacle preemption. This interpretation is supported by a 2009 Supreme Court opinion applying both preemption concepts. Some state courts have held that only laws in \"positive conflict\" with the CSA are preempted. Congress expressed its intent to preempt state laws only under impossibility preemption and not under obstacle preemption, as seen in cases like People v. Crouse and County of San Diego v. San Diego NORML. These cases determined that the language of the CSA cannot be used to preempt a state law under the obstacle preemption doctrine. The interpretation of the CSA's preemptive effect, as seen in cases like Crouse and County of San Diego, narrows the scope of preemption to only apply when it is physically impossible to comply with both state and federal law. This threshold interpretation could potentially prevent the CSA from preempting state recreational marijuana legalization measures. In the context of medical marijuana, courts have generally found that compliance with both state and federal law is not impossible unless state law mandates what federal law prohibits or vice versa. In the medical marijuana context, courts have generally asserted that individuals can comply with both federal and state law by refraining from using marijuana. The Colorado and Washington laws do not require individuals to engage in federally prohibited activity, only permit it. Despite obstacle preemption not being applicable, courts still analyzed it due to differing interpretations of Section 903. The Supreme Court's interpretation of the FDCA preemption provision in Wyeth v. Levine is relevant in this context. The FDCA preemption provision in Wyeth v. Levine and lower courts' application of impossibility and obstacle preemption in determining conflicts with the CSA suggest that state drug laws may be preempted if they create obstacles to federal objectives. The analysis focuses on whether Washington and Colorado laws obstruct Congress's goals. The question of whether state laws legalizing marijuana for recreational use can be preempted by the CSA remains unresolved. The federal courts have not extensively analyzed if federal law preempts state marijuana laws, with existing precedent mainly from state courts. The divergent body of precedent, along with general preemption principles, will likely determine the validity of Washington and Colorado laws. Both states aim to legalize marijuana, regulate producers, and processors. The Supreme Court will likely consider the conflict between state marijuana laws and federal law, focusing on the purpose of Congress in enacting the Controlled Substances Act. The main objectives of the CSA are to combat drug abuse and regulate the traffic of controlled substances. The Washington and Colorado state laws regarding marijuana possession are likely to be considered valid under the assumption that state drug laws fall under the historic police powers of the States. Possession of marijuana within certain restrictions in accordance with these laws may not be preempted by federal law. The possession, distribution, or production of marijuana under state law does not change the fact that it remains a crime under federal law. States have the power to criminalize conduct within constitutional bounds, and the federal government cannot force states to enact specific legislation. States and the federal government are recognized as separate sovereigns with the ability to enact their own laws. The Tenth Amendment prohibits the federal government from compelling states to adopt criminal measures that mirror federal law. States have the power to decide whether to prohibit conduct that Congress has determined should be deterred, without being forced to do so by federal law. This principle of federalism restricts the reach of federal preemption, allowing states to maintain their own regulatory regimes. Under Tenth Amendment and preemption principles, courts have ruled that a state allowing what federal law prohibits does not create a conflict. The Supreme Court has held that as long as state law does not compel actions prohibited by federal law, simultaneous compliance is not impossible. Courts have narrowly interpreted the obstacle prong of conflict preemption, finding preemption only when federal objectives cannot be achieved. In the context of medical marijuana, courts have generally not found state laws permitting federally prohibited conduct to be an obstacle to federal objectives. In the medical marijuana context, courts have found that state exemptions do not hinder federal enforcement of marijuana laws. Compliance with state laws does not protect against federal prosecution under the CSA. States not enforcing federal policies may reduce overall enforcement effectiveness but do not create a legal obstacle for federal law enforcement. In the context of marijuana laws, state exemptions do not impede federal enforcement. Colorado and Washington laws removing state penalties for marijuana possession are within the state's authority. Legalization aspects of these laws are likely to withstand legal challenges, but regulation and licensing aspects may pose more issues. The regulation and licensing aspects of marijuana laws in Colorado and Washington may raise preemption concerns due to state-implemented control measures. These provisions could create obstacles to federal objectives by authorizing conduct prohibited by federal law, potentially lacking Tenth Amendment protections. Arguments can be made against preemption in the regulation and licensing provisions of state marijuana laws. These provisions could help efficiently identify individuals following state laws without conflicting with federal law. The provisions may also restrict marijuana access, aligning with the Controlled Substances Act's objectives. These contrasting views could be considered in court reviews of Colorado and Washington laws. In Michigan Canners & Freezers v. Agricultural Board, the Court ruled that a state law allowing a board to authorize a food producers association as an exclusive bargaining agent conflicted with federal law. The state law stood as an obstacle to the full purposes and objectives of Congress. The Court's evaluation of state laws like those in Colorado and Washington may consider whether state \"authorizations\" pose a greater obstacle to federal objectives than state \"exemptions.\" For example, the Oregon Supreme Court upheld the state's issuance of identification cards for medical marijuana users, stating it did not invalidate the state's exemption from prosecution. The Oregon Supreme Court upheld the state's exemption of medical marijuana users from prosecution but found that the licensing provisions authorizing marijuana use were preempted by federal law. California courts have not made the same distinction and have generally upheld medical marijuana laws. California courts have generally upheld the state's medical marijuana identification card provisions, emphasizing the Tenth Amendment's protection of California's decision to permit medicinal marijuana. The courts have ruled that the state law does not obstruct federal objectives under the Controlled Substances Act. The courts in California have upheld the state's medical marijuana identification card provisions, stating that they do not obstruct federal objectives under the Controlled Substances Act. The cards do not provide immunity from federal laws or prosecution for federal offenses, but serve as a mechanism for law enforcement to identify individuals exempt from state prosecution for marijuana possession. The courts also considered the Tenth Amendment's protection of California's decision to permit medicinal marijuana and the anti-commandeering principles in their rulings. In Michigan and Colorado, courts ruled that state laws related to medical marijuana did not conflict with federal law. The courts emphasized that preemption theory does not allow federal objectives to commandeer state resources. In Michigan, a statute providing immunity from state prosecution for individuals with identification cards was not preempted by the CSA. Similarly, in Colorado, a law requiring the return of seized marijuana from medical marijuana patients acquitted of state charges did not conflict with the CSA. In Pack v. City of Long Beach, a California appellate court struck down a marijuana regulatory scheme implemented by the city after the repeal of a city ordinance. The court addressed the preemption challenge to the ordinance, which governed medical marijuana collectives through permits and regulations. The court distinguished between not criminalizing an activity and making it lawful in relation to the Controlled Substances Act, determining that the state law did not present an obstacle to Congress's purposes. The court in Pack v. City of Long Beach struck down a marijuana regulatory scheme, finding that the city ordinance went beyond decriminalization into authorization by establishing a permit scheme. This affirmative authorization was deemed to be preempted by federal law, as it stood as an obstacle to Congress's objectives. The extent of preemption of state marijuana provisions by the Controlled Substances Act remains unsettled, with differing approaches in various court decisions. In Emerald Steel and Pack, Colorado and Washington's recreational licensing provisions may be invalidated due to excessive state involvement in authorizing marijuana activities. Both states plan to implement a comprehensive regulatory distribution scheme, issuing licenses to producers, processors, and retailers. This state licensing could be seen as affirmatively authorizing conduct prohibited under federal law. The curr_chunk discusses the argument that state licensing laws in Colorado and Washington may not conflict with federal law as they do not shield holders from prosecution and are necessary to regulate marijuana activities. The state licenses are seen as a way for the state to control production and distribution of marijuana under state law. The United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Colorado ruled that a debtor leasing space for growing medicinal marijuana in compliance with state law was not engaged in ongoing criminal activity. The court stated that Colorado and Washington laws do not conflict with federal law as they apply only to state law. The regulatory and licensing aspects of Colorado and Washington's marijuana laws are argued to be consistent with federal law, as they could support the objectives of controlling the traffic of controlled substances. Both states also plan to impose an excise tax on marijuana sales. Both Colorado and Washington plan to impose substantial excise taxes on marijuana sales. Colorado's tax, capped at 15% until January 1, 2017, will apply to sales by cultivation, manufacturing, and retail facilities. In Washington, a 25% tax will be levied at each stage of the distribution chain. Precedent suggests that state-imposed taxes on medical marijuana would likely be permissible, as states can tax criminal activities, including the possession of illegal drugs. The Supreme Court ruled that states can impose taxes on illegal drugs like marijuana, even if the activity is unlawful. Some states already require marijuana possessors to purchase tax stamps, and while there have been legal challenges, no court has found these laws to be preempted by federal law. The Supreme Court ruled that states can impose taxes on illegal drugs like marijuana, even if the activity is unlawful. No court has found a state drug tax law to be preempted by federal law. State marijuana taxes do not authorize prohibited conduct or impose obstacles to federal objectives. Taxes on marijuana are intended to raise revenue for regulatory controls, health services, and education. The Colorado law adjusts tax levels to discourage marijuana use and undercut illegal market prices, imposing an economic impediment. The United States is bound by international treaties like the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, which restricts the manufacturing, distribution, and trade of narcotic drugs. The Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs establishes controls on narcotic drugs through a multi-schedule classification structure. \"Cannabis\" is listed as a Schedule I substance, subject to the most restrictive controls, limiting its production, distribution, and trade to medical and scientific purposes. Parties must provide information to the International Narcotics Control Board on drug consumption and production. The 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances and the 1988 United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances require controls and criminal penalties for marijuana. The U.S. DEA and Department of State must keep marijuana on Schedule I or II of the federal CSA to comply with international obligations. The DEA cites international drug control treaties as the legal basis for denying petitions to remove marijuana from Schedule I. While state legalization measures may conflict with these treaties, they may not necessarily be preempted by them according to existing jurisprudence. Treaties, like federal statutes, can preempt state laws under the Supremacy Clause. The Supremacy Clause states that federal law, including international treaties, takes precedence over state law. Treaties that are considered \"self-executing\" have automatic preemptive effect as federal law, while non-self-executing treaties require implementing legislation. The distinction was clarified in the case of Medellin v. Texas, which involved the evaluation of the preemptive effect of international agreements. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) and international agreements were deemed enforceable federal law with preemption authority over Texas court rules. However, the ICJ decision did not automatically preempt state restrictions as it required domestic implementing legislation. The treaties, including the Single Convention on drug control, are not self-executing and need domestic laws for legal effect. The treaties, such as the Single Convention on drug control, do not establish binding domestic law on their own. The U.S. implemented treaty obligations through the CSA, and it is unlikely for U.S. courts to give direct preemptive effect to these treaties. The Washington and Colorado marijuana laws may not be preempted by international obligations. The DOJ could prioritize prosecuting certain marijuana-related crimes over those in compliance with state laws, using prosecutorial discretion. The DOJ has discretion in enforcing the CSA, including using criminal prosecutions, civil lawsuits, and forfeiture provisions to deter activities violating state marijuana laws. Prosecutorial discretion allows federal law enforcement officials broad discretion in deciding when to prosecute violations of the CSA, with courts recognizing that this decision is not easily subject to judicial review. The DOJ's prosecutorial discretion in enforcing the CSA involves factors like evidence strength, deterrence value, and enforcement priorities, not easily reviewed by courts. DOJ has issued memoranda outlining federal priorities on state-authorized marijuana activities since 2009, including guidance on medical marijuana prosecutions. The DOJ's prosecutorial discretion in enforcing the CSA involves factors like evidence strength, deterrence value, and enforcement priorities. In 2009, a memorandum stated that federal prosecutors should not focus resources on individuals in compliance with state laws for medical marijuana. A 2011 memorandum distinguished between individual patients and \"commercial\" dispensaries for potential prosecutions. The DOJ clarified that the Ogden memorandum was not meant to protect large-scale, privately operated marijuana cultivation centers from federal enforcement. Individuals involved in cultivating, selling, or distributing marijuana, even if following state laws, are still in violation of the CSA. The Obama Administration's response to state initiatives on marijuana was outlined in a memorandum by Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole on August 29, 2013. The DOJ issued a memorandum guiding U.S. Attorneys on enforcement of the federal Controlled Substances Act in states where marijuana is legalized. The DOJ will not challenge states as long as strict regulations are in place to ensure public safety and health. This decision has sparked both praise and criticism. Federal prosecutors are instructed to prioritize resources accordingly. The DOJ issued a memorandum guiding U.S. Attorneys on enforcing the federal Controlled Substances Act in states where marijuana is legalized. The federal government prioritizes preventing specific activities related to marijuana, such as distributing to children, funding criminal enterprises, and trafficking to other states. Other concerns include using firearms in cultivation, public health consequences, growing on public lands, and possession on federal property. U.S. Attorneys and federal law enforcement are advised to focus resources on these key areas. The DOJ memorandum advises U.S. Attorneys and federal law enforcement to prioritize preventing specific activities related to marijuana, regardless of state law. Jurisdictions that have legalized marijuana must enforce their laws to avoid undermining federal priorities. The federal government retains the right to challenge state marijuana laws if they fail to protect against specified harms. Additionally, the memorandum acknowledges a change in Administration policy regarding large-scale, for-profit commercial enterprises. The DOJ's new guidance advises prosecutors not to target large-scale, for-profit marijuana enterprises solely based on their size or commercial nature. This marks a shift in policy towards the emerging for-profit marijuana industry, but does not address federal money laundering and banking laws that have hindered commercial marijuana establishments. The DOJ's new guidance advises prosecutors not to target large-scale, for-profit marijuana enterprises solely based on their size or commercial nature. It does not address federal money laundering and banking laws that have hindered commercial marijuana establishments from obtaining necessary financing and financial services. The memorandum suggests that states with robust regulatory systems for recreational marijuana are less likely to threaten federal priorities. This statement may impact the debate over state marijuana regulatory laws conflicting with federal law. Some courts suggest that robust state licensing and regulatory programs may be preempted by federal law. The DOJ supports state-run regulatory systems for marijuana production and distribution to control participation. They may use civil forfeiture to disrupt dispensaries and production facilities. Forfeiture is a penalty where property is confiscated and forfeited to the government. It is used to enforce criminal laws and deter crime. Forfeitures can be civil or criminal, depending on the judicial procedure. Civil forfeiture involves confiscating property without criminal charges against the owner, while criminal forfeiture requires a conviction of the owner. Property subject to forfeiture includes proceeds of illegal activities and any property used to facilitate a crime. Section 511 of the CSA allows the Attorney General to seize and forfeit property associated with violations of the CSA, including controlled substances, equipment, money, and real property used to facilitate a violation. The government only needs to show by a preponderance of evidence that the property is subject to forfeiture. Seized controlled substances may be destroyed, and other property can be sold at public auction, with excess funds forwarded to the DOJ Asset. The DOJ can seize and liquidate property associated with marijuana activities without criminal action through civil asset forfeiture proceedings. Challenges to these actions are unlikely to succeed due to federal law violations. Excess funds from forfeiture proceedings are sent to the DOJ Asset Forfeiture Fund. The DOJ may challenge Colorado and Washington laws in federal court on preemption grounds. The Obama Administration is unlikely to prosecute individuals for possessing small amounts of marijuana under state laws. The mere use of marijuana, even without arrest or conviction, can lead to consequences under federal law such as losing the ability to purchase firearms, being barred from public housing, and facing employment repercussions. Federal law prohibits possession of firearms by individuals considered unlawful users of controlled substances. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) considers any person who uses or is addicted to marijuana as an unlawful user of a controlled substance, prohibiting them from possessing firearms or ammunition. This applies even if the individual is not using marijuana at the time of acquiring a firearm. The ATF considers recreational marijuana users as prohibited possessors of firearms, regardless of state laws. Federal law also prohibits \"illegal drug users\" from federally assisted housing. The ATF prohibits recreational marijuana users from possessing firearms, and federal law also prohibits \"illegal drug users\" from federally assisted housing, including those using marijuana. The Department of Housing and Urban Development allows discretion for evicting current residents using medical marijuana. Some employers may risk losing federal funding or facing fines if they do not enforce drug-free workplace policies, as mandated by the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988. Employees of federal contractors and grantees could face discipline or termination for using marijuana on the job, even if allowed by state law, due to safety concerns. Employers risk losing federal funding or facing fines for not enforcing drug-free workplace policies, as mandated by the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988. Employees using marijuana at work may be considered a hazard, leading to disciplinary actions. Bills like H.R. 499 reflect different responses to state legalization initiatives. H.R. 499, Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act of 2013, aims to remove marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act and make amendments to various laws related to marijuana regulation. The bill \"Unlawful Businesses Without Marijuana Permit\" prohibits engaging in marijuana-related activities without a permit issued by the Secretary of the Treasury. Violators could face a criminal fine of up to $1,000, with the option of paying $500 instead. The Secretary must establish eligibility criteria for permit applicants and set a reasonable fee for regulation. The bill also grants the FDA authority over marijuana regulation. The bill H.R. 501, Marijuana Tax Equity Act of 2013, proposes imposing an excise tax on marijuana sales and requiring an occupational tax for those involved in the marijuana industry. It also transfers marijuana enforcement functions from the DEA Administrator to the Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The bill H.R. 689, States' Medical Marijuana Patient Protection Act, requires individuals to obtain a permit from the Secretary of the Treasury before starting a marijuana enterprise. It also imposes penalties for not paying taxes or operating without a permit. The bill directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to submit a recommendation on the scheduling of marijuana within the CSA to the DEA Administrator, excluding Schedule I or II. The DEA Administrator must then issue a proposed rule for rescheduling marijuana based on the recommendation within 180 days. The bill H.R. 689, States' Medical Marijuana Patient Protection Act, requires a permit for starting a marijuana enterprise and imposes penalties for non-compliance. It directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to recommend rescheduling marijuana within the CSA to the DEA Administrator. The bill mandates the Attorney General to transfer control over marijuana research access to a non-addiction-focused Executive Branch entity within 180 days of enactment. The bill H.R. 710, Truth in Trials Act, aims to provide an affirmative defense for medical marijuana use in federal prosecutions. It requires compliance with state laws, mandates the return of seized property within 10 days of establishing a valid defense, and allows courts to hold individuals liable for marijuana-related offenses. The bill H.R. 784, States' Medical Marijuana Property Rights Protection Act, would amend civil forfeiture provisions to protect real property used for medical marijuana activities in compliance with state law. H.R. 964, Respect States' and Citizens' Rights Act of 2013, would clarify that no provision of the CSA indicates Congress's intent to control state marijuana laws. H.R. 1523, Respect State Marijuana Laws Act of 2013, amends federal law to prevent the application of the Controlled Substances Act to individuals following state marijuana laws. H.R. 1635, National Commission on Federal Marijuana Policy Act of 2013, establishes a federal commission to review federal marijuana policies. H.R. 2652, Marijuana Businesses Access to Banking Act of 2013, grants legal immunity to banks providing financial services to state law-compliant marijuana businesses."
