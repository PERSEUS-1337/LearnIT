    "content": "In civil actions, victims of injury or death caused by others can seek compensation. Congress has established programs to assist victims of specific circumstances like negligence, terrorism, and natural disasters. These programs fall into three categories: those limiting compensation to specific groups, those limiting compensation for specific injuries, and hybrid programs that limit both eligible individuals and compensable injuries. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) reviewed federal compensation programs for individuals injured by harmful substances, finding significant differences in program design, administration, financing, benefits, and eligibility criteria. Various approaches are used to determine if claims are related to relevant employment or incidents for responsible fund stewardship. This is easier for acute injuries compared to chronic conditions like asbestos exposure. Some compensation programs evaluate claims administratively on a case-by-case basis, while others have lists of compensable conditions for specific exposures. Disease presumption is used when an eligible individual develops a listed condition related to the exposure. Vaccine injury compensation programs have an injury table and a time window for presumed causality. Listed conditions related to vaccination are compensated without time limitations, as some conditions may arise years after exposure. Claimants must show the condition did not precede the exposure. Disease presumptions shift the burden of proof to program administrators based on scientific evidence of causality. The report discusses federal programs established to compensate individuals for harm caused by specific events or exposures. Scientific evidence is used to determine causality, with a presumption of causality extended to exposed populations facing increased risks of certain conditions. It is often difficult to determine causality for specific individuals. The report discusses federal compensation programs for individuals affected by specific events or harm. Program attributes are outlined, followed by three groups of compensation programs: for specified groups, types of illness/injury, and hybrid programs. Veterans' disability compensation is based on linking illness/injury to military service, with some veterans granted a presumption of service-connection. Additionally, four federal assistance programs are described, including the Federal Tort Claims Act and Stafford Act. The curr_chunk discusses various federal compensation programs such as the Federal Tort Claims Act, Stafford Act emergency assistance, Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Program, and World Trade Center Medical Monitoring and Treatment Program. It includes program descriptions, statutory authority, administration details, eligibility criteria, and appeal processes. The curr_chunk discusses eligibility criteria for compensation programs, including factors like employment, hazard exposure, and disease development. Some programs reimburse healthcare costs and restrict provider eligibility to ensure quality care. For example, the Black Lung Program established specialized clinics for miners. Specialized provider networks in state workers' compensation programs offer specialized care for miners, reducing lost work time and costs. These networks improve program accountability by training providers to accurately identify eligible disease conditions. They also serve as centers for clinical research and provide outreach and training to general practitioners. However, exclusive use of selected providers may limit access to care. The curr_chunk discusses the benefits eligible individuals may receive, including compensation for death, disability, lost income, and healthcare costs. Compensation can be provided as one-time payments or reimbursements. Health care cost coverage is limited to conditions related to employment or incidents, making these programs not general health insurance. In some cases, the program acts as a secondary payer, deducting benefits paid by third parties. The program acts as a secondary payer, deducting benefits paid by third parties. Benefits vary in terms of taxable income and eligibility for public benefit programs like Medicaid and Food Stamps. Lists of presumed diseases may be developed through statute, rulemaking, or scientific advisory groups. The curr_chunk discusses how scientific advisory groups identify diseases for inclusion in compensation programs, with rebuttable presumptions for certain diseases. It also explains the financing mechanisms of such programs, including annual appropriations and payroll taxes. The federal government's role in expanding eligibility for compensation programs is highlighted. The federal role in expanding eligibility for compensation programs has increased, leading to expanded coverage for claimants and increased costs. Workers' compensation systems are established in every state, covering the majority of private sector workers in the US, with special federal laws for longshore and harbor workers and government employees. These systems vary but generally follow principles of providing compensation for injured employees. Workers' compensation systems in the United States are characterized by principles where employers cover medical care and partial wages for injured employees without the need to determine fault. Employees cannot sue their employers for injuries, except in special circumstances. Federal and state programs, like the Federal Employees Compensation Program and Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Program, are administered by the Department of Labor with appeal systems available for disputes. Benefits under workers' compensation in the United States are available for personal injury or death by accident arising out of employment. Regulations define qualified providers as those not excluded for various reasons, including criminal conduct or fraud. Most states allow employees to choose their physician, with medical costs fully covered and wage replacement for total disability at two-thirds of the salary. Workers' compensation in the United States provides benefits for total disability at two-thirds of the employee's wage, capped at the state's average wage. Permanent partial disability is compensated based on the percentage of disability, with specific injuries having set amounts. Occupational diseases are covered but are harder to prove and may manifest after the claim period. In the United States, workers' compensation provides benefits for total disability at two-thirds of the employee's wage, capped at the state's average wage. Occupational diseases may manifest after the claim period, with explicit restrictions on benefits for specific diseases, especially respiratory ones. In 2004, nationwide benefits totaled $54.7 billion, with employer costs at $87.6 billion. Larger employers tend to self-insure, while smaller employers use insurance. Insurance is provided by private carriers or state funds in most states, with four states requiring insurance purchase from an employer. The Public Safety Officers' Benefits Act established the PSOB program to provide compensation for line-of-duty death or disability. It also offers financial assistance for education and support services for eligible public safety officers' families. The PSOB program, administered by the Bureau of Justice Assistance, provides compensation for line-of-duty death or disability of eligible public safety officers. It covers state and local law enforcement officers, firefighters, federal law enforcement officers, firefighters, rescue squads, ambulance crews, FEMA personnel, emergency management personnel, and chaplains serving public agencies. The PSOB program provides death benefits to eligible survivors of public safety officers who die in the line of duty and disability benefits for officers permanently disabled by a catastrophic injury sustained on duty. Medical retirement for a line-of-duty disability does not automatically qualify for benefits. The PSOB program provides death benefits to eligible survivors of public safety officers who die in the line of duty and disability benefits for officers permanently disabled by a catastrophic injury sustained on duty. The award amount is determined by the date of the officer's death or disability. The program initially offered a death benefit in 1976 and added a disability benefit in 1990. The payment level has increased over the years, currently at $315,746 for eligible deaths after October 1, 2008, and eligible disabilities after November 29, 2007. Benefits are expedited for line-of-duty deaths or disabilities related to a terrorist attack. The PSOB program provides death benefits for public safety officers who die in the line of duty or become permanently disabled due to a catastrophic injury sustained on duty. The program compensates individuals for specific outcomes, such as death or total disability, resulting from injuries sustained while on duty. It also includes provisions for fatal heart attacks or strokes within 24 hours of non-routine physical activity on duty. The program does not cover chronic diseases. The PSOB program does not cover chronic diseases but may provide benefits for events related to progressive diseases if a line-of-duty injury is a substantial factor in causing death. The program received $75 million in appropriations in FY2008, with death benefits classified as mandatory and disability and educational benefits as discretionary. A continuing resolution was enacted in September 2008 to fund the government until March 6, 2009. The Compensation Fund of 2001 (P.L. 107-42) was established to compensate individuals physically injured or killed in the terrorist attacks. Kenneth R. Feinberg was appointed as special master to distribute the fund without a financial cap. Claimants had until December 22, 2003, to file for compensation if present at the attack sites. The Compensation Fund of 2001 was set up to compensate individuals physically harmed or killed in the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The program awarded over $7.1 billion in total, with an average award of over $2 million for families of deceased victims and nearly $400,000 for injured victims. The Special Master appointed personal representatives for those who did not have one appointed by a court. No health care benefits were provided through the program. The 9/11 Compensation Fund awarded over $7.1 billion in total, with awards ranging from $500 to over $8.6 million. Determinations were final and not subject to judicial review. Awards were offset by life insurance and other collateral source compensation, excluding tax benefits from the federal government. The 9/11 Compensation Fund awarded over $7.1 billion in total, with awards ranging from $500 to over $8.6 million. Compensation was provided for physical injury or death resulting from being present at the crash sites or in their immediate aftermath. Physical harm was defined as an injury treated by a medical professional within a specific timeframe. Offset amounts for pension funds and life insurance were reduced by victim's self-contributions or premiums paid. The 9/11 Victim Compensation Fund awarded over $7 billion in total, with payouts ranging from $500 to over $8.6 million. The program was intended for those who were present at the crash sites or in their immediate aftermath and suffered physical injuries that were treated by a medical professional within a specific timeframe. Funding for the program was authorized under the 2001 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Recovery From and Response to Terrorist Attacks on the United States. Legislation introduced in Congress (H.R. 847) aimed to provide benefits for emergency responders, workers, and individuals involved in 9/11 rescue efforts. The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 established a compensation program for vaccine-related injuries or deaths. The National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 established a compensation program for vaccine-related injuries or deaths. Claimants denied awards may sue vaccine manufacturers under state tort law. The program is jointly administered by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice, and the United States Court of Federal Claims. The Vaccine Injury Compensation Program allows individuals who have been injured by a covered vaccine to file a petition for compensation. Eligibility criteria include lasting effects of the injury for more than six months, hospitalization, surgery, or death. Compensation is limited to medical expenses, loss of earnings, pain and suffering, and emotional distress, with a maximum of $250,000 for a vaccine-related death. The Vaccine Injury Compensation Program provides compensation for injuries caused by covered vaccines, including medical expenses, loss of earnings, pain and suffering, and emotional distress up to $250,000. The program does not cover payments available from insurance or other health benefits programs. The Vaccine Injury Table establishes a presumption of causation for specific injuries within certain time frames after vaccine administration. Currently, 16 types of vaccines are covered by the program. Eight other types of vaccines have been added to the list without specified compensable conditions or time frames. Four were directly listed, and another four were added for any new vaccine recommended by the CDC for routine administration to children. Compensable adverse events include anaphylaxis, infections from live-virus vaccines, acute complications, and specific conditions related to certain vaccines. Petitioners must show a \"Table Injury\" or prove vaccine causation for compensation. Compensation under the program is paid from the Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust Fund, funded by a manufacturers' excise tax on certain vaccines. In FY2008, $61 million in claims and administrative expenses were paid, $358 million in deposits were received, and the trust fund ended the year with a balance of $2.91 billion. In January 2003, the Secretary of Health and Human Services declared it advisable to administer smallpox vaccine and related countermeasures to certain civilians on a voluntary basis. In April 2003, Congress passed the Smallpox Emergency Personnel Protection Act of 2003 (SEPPA, P.L. 108-20), requiring the federal government to establish a program to compensate individuals harmed by smallpox vaccine with payment for medical care, lost income, and death. The Smallpox Vaccine Injury Compensation Program provides payment for medical care, lost income, and death benefits for covered injuries related to the smallpox vaccine. Administered by HRSA, the program covers injuries deemed vaccine-related in individuals who volunteered for vaccination or were infected after contact with vaccinated individuals. Eligible individuals include those vaccinated in covered occupations and those who received the vaccine as part of an approved emergency response plan. The law does not allow judicial review of the Secretary's actions. The Smallpox Vaccine Injury Compensation Program provides benefits for individuals who sustained compensable injuries related to the smallpox vaccine, including medical care, lost employment income, and survivor death benefits. There are no restrictions on who can receive benefits, and payments are secondary to any other obligations under the law. The Smallpox Vaccine Injury Compensation Program regulations require eligible requesters to submit a list of possible third-party payers, pay medical benefits only if not already covered, and reserve the right to recoup costs from third-party payers. Payers include insurance companies, workers compensation programs, and the PSOB program, with a death benefit specified by the PSOB program. Any survivor death benefit is reduced by the amount paid. The Smallpox Vaccine Injury Compensation Program provides a death benefit to survivors, which is reduced by any lost employment income benefits already paid. The death benefit may not be in addition to a PSOB disability or death benefit, but can be made in addition to medical care payments. Recipients of the smallpox vaccine are eligible for compensation for 12 covered conditions, and there is no current registry for tracking vaccinated public health and healthcare volunteers. The Smallpox Vaccine Injury Compensation Program provides compensation for 12 covered conditions, with $42 million allocated for eligible individuals injured by vaccination. As of January 2007, HRSA had received 62 claims, paying out $1,972,452 in total, with additional claims pending. Administrative costs totaled slightly over $2 million. The Black Lung Benefits Act provides cash compensation and medical care benefits to coal miners suffering from black lung disease, administered by the Office of Workers Compensation Programs. Eligibility requires the miner to have black lung disease, be totally disabled by the disease, and for the disease to have arisen out of coal mine employment. The Black Lung Benefits Act provides compensation and medical care to coal miners with black lung disease. Eligibility requires total disability from the disease and it must have originated from coal mine employment. Statutory presumptions and medical evaluations play a role in determining qualification for benefits. Claimants before June 1973 (or December 1973 for survivors) fall under Part B program definitions, while later claims are assessed under stricter Part C definitions. Coverage under Part B or Part C varies based on the date of the claimants' last coal mine employment. Treatment for pneumoconiosis has no restrictions, but diagnosis requires specific evidence like chest X-rays. The Black Lung Clinics Program (BLCP) provides specialized pulmonary and respiratory care to eligible coal miners. Monthly cash compensation ranges from $616 to $1,233 and is not taxable. The program covers the full cost of medical treatment and care related to black lung disease, including transportation costs. Administered by HRSA, the program does not require individuals to receive care through a Black Lung Clinic. The Black Lung Clinics Program provides medical services for miners with black lung disease, including diagnostic testing and medical coverage for treatment. This includes chest X-rays, breathing tests, prescription drugs, office visits, hospitalizations, durable medical equipment, pulmonary rehabilitation therapy, and home nursing visits. Additionally, beneficiaries may receive benefits under state workers' compensation or black lung laws. Part B and Part C black lung benefits may be reduced by workers' compensation, disability insurance, or unemployment compensation payments, as well as earnings. Medical evidence is required to support a diagnosis of pneumoconiosis, with regulations providing presumptions for miners with the disease. Part C benefits can impact social security disability benefits. The Black Lung Benefits Program provides compensation for miners with pneumoconiosis, with funding from federal appropriations and the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund. The program includes presumptions for miners with the disease and benefits can impact social security disability benefits. The Part C trust fund collects fees and penalties, recoups beneficiaries' payments, and borrows from the Treasury. It currently owes $10 billion and has had to borrow to meet interest obligations. Proposals have been made to retire this debt. The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act established a fund for lump-sum payments to individuals with certain diseases from radiation exposure. The Radiation Exposure Compensation Program (RECP) was amended in 2000 to expand eligibility and require regular reporting on program status. Administered by the Department of Justice, Civil Division, RECP initially covered downwinders and uranium miners with specific health conditions. It was later amended to include government employees and others affected by ionizing radiation. The Radiation Exposure Compensation Program (RECP) was amended in 2000 to include government employees and on-site participants in above-ground tests who developed certain cancers. The changes also added uranium mill workers and ore transporters as claimants, expanded the list of compensable cancers, and authorized grants for screening, treatment referrals, claims assistance, and public education programs. HRSA funds health care institutions in five western states for RECP claimants. The Radiation Exposure Compensation Program (RECP) was amended in 2000 to include various claimant categories with different compensations for specific cancers. Acceptance of benefits settles all claims against the federal government and its contractors, and payments are not subject to federal income tax. The Radiation Exposure Compensation Program (RECP) provides tax-free payments for specific cancers to eligible claimants, settling all claims against the government and its contractors. Since its inception, over 30,000 claims have been filed, with $1.4 billion awarded for 20,864 claims. The program covers 19 compensable cancers, and Congress previously made annual appropriations to the RECA trust fund for compensation. The RECA trust fund saw increased claims filed and processed after the RECA Amendments of 2000. Congress appropriated $11 million for FY2001, with additional funding as needed. $108 million was paid out in approved claims that year. Funding for the trust fund was mandated for FY2002 through FY2011, with mandatory and indefinite funding starting in FY2006. From FY2005 onwards, the trust fund only paid downwinder and on-site participant claims. The RECA trust fund now only pays downwinder and on-site participant claims, while uranium miners, millers, and ore transporters are covered by the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program. This program provides compensation and medical benefits to workers in the nuclear weapons industry who may have been exposed to radiation and other hazards. The Department of Labor manages claims for workers in the nuclear weapons industry who may have been exposed to radiation and other hazards. The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health conducts exposure studies for eligible individuals to characterize their radiation exposure. The Department of Energy provides records to support claims management and exposure assessment. Program benefits are available to DOE employees, contractors, and subcontractors. Part B benefits are available to DOE employees, contractors, subcontractors, and atomic weapons employers for radiation-induced cancers and illnesses related to beryllium or silica exposure. Part E benefits are available to Part B recipients and nuclear weapons workers for other toxic-related illnesses. Beginning in 2005, Part E replaced a Part D program, providing benefits to nuclear weapons workers for illnesses caused by toxic substances. Eligible claimants receive a document outlining their medical conditions, with a fee schedule set by DOL. Part B offers a lump sum of $150,000 and covers medical expenses, while uranium workers under RECA receive $50,000. Part E pays medical expenses and a lump sum up to $250,000 based on wage loss and impairment. The EEOICPA program provides a lump sum payment of up to $250,000 for wage loss and impairment, covering all medical expenses related to covered illnesses. Part E benefits are subject to offset for state workers' compensation payments. Over 177,372 claims have been filed, with more than 50,916 approved, totaling over $4.8 billion in compensation and benefits. Diagnostic criteria for beryllium disease and silicosis are explicitly defined for eligibility. The EEOICPA program provides compensation for covered illnesses, including silicosis and certain cancers. Eligibility criteria are clearly defined, with compensable cancers listed in the statute. Workers with listed cancers in the Special Exposure Cohort qualify for benefits, while others must prove work-relatedness through dose reconstruction. The EEOICPA program provides compensation for covered illnesses, including silicosis and certain cancers. The Special Exposure Cohort (SEC) simplifies the process of qualifying for benefits for more than 30 different groups of workers, with over 1,000 workers and their survivors included. Controversies have arisen regarding the designation of SEC classes, with allegations of bias and irregularities in the appointment of advisory board members and other matters. NIOSH conducts dose reconstruction using radiation exposure data to estimate worker's radiation exposure for SEC status. Workers must initiate the process, which can be challenging if data is unavailable. NIOSH received over 29,000 claims between 2001 and 2009. Between October 2001 and April 2009, NIOSH received over 29,000 claims for dose reconstruction related to radiation exposure from atomic and thermonuclear weapons tests conducted in the Marshall Islands. The claims have been mostly processed, with 83% completed and sent to the Department of Labor for compensation decisions. Administrative costs for this process require annual appropriation. The Marshall Islands, previously a district of the United Nations Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, gained self-government through the Compact of Free Association in 1986. The Compact of Free Association granted self-government to the Marshall Islands and provided $150 million in compensation for nuclear test-related damages. The Marshall Islands government requested additional compensation in 2000, but the U.S. Department of State found no legal basis for it in 2004. The 109th Congress held hearings on the petition in 2005 but did not make a determination. In 2006, Bikini and Enewetak atolls filed lawsuits against the U.S. government seeking compensation for nuclear testing damages. The court dismissed the lawsuits in 2007, and an appeal in 2009 upheld the decision citing the Compact of Free Association. The Compact established a Nuclear Claims Tribunal to handle claims and allocated funds for compensation. The Nuclear Claims Tribunal in the Marshall Islands has judges serving three-year terms and is divided into three operational divisions. The Tribunal's compensation system, established in 1991, is similar to the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) and does not require claimants to prove a direct link between radiation exposure and their injury. Claimants need to show residency during nuclear testing years and have a listed medical condition presumed to be caused by radiation. Unlike RECA, the Tribunal awards varying amounts for different diseases. The Nuclear Claims Tribunal in the Marshall Islands awards varying amounts for different diseases on its list of compensable diseases, ranging from $12,500 to $125,000. Biological children of exposed individuals receive 50% of the compensation. The Tribunal considered expert recommendations and scientific evidence in determining the diseases eligible for compensation. The Nuclear Claims Tribunal in the Marshall Islands reviews compensable diseases annually based on scientific evidence and expert recommendations. The list has been amended multiple times since 1991, now including 36 medical conditions. The $150 million Nuclear Claims Fund aimed to provide compensation for personal injury, property damages, health care, and other needs but stopped payments in 2006 due to fund depletion. Personal injury awards from the Tribunal have surpassed the allocated $45.75 million from the Compact. The Nuclear Claims Tribunal in the Marshall Islands has awarded $91.4 million for compensable injuries, exceeding the allocated $45.75 million. The Ricky Ray Hemophilia Relief Fund provided compassionate lump-sum payments to hemophiliacs infected with HIV, with a total appropriation of $750 million. The program ended in 2003, with close-out in 2005. The Ricky Ray program provided $100,000 payments to individuals with blood-clotting disorders who contracted HIV between 1982 and 1987, as well as their survivors. Over $559 million was paid out to nearly 7,200 eligible individuals and survivors, with payments not subject to federal income tax or affecting Medicaid eligibility. The Ricky Ray program provided $100,000 payments to individuals with blood-clotting disorders who contracted HIV between 1982 and 1987, as well as their survivors. Eligible individuals did not have to prove that HIV infection was caused by their use of clotting factors. The trust fund received $655 million in total, more than enough to cover all eligible claims, with excess funds returned to the U.S. Treasury. The Department of Veterans Affairs pays monthly benefits to veterans disabled by injury or disease, regardless of whether it occurred in the line of duty. Veterans can receive disability compensation if their condition is related to military service, with severity evaluated by the VA through disability ratings. A minimum disability rating of 10% is required to qualify for compensation, with rates based on the degree of disability. Veterans must prove their condition is service-connected, often through military records, although some cases may lack conclusive evidence. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs can grant a presumption of service connection in certain situations. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs can grant a presumption of service connection for specific conditions or groups of veterans, potentially making them eligible for disability compensation without conclusive evidence. This authority has been used for conditions like ALS. Congress has granted presumptions for atomic veterans, Vietnam veterans, and Persian Gulf War veterans. VA cash payments are funded through federal appropriations. In 1984, Congress enacted legislation (P.L. 98-542) to provide disability compensation to radiation-exposed veterans. The VA awards compensation if a veteran's disability is likely due to radiation exposure while in service. Regulations cover all veterans exposed to radiation while on active duty, requiring a radiation dose estimate with each claim. The Defense Threat Reduction Agency provides radiation dose estimates for veterans claiming disability compensation due to radiation exposure during service. DTRA may reconstruct doses if historical records are incomplete. Veterans can also submit alternative dose estimates. VA officials use radioepidemiologic tables to determine if the veteran's disease is likely due to radiation exposure, with a probability of causation (POC) of at least 50% required to meet VA criteria. The Radiation-Exposed Veterans' Compensation Act (P.L. 100-321) established a presumption of service connection for 13 specified types of cancer for atomic veterans. Veterans with one of the listed cancers and who participated in specified radiation-risk activities are eligible for compensation without the need for estimating radiation dose. The VA has expanded the list of compensable cancers for atomic veterans to 21 under various legislative acts. Veterans with these cancers have their claims adjudicated under specific laws, while those seeking compensation for other diseases must undergo dose estimation. The Agent Orange Act provides a presumption of service connection for Vietnam veterans exposed to herbicides sprayed over South Vietnam. The VA no longer requires proof of herbicide exposure for disability compensation claims. P.L. 102-4 authorized the VA to contract with the IOM to review evidence linking medical conditions to herbicide exposure every two years. The VA uses this information to establish a presumption of service connection for diseases associated with herbicide exposure in Vietnam veterans. The VA currently recognizes various diseases as connected to military service in Vietnam. The Veterans Benefits and Health Care Improvement Act of 2000 authorized benefits for children with certain birth defects of Vietnam veterans. Gulf War veterans with undiagnosed illnesses were granted a service connection presumption in 1994. The Persian Gulf War Veterans' Benefits Act compensated veterans with chronic disabilities from Gulf War service. The Veterans' Education and Benefits Expansion Act of 2001 further expanded benefits for veterans. The Veterans' Education and Benefits Expansion Act of 2001 (P.L. 107-103) expanded benefits for veterans by including chronic multi-symptomatic illnesses like chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia. Over 3,300 Gulf War veterans received service connection for undiagnosed illnesses. The Federal Tort Claims Act allows suits against the United States for torts committed by federal employees. The Federal Tort Claims Act allows injured individuals to file administrative claims with federal agencies within two years of the claim accruing. If the claim is denied, a lawsuit can be filed in federal district court without a jury. Federal employees, including military and civilian, cannot recover under the FTCA but have alternative compensation options. Successful plaintiffs can recover economic and noneconomic damages as allowed by state law, excluding punitive damages and attorney's fees unless bad faith is proven by the United States. The United States can provide funding to state and local governments, as well as individuals, in response to catastrophes under the Stafford Act. Assistance is given upon a presidential declaration of an emergency or major disaster, with federal aid available for individuals in congregate settings through state assistance. Assistance under the Stafford Act can be provided to individuals through state and local governments for healthcare costs related to injuries or illnesses. A counseling program may also be available upon the Governor's request. FEMA administers these assistance programs based on residence in a declared disaster area. The Individuals and Households Program offers cash assistance for uninsured medical, dental, and funeral expenses. The Individuals and Households Program offers cash assistance for uninsured medical, dental, and funeral expenses, capped at $30,300 annually. FEMA evaluates eligibility on a case-by-case basis, and provides financial assistance for counseling services through the Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training Program. The Counseling Assistance and Training Program (CCP) provides federal assistance to states under the Stafford Act for victims' health care needs. Funding for activities under the Stafford Act comes from the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) administered by FEMA. The DRF is a no-year account that requires supplemental appropriations each fiscal year to replenish funds for catastrophic disasters. Additionally, the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP) was established in 1990 to provide low-income, uninsured, and underserved women access to cancer screening services. The Breast and Cervical Cancer Prevention and Treatment Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-354) provides Medicaid coverage for eligible women screened through the NBCCEDP and found to have breast or cervical cancer. This act allows all 50 states and the District of Columbia to offer medical assistance for treatment. Medicaid provides coverage for women screened through the NBCCEDP and diagnosed with breast or cervical cancer. Eligibility criteria include being under 65, uninsured, and not eligible for Medicaid otherwise. CMS sets health and safety standards for providers to receive reimbursement through Medicaid. Safety standards for Medicaid certification apply equally for Medicare. No additional provider restrictions for Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment program. Eligible individuals entitled to full range of Medicaid services. States may use administrative mechanisms to determine medical necessity. States and federal government share Medicaid costs with no upper limit on federal funds. Following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center in New York City, Congress provided funding for the World Trade Center Medical Monitoring and Treatment Program to assist responders exposed to toxins during the rescue and recovery efforts. The World Trade Center Medical Monitoring and Treatment Program (MMTP) provides health care services for eligible individuals involved in the 9/11 rescue and recovery efforts. Administered by the CDC's NIOSH, the program offers medical screening, monitoring, and treatment for NYC firefighters, non-federal responders, federal employees, and residents affected by the disaster. Some Members of Congress are seeking explicit authorization for the MMTP. The World Trade Center Medical Monitoring and Treatment Program (MMTP) provides health care services for eligible individuals involved in the 9/11 rescue and recovery efforts. The program is administered by the CDC's NIOSH and offers medical screening, monitoring, and treatment for NYC firefighters, non-federal responders, federal employees, and residents affected by the disaster. The program component for federal responders is implemented by Federal Occupational Health Services, under the HHS Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management. GAO has commented on difficulties that HHS has had in establishing and running this program component. Congress first established program eligibility for residents, students, and other non-responders in FY2008 appropriations. NIOSH reported to Congress in April 2008 that it was exploring options for the provision of services for the \"Community Program\" in the NYC area. NIOSH awarded a contract in May 2008 to manage the WTC National Responder Health Program, but there is no comparable program for eligible non-responders outside the NYC area. The World Trade Center Health Registry tracks the health status of those exposed to the WTC site for up to 20 years, but does not provide compensation or health care services. Congress has expanded eligibility for the MMTP over time, including residents and non-responders. The MMTP program covers WTC responders, including paid contractors and volunteers, regardless of employer. The FDNY program is for current and retired NYC firefighters who receive care through FDNY. The MMTP was expanded in FY2008 to include the Community Program for residents, students, and others affected by the WTC disaster. NIOSH reported 50,300 responders registered in the MMTP as of December 31, 2007, with 47,000 in the NYC metropolitan area. In the NYC metropolitan area, 9,744 received treatment for respiratory and/or gastrointestinal conditions, and 5,674 for mental health conditions. Program information does not mention the status of non-federal responders' health insurance. MMTP funds medical services through occupational medicine clinics and the FDNY Bureau of Health Services. NIOSH manages the WTC National Responder Health Program. The NIOSH-managed Community Program provides medical monitoring and treatment for eligible responders of specified conditions without cost-sharing. Coverage includes inpatient and outpatient procedures and prescribed medications, but excludes unrelated health conditions and services from personal physicians outside the network. The NIOSH-managed Community Program offers medical monitoring and treatment for eligible responders at no cost, covering inpatient and outpatient procedures and prescribed medications. The program generally allows only one transfer of in-network clinics and does not cover services for family members. The Community Program, established with FY2008 funds, provides health screenings, assessments, and improved access to healthcare services, using grant money to fill gaps in insurance coverage. The NIOSH-managed Community Program offers medical monitoring and treatment for eligible responders at no cost. Covered conditions are those presumed to be related to WTC exposure or injury, including aerodigestive, psychological, and musculoskeletal disorders. Presumptions for non-responders have not been published yet. Conditions covered have been established based on guidelines from NIOSH. The World Trade Center (WTC) Health Program provides medical monitoring and treatment for eligible responders with conditions related to WTC exposure. Aerodigestive conditions are the most prevalent, affecting 19% of registrants. The program has evolved since 2002, offering baseline screenings, regular monitoring, and periodic treatment for WTC-related illnesses funded through appropriations to grantees. The CDC received additional funding from Congress for the WTC Health Program, including $12 million in FY2002, $90 million in FY2003, $75 million in FY2006, and $50 million in FY2007. Funds were allocated for baseline screenings, medical monitoring, and treatment for WTC responders. In FY2008, approximately $108.1 million was provided for screening and treatment of first responders, residents, students, and others. In FY2009, Congress allocated $70 million for the WTC Health Program, with an additional $112 million available from prior year funds. NIOSH and the City of New York projected future program costs to exceed federal funding levels, estimating annual costs between $392 million and $428 million. NIOSH also estimated annual treatment costs for responders in FY2008 and FY2009 at around $55 million. The estimated annual treatment costs for responders for FY2008 and FY2009 were between $55 million and $80 million. Legislation introduced in Congress would provide statutory authority for the MMTP and designate its costs as mandatory spending. Bills in previous Congress sessions proposed alternative financing options for the program. In the 110th Congress, proposals were made regarding the costs of screening, monitoring, and treatment services for responders, but none were enacted. NIOSH is traditionally involved in research on occupational illnesses, workplace safety guidelines, and educating workers. Congress has requested a long-term plan for the MMTP from the Secretary of HHS and the Director of NIOSH. HHS and NIOSH are required to submit a long-term plan for the MMTP to address responder health concerns in future disasters. This plan falls under the responsibilities of the HHS Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response."
