    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 6601 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to require the Secretary of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to refer individuals in custody who may be sexually violent predators for evaluation at least six months before their scheduled release from prison. A petition may be filed if the individual was in custody for a determinate prison term, parole revocation term, or hold under Section 6601.3 at the time of filing. The petition cannot be dismissed if custody was later deemed unlawful due to a good faith mistake of fact or law. This applies to petitions filed on or after January 1, 1996. The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation and the Board of Parole Hearings screen individuals for sexually violent predatory offenses based on their history. If deemed likely to be a sexually violent predator, the person is referred for a full evaluation by the State Department of State Hospitals. The State Department of State Hospitals evaluates individuals using a standardized assessment protocol to determine if they meet the criteria of a sexually violent predator. Factors considered include mental disorders, criminal history, sexual deviance, and severity of mental disorder. The person must be evaluated by two psychiatrists or psychologists designated by the Director of State Hospitals. If both evaluators agree that the person has a diagnosed mental disorder making them likely to commit sexual violence without treatment, a petition for commitment may be filed. The evaluation reports and supporting documents will be provided to the county attorney for possible commitment proceedings. If one professional disagrees with the evaluation results, the Director of State Hospitals will arrange for further examination by two independent professionals. If two independent professionals agree that a person meets the criteria for commitment, a petition for commitment can be filed. The purpose of the evaluation is to determine if the person meets the criteria for involuntary commitment. Any independent professional designated by the Secretary of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation or the Director of State Hospitals must have at least five years of experience in diagnosing and treating mental disorders. This includes psychiatrists and licensed psychologists with a doctoral degree in psychology. These requirements also apply to professionals appointed by the court for evaluations in other proceedings under this article. If the State Department of State Hospitals deems a person a sexually violent predator, the Director of State Hospitals will request a petition for commitment to be filed with the county at least 20 days before the person's release. Evaluation reports and supporting documents will be provided to the county's designated attorney for possible petition filing in court. If a hold is placed under Section 6601.3 and the State Department of State Hospitals determines a person as a sexually violent predator, the Director of State Hospitals will request a petition for commitment to be filed with the county at least 20 days before the hold ends. The person has no right to enforce the time limit or remedy its violation. If the county's designated counsel agrees with the recommendation, a petition for commitment will be filed in the superior court of the county where the person was convicted. The petition will be handled by either the district attorney or county counsel, as designated by the county board of supervisors. An order from a judge under Section 6601.5 can toll parole for a sexually violent predator if probable cause is found. The county's designated attorney must notify the State Department of State Hospitals within 15 days of deciding on a commitment petition. Section 6601.3 of the Welfare and Institutions Code allows the Board of Parole Hearings to extend a person's custody for up to 45 days for evaluation under certain circumstances, such as credit recalculations or court resentencing."
