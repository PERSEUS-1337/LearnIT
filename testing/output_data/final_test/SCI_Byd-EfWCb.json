An optimal representation space concept resolves this paradox theoretically. A simple procedure enables deep recurrent models to perform as well as shallow models without retraining. Empirical evaluations validate the analysis, introducing new sentence embedding models. The insights are applicable beyond natural language processing to domains relying on distributed representations for transfer tasks. Distributed representation spaces in machine learning encode semantic similarity, allowing for generalization to new inputs. Learning effective representations from unlabelled data is a focus of modern research, particularly in the NLP community. Attention has shifted towards unsupervised learning of representations for larger text pieces like phrases and sentences. Research in natural language processing (NLP) focuses on learning effective representations from unlabelled data for larger text pieces like phrases and sentences. Different approaches include summing or averaging word vectors for sentence representation and using sentence-level distributional hypothesis to predict adjacent sentences. Models like SkipThought and FastSent use encoder-decoder architectures, with variations like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or bag-of-words (BOW) versions. These models are trained unsupervised on large text corpora and applied to supervised transfer tasks. In this work, researchers aim to address the observed differences in performance between deep complex models like SkipThought and shallow log-linear models like FastSent on supervised transfer tasks and unsupervised similarity tasks. The focus is on analyzing the geometry of the representation space to improve model performance. In this work, the researchers aim to address the performance gap on unsupervised similarity tasks between simple models and deep complex models. They introduce the concept of an optimal representation space and show that log-linear decoders are usually evaluated in this space, while recurrent models are not. By evaluating recurrent models in their optimal space, the gap is closed. They provide a procedure for extracting this optimal space using decoder hidden states and validate their findings through empirical evaluations.

They provide a procedure for extracting this optimal space using decoder hidden states and validate their findings through empirical evaluations. A distributed representation space is defined as a space H with a similarity measure \u03c1 where semantically close symbols have close representations. Distributed representations are obtained via a function parametrized by weights \u03b8. The input symbols' representations are found as layer activations of a Deep Neural Network, and the output symbols' representations are obtained via a function that does not depend on the input symbol. An optimal representation space, denoted as H with a similarity measure \u03c1, is crucial for evaluating models effectively. This space ensures that small changes in semantic similarity correspond to small changes in vector representations. If a model operates in an optimal representation space, the conditional log-probability of an output symbol given an input symbol is determined by the similarity measure \u03c1 between their vector representations. The conditional log-probability of an output symbol y given an input symbol x is proportional to the similarity \u03c1(h y , h x ) between their vector representations in the optimal space H. The optimal space is crucial for effective model evaluation, ensuring small changes in semantic similarity correspond to small changes in vector representations. An optimal space, denoted by DISPLAYFORM1, ensures that input and output symbols are close under \u03c1. Semantic similarity of symbols translates into closeness of their distributed representations, consistent with the model. Any model parametrised by a continuous function can be approximated by Equation (1), indicating an optimal representation space for probability distribution. An optimal space, denoted by DISPLAYFORM1, ensures that input and output symbols are close under \u03c1. The optimal space for inputs can be constructed from any layer in the network. The paper focuses on unsupervised models for learning distributed representations of sentences in NLP. The text discusses modeling the probability of a context given a sentence using encoder-decoder architectures. It mentions using a log-linear Bag-of-Words (BOW) decoder for the context and the encoder producing a fixed-length vector representation of the sentence. The specific type of encoder is not crucial for the analysis. The log-linear BOW decoder assumes words are conditionally independent, maximizing model probability of contexts given sentences across the corpus. The objective is to find the Maximum Likelihood Estimator for trainable parameters by optimizing the negative log-likelihood. The optimization problem forces sentence representation to be similar to its context representation through dot product, summing output embeddings of context words. The decoder in the RNN model uses a learned <GO> token at the first time step and a probability-weighted sum over word vectors in subsequent steps. The hidden states are concatenated to produce the unrolled decoder embedding. The sentence representation is the concatenation of RNNs for previous and next sentences, ensuring similarity through dot product. The encoder output equipped with the dot product constitutes an optimal representation space for sentences in related contexts. The context decoder can also be an RNN decoder where the encoder output is used. The decoder states are converted to probability distributions over the vocabulary. The model parameters can be found using Maximum Likelihood Estimation. The sentence representation using vector concatenation can be improved by unrolling hidden states of the decoder, leading to better performance on STS tasks regardless of the encoder architecture. This approach consistently outperforms raw encoder output with RNN decoder and often outperforms raw encoder output with BOW decoder. The sentence representation can be enhanced by unrolling decoder hidden states, improving performance on STS tasks regardless of the encoder used. This method outperforms raw encoder output with RNN decoder and sometimes with BOW decoder. The representation space of unrolled concatenated decoder states, equipped with dot product, is optimal for models with recurrent decoders. This space is a better candidate for sentence representation compared to unordered representations. The method of unrolling decoder hidden states improves sentence representation for models with recurrent decoders, enhancing performance on unsupervised similarity tasks. This technique does not require retraining the model and can potentially boost performance almost for free. The optimal representation space depends on the choice of decoder architecture, as demonstrated empirically in Section 5. The study evaluates models with BOW and RNN encoders for sentence representation. The RNN encoder with unrolled decoders using concatenation of hidden states improves performance on tasks, validating theoretical justification. The study compares models with BOW and RNN encoders for sentence representation, showing that unrolling RNN decoders improves performance. Different methods of extracting sentence representations are tested for each encoder-decoder combination. The study evaluates sentence representations using *-RNN-concat models trained on the Toronto Books Corpus. Evaluation tasks include supervised tasks like paraphrase identification, sentiment analysis, subjectivity, opinion polarity, and question type. Unsupervised tasks like Semantic Textual Similarity are also assessed using the SentEval tool. The study evaluates sentence representations using *-RNN-concat models trained on the Toronto Books Corpus for various tasks, including supervised tasks like paraphrase identification and unsupervised tasks like Semantic Textual Similarity (STS). The unsupervised STS tasks are scored using the model's embeddings as features, with dot product used to compute similarity. Identical hyperparameters and architecture are used for each model to compare different decoder types' performance on sentence embeddings. The study evaluates sentence representations using *-RNN-concat models trained on the Toronto Books Corpus for various tasks. A single layer GRU with layer normalization BID8 is used, along with a vocabulary size of 20k, 620-dimensional word embeddings, and 2400 hidden units in all RNNs. Performance of the unrolled models on the STS tasks is presented, showing improvement with even a single state of the decoder. Performance tends to peak around 2-3 hidden states before falling off. The study evaluates sentence representations using *-RNN-concat models trained on the Toronto Books Corpus for various tasks. Performance across unsupervised similarity tasks is presented in Table 1 and performance across supervised transfer tasks is presented in TAB2. The peak performance tends to be around the average sentence length of the corpus, possibly due to the \"softmax drifting effect\". Further research is needed to understand this phenomenon and other potential causes in detail. The study evaluates sentence representations using RNN models trained on the Toronto Books Corpus for various tasks. Results show better performance with RNN encoders compared to BOW encoders in supervised transfer tasks. Further analysis is needed to understand the impact of encoder simplicity on representation space. See Appendices for additional comparisons and results using different similarity measures. The study evaluates sentence representations using RNN models trained on the Toronto Books Corpus for various tasks, showing better performance with RNN encoders compared to BOW encoders in supervised transfer tasks. Results indicate that a single model may perform well on different downstream tasks if representation spaces differ. The unusual combination of a BOW encoder and concatenation of RNN decoders leads to the best performance on most benchmarks. The concept of an optimal representation space is introduced to explain the performance gap between simple and complex architectures on downstream tasks. The study explores the performance difference between simple and complex architectures in downstream tasks by analyzing the optimal representation space for BOW and RNN decoders. It is found that BOW decoders perform optimally with the initial hidden state equipped with dot product, while RNN decoders do not. This discrepancy in optimal representation space explains the performance gap between the two architectures. Additionally, any neural network that outputs a probability distribution has an optimal representation space, which is further analyzed in the context of RNN decoders. Our analysis focused on the optimal representation space for BOW and RNN decoders, showing that unrolling the decoder can improve performance across transfer tasks. Different vector embeddings can be utilized for various downstream tasks, potentially leading to high performance from a single trained model. Although our study was limited to BOW and RNN decoders, other architectures like convolutional and graph decoders may be more suitable for certain tasks. In exploring optimal representation spaces for different decoders, it is important to consider various vector spaces such as hyperbolic, complex-valued, and spinor spaces. While an optimal representation space may not be clear, a mapping from the intuitive space to the optimal space can be achieved through network transformations. Evaluating models in this space can enhance performance, with the goal of making subsequent learning tasks easier. This aspect of representation is crucial for unsupervised similarity tasks, focusing on how well the model separates objects in the chosen space. Our findings suggest using a simple or complex model architecture to optimize the representation space and similarity metric. Future work should focus on understanding similarity and its link to the objective function to improve complex model performance. The study compares the performance of RNN and BOW encoders with different decoder unroll steps using cosine similarity. Unrolling the decoder improves performance compared to *-RNN and is on par or better than *-BOW. Results are compared with the SkipThought model, showing the highest performing model highlighted in bold for various tasks. The study compares RNN and BOW encoders with different decoder unroll steps using cosine similarity. Results show improved performance with decoder unrolling compared to *-RNN and *-BOW, and are on par or better. The SkipThought model's performance is highlighted in bold for various tasks. Reported values indicate test accuracy, with discrepancies attributed to differences in experimental setup or implementation. The objective function aims to maximize the dot product between the decoder and context, but results are presented using cosine similarity. Switching from cosine similarity to dot product in determining semantic similarity results in lower performance across STS tasks. The length of word vectors affects model confidence in context, with longer vectors indicating more certainty. Using raw encoder output achieves the lowest performance, while unrolling RNN decoders significantly improves task performance compared to raw encoder RNN. Using dot product as the similarity measure significantly improves performance across all tasks compared to raw encoder RNN output. Longer sentences have shorter norms, affecting model confidence in context. The noise induced by differences in norms penalizes sentences with multiple contexts, making dot product less useful for STS tasks compared to cosine similarity. The unrolling procedure in Section 3.3 leads to high-dimensional vectors in the decoder, which can be avoided by averaging hidden states instead. This model choice, known as *-RNN-mean, optimizes the dot product for similarity. Results for BOW-RNN-mean and RNN-RNN-mean on similarity and transfer tasks are presented in TAB7, with other models from Section 5 included for completeness. The performance of RNN-RNN-mean is highlighted relative to RNN-RNN. The strong performance of RNN-RNN-mean compared to RNN-RNN is consistent with theory, but further exploration on why it outperforms RNN-concat on STS tasks is left for future work."
