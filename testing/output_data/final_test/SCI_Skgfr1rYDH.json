    "content": "Abstract Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and Adam are commonly used to optimize deep neural networks, but choosing one usually means making tradeoffs between speed, accuracy, and stability. A new algorithm is introduced to unify SGD and Adam, allowing for more detailed control over training models. It outperforms SGD and Adam for image classification tasks and surpasses SGD for language modeling tasks. SoftAdam is a new optimizer that combines SGD with Adam, aiming to improve speed and generalization in training deep neural networks. It addresses the tradeoffs between speed, accuracy, and stability typically associated with using either SGD or Adam alone. SoftAdam is a new optimizer that combines SGD with Adam to achieve better optimization results across various problems. Recent studies have shown that switching from Adam to SGD during training can improve generalization performance, with one approach involving clipping large Adam updates to make them more similar to SGD as training progresses. SoftAdam is a new optimizer that combines SGD with Adam to improve optimization results. Recent studies suggest switching from Adam to SGD during training can enhance generalization performance by clipping large Adam updates to resemble SGD. Other algorithms like averaging weights over many steps have also shown improvements on SGD. The idea of gradient descent is to follow the steepest descent path to an optimum. Stochastic gradient descent optimizes larger problems by using randomly subsampled training data. The algorithm minimizes the loss function J(\u03b8; x) parameterized by \u03b8 and input training data x, with a learning rate \u03b1 that may vary with t and x t as the selected training data. Convergence rate can be improved using momentum and the Adam algorithm, which involves the second gradient for better convergence, especially for LSTM and language modeling tasks. The convergence of gradient descent algorithms can be analyzed by considering a second-order approximation of the loss function. The learning rate plays a crucial role in stability and convergence speed, with the optimal rate depending on the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix. Using a diagonal matrix for updates can potentially improve convergence, especially when the Hessian is diagonal. When the Hessian is diagonal, the algorithm can converge to the minimum in one step if eigenvalues are known. AdaGrad algorithm uses diagonal elements for approximation. Comparing AdaGrad coefficient to optimal value shows convergence. When the Hessian is diagonal, the algorithm can converge to the minimum in one step if eigenvalues are known. AdaGrad algorithm uses diagonal elements for approximation. Comparing AdaGrad coefficient to optimal value shows convergence. This may be true if initializations z 0i and optima z i can be made over the same subspaces. Errors can occur in overestimating and underestimating eigenvalues, especially when parameters are initialized far from their optimum. When the Hessian is diagonal, the algorithm can converge to the minimum in one step if eigenvalues are known. However, errors can occur in estimating eigenvalues, leading to significant noise in the optimization process. This problem is exacerbated for Adam due to its decay factor, potentially causing divergence as parameters reach their optimum. The algorithm's performance worsens for small eigenvalues. The understanding that adaptive moments may effectively estimate large eigenvalues but less so for small eigenvalues has led to considering an update to the algorithm. This update incorporates information about large eigenvalues and optimizes the learning rate to account for variation in eigenvalues contributing to convergence. The update includes a new hyper-parameter to control the weighting of eigenvalue estimation. The update to the algorithm incorporates information about large eigenvalues and optimizes the learning rate to account for variation in eigenvalues contributing to convergence. It includes a new hyper-parameter to control the weighting of eigenvalue estimation, with the goal of making warmup unnecessary. The algorithm incorporates a biased gradient estimate and calculates the second moment v t in an unbiased way. It also calculates the ratio of samples used to calculate the moment v t to the steady state number of samples. Weight decay should be calculated separately from this update. SoftAdam algorithm was tested on various deep learning problems with \u03b7 set at the default value of 1. Results show that SoftAdam performs well with common parameter choices, comparable to SGDM and Adam algorithms. Hyper-parameters \u03b7 and learning rate schedule \u03b1 should be optimized for best performance. Various networks were trained including AlexNet, VGG19, ResNet-110, PreResNet-56, and DenseNet-BC. SoftAdam algorithm outperforms SGD in training classifiers on CIFAR-10 dataset. It achieves lower validation loss with a larger weight decay constant. Results are summarized in Table 1. SoftAdam algorithm, with 1150 hidden units per layer on the Penn Treebank dataset, outperforms SGD significantly but falls short of Adam's performance. Results for three random initializations are shown in Figure 2 and summarized in Table 2. A transformer was also trained on the IWSLT'14 German to English dataset using the fairseq package. Results with optimized hyperparameters are summarized in Table 3. This paper introduces a new optimization algorithm that combines SGD and Adam.
