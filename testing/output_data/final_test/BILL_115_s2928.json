    "content": "The \"Colorectal Cancer Detection Act of 2018\" allows Medicare coverage for FDA-approved blood-based screening tests for colorectal cancer. The \"Colorectal Cancer Detection Act of 2018\" amends the Social Security Act to include coverage for qualifying colorectal cancer screening blood-based tests that are FDA-approved and marketed more than 6 months before the year of screening. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act amends the Social Security Act to include frequency limits for colorectal cancer screening tests and payment amounts for qualifying colorectal cancer screening blood-based tests. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act includes frequency limits for colorectal cancer screening tests and payment amounts for qualifying blood-based tests. This includes timeframes for follow-up screenings based on previous findings. Frequency limits for colorectal cancer screening tests are outlined in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. These limits specify that no payment can be made for a screening colonoscopy if it is performed within certain timeframes after a previous screening test, based on the individual's risk level for colorectal cancer. The payment amount and frequency limits for colorectal cancer screening tests, including blood-based tests, are determined by the Secretary based on specific criteria. The amendments made by this section apply to colorectal cancer screening tests, including blood-based tests, more than 6 months after the enactment of this Act."
