    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Business Supply Chain Transparency on Trafficking and Slavery Act of 2014\". It includes findings and the sense of Congress. Congress finds that in 2012, the Department of Labor identified 134 goods from 74 countries made by forced labor and child labor. The United States, as the largest importer, faces increasing demands for information on human rights impacts of products. Courts have limited consumer actions under the Tariff Act, resulting in few enforcement actions in the past 80 years. The United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights emphasize the responsibility of businesses to respect human rights and the duty of States to protect these rights. States must take necessary steps to prevent and address human rights abuses in the workforce through effective policies and regulations. The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2003 and the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2005 allow for the termination of Federal contracts if contractors engage in trafficking or forced labor. United States courts have jurisdiction over Federal employees involved in such activities abroad. Executive Order 13126, Executive Order 13627, and the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 have prohibited Federal contractors from engaging in trafficking-related activities such as charging labor recruitment fees, confiscating passports, and using fraudulent recruitment practices. The legislative framework requires Federal contractors to have an anti-trafficking compliance plan, including a complaint mechanism and procedures to prevent subcontractors from engaging in trafficking. Congress acknowledges forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor as severe abuses for profit, and the current regulations to prevent these practices in the US commerce are inadequate. Legislation is needed to inform consumers about products free of child labor, forced labor, slavery, and human trafficking. Public disclosures can help businesses and consumers avoid supporting these crimes through tainted supply chains. Legislation is necessary to disclose information on efforts to combat forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is amended to require covered issuers to disclose efforts to combat forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor in their annual reports. Regulations will be promulgated within a year of the enactment of the Global Supply Chain Transparency Act. The Global Supply Chain Transparency Act amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to mandate disclosure of measures taken by covered issuers to address forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor in their supply chains. This includes policies to identify and eliminate these risks, along with actions taken in accordance with the policy. The Global Supply Chain Transparency Act requires covered issuers to disclose their policies on prohibiting employees from engaging in commercial sex acts with minors, efforts to address risks of forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor in the supply chain, and actions taken to eliminate these risks. The Global Supply Chain Transparency Act mandates covered issuers to disclose if evaluations were conducted by a third party, involve consultation with independent labor organizations or workers' associations, and specify the extent of such consultation. The Global Supply Chain Transparency Act requires covered issuers to specify the extent of their process in covering entities within the supply chain, including upstream entities and across product lines. It also mandates audits of suppliers to investigate working conditions, labor practices, and risks of forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor within their supply chain. The Global Supply Chain Transparency Act mandates covered issuers to evaluate their supply chain systems for compliance with policies, require suppliers to attest to lawful practices, and maintain internal accountability. The Global Supply Chain Transparency Act requires covered issuers to maintain internal accountability standards, supply chain management, and procurement systems for entities within their supply chain, ensuring compliance with standards on forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor. Employees and management responsible for supply chain management must receive training on these issues. The Global Supply Chain Transparency Act mandates covered issuers to enforce accountability standards in their supply chains to combat forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor. This includes ensuring labor recruitment practices comply with issuer policies to eliminate exploitative practices. The Global Supply Chain Transparency Act requires covered issuers to take action when forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor are found in their supply chains. This includes providing support to victims and implementing programs to prevent future occurrences. Information on these efforts must be disclosed on the issuer's website. The Global Supply Chain Transparency Act mandates covered issuers to disclose information on efforts to combat forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor in their supply chains. This disclosure must be easily accessible on the issuer's website and provided in writing upon request. The Commission will maintain a searchable list of covered issuers on its website. The Global Supply Chain Transparency Act requires covered issuers with annual global receipts exceeding $100,000,000 to disclose measures taken to address forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor in their supply chains. The Commission will compile this information for easy access. The Global Supply Chain Transparency Act mandates disclosure of actions taken to address forced labor, slavery, and human trafficking in supply chains. Remediation refers to measures implemented by issuers to address non-compliance with standards. The term 'supply chain' for covered issuers means all labor recruiters, suppliers, component parts, and raw materials used in manufacturing products. 'The worst forms of child labor' refer to child labor violating national and international standards. SEC. 4. DISCLOSURES ON WEBSITE OF DEPARTMENT OF LABOR. The Secretary of Labor will provide a searchable list on the Department of Labor's website of companies disclosing measures to address forced labor, slavery, human trafficking, and child labor in their supply chains. Additionally, a top 100 list of companies adhering to supply chain labor standards will be published annually.
