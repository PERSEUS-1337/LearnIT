    "content": "Salmon and steelhead are anadromous fish that migrate from freshwater to the ocean and back to spawn. Dams in the Columbia Basin have impacted their populations since the construction of Bonneville Dam in 1938. Currently, several salmon ESUs and steelhead DPSs in the region are listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act. The ESA protects various fish species in the Colombia River Basin, including Snake River sockeye salmon, Chinook salmon, steelhead, Columbia River Chum salmon, and others. The NMFS has noted a significant decline in salmon and steelhead production in the basin, with an annual loss of over 10 million fish compared to historical levels. The Columbia River Basin has over 10 million fish below historical levels, with 8 million attributed to hydropower development. Habitat has decreased from 21,000 to 16,000 miles due to management practices. Salmon and steelhead trout are a mix of wild and hatchery fish. Artificial propagation began in the late 1800s to support wild stocks. Federal and state hatcheries produce more fish than wild stocks annually. The ESA requires reviews of federal actions to protect threatened and endangered species. The consultation process under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) involves federal agencies like NMFS and FWS to protect threatened and endangered species like anadromous salmon and steelhead in the Columbia Basin. The Corps, Reclamation, and BPA are involved in operating the FCRPS and initiating formal consultation with NMFS when their actions may impact listed species. ESA consultation is triggered by submitting a biological assessment describing the proposed action's impact on listed species. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) consultation process involves NMFS assessing the impact of proposed actions on listed species like salmon and steelhead. NMFS issues a biological opinion (BiOp) to determine if the action would jeopardize protected species and includes reasonable and prudent alternatives (RPAs) if jeopardy is found. If no jeopardy is likely, NMFS issues an Incidental Take Statement to the action agencies. The Endangered Species Act (ESA) consultation process involves NMFS assessing the impact of proposed actions on listed species like salmon and steelhead. NMFS issues a biological opinion (BiOp) to determine if the action would jeopardize protected species and includes reasonable and prudent alternatives (RPAs) if jeopardy is found. If no jeopardy is likely, NMFS issues an Incidental Take Statement to the action agencies, excusing any harm to listed species as long as terms are followed. NMFS also issues salmonid BiOps for Upper Snake River activities and harvest operations. The FCRPS dams' configuration and operation are contentious, affecting various stakeholders with differing interests. Actions to aid the recovery of salmon populations in the Columbia River watershed include habitat restoration, harvest management, hatchery programs, and hydrosystem improvements. These populations face threats from various human activities and climate change impacts, such as water pollution, habitat degradation, and changing environmental conditions. Efforts are focused on improving access to suitable habitat for salmon rearing and spawning, which has been historically degraded by economic activities like logging, mining, and development. The Columbia River watershed faces threats to salmon populations from habitat degradation caused by human activities and climate change. Restoration efforts include actions to improve upriver and down-river habitat, such as increasing stream flows, reducing water temperature, removing barriers, and enhancing spawning habitats. Additionally, measures are being taken to address predators like California sea lions, which consume significant numbers of salmon at fish passage facilities. Sea lions at the Bonneville Dam consumed 10,859 salmonids between January 1 and May 31, 2015, accounting for 4.3% of adult salmonid passage. To reduce predation, NMFS authorized the lethal take of California sea lions gathering below the dam. Efforts to capture and euthanize sea lions continue despite legal challenges. Other predators like pikeminnow also pose a threat to juvenile salmon and steelhead in the Columbia River, with a program offering rewards for their removal. Over 4.2 million pikeminnow have been caught since the program's inception. Since the program started, over 4.2 million pikeminnow have been caught, reducing their predation on juvenile salmonids by 40%. Fisheries in the Columbia River are co-managed by multiple entities and subject to review for compliance with the ESA. Managers aim to minimize harvest of wild fish, especially listed populations, through various actions like selective fishing gear and timing harvest periods. In mark-selective fisheries, adipose fins are clipped on hatchery juveniles to differentiate them from wild adults. Hatchery efforts aim to increase fish numbers through artificial propagation, but concerns exist about competition with wild salmon for food and habitat, as well as genetic diversity alterations. The Hatchery Scientific Review Group emphasizes that hatchery management alone will not recover endangered salmon and steelhead, requiring a broader strategy involving habitat, harvest rates, and other human environment factors. NMFS Hatchery Listing Policy allows for consideration of hatchery fish in population estimates under certain circumstances. Hydrosystem actions focus on improving salmon and steelhead survival during migration past dams. Measures include structural changes, juvenile bypass systems, fish transportation, and water releases for safer passage. Federal protection measures for salmon and steelhead have been in place for nearly 70 years. The dam, constructed in 1938, includes a fish ladder for salmon passage. The Northwest Power Act established a fish protection program for the dam. Options for downstream fish migration at hydropower dams include spill over, turbine passage, barge/truck transport, or river bypass. Actions like spilling water to aid juvenile fish downstream can impact energy production and increase power rates. Gas bubble disease from spill can harm fish, increasing mortality and vulnerability to predation. Research suggests that harm to migratory juvenile or adult salmonids exposed to gas supersaturation depends on characteristics of the site adjacent to the dam. Fish ladders and bypasses can assist migration, but dams can also change river ecology, decrease flow, delay fish movement, increase predation, and raise water temperature to lethal levels. Reservoirs created by dams may inundate productive spawning and rearing habitat. Some advocate for altering dam operations to benefit salmon. Some parties propose removing four dams on the Lower Snake River in Washington to save salmon populations. Dam removal could benefit fishing and recreation industries, reduce harm to listed species, and revitalize local economies. Opponents argue that dam removal would only help a portion of salmon populations in the Columbia Basin and that the dams are crucial for the Northwest's power supply. The Lower Snake River dams are important for the Northwest's power supply and removing them could impact downstream barge transport of wheat from Idaho. Dam removal may be necessary if relicensing requires costly modifications for fish passage. The removal of Condit Dam on the White Salmon River has reopened habitat for steelhead and salmon after nearly 100 years, with Chinook salmon and steelhead spawning in the area. Long-term monitoring and adaptive management of the newly accessible habitat are recommended. Legal challenges have frequently altered operations of the FCRPS due to concerns about listed species. NMFS may offer alternatives like habitat protection and fish passage systems when planned operations jeopardize species. Since the early 1990s, various groups have challenged NMFS's conclusions under the APA, which allows courts to set aside agency actions deemed arbitrary or capricious. In order to survive an APA challenge, a federal agency must show a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made. The central question in ESA litigation regarding the FCRPS was whether NMFS and the action agencies could meet the arbitrary and capricious standard. NMFS issued BiOps in 1992 finding no jeopardy to protected salmonids in the Columbia Basin from ocean and in-river fisheries. The U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon dismissed claims by high volume energy users challenging the 1992 BiOps for FCRPS consultation, citing a conflict between lower power rates and ESA's salmon protection goals. The Ninth Circuit disagreed with the standing ruling but affirmed the dismissal based on alternative grounds. The U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon dismissed claims challenging the 1992 BiOps for FCRPS consultation, citing a conflict between power rates and salmon protection goals. The Ninth Circuit disagreed on standing but affirmed dismissal based on the case being moot due to a revised BiOp issued in 1993. The 1993 BiOp was found to be \"arbitrary and capricious\" by the district court for using improper data in calculating the baseline number of protected salmonids in the Columbia Basin. The 1993 BiOp for FCRPS consultation was found to be flawed, leading to a call for a major overhaul. NMFS was directed to consult with action agencies and revise the BiOp, but FCRPS operations were not halted. The Ninth Circuit later vacated the district court's decision as the BiOp expired, and subsequent BiOps were released. The 1994 BiOp concluded that FCRPS operations would not harm protected species or critical habitat. In response to criticism of the 1993 BiOp, NMFS issued a new 1995 BiOp concluding that FCRPS operations jeopardized protected species and their habitat. This led to the proposal of RPAs to address the issue. NMFS proposed RPAs to address the jeopardy to protected species and their critical habitat, including a program for juvenile salmonids to bypass the dam system using tanker trucks or barges. The Ninth Circuit dismissed a challenge to the long-term transportation program as non-justiciable, stating that it was not a final agency action subject to judicial review. Another lawsuit challenged BPA's decision to adopt the jeopardy opinion and propose RPAs. The Ninth Circuit upheld the 1995 BiOp despite scientific uncertainty about salmon decline. In the 2000 BiOp, NMFS proposed RPAs to mitigate FCRPS operations' impact on salmon, finding that RPAs and offsite activities combined could avoid jeopardy. In the ongoing case National Wildlife Federation v. National Marine Fisheries Service, Judge Redden found the 2000 BiOp to be inconsistent with the ESA due to uncertainties surrounding offsite activities. NMFS issued a new biological opinion instead of revising the existing one as directed by the court. In response to concerns raised by the court, NMFS issued a new biological opinion in 2004, known as the 2004 BiOp. This opinion took a unique approach by excluding the impact of existing dams from evaluation, focusing only on discretionary elements of FCRPS operations. Judge Redden found this approach incompatible with the ESA and identified four fundamental flaws, leading to a preliminary injunction for modifying FCRPS operations. The Ninth Circuit largely affirmed the district court's decision on appeal. Following the Ninth Circuit's affirmation of the district court's preliminary injunction on the 2004 BiOp, Judge Redden ordered NMFS to reengage in consultation and produce a new BiOp. Despite NMFS's objections, Judge Redden closely monitored the consultation process and provided detailed instructions. Two months later, the district court granted another motion for preliminary injunction, modifying FCRPS dam operations. The Ninth Circuit later affirmed the district court's decision that the 2004 BiOp was structurally flawed. The 2004 BiOp was criticized by the Ninth Circuit for its flawed evaluation approach, which failed to consider severely degraded baseline conditions. NMFS issued a separate 2005 Snake River BiOp, which was also found to be arbitrary and capricious by Judge Redden. In 2008, BPA, the Corps, and Reclamation entered into 10-year agreements with Columbia Basin tribes and states for the FCRPS. This led to the \"Fish Accords,\" where parties agreed on terms for a BiOp and BPA committed to funding mitigation projects. Environmental groups, fishing interests, and Oregon were not part of the Fish Accords. NMFS issued a new FCRPS BiOp in 2008 based on the Fish Accords. NMFS issued a new FCRPS BiOp in 2008 based on the Fish Accords, supplemented in 2010 to address concerns. Environmental groups challenged the 2008/2010 BiOp, with the court ruling in favor of a portion of it for compliance with the ESA. The court ruled that NMFS relied on habitat mitigation measures that are not specific or certain for the 2014-2018 operations in the BiOp. Judge Redden remanded the 2008/2010 BiOp for further consultation on post-2013 operations and ordered a supplement by January 1, 2014, to consider more aggressive actions like dam removal. NMFS issued a second supplement in January 2014, maintaining that jeopardy could be avoided through RPAs. The U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon found flaws in NMFS's conclusion on protected species recovery, habitat improvement data, and climate change analysis in the 2014 Supplement. The court deemed the Supplement arbitrary and capricious, ordering further consultation by March 1, 2018, and keeping the Supplement in place temporarily. Additionally, the action agencies were found to violate the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The action agencies violated the National Environmental Policy Act by not preparing an environmental impact statement for the RPAs in the 2014 Supplement. The court found the statements used were outdated or too narrow, requesting a timeline for completing the EIS. NMFS, the Corps, and Reclamation requested five years to prepare the EIS. Other litigation has influenced the application of the ESA to Columbia River anadromous fish. NMFS settled a suit challenging its critical habitat determination for the Columbia River due to flawed methodology. Litigants also questioned the Hatchery Listing Policy's treatment of hatchery-raised salmon and steelhead under the ESA. The policy allowed certain hatchery fish to be included in the same ESU as wild fish but excluded them from listing, which a federal court found violated the ESA. The federal court found that the Hatchery Listing Policy violated the ESA by listing distinctions below the species level. The revised policy requires considering the status of the entire ESU rather than just wild fish, resulting in downlisting certain fish like steelhead trout. Two suits were filed challenging the final HLP's application to steelhead and salmon. In the steelhead case, plaintiffs challenged NMFS's downlisting decision based on the condition of both hatchery and wild steelhead. The Ninth Circuit upheld NMFS's analysis, stating it was supported by substantial scientific data. In the salmon case, NMFS distinguished between hatchery and wild salmon stocks. In the salmon case, NMFS distinguished between hatchery and wild salmon stocks. The U.S. District Court rejected the argument for equal treatment under the ESA. NMFS authorized lethal removal of California sea lions to reduce predation on salmon, but this was revoked in 2010 due to a court decision. NMFS was unable to justify killing sea lions when their impact on salmon was comparable to commercial fishing. In May 2011, NMFS authorized states to euthanize California sea lions, but withdrew that in July 2011 due to a lawsuit. In March 2012, NMFS reissued Letters of Authorization to Washington, Oregon, and Idaho allowing the removal of up to 92 sea lions. A legal challenge was raised by the Humane Society and others, but the Ninth Circuit sided with NMFS, stating that the authorization was based on scientific data. States have since lethally removed sea lions under the 2012 authorization. Between 2008 and 2015, Oregon and Washington removed 102 California sea lions, with 15 placed in a zoo or aquarium, 87 euthanized, and 7 dying in captivity. The 2012 authorization expired on June 30, 2016, but a new letter of authorization was issued on that date after the states applied for a five-year extension. NMFS agreed that the states showed sufficient evidence of the predation problem."
