    "content": "The Nurse Training and Retention Act of 2009 may be cited as such. Key findings are outlined in the Act. The Nurse Training and Retention Act of 2009 highlights the growing shortage of nurses in the healthcare system. By 2020, there is projected to be a shortage of 1,016,900 nurses nationally. To address this issue, healthcare workers need access to education and support for training opportunities. Healthcare workers and bedside nurses can help address the nursing shortage and provide quality care as the American population ages. Establishment of grant program. The purpose of this section is to authorize grants to address the projected shortage of nurses, increase nurse education capacity, and provide training programs for healthcare workers. The Secretary of Labor will establish a partnership grant program to award grants to eligible healthcare entities for nurse education and career advancement programs. Eligible entities include healthcare entities jointly administered by a healthcare employer and a labor union representing healthcare employees. The partnership grant program awards grants to eligible healthcare entities for nurse education and career advancement programs. Eligible entities include those jointly administered by healthcare providers or facilities, a trade association of healthcare providers, and organizations representing direct care healthcare workers or staff nurses with input on leadership. To be eligible for a grant under this section, a healthcare employer must participate in a State training partnership program that includes equal participation from industry, labor organizations, and other relevant entities. The employer must also submit an application to the Secretary with required information. To be eligible for a grant under this section, a healthcare employer must demonstrate an established program to retain nurses, provide competitive wages and benefits, and support nursing career ladder programs through paid leave and health coverage for incumbent healthcare workers. The eligibility requirements for a grant under this section include contributions to a joint labor-management training fund, provision of paid release time for staff nurses, payment of tuition assistance, and a matching requirement set by the Secretary. The Secretary may only grant funds if the applicant agrees to provide non-Federal contributions equal to at least $1 for every $1 of Federal funds. Contributions can be in cash, in-kind, or through paid release time for worker students. Non-Federal contributions required in cash or in kind, including paid release time, must be fairly evaluated. Federal Government funds or services subsidized by the Federal Government cannot be counted as non-Federal contributions. Entities receiving assistance must collaborate with accredited schools of nursing, including community colleges and other academic institutions offering nursing programs. Activities funded by grants under this section include programs to educate healthcare workers to become nurses, such as Certified Nurse Assistants, Licensed Practical Nurses, Licensed Vocational Nurses, and Registered Nurses. This may involve English as a second language education, GED education, pre-college counseling, college preparation classes, and entry support. Providing tuition assistance for nursing education, including dedicated cohort classes in community colleges and universities, support with licensure tests, orientation and mentorship programs for new nurses, and stipends for release time. Programs are in place to assist nurses in obtaining advanced degrees and completing specialty training. Incentives are provided for nurses to take on faculty positions. This includes funding for nurses to return to school and incentives for bedside nurses with advanced degrees to teach in nursing programs. Bedside nurses can obtain a leave to teach in nursing programs without losing salary or benefits. Collaboration with accredited schools for innovative nursing programs is encouraged. Preference is given to programs that improve nurse retention. The program aims to improve nurse retention, increase diversity in new nurse graduates, enhance nursing education quality for better patient care, upgrade healthcare workers to become nurses, and evaluate outcomes annually. The outcomes of the program may include increased enrollment in nursing schools, higher graduation and licensure rates for nurses, improved nurse retention, more staff nurses at healthcare facilities, more nurses with advanced degrees, increased nurse faculty, and better patient quality measures. The Secretary of Labor will submit a report to Congress on the effectiveness of the grant program, using data from reports received. Authorization of appropriations is provided for the implementation of this section."
