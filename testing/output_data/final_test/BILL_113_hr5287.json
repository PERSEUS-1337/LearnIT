    "content": "Expenses for household and elder care services necessary for gainful employment are addressed in a new section added to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The new section added to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 allows for a tax credit against employment-related expenses paid by an individual with qualifying dependents. The credit amount is determined based on the taxpayer's adjusted gross income. The new section in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 provides a tax credit for employment-related expenses paid by individuals with qualifying dependents, defined as individuals over 50 years old who are related to the taxpayer or would be a dependent if not for certain criteria. The new section in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 offers a tax credit for employment-related expenses for individuals providing over half of a dependent's support for the current and previous four years, based on the individual's modified adjusted gross income. The tax credit is available for individuals caring for dependents who are physically or mentally incapable of caring for themselves and have the same principal place of abode for more than half of the taxable year. The tax credit is available for individuals caring for dependents who are physically or mentally incapable of caring for themselves and have the same principal place of abode for more than half of the taxable year. Modified adjusted gross income excludes section 86, and employment-related expenses cover household services and care for qualifying individuals. The tax credit covers employment-related expenses for care outside the taxpayer's household for qualifying individuals, including those who spend at least 8 hours daily in the taxpayer's household or are cared for by a dependent care center. A dependent care center, as defined in this paragraph, provides care for more than six individuals and receives payment for its services. The center must comply with state or local laws and meet specific requirements to be eligible for consideration under the tax credit for employment-related expenses. The tax credit for employment-related expenses has a dollar limit of $3,000 for one qualifying individual or $6,000 for two or more qualifying individuals. The amount is reduced by any income excluded under section 129. There is also an earned income limitation on the expenses that can be claimed. The tax credit for employment-related expenses has a dollar limit based on earned income. For individuals, the limit is their earned income, and for married individuals, it is the lesser of their earned income or their spouse's earned income. Special rules apply, such as not having the same principal place of abode if in violation of local law, and married couples must file a joint return. If a taxpayer is married at the end of the tax year, the tax credit can only be claimed if they file a joint return with their spouse. Legal separation or living apart rules apply for married individuals filing separately. If an individual maintains a household during the taxable year and their spouse is not a member of the household for the last 6 months of the year, they will not be considered married for tax purposes. No tax credit is allowed for payments made to related individuals who are eligible for a deduction as a dependent or are the taxpayer's child under 19 years old. The tax credit for services performed by individuals must include identifying information such as name, address, and taxpayer identification number on the return claiming the credit. If the service provider is a tax-exempt organization, only the name and address need to be included. Failure to provide this information will result in disqualification for the credit. The taxpayer must provide identifying information, including the TIN, for qualifying individuals to claim the tax credit. Failure to do so will result in disqualification. The Secretary will prescribe necessary regulations for this section. The amendments made by this section regarding expenses for household and elder care services necessary for gainful employment will apply to taxable years beginning after the date of the enactment of this Act."
