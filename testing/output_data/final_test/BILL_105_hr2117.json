    "content": "The \"Farm Preservation Act of 1997\" is cited as the short title. It excludes gains from the sale of certain farmland used for farming under section 138 of the Internal Revenue Code. The \"Farm Preservation Act of 1997\" excludes gain from the sale of farmland under a qualified covenant that restricts its use to farming purposes. Farmland is defined as real property used for farming in the United States. A qualified covenant is an irrevocable agreement entered into by all owners of the farmland. The \"Farm Preservation Act of 1997\" requires a covenant that applies to all owners of farmland and binds future owners. The covenant must be notified to the Secretary and the Secretary of Agriculture, and a copy must be submitted for verification. The use of farmland includes using it as the principal residence. (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections for such part is amended by inserting new items. Sec. 138 and Sec. 139 pertain to sales and exchanges of farmland restricted to farming and cross-references to other Acts. The effective date for these amendments is after December 31, 1996. Additionally, Sec. 2033A excludes farmland from the gross estate if it is restricted to use as farmland by covenant. Sec. 2033A excludes the adjusted value of farmland from the gross estate if there is a qualified covenant restricting its use to farmland only. This applies to estates of US citizens or residents with ownership of farmland for at least 5 years within an 8-year period before the decedent's death. The section defines farmland as real property used for farming in the US and a qualified covenant as an irrevocable agreement entered into by all owners of the farmland. Material participation by the decedent or family in farmland operation is required for exclusion from the gross estate. The term 'adjusted value' refers to the value of farmland for estate tax purposes, excluding deductions under section 2053(a). The use of farmland as a principal residence is considered under this section. Notification to the Secretary and the Secretary of Agriculture is required for any covenant to be valid. The adjusted value of farmland for estate tax purposes excludes deductions under section 2053(a). Notification to the Secretary and the Secretary of Agriculture is required for any covenant to be valid. The state where the covenant is recorded must be specified, and a copy of the covenant must be submitted to the Secretary. The amendments exclude farmland restricted to agricultural use by covenant from estate tax calculations for covenants recorded after December 31, 1996, for estates of decedents after that date."
