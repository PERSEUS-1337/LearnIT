    "content": "This report examines real wage trends from 1979 to 2017 using data from the Current Population Survey. It focuses on wage growth among low- and middle-wage workers aged 25 to 64, adjusting hourly wages to 2017 dollars. The report analyzes real wage trends from 1979 to 2017, focusing on low- and middle-wage workers aged 25 to 64. Wages were adjusted to 2017 dollars using the CPI-U. Non-wage compensation, such as health insurance and retirement contributions, also impacts living standards. A BLS study found that while median wages fell between 2007 and 2014, total compensation remained unchanged due to rising health insurance costs. The report analyzes wage trends from 1979 to 2017 for low- and middle-wage workers aged 25 to 64. Data are cross-sectional, showing patterns among different wage percentiles but not individual experiences. Wage stagnation at the median suggests that living standards have not broadly increased. Overall, wage trends from 1979 to 2017 show an increase at the top of the distribution, a slight increase in the middle, and a lesser rise at the bottom. Gender wage gap narrowed as median wages for women increased while those for men declined. Real wages fell for less educated workers and rose for highly educated workers, contributing to a wage gap based on education levels. The wage gap between workers with different educational attainment grew markedly over the 1979 to 2000 period and has plateaued since then. The rising wage premium to post-secondary education has likely contributed to relatively high wage growth at the top of the distribution. Occupational composition of worker groups also plays a role in wage disparities. Factors such as market, institutional, and macroeconomic influences are thought to contribute to wage patterns. Wage trends from 1979 to 2017 show an increase at the top of the distribution, a slight increase in the middle, and a lesser rise at the bottom. Gender wage gap narrowed as median wages for women increased while those for men declined. Real wages fell for less educated workers and rose for highly educated workers. Wage trends are analyzed by sex, race, Hispanic ethnicity, and education levels. The focus is on low-, middle-, and high-wage groups at the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles of each group's wage distribution. Examining trends within demographic groups reveals important differences that would be masked by only looking at the overall distribution. Data in Appendix B shows the composition of wage distribution in 1979 and 2017. The composition of wage distribution in 1979 and 2017 is analyzed, including trends and estimated wage levels. Methodology used to produce wage estimates is discussed, with a focus on excluding outliers. Data used for analysis is cross-sectional, representing different samples of workers each year. Individual workers can move throughout the wage distribution over time. Individual workers can move throughout the wage distribution over time. Table 1 shows real hourly wages across demographic groups from 1979 to 2017. Wages at the 90th percentile increased, with rates ranging from 12.1% to 65.5% across different groups. Overall, wages at the 90th percentile increased by 34.3% over the 38-year period. Median wage trends varied among demographic groups, with some experiencing decreases. Overall, wage trends from 1979 to 2017 were uniform across demographic groups, with some groups experiencing wage decreases while others saw increases. Median wages increased from $20.27 to $21.50 (a 6.1% increase), and wages at the 10th percentile rose from $10.81 to $10.94 (a 1.2% increase). Wage growth rates varied over different time periods, showing declines in the 1980s for all groups at the 10th percentile, and some declines at the 50th percentile as well. From 1979 to 2017, wage trends varied across demographic groups. While median wages increased, the 10th percentile wages also saw a slight rise. Real wage growth differed among groups, with exceptions for black and Hispanic workers at the 90th percentile. Despite overall gains for women, disparities existed between black and white women, as well as Hispanic and non-Hispanic women. Variations in wage growth were observed within different demographic groups. The text discusses variations in wage trends among demographic groups from 1979 to 2017. Disparities exist between Hispanic and non-Hispanic women, as well as within other demographic groups. Wage growth differed by gender, with women experiencing a 25.5% increase compared to a 6% loss for men. However, women's median wage in 2017 was still lower than men's. The analysis disaggregates wage trends by sex, race, and Hispanic ethnicity, organized by low, median, and high earners. In general, women in all demographic groups experienced rising wage levels at the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles, except for black women and Hispanic women at the 10th percentile. Among male workers, the 10th percentile wage fell for all demographic groups between 1979 and 2017, with the median wage falling for black men and Hispanic men but increasing modestly for white men. Wages at the 90th percentile rose for all male groups, while wages at the 10th percentile fell in real terms for all low-wage worker groups except for white women. From 1979 to 2017, wages at the 10th percentile varied by race and gender. For men, Hispanic men had the largest decline (8.9%), followed by white men (7.6%) and black men (6.0%). Women's wages at the 10th percentile increased by 1.7%, mainly driven by gains for white women (8.6%). Median wages for men fell by 6.0% during the same period. From 1979 to 2017, there was a significant wage gap between men and women. Median wages for men decreased by 6.0%, while women saw an increase of 25.5%. White men had the highest median wages in both years, with a slight increase from $25.33 to $25.96. However, wages for black and Hispanic men decreased. White women experienced the largest increase in median wages at 31.3%, while black and Hispanic women also saw increases. Wages at the 90th percentile grew for both men and women, with women experiencing a higher increase at 65.5%. Wages at the 90th percentile saw significant increases from 1979 to 2017. White men had the highest wages, rising by 43.5% to $60.58. Black and Hispanic men also saw increases, but not as much. White women had the largest percentage increase at 68.5%, reaching $46.25. Black and Hispanic women also experienced wage growth. The wage growth from 1979 to 2017 varied among demographic groups, leading to increased wage inequality. The 90th percentile wages increased significantly, contributing to growing inequality within all groups. The gender wage gap narrowed as female workers experienced strong wage growth, while men saw wage losses. The gender wage gap narrowed from 62.8% to 83.9% over the 1979 to 2017 period. However, wage differentials between black and white workers, as well as Hispanic and non-Hispanic workers, increased. Wages for workers with higher education levels rose significantly, while wages for those with a high school diploma or less declined. Workers with a high school diploma or less education faced decreasing labor market opportunities and a decline in wage bargaining power. Median wages for these workers fell by 14.3%, while the wage premium for bachelor's or advanced degree holders compared to high school-educated workers grew from 49.8% to 101.8% from 1979 to 2017. Workers with less than a high school degree and those with a high school diploma experienced declining median wages from 1979 to 2017. In contrast, workers with at least a bachelor's degree saw rising wages during the same period. The most significant changes in wages occurred in the 1980s and 1990s, with slower changes since 2000 across all education groups. Median wages declined from 1979 to 2000, with the most significant decrease in the 1980s and 1990s. Workers with some college education had a less pronounced decline compared to those with a high school degree or less. While workers with a bachelor's degree saw an increase in wages, the majority of the gains occurred between 1979 and 2000. For workers with education above a bachelor's degree, median wages increased by 24.6% from 1979 to 2017, with slower growth in the 2000 to 2017 period. The wage premium for workers with higher education rose from 1979 to 2000 but has been flat since 2000 for workers with a bachelor's degree. Workers with advanced degrees saw a slower rise in the wage premium post-2000. This suggests a higher demand for skilled workers and less favorable labor market conditions for less-skilled workers. Market conditions for less-skilled workers have become less favorable, with a demand for workers in the \"middle-skill\" range. Workers can gain skills through nondegree programs, apprenticeships, and on-the-job training. Some occupations with entry positions requiring less than a bachelor's degree have above-average job growth and earnings. Wage growth at the top of the distribution has been strong from 1979 to 2017. The wage distribution from 1979 to 2017 showed strong growth at the top but slower growth or falling wages at the median and bottom. There were differences in wage growth across demographic groups, with women experiencing higher growth than men. Median wages rose for non-Hispanic workers but fell for Hispanic workers. Educational attainment and occupational distribution were compared to understand these differences. Overall, educational gains from 1979 to 2017 have a positive relationship with wages. Shifts in occupation also impact wage trends, with different occupations requiring varying skills and experience levels. This results in a range of median hourly wages, from $10.01 for food preparation workers to $48.46 for managers in May 2016. The data in the next three tables show the education levels and occupation groups of low, middle, and high-wage workers in 1979 and 2017. Workers in 1979 and 2017 were categorized into low, middle, and high-wage groups based on their percentiles. The analysis shows that workers in 2017 were more likely to have completed a bachelor's or advanced degree compared to workers in 1979, especially in the highest wage group. In 2017, workers saw gains in educational attainment, particularly in the highest wage group. Despite slightly rising or declining real wages, workers with higher education levels tended to earn more. Low-wage workers shifted towards service jobs, while high-wage workers moved into managerial and professional roles. Middle-wage workers experienced varied occupational shifts across demographic groups. Worker characteristics by earnings group in 1979 and 2017 are described in the tables and discussion. The data used in this report are cross-sectional and do not track individuals over time. Between 1979 and 2017, there were changes in educational attainment among workers, with low-wage workers increasing their education levels. Women, in particular, saw significant gains in educational attainment. The data used in this report are cross-sectional and do not track individuals over time. Between 1979 and 2017, low-wage women with a bachelor's degree or higher increased from 4% to 15%, similar to low-wage men. Despite educational gains, not all groups saw wage growth. Low-wage male and Hispanic workers also increased education levels, but their wages at the 10th percentile declined in real terms. Service occupations grew from 28% to 35% of low-wage workers, while production jobs declined. Service occupations have a wide wage range, with many paying less than production jobs. Workers who shifted to service occupations, such as male and Hispanic workers, experienced declining wages from 1979 to 2017. Middle-wage workers across all demographic groups saw significant educational gains during this period. Women also had strong median wage growth of 25.5% over the same period. Women's strong median wage growth of 25.5% from 1979 to 2017 may be linked to occupational shifts, particularly moving from clerical and production jobs to higher-paying executive and managerial roles. Hispanic workers experienced wage loss alongside gains in educational attainment and a shift from production to service jobs. Wages grew at the 90th percentile for all groups, attributed to education gains and increased employment in executive and professional occupations. High-wage workers at the 90th percentile saw strong wage growth from 1979 to 2017, attributed to increased demand for skilled workers and improved bargaining power. They also showed a significant increase in educational attainment, with a concentration in executive and professional occupations. The exception was Hispanic workers, who experienced notable compositional changes and were not predominantly college degree holders in 2017. The curr_chunk discusses factors affecting wage trends in executive, administrative, and managerial jobs, as well as professional and technical occupations. It outlines primary mechanisms contributing to wage growth or stagnation, including market and institutional factors. These factors interact to determine individual wages, such as workers' skills, job match quality, and bargaining power. The curr_chunk discusses the supply and demand for workers, factors affecting compensation rules, and how changes in education, training, and macroeconomic growth impact wage gains or losses for different groups. Workers bring varying levels of human capital to labor markets, where they match with employers seeking specific skills. Some jobs require specialized training, while others can be done by workers of any skill level. Skilled workers are in demand due to their productivity and scarcity, leading to higher wages. Various factors like technological change and labor supply affect wage trends. Technological advancements impact wage trends by increasing demand for high-skilled workers and reducing demand for tasks that can be automated or offshored. Global trading patterns also influence the demand for labor in the United States. The decline in U.S. manufacturing employment, attributed to increased import penetration, particularly from China, has led to factory closings and production shifts, displacing many U.S. workers and impacting surrounding communities and support services. The decline in U.S. manufacturing employment, attributed to increased import penetration, has led to factory closings and production shifts, impacting surrounding communities. Changes in labor supply, including immigration and other economic factors, can influence wages and the labor market. A large influx of new immigrants can increase the labor supply, potentially lowering wage offers in the short run. Job match quality, influenced by factors like workers' information about job openings and employers' ability to assess qualifications, also impacts wages. Job search costs can lead to suboptimal job matches for both workers and employers. Labor market institutions, including minimum wage laws and labor unions, play a crucial role in determining wage trends. Minimum wages can directly impact low-wage workers and also influence wage differentials across the distribution. Changes in institutions over time can affect how workers bargain for compensation and ultimately impact wage growth. Minimum wage earners may see declines in real wages if the minimum wage is not increased to keep pace with inflation. The federal minimum wage did not increase from 1981 to 1989, leading to a decrease in its real value. This decline in the 1980s contributed to the wage gap between low and middle earners. Factors like unionization, employment policies, and workplace organization can impact workers' bargaining power and wage growth. Union members tend to have higher wages compared to nonunion members, with a 10%-20% wage premium in the private sector. However, these gains apply to a shrinking pool of workers over time due to declining union membership. Empirical work suggests that declining unionization has contributed to stagnant wages and rising inequality, especially in the 1980s. This decline has particularly affected middle-wage workers and men in traditionally unionized \"blue collar\" jobs like manufacturing and construction. Employment policies that limit workers' bargaining power can also impact wages, as job mobility is restricted when franchise agreements prevent hiring from affiliated firms. The curr_chunk discusses provisions that restrict hiring from affiliated firms and the use of contractors, impacting worker bargaining power and wages. 58% of franchise contracts have restrictions on hiring from within the system, while the use of subcontractors has reduced wages for lower-paid workers. The curr_chunk discusses how workplace restructuring can disassociate workers from industry pay schedules, especially in competitive markets. Changes in pay-setting practices and the emergence of superstar earners have improved wage growth for some workers. Aggregate employment increases with economic growth due to innovations driving consumer demand for goods and services. In the long run, labor productivity and wages tend to move together as lower production costs lead to increased demand for labor. The gap between labor productivity and compensation has widened, resulting in a decline in labor's share of gross domestic income. The shift in forces has led to a decrease in labor's share of gross domestic income from 57.2% in 1979 to 53.2% in 2016. During economic recessions, there is a decline in private sector demand, leading to strain on the labor market with high unemployment rates and lower wage growth. Middle-skill workers tend to experience higher job loss during recessions, impacting differential wage growth. During economic recessions, private sector demand declines, leading to strain on the labor market with high unemployment rates and lower wage growth. Middle-skill workers tend to experience higher job loss, impacting wage growth. Research shows wages fall during recessions and rise during recoveries, with wage response varying. Data from the Current Population Survey is used to create annual wage distributions over the 1979-2017 period. The ORGs consist of respondents in their fourth and eighth month of the survey, providing data on usual earnings and hours worked for hourly wage studies. The sample includes individuals aged 25 to 64 employed in nonfarm, nonmilitary wage and salary jobs, excluding self-employed, Armed Forces members, agricultural workers, and those with imputed wages. Hourly wages are estimated by dividing reported weekly earnings by weekly hours worked. The curr_chunk discusses how wages are calculated for workers, including hourly workers and non-hourly workers. Wages are determined by dividing usual weekly earnings by usual weekly hours of work, or by using the reported hourly rate of pay for hourly workers. Wages are weighted by CPS weight and weekly hours, and earnings data are top-coded to protect respondent anonymity. Weekly earnings were top-coded at $999 per week in 1979. The top-coding of earnings at $999 per week changed twice over the 1979-2017 period, reaching $2,884.61 per week in 1998. This practice, while necessary for respondent anonymity, poses challenges for studying wage distribution. Researchers address top-coded values by modeling earnings as log-normal and replacing them with gender-specific estimates. Wage outliers are excluded based on set criteria. The report analyzed wage trends by demographic group and earner category, excluding wages below $0.50 and above $150 in 1989 dollars. Hourly wages were adjusted to 2017 dollars using the CPI-U. The CPI-U is commonly used to compare the real value of earnings over time and to adjust minimum wage rates. The report also examined worker characteristics within demographic groups. The workforce composition changed significantly between 1979 and 2017, with a more diverse and balanced sex composition. There was a decrease in white and non-Hispanic workers, an increase in older and better-educated workers, and a shift away from production jobs towards professional and technical occupations. These changes were not uniform across different wage distribution categories. Between 1979 and 2017, there were changes in the workforce composition, with black workers remaining overrepresented in the bottom two-thirds of the wage distribution. Female and Hispanic workers gained shares in the top third but remained underrepresented among top earners. There was a shift towards service-sector employment in the bottom and middle wage terciles, with a decline in production and clerical jobs. In the bottom and middle wage terciles, there was a decline in production and clerical jobs, while workers in the top third saw an increase in executive, administrative, and managerial occupations as well as professional, technical, and related jobs."
