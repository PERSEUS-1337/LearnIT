    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature passed Senate Bill 1021 in 2012 to create the Supportive Housing Program for Mentally Ill Parolees, but funds have not been used for their intended purposes. The Legislature aims to strengthen the ISMIP program to promote evidence-based practices. The Legislature aims to strengthen the ISMIP program by providing evidence-based wraparound services, including rental subsidies, to mentally ill parolees experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness upon release from prison. Contracts under the program must target resources to parolees experiencing homelessness or at risk of homelessness, emphasizing housing stability over other services. The Legislature intends for the Department of Corrections to incorporate changes into contracts for the ISMIP program starting January 1, 2017. Section 2985 of the Penal Code is amended. Section 2985 of the Penal Code is amended to provide evidence-based mental health and supportive services, including housing subsidies, to parolees with mental illness who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. The goal is to reintegrate them into the community, enhance public safety, and reduce recidivism costs. Additionally, services will be extended to individuals with severe mental illness who require specialized care beyond what parole outpatient clinics offer. Section 2985.1 of the Penal Code is amended to define \"bridge rental assistance\" as temporary rental aid for program participants to maintain housing post-parole. The Department refers to the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. The curr_chunk defines key terms related to housing assistance programs for parolees, including the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, fair market rent, homelessness, and the Integrated Services for Mentally Ill Parolees program. The curr_chunk defines \"interim housing\" as temporary residence for program participants for up to nine months, including motel vouchers or housing for recuperative care. It also explains \"likely to become homeless upon release\" as individuals without a fixed nighttime residence, only having access to shelters or unconventional sleeping accommodations. The curr_chunk discusses the provision of supportive housing for mentally ill parolees at risk of homelessness, with services aimed at reducing recidivism and homelessness. Service providers must offer evidence-based practices, show effectiveness in reducing recidivism and homelessness, have experience with mental health programs, and have relationships with supportive housing providers. Inmates or parolees with serious mental disorders and a history of mental health treatment are eligible for the program if they voluntarily choose to participate and are at risk of homelessness upon release. Priority is given to the lowest functioning offenders likely to become homeless. A service provider must exercise due diligence in providing mental health or other contracted services to individuals participating in Section 2985.3 services. Parolees are not required to receive other ISMIP services to be eligible for rental assistance. Section 2985.3 of the Penal Code is amended. Section 2985.3 of the Penal Code is amended to require service providers to offer health and housing stability services to program participants on parole, including case management, discharge planning, housing location services, rental subsidies, and linkage to other needed services. Upon receipt of referral, service providers offer various services to program participants, including linkage to vocational, educational, and employment services, benefit entitlement application assistance, transportation assistance, and help with obtaining identification. Additionally, for participants identified before release from state prison, providers collaborate with parole agents to receive prerelease assessments and discharge plans. Draft a transition plan for program participants into housing, including permanent supportive housing options. Engage participants in services, assist with obtaining identification and applying for eligible benefits. To facilitate the transition of program participants into supportive housing, a service provider must assess their needs quarterly and create a plan for independence and continued residence post-parole. Assistance should be provided in applying for eligible benefits. The service provider must transition program participants from the department's rental assistance to other mainstream rental assistance benefits to help them remain in stable housing. This may include federal Housing Choice Voucher assistance or other rental assistance programs. The parole discharge plan for program participants prioritizes linkage to county mental health services and housing opportunities supported by various funding sources for permanent supportive housing. Bridge rental assistance is provided until the end of parole, allowing participants to remain in the same housing if lease terms are met. Section 2985.4 of the Penal Code is amended to require service providers to find supportive housing for program participants before or shortly after their release from prison, but no later than nine months after agreeing to participate in the program. The housing must meet specific criteria and not be subject to licensing requirements. Service providers must find supportive housing for program participants before or shortly after their release from prison, but no later than nine months after agreeing to participate. Participants in supportive housing have a lease and must adhere to tenancy rights and responsibilities. Providers use ISMIP payments to offer interim housing while waiting for permanent rental housing and to assist with necessary documentation. In counties with homeless coordinated systems, parolees qualifying for the program can receive ISMIP payments and housing assistance. Service providers can use ISMIP program payments to support a housing specialist position to assist in securing affordable rental housing for program participants. The amended Penal Code requires service providers to report on program outcomes, including the number of participants served, services provided, and participant outcomes such as independent living, permanent housing, program cessation, return to prison, and arrest. The department will analyze the costs of the supportive housing program compared to state cost savings from reduced recidivism rates. This analysis will exclude federal funds for services during parole to accurately reflect state costs for program participants. The department will annually submit information and analysis to legislative committees regarding the supportive housing program's costs and state cost savings from reduced recidivism rates."
