    "content": "The \"Energy Independence Act of 2001\" requires the Secretary of Energy to develop a strategic plan for energy self-sufficiency by 2011, including legislative and regulatory recommendations. $20,000,000 is authorized for this purpose. Additionally, a Federal Government Fuel Cell Pilot Program is established. The Secretary of Energy will establish a program to acquire up to 100 200 kilowatt fuel cell power plants or up to 20 megawatts of power from such plants for use at federally owned facilities. Funding will be provided for purchase, installation, and maintenance costs. All fuel cell systems must be assembled in the United States, and site selection for power plant locations will be based on federally owned or operated facilities. Priority will be given to sites with specific attributes for the location of power plants acquired under this program, including being in nonattainment areas, sensitive computer operations, need for reliable power supply, remote locations, and supporting national security efforts. $140,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2002 through 2004 for this purpose. $140,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2002 through 2004 for carrying out this section. SEC. 4. PROTON EXCHANGE MEMBRANE DEMONSTRATION PROGRAMS. The President, in coordination with several Secretaries, shall establish a program to demonstrate fuel cell proton exchange membrane technology for commercial, residential, and transportation applications, including buses. $140,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2002 through 2004 for this purpose. The President, in coordination with the Secretaries of Energy and Transportation, will establish a proton exchange membrane fuel cell bus demonstration program from 2002 to 2004. This program will focus on hydrogen production, storage, and use in transit bus applications, including developing on-site hydrogen delivery and storage systems. The proton exchange membrane fuel cell bus demonstration program from 2002 to 2004 focuses on using hydrogen as a safe, renewable energy source for buses. It includes developing a fuel cell power system compatible with transit bus requirements, durability testing at a national facility, and implementing necessary codes and standards for safe hydrogen use in bus applications. The proton exchange membrane fuel cell bus demonstration program focused on implementing maintenance and overhaul requirements for hydrogen fuel cell transit buses. Fleet vehicle evaluation programs were completed by bus operators to enable operation of the fuel cell bus under various environments. All fuel cell systems and stacks in power plants acquired must be assembled in the United States. Authorization of appropriations is provided for carrying out these activities. In carrying out this subsection, $150,000,000 is authorized for fiscal years 2002 through 2004. Federal agencies maintaining vehicle fleets must develop plans to transition to fuel cell technology by fiscal year 2011, incorporating results from demonstration programs. Life-cycle cost benefit analyses by agencies must include environmental and power reliability factors. State and local governments may receive incentives. The Secretary of Energy will establish a grant program for State and local governments to use fuel cell technology for energy needs, including powering vehicles. Grants will require a 10% matching contribution. $110,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2002 to 2006 for this program."
