    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Autism Employment and Education Act, known as Chapter 15.8, is added to the Education Code to address the lifelong neurological condition of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affecting many children. The legislation recognizes the need for support for individuals with severe autism, highlighting the high costs associated with long-term care and housing arrangements. The Autism Employment and Education Act, Chapter 15.8, addresses the high costs of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) care. The lifetime per capita cost of ASD is $3,200,000 per individual or $50,793 per year. Taft Community College offers a unique residential program in California but struggles to meet student needs. The program, funded by regional centers, sees over 80% of graduates employed within two years. According to Disability Planning Data for Riverside County, 10.5% of people aged 21 to 64 have a disability, with 37% of them employed. According to a report by the Autism Society of California, the majority of transition-aged families believe that current adult programs do not meet their loved one's needs. Only a small percentage of individuals with ASD graduate from college, and the unemployment rate for individuals with disabilities is 78.5 percent according to the Department of Labor Statistics. The federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act services end after high school, but 60% of costs occur in adulthood. There is a disparity in long-term services for people with disabilities, leading to waiting lists. The Legislature aims to implement a program to increase employment rates for students with mental disabilities, including autism, from 25% to 85%. The program aims to provide affordable services for students with mental disabilities, allowing them to live independently and develop necessary life skills. It will offer a coordinated continuity of care, incorporating living skills, occupational, social, and recreational development needs into one program. The Autism Employment and Education Program is established to help students with mental disabilities, including autism, live independently and obtain employment after graduation. The Autism Employment and Education Fund is created to support the program financially. The Board of Governors of the California Community Colleges and the Trustees of the California State University will oversee the program's development and implementation. A program is established at colleges to assist students with mental disabilities, including autism, in living independently and finding employment. Administrative guidelines are provided for the program's development and implementation. This chapter will only be in effect upon appropriation in the annual Budget Act."
