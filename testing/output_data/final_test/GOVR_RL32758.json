    "content": "U.S. military operations in the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) began in 2001 and continue today, involving diplomatic, intelligence, law enforcement, and financial efforts. This report focuses on military operations in Afghanistan, Africa, the Philippines, and Colombia, with Congress showing interest in these regions. NATO's role in Afghanistan and counternarcotics operations are also highlighted. The current situation in Afghanistan involves approximately 19,000 U.S. military personnel, including troops from the Army's 173rd Airborne Brigade, the 82nd Airborne Division, Marine elements from the Second MEF, and Special Forces focused on capturing Taliban and Al Qaeda leaders. Additionally, Army units from the Florida National Guard's 53rd Infantry Brigade are deployed for training Afghan forces. Units from the Florida National Guard's 53rd Infantry Brigade have been deployed to train the Afghan National Army (ANA). The drawdown of U.S. forces in Afghanistan includes the deployment of one battalion-sized infantry task force from the 4th Brigade stationed at Ft. Polk to assist in the transition of coalition operations to NATO in southern Afghanistan. This reduction is attributed to NATO's increasing presence in Afghanistan and the progress of the ANA and Afghan National Police. The 4th Brigade is expected to reduce U.S. troop levels by 2,500 troops, bringing them to approximately 16,500. Security was provided for Afghanistan's September 18, 2005 elections, with reports indicating relative effectiveness despite some security-related issues. President Karzai suggested a stronger political approach focusing on shutting down guerilla training camps and outside financial support. President Karzai suggested a stronger political approach focusing on shutting down guerilla training camps and outside financial support. Insurgents have recently reasserted themselves, killing hundreds in bombings and ambushes in southern and eastern Afghanistan. U.S. troops are expected to stay on the offensive against insurgents. In recent months, insurgent tactics in Afghanistan have increasingly included suicide and roadside bombings, similar to those used in Iraq. These attacks have targeted U.S. and NATO convoys, resulting in casualties among both military personnel and Afghan civilians. The insurgents have shown a willingness to use suicide attackers, with one incident resulting in the deaths of 9 Afghan soldiers. A top Taliban commander claimed to have over 200 insurgents ready to carry out suicide attacks against U.S. forces. The Afghan government dismissed the claim of over 200 insurgents willing to become suicide attackers as propaganda, suggesting the insurgents' weakening military power. U.S. military officials acknowledge the insurgents are recruiting younger fighters and staging smaller-scale attacks, using a hit-and-run approach. Taliban insurgents have divided into groups with Al Qaeda members teaching tactics developed in Iraq. According to a source, \"rogue\" elements from Pakistan's Intelligence Service assist insurgent groups in Afghanistan by providing sanctuary and training in Pakistan. Insurgents are described as extremely resolute, well-organized, and react well to battlefield situations. The U.S. Army claims to have killed over 1,200 insurgents in 2005, including senior commanders. U.S. forces use small formations to draw out insurgent forces, who then overwhelm them with larger formations. Combat Operations Against Insurgents: U.S. and coalition forces continue combat operations in border provinces where the Taliban exert control. Raids on Taliban camps in Afghanistan result in the killing of suspected insurgents. Pakistani forces deploy reinforcements to prevent insurgent attacks before Afghanistan's parliamentary elections. Pakistan deployed additional troops to the Northwest Frontier Province and Baluchistan to combat insurgent attacks. Operations in North Waziristan resulted in the destruction of an Al Qaeda hideout and the arrest of suspected militants. Despite the presence of Pakistani forces, the Taliban and Al Qaeda are regrouping in the Waziristan region, with reports of foreign fighters linked to Al Qaeda operating in the area. Arab, Uzbek, and Chechen fighters linked to Al Qaeda are recruiting local tribesmen for jihad against Pakistani Army and U.S. forces in Afghanistan, leading to clashes between tribes aligned with the Army and insurgents. U.S. and Afghan forces conducted offensive operations, killing suspected Taliban fighters in Uruzgan province. A U.S. Army helicopter was shot down in Zabul province, resulting in the death of all crew members. A U.S. soldier was killed by a landmine in Helmand province, marking the 200th U.S. service member death since 2001. In mid-October, allegations emerged that U.S. soldiers burned the bodies of two dead Taliban fighters for hygiene reasons and used them for propaganda against insurgents. This act, condemned by Afghan President Karzai, violated Muslim beliefs and raised fears. The burning of two dead Taliban fighters by U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan was strongly condemned by Afghan President Karzai and raised fears of further damage to the United States' image among Muslims. U.S. CENTCOM quickly condemned the actions, stating that they violated U.S. policy and the Geneva Convention. U.S. Army Major General Jason Kamiya halted psychological operations and ordered an investigation, but it is unknown if the soldiers involved were punished. The soldiers involved in the incident were punished, and extensive training was ordered to address the cultural gap in Afghanistan. U.S. forces conducted a successful offensive operation in Kunar province, named Operation Pil, to disrupt enemy activities. No U.S. troops were killed during the operation, but on October 29, a U.S. and British soldier were killed in separate incidents. In October and December, incidents in Afghanistan involved U.S. and British soldiers, including assaults on Afghan prisoners, helicopter emergency landings due to enemy fire, and successful operations against Taliban insurgents. Multiple U.S. soldiers were killed in various incidents, making 2005 the deadliest year. In 2005, the deadliest year for the U.S. military in Afghanistan, 91 service members were killed by fighting and accidents. On January 13, 2006, an armed CIA Predator unmanned aircraft launched an airstrike in Pakistan, possibly killing four top Al Qaeda leaders and sparking protests. Al Qaeda's second-in-command, Ayman al-Zawahri, escaped the raid. U.S. and coalition forces on the Afghan border may have dealt a significant blow to Al Qaeda by targeting experienced leaders. There are indications that the United States is considering establishing permanent military bases in Afghanistan, with upgrades to facilities at Bagram and Kandahar airbases. Afghan leaders are seeking a long-term strategic partnership with the U.S. and other friendly countries. The United States is considering establishing permanent military bases in Afghanistan to avoid a strategic disengagement like in the 1990s that led to the rise of the Taliban. ISAF, a NATO-led organization, consists of troops from various nations, including the U.S. with approximately 200 troops assigned primarily in staff and support roles. ISAF, under U.N. mandates, conducts security patrols in Kabul and surrounding areas, runs Provincial Reconstruction Teams, and coordinates Civil Military Cooperation projects. ISAF does not engage in offensive operations against the Taliban and Al Qaeda, which are carried out by the U.S.-led CJTF-180 and forces from other countries. The Italian Rapid Deployment Corps currently commands ISAF, soon to be replaced by the British-led ARRC. NATO agreed to expand ISAF coverage into southern regions in February 2005. NATO expanded ISAF coverage into southern Afghanistan in February 2005. Germany and France committed to increasing their troop presence in ISAF, but there are concerns among certain allies about ISAF working closely with the U.S. in counterterrorism efforts. On November 14, Taliban insurgents killed a German ISAF member and wounded two others in a suicide car attack in Kabul, raising security concerns among NATO nations. The Netherlands, set to lead NATO's expansion in 2006, questions the sufficiency of planned NATO forces. They plan to deploy 1,000 to 1,400 troops to southern Afghanistan, with Britain, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia also expected to send additional forces. On January 10, 2006, Australia announced sending 110 special forces soldiers and two helicopters to support troops in Afghanistan. The United States may add 6,000 troops to ISAF, merging with NATO in mid to late 2006. NATO's expansion into southern Afghanistan and the Pakistani border region raised concerns among member countries. NATO countries had concerns about merging missions under a single commander in Afghanistan, fearing it would lead to mission failure and Afghan resentment. A plan was agreed upon for a single chain of command with a deputy commander for counterinsurgency operations. British, Dutch, and Canadian troops would lead in the south, Germany in the north, and Italy and Spain in the west. The Netherlands had concerns about deploying more troops to southern Afghanistan. The Dutch government is considering sending additional troops to Urzuzgan province in Afghanistan, but concerns about operating in a dangerous area have led to a divided Parliament. Other NATO members may struggle to fill the gap if Dutch forces are not deployed, potentially requiring the United States to step in. The United States may need to increase forces in Afghanistan to make up for a shortfall, potentially affecting plans to decrease troop levels. NATO is pressuring the Dutch government to honor troop commitments, with concerns that a substantial U.S. military presence will be necessary for the long-term NATO mission. NATO faces challenges in mustering troops for operations in Afghanistan, with only a few member nations willing to commit forces for counterterror and counterinsurgency operations. The effectiveness of NATO's new role is questioned due to reluctance from many members to engage in potentially hostile situations. PRTs, small civil-military teams, were originally created to extend the Afghan government's authority beyond Kabul and facilitate aid and reconstruction projects. PRTs, supervised by the Coalition and NATO, extend security to outlying regions in Afghanistan. As of July 2005, there were 22 PRTs, with the Coalition focusing on high-threat areas in the south and east, and NATO in low to moderate threat areas in the north and west. PRTs have been successful in accomplishing their missions and supporting training and counter narcotics efforts. Some NATO PRTs have been criticized for being \"risk averse\" and controlled by their nation's leadership. Concerns arise about their effectiveness compared to US and UK-run PRTs. A senior US defense official points out issues such as inconsistent mission statements, unclear roles, ad hoc preparation, and limited resources hindering PRTs' impact in Afghanistan. Suggestions for improvement include creating more PRTs or extending their operations. The official suggests improving PRTs by creating more or extending current ones, equipping them with better communication and transportation assets, increasing funding for projects, enhancing civil-military coordination, measuring effectiveness, focusing on capacity-building programs, and linking local governance to the central government. Training is also emphasized. Training of the Afghan National Army (ANA) began after the defeat of Taliban forces in 2002. Despite initial challenges with morale and desertion, the multi-ethnic ANA has evolved into a credible fighting force. Eight experienced ANA battalions now work alongside U.S. and NATO forces in the provinces. While ANA soldiers are praised for their fearlessness and quick learning, obstacles remain, including low literacy rates among recruits and lack of modern equipment. The growth of the Afghan National Army (ANA) has been hindered by low literacy rates among recruits, lack of barracks and modern equipment, and inadequate logistics. The U.S. military has increased the number of tactical trainers embedded with ANA units to 600 soldiers. The ANA consisted of almost 27,000 officers and soldiers supported by 55,000 members of the Afghan National Police as of December 2005. Other countries like France, Britain, and Romania also assist in training ANA soldiers and officers. The Afghan National Army (ANA) receives training from various countries like France, Britain, Romania, and Russia. The U.S. has increased training efforts to reach a mandated strength of 70,000 by the end of 2006. The ANA has infantry units, combat support battalions, a tank battalion with Soviet-era tanks, and plans for a mechanized infantry battalion. The Afghan government aims to equip its military with high-tech weaponry and specialized units, including U.S. Apache helicopters, A-10 ground attack aircraft, transport aircraft, and armored vehicles. Discussions are ongoing with the United States to provide transport aircraft and helicopters. Afghanistan also seeks assistance in creating and training commando, engineer, and intelligence units for the Afghan National Army (ANA). Afghanistan's opium industry employs a significant portion of the population and contributes significantly to the country's GDP. The Taliban's regulation and taxation of poppy cultivation led to a flourishing opium industry in Afghanistan, making it the world's top source of opium and heroin. Despite a 21% decrease in production in 2005, Afghanistan still supplies 87% of the world's opium. The Taliban is reportedly increasing poppy production to fund their operations and weaken the Afghan government. NATO's Supreme Commander, U.S. Marine General James L. Jones, has stated that drugs pose a greater threat to Afghan security than the resurgent Taliban. The U.S. military has increased its counternarcotics role in Afghanistan, supporting efforts by Afghan and U.S. agencies like the DEA. The U.S. Army has provided training to DEA agents deploying to Afghanistan. Britain leads the Coalition's military counternarcotics efforts in Afghanistan and plans to step up military efforts next year. British troops will deploy to southern provinces and Helmand province, an insurgent stronghold. The UK is focusing on counternarcotics efforts in Afghanistan, particularly in Helmand province, a key area for the country's opium trade. Britain is establishing a joint intelligence fusion center with the US to target drug-related intelligence. Colombia is also assisting by providing counternarcotics expertise to Afghan police and military forces. Raids by Afghan police and Coalition forces have had mixed success in seizing narcotics, with some traffickers escaping to Pakistan. The US military has a supporting role in counternarcotics operations in Afghanistan. The US military has a supporting role in counternarcotics operations in Afghanistan, with some suggesting a more aggressive approach to tackling the opium problem to limit insurgent activities. NATO and the Afghan government have faced challenges in addressing Afghanistan's drug trafficking, with concerns over insufficient funds and lack of effective alternatives for poppy farmers. The United States is concerned about Africa becoming a breeding ground for terrorists due to ungoverned spaces and unprotected borders. Somalia is seen as a haven for terrorists, with reports of Al Qaeda recruiting bases in Nigeria, Somalia, Tanzania, and Uganda. There are conflicting views on the presence of Al Qaeda in the region, with some suggesting that US support to local military forces could fuel radicalism. The U.S. European Command has reported that foreign fighters captured in Iraq have come from Africa, with some returning to countries like Morocco and Algeria where their skills could be used against their governments. Terrorism and access to Africa's oil are cited as primary reasons for U.S. military operations in the region. The U.S. established Combined Joint Task Force Horn of Africa in 2002 to combat terrorism in the region. The Combined Joint Task Force Horn of Africa (CJTF-HOA) was established in 2002 to combat terrorism in the Horn of Africa region. CJTF-HOA is headquartered at Camp Lemonier in Djibouti and consists of approximately 1,400 personnel including U.S. military, Special Operations Forces (SOF), U.S. civilian, and coalition force members. Additionally, Combined Task Force (CTF) 150 is a naval task force tasked with monitoring, inspecting, boarding, and stopping suspect shipping in the region. The Combined Joint Task Force Horn of Africa (CJTF-HOA) was established in 2002 to combat terrorism in the Horn of Africa region. CJTF-HOA is headquartered at Camp Lemonier in Djibouti and consists of approximately 1,400 personnel including U.S. military, Special Operations Forces (SOF), U.S. civilian, and coalition force members. The mission has evolved into gathering intelligence, military training for some of the region's military forces, and building infrastructure to create an environment hostile to terrorist organizations. DOD is considering putting Africa under a single, unified command to streamline operations. The CJTF-HOA in Djibouti is under-resourced and may form the basis for a new U.S. Africa Command. However, additional personnel and resources are needed for this expansion. The U.S. Navy will take over command of CJTF-HOA in 2006 from the U.S. Marines Corps to free up Marine forces. There are plans to expand activities into Uganda, Tanzania, and possibly Eritrea, and to bring in troops from foreign nations. DOD is looking for alternative headquarters locations due to increased rent in Djibouti. Ethiopia, Kenya, and Uganda are potential candidates for new headquarters. The U.S. Navy could potentially house CJTF-HOA on a command ship at sea, like the USS Mount Whitney. The Philippines faces insurgency threats from Islamic and Communist groups, with the Abu Sayyaf Group being a focus of counterterror efforts. Abu Sayyaf has reported links to Al Qaeda and targets the Philippine government. The Abu Sayyaf Group, previously targeting the Philippine government, was implicated in planning the assassination of the Pope and hijacking U.S. airliners. The Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) is in negotiations with the Philippine government but allegedly provides training to the Al Qaeda affiliate Jemaah Islamiyah. U.S. military operations in the Philippines are constrained by the Philippine constitution. The United States conducts training exercises in the Philippines, focusing on counterinsurgency and counterterrorism tactics. They also participate in civil-military operations to limit insurgent influence, particularly in the southern region. Large joint training exercises, including Balikatan exercises, have been ongoing since 1981. In 2005, the U.S. Navy's Forward Deployed Amphibious Readiness Group and the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit arrived for Amphibious Landing Exercise (PHIBLEX) 06. Additionally, community service projects are planned with Filipino military personnel. During the exercise, U.S. Army special forces soldiers and Filipino soldiers conducted training in small unit tactics, marksmanship, and combat lifesaver training in an area frequented by Abu Sayyaf and Jemaah Islamiyah. The U.S. special forces also planned to conduct medical missions in local communities to win over the local Muslim populations. The United States has a history of conducting training exercises with Filipino counterterrorism and counterinsurgency forces. The United States has begun counter-drug training with the Philippines, focusing on planning, tactics, and specialized counterterrorism equipment. The Balikatan exercise for 2006 involves over 5,000 U.S. military personnel conducting various operations, including humanitarian efforts on Jolo island. U.S. involvement in the Philippines is seen as part of a broader strategy to combat Islamic terrorism in Southeast Asia. Officials believe that Abu Sayyaf and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front have connections with Jemaah Islamiyah, an Al Qaeda affiliate responsible for bombings in Indonesia and the Philippines. Abu Sayyaf has a training relationship with Jemaah Islamiyah, potentially increasing its capabilities. Some experts warn that increased U.S. involvement could complicate the insurgency dilemma in the Philippines and fuel anti-American sentiment in the region. It is noted that not all militant Muslim groups in Southeast Asia are aligned with Al Qaeda. Muslim groups in Southeast Asia are aligned with Al Qaeda, and U.S. counterterrorism efforts in the region should not encourage them to join the Al Qaeda cause. In Colombia, the targeted terrorist groups are Marxist, not Islamic-based, with no reported links to Al Qaeda. U.S. military involvement under \"Plan Colombia\" began in 2000, initially focused on training counternarcotics units but now includes training the Colombian military in counterinsurgency operations against groups like FARC and ELN. Colombia has been engaged in a long-standing civil war or counterinsurgency campaign against these groups. The Liberation Army (ELN) and United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) are violent criminal organizations funded by drug revenues. They hold Colombian and foreign hostages for negotiating leverage. The Colombian government offered to withdraw forces in exchange for talks with the FARC to release hostages in 2005. The majority of U.S. military personnel in Colombia are from the U.S. Army's 7th Special Forces Group stationed at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. About 200 special forces soldiers are currently serving as trainers, limited to training in garrison and planning support at headquarters. Another 200 troops provide \"information support\" with intelligence, leadership, and planning. U.S. forces do not accompany Colombian units in combat operations, but their training has led to the killing or capturing of over 600 insurgents and the confiscation of arms and ammunition. On December 13, 2005, a U.S. Navy helicopter crashed after taking off from the USS DeWert during counterdrug operations. On December 12, 1,923 members of the AUC demobilized, surrendering weapons and equipment. The demobilized fighters will receive support for reintegration into Colombian society. Approximately 8,000 AUC paramilitaries are yet to be demobilized. On December 16, the ELN and Colombian government announced peace talks in Havana, Cuba. The FARC, facing pressure from the Colombian government's operations, launched a country-wide campaign using smaller groups to avoid casualties. They increased the use of explosives, landmines, and snipers. The FARC has escalated the use of improvised explosive devices, landmines, and snipers, resulting in numerous casualties among Colombian military personnel. Attacks on soldiers and police officers have been reported, with concerns that these assaults will continue leading up to Colombia's presidential primary and national election. NATO's assumption of command of ISAF and Operation Enduring Freedom in 2006 raises questions about the formal transition plan, U.S. military role, NATO's authority in security operations, long-term force commitments, counternarcotics plan, and effectiveness in Afghanistan. NATO's comprehensive counternarcotics plan and long-term security strategy in Afghanistan are under scrutiny by Congress. Despite progress in governance and ANA performance, concerns remain about the impact of Afghanistan's drug trade on government stability and Taliban funding. The current U.S. military role in counternarcotics operations is limited to training and support. The current U.S. military role in Afghan counternarcotics operations is limited to training and support, with critics calling for a more active role. Some believe that the U.S. is not fully fulfilling its responsibilities in counternarcotics efforts despite the significant security threat posed by the Afghan drug trade. Congress may explore how Africa fits into the Administration's long-term strategy for the war on terror. The Administration's long-term strategy for the war on terror in Africa is unclear, with little known about the commitments and resources needed. Congress may consider establishing a separate regional command for Africa, but political and resource issues need to be examined. Security for a headquarters in Africa could be a significant concern due to the volatile nature of the region. Reports suggest a potential increase in terrorist activities in Southeast Asia, with concerns about attacks on U.S. interests. The adequacy of U.S. military forces in the region and their mandate for training and advising regional military forces may be reviewed by Congress. The U.S.-trained Colombian military's progress against the FARC is being examined by Congress. Reports show demobilization efforts by other insurgent groups, but the FARC continues its campaign against the Colombian government. Critics suggest reducing drug profits to weaken the FARC's operations."
