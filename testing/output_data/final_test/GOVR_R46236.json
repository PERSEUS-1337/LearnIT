    "content": "Brazil, as the fifth-largest country and ninth-largest economy globally, plays a significant role in global governance. Over the past two decades, Brazil has collaborated with other large developing nations to advocate for changes in multilateral institutions and ensure that global agreements protect their interests. Despite recent domestic challenges, Brazil continues to influence international policy issues, including peacekeeping missions and conflict mediation. The country's multicultural democracy status makes it a natural partner for the United States in regional and global affairs. The Trump Administration sees an opportunity to deepen the bilateral relationship with Brazil under President Bolsonaro, who is aligning the country's foreign policy with the United States. However, differences over trade and relations with China may hinder cooperation. The 116th Congress has shown renewed interest in Brazil as a strategic partner for addressing global challenges. Members view Brazil as a strategic partner for addressing regional and global challenges, urging stronger economic, security, and military ties with Brazil to counter the influence of extra-hemispheric powers like China and Russia. Some Members have reservations about a close partnership with the Bolsonaro Administration due to concerns about democracy, human rights, and environmental policies. Congress will continue to assess these differing approaches to U.S.-Brazilian relations. Brazil declared independence from Portugal in 1822, establishing a constitutional monarchy with a slave-based economy. Brazil transitioned from a constitutional monarchy with a slave-based economy to a republic in 1889. Despite abolishing slavery, power remained with rural landowners, excluding most Brazilians from politics. Get\u00falio Vargas' authoritarian regime incorporated the working class but centralized power. The military coup in 1964 led to two decades of military rule, supported by the United States. The 1964 military coup in Brazil, supported by the United States, led to two decades of authoritarian rule. The military government, while repressive, allowed some institutions to function but stifled democracy and civic action. Security forces killed thousands of indigenous people and political dissidents, detaining and torturing many others. Brazil restored civilian rule in 1985, leading to the establishment of a liberal democracy with a strong president and bicameral congress. Brazil has a bicameral congress with a chamber of deputies and a senate, along with an independent judiciary. The country's federal structure includes 26 states, a federal district, and over 5,500 municipalities. Economic recession and political uncertainty marked the first decade after the political transition, with failed attempts to control inflation and two presidents not completing their terms. President Fernando Henrique Cardoso stabilized the situation with the anti-inflation Real Plan. During his tenure as finance minister under President Itamar Franco, Cardoso implemented market-oriented economic reforms in Brazil, including privatization of state-owned enterprises, opening the economy to foreign trade and investment, and adopting key macroeconomic policies. These reforms, coupled with a surge in international demand for Brazilian commodities, led to strong economic growth in the early 21st century. Between 2003 and 2010, the PT-led government in Brazil used increased export revenues to improve social inclusion and reduce inequality. Social welfare programs were expanded, and the minimum wage was raised by 64% above inflation. The economy grew by an average of 4.1% per year, leading to a decrease in the poverty rate from 28.2% to 13.6%. However, socioeconomic conditions deteriorated during President Dilma Rousseff's final two years in office (2011-2016) after a period of relative stability. Brazil has faced crises since 2014, including a deep recession due to global commodity price declines and economic mismanagement under the Rousseff Administration. Brazil's economy contracted by 8.2% from 2015 to 2016 due to commodity prices and economic mismanagement under the Rousseff Administration. Despite emerging from recession in 2017, slow recovery led to a modest 1% growth in 2017 and 2018. Unemployment remained above 10%, causing a 17% decline in real incomes for the bottom half of workers, pushing 6 million people into poverty. Afro-Brazilians were disproportionately affected, with 64% of the unemployed. Fiscal deficits limited resources for social services, hindering government efforts to address the situation. The deep recession in Brazil has hindered government efforts to address challenges like crime and violence. In 2017, a record-high 64,000 Brazilians were killed, with a homicide rate of 30.9 per 100,000 residents. Homicides decreased by 11% in 2018, but feminicide and sexual violence reports increased. Afro-Brazilians are disproportionately affected, accounting for over 75% of homicide victims and feminicide victims. Corruption scandals, like the Car Wash investigation, have discredited the political establishment. The Car Wash investigation in Brazil uncovered widespread corruption involving political appointees at Petrobras colluding with construction firms to manipulate contract bidding processes. This led to kickbacks to officials and politicians, contributing to President Rousseff's impeachment in 2016. Despite scandals, Michael Temer managed to stay in power, while other high-level politicians, including former President Lula, have been convicted. The Car Wash investigation in Brazil exposed widespread corruption involving Petrobras and construction firms, leading to kickbacks and President Rousseff's impeachment in 2016. Former President Lula and other high-level politicians have been convicted. Brazilian voters showed dissatisfaction in the 2018 elections by ousting many incumbents. Trust in democratic institutions in Brazil is low, with only a small percentage expressing satisfaction with the way democracy is working in the country. In the 2018 Brazilian elections, Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right congressman and retired army captain, was elected president with 43% of incumbents running for reelection to the chamber of deputies. Despite being initially considered a fringe figure in congress, Bolsonaro's social media-driven campaign and populist message attracted strong support by exploiting anti-PT and antiestablishment sentiment. He aligned himself with trusted institutions like the military and churches, outflanking his opponents. Jair Bolsonaro won the 2018 Brazilian election with strong support from the military and churches. Despite facing challenges in advancing his agenda due to cabinet infighting and a fragmented congress, Bolsonaro has refused traditional governing coalitions and prefers to keep his political base mobilized. Bolsonaro maintains his political base by taking conservative stands on cultural issues and attacking perceived enemies. His confrontational approach has alienated potential allies in congress. In November 2019, he left the PSL and plans to create a new party. The Bolsonaro Administration has started implementing a market-oriented economic agenda, including privatization programs yielding significant revenues. The Brazilian government implemented policies to increase revenues and reduce expenditures, including a major pension reform. The economy is expected to grow due to market-oriented policy changes, but unemployment remains high at 11%. Political parties may resist further austerity measures before the 2020 municipal elections. The Brazilian government implemented market-oriented policy changes to boost the economy, but 11% of Brazilians are still unemployed. Some economists suggest reallocating funds to support vulnerable groups and invest in education, training, and infrastructure. President Bolsonaro faced challenges in implementing his security agenda, with Congress blocking some proposals. Security conditions improved in 2019, but police killings increased in certain states like Rio de Janeiro. The Bolsonaro Administration in Brazil has faced setbacks in anti-corruption efforts, with President Bolsonaro interfering in law enforcement agencies. This interference has raised concerns about the political independence of Brazilian institutions. In August 2019, he dismissed the head of the federal police office in Rio de Janeiro, which is investigating potential corruption involving his son. President Bolsonaro has been criticized for disregarding norms in selecting an attorney general and making changes to Brazil's tax collection agency, financial intelligence unit, and antitrust regulator. The Brazilian congress has been hesitant to adopt anti-corruption reforms, and the supreme court's rulings could hinder corruption investigations. Analysts argue that democracy in Brazil has eroded under Bolsonaro, who has shown support for military dictatorships. His administration has hinted at imposing authoritarian measures. Bolsonaro's administration has hinted at imposing authoritarian measures and has taken steps to weaken the press and control civil society. The military's involvement in politics has increased, with retired and active-duty officers leading many government positions. Despite checks from civil society, congress, and the judiciary, human rights advocates argue that Bolsonaro's actions have fueled attacks against journalists and activists. Polls show divided public opinion on Bolsonaro's government in Brazil. Concerns over increased fires in the Amazon in 2019 raised worries about its impact on climate change. The Amazon Basin, home to a biodiverse tropical forest, plays a crucial role in the global carbon cycle by absorbing carbon dioxide. The Amazon forest absorbs 560 million tons of carbon dioxide annually, holding 76 billion tons of carbon. It influences regional rainfall patterns in South America. Deforestation has reached 17% in the Amazon basin, risking a transition to a drier ecosystem. Conservation efforts mainly focus on Brazil, particularly the Legal Amazon zone comprising nine states. The Legal Amazon region has experienced significant deforestation due to settlement, logging, ranching, and farming activities. The human population in the region grew from 6 million in 1960 to 25 million in 2010. In response, the Brazilian government implemented measures to prevent and control deforestation, including increased surveillance, enforcement of environmental laws, and expansion of protected lands. Nearly 20% of the Brazilian Amazon now has some form of protected status. The Brazilian government has implemented measures to protect the Amazon, including designating 20% of the Brazilian Amazon as protected areas and recognizing 22% as indigenous territories. Private landowners in the Legal Amazon are required to maintain native vegetation on 80% of their properties. Initiatives such as conditioning credit on farmers' compliance with environmental laws and banning new sugarcane plantations in the Legal Amazon have been put in place to support sustainable development and limit deforestation. Additionally, private sector conservation initiatives, such as agreements among soybean traders and meatpackers, have been supported by the government. Deforestation in the Legal Amazon declined by 83% between 2004 and 2012 due to Brazil's conservation efforts and economic factors. However, deforestation has been increasing in recent years, reaching 3,769 square miles in the 12-month period ending in July 2019. This rise is attributed to policy reversals cutting funding for environmental enforcement, reduced protected areas, relaxed conservation requirements, and market incentives like Chinese imports of Brazilian beef and soybeans. The rise in deforestation in the Legal Amazon is linked to policy changes and market incentives, such as China's increased soybean imports from Brazil. President Bolsonaro's administration has lifted bans on new sugarcane plantations and proposed allowing commercial activities in indigenous territories to spur economic growth. President Bolsonaro's administration's policies have led to a surge in deforestation in the Legal Amazon region, with a 30% increase in deforestation and a rise in fires in 2019. Bolsonaro initially dismissed environmental concerns but later announced the creation of a new security force and Amazon Council to address conservation efforts. As of the end of 2019, a majority of Brazilians disapproved of President Bolsonaro's environmental policies, particularly regarding the rising levels of Amazon deforestation. This raises doubts about Brazil's ability to meet its Paris Agreement commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 37% below 2005 levels by 2025. Despite previous declines in emissions, recent increases in deforestation have caused a rise in greenhouse gas emissions, with a 0.3% increase in 2018. At COP 25, Brazil urged developed countries to meet $100 billion goal for climate change aid. Brazil wants 10% of funds and to carry over Kyoto Protocol carbon credits. Brazil's proposals at COP 25 raised concerns about the transfer of credits from Kyoto mechanisms, risking double-counting and undermining the new Paris Agreement markets. Disagreements on this issue hindered the finalization of rules for new carbon markets. Additionally, the Brazilian government, while calling for international financial support, has reduced domestic efforts to combat climate change by closing climate change departments and cutting funding for climate change initiatives by 95%. Brazil unilaterally restructured the governance of the Amazon Fund, leading Norway and Germany to suspend their contributions. State governments in the Legal Amazon are negotiating directly with Norway and Germany to restore funding. President Bolsonaro has shifted Brazil's foreign policy towards closer alignment with the United States. Bolsonaro's foreign policy realignment towards the United States has been controversial, with a confrontational approach towards Cuba and close coordination on Venezuela. Support for controversial U.S. actions like the killing of Soleimani has not resulted in concrete benefits for Brazil, as trade barriers were maintained on key exports despite bilateral agreements. The Trump Administration warned Brazil about defense ties if Huawei participates in Brazil's 5G network. Abandoning autonomy in foreign affairs weakened Brazil's international standing and caused tensions with BRICS partners. 60% of Brazilians lack confidence in Trump's foreign policy. During his presidency, Bolsonaro initially aligned Brazilian foreign policy with the United States but later backed away due to concerns about losing access to foreign markets, particularly in the agribusiness sector. Some Members of Congress have urged the Trump Administration to develop a strategic partnership with Brazil, while others have reservations about Bolsonaro's commitment to democracy. The current Brazilian administration is facing concerns about Bolsonaro's commitment to democracy, human rights, and environmental policies. Trade policy has been a contentious issue in U.S.-Brazilian relations, with Brazil prioritizing integration with its South American neighbors through Mercosur and WTO negotiations. Mercosur, established in 1991, has only achieved limited economic integration and has become somewhat protectionist. The Mercosur trade arrangement has become protectionist, shielding members from external competition instead of promoting global economic integration. Brazil, along with other developing nations, has pushed for reduced agricultural tariffs by developed countries while resisting calls for increased access to their industrial and services sectors. This has hindered multilateral trade negotiations and efforts to establish a Free Trade Area of the Americas. The Bolsonaro and Trump Administrations have negotiated bilateral agreements to strengthen commercial ties. In March 2019, during an official visit to Washington, the United States and Brazil agreed to lower trade barriers for certain agricultural products. Brazil implemented a tariff rate quota allowing the importation of 750,000 tons of U.S. wheat annually without tariffs and agreed to adopt \"science-based conditions\" for potential imports of U.S. pork. In return, the U.S. sent a team to audit Brazil's raw beef inspection system after suspending imports in 2017 due to bribery scandals involving top meat processing companies. The Trump Administration lifted the suspension on Brazilian beef imports after determining Brazil's food safety inspection system is equivalent to the US. Concerns remain about Brazilian meat, with a bill introduced to suspend beef and poultry imports for evaluation. Other agreements were announced during Bolsonaro's official visit in March 2019. During Bolsonaro's March 2019 visit, Brazil ratified a technology safeguards agreement allowing the launch of U.S.-licensed satellites from Alc\u00e2ntara space center. The U.S. endorsed Brazil's OECD accession in exchange for giving up special treatment status at the WTO. Discussions for a comprehensive trade agreement have begun between the two countries, with considerations for Mercosur's rules. The recent political shift in Argentina could complicate the negotiation of new trade agreements. Industry associations in Brazil are urging the Bolsonaro Administration to focus on reducing domestic business costs before pursuing trade liberalization. U.S. businesses seek protections, with President Trump occasionally threatening tariffs on Brazilian products. Bilateral trade between the U.S. and Brazil has grown but faced challenges due to economic volatility. Total merchandise trade in 2019 amounted to $73.9 billion. In 2019, total bilateral merchandise trade between the U.S. and Brazil was $73.9 billion. U.S. goods exports to Brazil were $43.1 billion, while U.S. goods imports from Brazil were $30.9 billion, resulting in a $12.2 billion trade surplus for the United States. Brazil was the 14th largest trading partner of the U.S., with the U.S. being Brazil's second-largest trading partner. Top U.S. exports to Brazil included mineral fuels, aircraft, machinery, and organic chemicals, while top U.S. imports from Brazil included mineral fuels, iron and steel, aircraft, machinery, and wood products. Brazil benefits from duty-free imports to the U.S. through the Generalized System of Preferences program. In 2019, Brazil was a beneficiary of duty-free imports to the United States valued at $2.3 billion, accounting for 7.4% of U.S. merchandise imports from Brazil. Total bilateral services trade in 2018 amounted to $34.4 billion, with the U.S. having a $22.1 billion surplus. Travel, transport, and telecommunications were top U.S. services exports to Brazil, while business services were the top U.S. imports from Brazil. Brazil exempted U.S. citizens from tourist and business visa requirements in June 2019, potentially increasing U.S. travel to Brazil. U.S. foreign direct investment in Brazil has increased by over 60% since 2008, reaching $70.9 billion in 2018. Cooperation between the United States and Brazil on security issues has strengthened in recent years, with the launch of a new Permanent Forum on Security in 2018. This forum aims to enhance bilateral cooperation on various security challenges such as arms and drug trafficking, cybercrime, financial crimes, and terrorism. Additionally, high-level security discussions take place under the Political-Military Dialogue and the Strategic Partnership Dialogue. Brazil is a major transit country for cocaine and has seen an increase in organized crime over the past decade, with large criminal groups like the Red Command and First Capital Command expanding their operations. The government is responding to the challenges posed by organized crime. The Brazilian government has implemented the Strategic Border Plan to enhance security along its 9,767-mile border with neighboring countries like Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru, known for cocaine production. Measures include deploying resources like unmanned aerial vehicles and acquiring mobile radars for the Integrated Border Monitoring System. Budget constraints may delay full implementation of the system until 2035. The United States supports Brazil's counternarcotics efforts. The United States supports counternarcotics capacity-building efforts in Brazil under a 2008 U.S.-Brazil Memorandum of Understanding. In 2018, nearly 1,000 Brazilian police officers were trained by the U.S. on combatting money laundering and community policing. Brazil collaborated with the U.S. and other partners to assess and mitigate potential terrorist threats before hosting major events. U.S. authorities trained Brazilian law enforcement on countering terrorism and identifying fraudulent documents. Brazil enacted legislation criminalizing terrorism and terrorist financing in 2016. Brazil strengthened its legal framework for identifying and freezing terrorist assets in 2019, following legislation criminalizing terrorism and terrorist financing in 2016. Brazilian officials have used the new legal framework to dismantle terrorist networks and prosecute individuals involved in promoting the Islamic State. In 2018, prosecutors charged individuals with planning to establish an Islamic State cell in Brazil and recruiting fighters for Syria. Some applaud these efforts, while others have raised concerns. Brazil has strengthened its legal framework for identifying and freezing terrorist assets. President Bolsonaro's comparison of social movements to terrorists has raised concerns about improper surveillance and prejudice towards Brazil's small Muslim population. The Brazilian congress recently restricted the financial intelligence unit's ability to report on terrorist financing, potentially jeopardizing Brazil's compliance with global anti-money laundering and antiterrorism financing standards. In December 2019, the U.S. Department of State allocated $700,000 to Brazil to enhance law enforcement capabilities in deterring terrorism. The aid will focus on border security training to prevent suspected terrorists from transiting the Tri-Border Area of Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay, known for illicit activities. Brazil arrested an alleged Hezbollah financier in the area in 2018, despite not considering Hezbollah a terrorist organization. The Bolsonaro Administration in Brazil is considering designating Hezbollah as a terrorist organization, despite not currently viewing it as such. U.S.-Brazilian military ties have strengthened over the past decade, with the two countries engaging in joint operations after the 2010 Haiti earthquake. Relations were strained in 2015 due to reports of U.S. espionage in Brazil, but a Master Information Exchange Agreement was signed in 2017 to facilitate cooperation. The 2017 agreement enabled bilateral defense-related technology projects between Brazil and the U.S. In 2019, President Trump designated Brazil as a major non-NATO ally, granting privileged access to the U.S. defense industry. The U.S. provided military assistance to Brazil, including IMET assistance, equipment under the Excess Defense Articles program, and equipment/services under the Foreign Military Sales program. The Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 does not allocate military assistance for Brazil, but the Trump Administration requested $625,000 in IMET for Brazil in FY2020 and FY2021. Bilateral agreements and Brazil's designation as a major non-NATO ally have strengthened military ties, but the future of the defense relationship may be influenced by geopolitical factors. U.S. officials have warned that cooperation could be at risk if Brazil allows Huawei to participate in its 5G network, despite the economic benefits. The Bolsonaro Administration in Brazil may prioritize the financial benefits of using lower cost components for the 5G network over closer defense ties with the United States. Brazil has shifted towards closer cooperation with China, its top trade partner, and is cautious about becoming technologically dependent on any one country. Congress is interested in ensuring U.S. military engagement with Brazil. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 directs the Secretary of Defense to submit a report to Congress regarding U.S.-Brazilian security cooperation, assessing Brazil's military capabilities, U.S. objectives, ongoing activities, and human rights climate in Brazil. The report will also identify any Brazilian military forces alleged to have engaged in human rights violations. The report on U.S.-Brazilian security cooperation will detail ongoing activities and planned cooperation focused on human rights. Some Members of Congress have proposed changes to U.S. security cooperation with Brazil, including rescinding Brazil's major non-NATO ally status. Others advocate for closer security ties, even suggesting Brazil's inclusion in NATO partnership programs. The U.S. government also supports conservation efforts in Brazil. The U.S. government has supported conservation efforts in Brazil since the 1980s through the U.S.-Brazil Partnership for the Conservation of Amazon Biodiversity (PCAB). Launched in 2014, the PCAB aims to strengthen protected area management and promote sustainable development in the Amazon by working with various stakeholders including governments, private sector companies, and NGOs. USAID provides assistance for protected areas, indigenous communities, and quilombola communities to improve resource management and livelihoods. Additionally, USAID supports the Partnership Platform for the Amazon to facilitate private investment in conservation and sustainable development activities, including the establishment of the Athelia Biodiversity Fund in November 2019. In November 2019, USAID helped establish the Athelia Biodiversity Fund, a Brazilian equity fund aiming to raise $100 million of private capital for conservation efforts. USAID's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance also sent wildfire experts to assist Brazilian fire investigators in 2019. Other U.S. agencies collaborate with or receive funding from USAID for various environmental programs in Brazil, such as the U.S. Forest Service providing technical assistance for protected area management and NASA offering data support for monitoring Amazon deforestation. President Trump has not requested funding for these programs. President Trump has not requested funding for environmental programs in Brazil in his budget proposals, but Congress has allocated $15 million for the Brazilian Amazon in the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020. Some Members of Congress are urging both the Brazilian and U.S. governments to do more to conserve the Amazon, with resolutions calling for increased environmental enforcement and protection for indigenous communities. The Act for the Amazon Act aims to take more punitive measures. The Act for the Amazon (H.R. 4263, DeFazio) proposed in September 2019 would impose bans on certain imports from Brazil, restrict military engagement, and prohibit free trade negotiations. Brazil continues to face economic challenges with slow growth, widespread poverty, and reduced social services due to budget cuts. President Bolsonaro's interference in justice sector agencies and attacks on press and civil society have strained Brazil's democratic institutions. Brazilian policymakers are focused on internal challenges, limiting the country's ability to take on regional responsibilities or exert international influence. U.S.-Brazilian relations have strengthened since 2019, with a focus on aligning with the Trump Administration, enhancing commercial ties, and security cooperation. Policy differences have emerged between the two countries. Policy differences have emerged between the Trump and Bolsonaro Administrations over sensitive issues like bilateral trade barriers and relations with China, impacting economic and geopolitical interests. The 116th Congress may shape U.S.-Brazilian relations through legislative and oversight powers, with some reluctance to advance major initiatives due to concerns about democracy, human rights, and the environment in Brazil. The 116th Congress may shape U.S.-Brazilian relations through legislative and oversight powers, with concerns about democracy, human rights, and the environment in Brazil. Funding for programs like Amazon conservation efforts may continue while Members advocate for different policy approaches towards the Bolsonaro Administration."
