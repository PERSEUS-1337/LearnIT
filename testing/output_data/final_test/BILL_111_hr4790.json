    "content": "The \"Shareholder Protection Act of 2010\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. Congress finds that corporations make significant political contributions and expenditures that influence elections and support political causes. These decisions are typically made by corporate boards and executives, rather than shareholders. Shareholders have historically lacked transparency and influence over corporate political activities, but they have a right to know how their funds are being used for political purposes. Corporations should be accountable to shareholders for political contributions and expenditures, requiring shareholder approval for such actions to ensure transparency and accountability. SEC. 3. SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL OF CORPORATE POLITICAL ACTIVITY. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is amended to include a new section requiring shareholder approval for certain political expenditures and disclosure of votes by institutional investors. Shareholder authorization is required for political expenditures by issuers, including a description of proposed expenditures and a separate shareholder vote. Issuers cannot make political expenditures unless they align with what was proposed and authorized by shareholders. Shareholder authorization is necessary for political expenditures by issuers, with officers and directors being held liable for unauthorized expenditures. Violations of this requirement constitute a breach of fiduciary duty, leading to potential financial liability for those responsible. The curr_chunk defines different types of political expenditures, including independent expenditures, electioneering communications, and payments to organizations that could be used for political purposes. The curr_chunk discusses exclusions from the definition of political expenditures, such as direct lobbying efforts, communications to shareholders and personnel, and contributions to a separate fund for political purposes. Institutional investment managers must report their votes on shareholder issues annually. The Commission will require reports on shareholder votes to be made publicly available within 30 days through the EDGAR system. A safe harbor is provided for investment managers who decide to divest from securities due to political expenditures by the issuer, protecting them from legal actions based solely on this decision. The subsection does not apply to institutional investment managers unless disclosures are made as per Commission regulations. SEC. 4. REQUIRED BOARD VOTE ON CORPORATE EXPENDITURES FOR POLITICAL ACTIVITIES. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is amended to include a new section requiring a board vote on corporate expenditures for political activities. The Commission will direct exchanges to prohibit listing of equity securities for issuers not complying with expenditure voting requirements in corporate bylaws. Issuers must vote on political expenditures exceeding $50,000 and disclose individual votes publicly. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires issuers to publicly disclose individual votes of directors on political expenditures exceeding $50,000 within 48 hours. This voting process does not affect the determination of independence from candidates or campaigns. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 mandates issuers to disclose directors' individual votes on political expenditures over $50,000 within 48 hours, without impacting their independence from candidates or campaigns. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 now requires issuers to disclose quarterly political expenditures and individual board members' votes on such expenditures within 180 days of enactment. The report must include the date and amount of each expenditure. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 mandates issuers to disclose quarterly political expenditures, including the amount, candidate details, and trade associations involved. Additionally, annual reports to shareholders must include a summary of political activities exceeding $10,000. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires issuers to disclose political expenditures, including materials purchased, within 48 hours on their website. The Commission ensures public availability of quarterly reports on its website and through the EDGAR system. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 mandates issuers to disclose political expenditures promptly on their website, ensuring public access to quarterly reports through the EDGAR system. The disclosed information must be searchable, sortable, and downloadable as per section 24 requirements. SEC. 6. REPORTS.\n\nThe SEC will annually assess public corporations' compliance with the Act's amendments and report findings to Congress. The Comptroller General will evaluate the SEC's oversight effectiveness.\n\nSEC. 7. SEVERABILITY.\n\nIf any part of the Act is deemed unconstitutional, the rest remains unaffected."
