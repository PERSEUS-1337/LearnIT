    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Commitment to American Prosperity Act of 2011\" or the \"CAP Act of 2011\". Congress finds that this Act is authorized by the United States Constitution, with total Federal outlays averaging 20.6% of GDP over the past 40 years, reaching 23.8% in fiscal year 2010 and projected to be 25.9% in fiscal year 2020. If a constitutional amendment sets a lower outlay limit, Congress should consider adjusting the maximum outlay amounts in this Act. The Congressional Budget Office's Alternative Fiscal Scenario suggests limiting total Federal outlays as a percentage of GDP to align spending with historical norms. SEC. 3. OUTLAYS EXCEEDING THE GDP OUTLAY LIMIT. The curr_chunk introduces new definitions related to the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, including the term 'GDP' and 'emergency requirement' for budget authority in urgent situations. The curr_chunk introduces definitions related to emergencies under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, specifying that emergencies must be unforeseen, unpredictable, temporary, and not part of anticipated emergencies. The curr_chunk introduces the enforcement of GDP outlay limits. The curr_chunk defines the term 'GDP outlay limit' as an amount estimated by OMB based on the average GDP of preceding fiscal years. It outlines the calculation method for the limit for fiscal years 2013 to 2022. The curr_chunk discusses the timing of advisory reports on GDP outlay limits and the inclusion of all federal outlays. It also outlines the process for sequestration to eliminate excess outlay amounts. The process for sequestration to eliminate excess outlay amounts involves advisory reports on GDP outlay limits, with OMB issuing preview and final sequestration reports accompanied by a Presidential order detailing spending reductions. The process for sequestration involves Congressional action to change existing laws based on OMB reports projecting sequestration. OMB calculates outlay savings to eliminate excess outlays in three categories, including direct spending like Social Security. The sequestration process involves reductions in direct spending (Social Security, Medicare, etc.), discretionary security spending, and discretionary non-security spending. Reductions are proportional to the growth in outlays from the previous fiscal year, with uniform reductions within each category to achieve the required percentage reduction. Sequestration required by this section is done on a pro rata basis if legislation funding the Government does not cover the entire fiscal year. Total Federal outlays can exceed the GDP outlay limit to reduce public debt or if the public debt is zero. Section 255 does not apply, except for exempting payments for net interest. The Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 shall apply to enforce excess outlays caused by enacted bills. This section is effective starting fiscal year 2013, including necessary reports and calculations. SEC. 4. ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURES UNDER THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET ACT OF 1974. Amends Title III of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 by adding enforcement procedures. The text chunk discusses limits on GDP outlays in bills, resolutions, and reports, with provisions for waivers or suspensions by a two-thirds vote in the Senate or House. It also includes point of order protection in the House. The text discusses point of order protection in the House and limitations on suspending the application of certain sections in bills. Enforcement procedures under Section 316 are discussed, focusing on the House's point of order protection and limitations on suspending certain sections in bills."
