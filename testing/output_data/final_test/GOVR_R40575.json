    "content": "Swine flu is a strain of influenza that affects wild and domestic pigs. While rare, there have been isolated cases of human flu caused by swine flu strains. The current outbreak is caused by a new strain of flu virus, known as influenza A(H1N1), first detected in the United States in April 2009. The virus spreads from person to person similar to seasonal flu. The new strain of flu virus, known as influenza A(H1N1), is different from normal pig flu viruses in North America, with genes from Europe, Asia, humans, and birds. There is no evidence of pigs transmitting the virus to humans. Organizations like CDC, WHO, and OIE confirm that the 2009 H1N1 virus is not transmitted through food, including pork. The 2009 H1N1 flu cannot be transmitted to humans through pork or pork products. Properly handling and cooking pork to an internal temperature of 160\u00b0F/70\u00b0C is recommended to kill all viruses and foodborne pathogens. The USDA states that the flu is not a foodborne disease, and medical and veterinary authorities confirm that exposure to pigs or consumption of pork are not risk factors for infection. WHO, OIE, WTO, and FAO also support the safety of eating properly cooked pork. The WHO, OIE, WTO, and FAO confirm that pork products handled properly are not a source of infection. Various organizations recommend referring to the 2009 H1N1 flu as influenza A(H1N1) or 2009 H1N1 instead of \"swine flu\" due to its human-to-human transmission. The WHO, CDC, OIE, and EFSA emphasize that proper handling of pork products prevents infection with influenza A(H1N1) or 2009 H1N1. They recommend avoiding meat from sick pigs and ensuring thorough cooking to kill any viruses. The USDA advises proper cooking to kill bacteria or viruses in foods, reducing the risk of foodborne illness. A study confirmed that meat from pigs exposed to H1N1 virus did not contain the virus in the meat, only in the respiratory tract. CDC warns of H1N1 flu virus transmission between pigs and humans, with swine farmers and veterinarians at higher risk. CDC has provided guidance for workers exposed to infected animals. In May 2009, H1N1 flu virus was found in a swine herd in Alberta, Canada, resulting from human-to-pig transmission. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency placed the herd under quarantine, but stated that Canadian pork remains safe to eat. H1N1 was also detected in poultry farms, including turkey flocks in Chile. In October, USDA confirmed the presence of H1N1 in a pig sample from the Minnesota State Fair. In December, USDA confirmed the first case of H1N1 flu virus in a U.S. turkey flock in Virginia. Researchers believe the virus originated in pigs and may have been circulating in them for years. Speculation arose that the outbreak could be linked to operations with a large number of confined animals, with initial reports pointing to a large confinement of Smithfield Foods Inc. in Veracruz, Mexico. Smithfield denies any evidence of 2009 H1N1 influenza in their company. The company reported no evidence of 2009 H1N1 influenza in its swine herds or employees worldwide, including in the United States. The U.S. Animal Health & Productivity Surveillance Inventory, maintained by USDA's APHIS, conducts surveillance for avian flu. Industry reports indicated that APHIS was working on draft guidelines and surveillance plans for the H1N1 virus. APHIS was developing draft guidelines and surveillance plans for the H1N1 virus in collaboration with various communities. An interagency agreement was made between CDC and USDA for swine influenza virus surveillance, with related research efforts conducted by USDA Agricultural Research Service. APHIS's Veterinary Services also developed guidelines for managing potential cases of the virus in swine. The National Animal Health Surveillance System (NAHSS) has released its surveillance plan for swine influenza virus. The USDA provided H1N1 virus to animal vaccine makers for vaccine development. By December 2009, the first H1N1 swine vaccine was in use in the Midwest, with limited distribution. Consumer fears of pork consumption due to H1N1 flu led to a drop in domestic pork sales, causing a sharp decline in hog prices. Economists at Purdue University estimated that Indiana hog producers were losing about $5 a head on April 24, compared to estimated losses of about $20 immediately following reports of the initial outbreak in March. Stock analysts downgraded the stock of Tyson Foods Inc. and Smithfield Foods Inc. due to the impact of the H1N1 flu outbreak. Consumers were still confused about how humans can get the 2009 H1N1 flu, with a survey showing that most believed it could be contracted from close contact with someone who has swine flu. Consumers were confused about how humans can get the 2009 H1N1 flu, with some believing it could be contracted from being near someone who has swine flu, coming in contact with pigs, or eating pork. Despite safety concerns, pork consumption in the United States returned to normal as prices dropped. However, a survey in China showed that many consumers stopped eating pork during the H1N1 outbreak, with some still believing it could result in catching the flu virus. Several countries banned or restricted U.S. pork products due to public health concerns during the 2009 H1N1 flu outbreak. Mainland China and Russia were among the countries that imposed trade restrictions on U.S. pork. The U.S. Trade Representative reported that 16 trading partners had notified the United States of trade restrictions on swine and pork products, with as many as 27 countries later implementing similar measures. Several countries, including St. Lucia, Thailand, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan, imposed trade restrictions on U.S. pork products during the 2009 H1N1 flu outbreak. The restrictions varied by country, with some banning all pork products and others restricting certain products. For example, Russia restricted all livestock and meat products from selected states, while China limited restrictions to uncooked pork and pork products. Hong Kong was not included in China's suspension. During the 2009 H1N1 flu outbreak, several countries imposed trade restrictions on U.S. pork products. China and Russia, which account for 15% of U.S. pork trade, lifted their restrictions after several months. Some countries extended their bans to include all pork imports, while others lifted their import ban. Mexico and Canada also faced similar restrictions. China and Russia lifted their restrictions on U.S. pork trade after negotiations with the United States. Foreign sales are crucial for the U.S. meat and poultry industries, with China and Russia being top markets for U.S. pork. The countries that had banned U.S. pork exports due to the 2009 H1N1 flu outbreak represented a significant portion of the market. As of mid-May, bans on U.S. pork exports due to the 2009 H1N1 flu outbreak accounted for 13%-16% of annual U.S. pork trade, mainly from Russia and China. Japan, the largest market for U.S. pork, and Hong Kong indicated they would not restrict U.S. pork exports. China alone represented about 20% of U.S. pork trade and was a top export market. China and Hong Kong are important markets for U.S. pork products. Hong Kong accounts for 9% of exports compared to 6% for China in 2008. The ban on U.S. pork exports to China due to H1N1 flu concerns may have lower trade effects as Hong Kong was not included in the suspension. It is emphasized that health and safety measures for imports should be based on scientific evidence and comply with international obligations under WTO rules. OEI guidelines and WTO member obligations under the SPS Agreement state that trade restrictions on pork products due to 2009 H1N1 are not justified. Some countries are imposing bans, leading affected exporting countries to consider WTO actions. USTR urges trading partners to base food safety measures on scientific evidence and remove trade restrictions. The USTR and USDA emphasized that trade restrictions on U.S. pork products due to the 2009 H1N1 outbreak are not based on scientific evidence and may cause unnecessary trade disruptions. Many in Congress and exporting countries criticized WTO member countries for imposing unjustified import bans on pork products. Several countries imposed import bans on pork products due to the 2009 H1N1 outbreak. China, Ukraine, Indonesia, and Jordan claimed the bans were temporary and would be lifted after examining scientific evidence. Mexico and other countries urged trading partners to withdraw unjustified restrictions on Mexican products. Additional formal statements against import restrictions were made by Armenia, Bahrain, Croatia, Gabon, Thailand, and others. Many countries imposed import bans on pork products due to the 2009 H1N1 outbreak, with some claiming the bans were temporary and based on scientific evidence. Trade restrictions were seen as politically motivated or aimed at protecting domestic producers. Russia, for example, faced challenges in competing globally in red meats and poultry, leading to a growing reliance on imports. Russia also imposed SPS measures that hindered U.S. meat and poultry imports. In March 2002, Russia banned U.S. poultry imports over avian influenza concerns, which U.S. officials deemed discriminatory. China's pork market is significant, with growing imports crucial for exporting nations like the U.S. The National Pork Producers Council expected temporary restrictions on U.S. pork exports due to misconceptions about virus transmission. The initial trade restrictions, such as the ban on U.S. beef by Russia, raised concerns about their potential long-term impact. The spread of H1N1 flu led to a decline in domestic pork sales, affecting futures prices for corn, soybeans, and wheat due to fears of reduced demand for feed grains and protein meals. There were worries about ripple effects throughout the hog sector and production changes. Analysts predicted volatile feed prices and production changes in the hog sector due to lower prices. Initial reports of economic effects on U.S. hog producers were grim, but as time passed, it became difficult to separate the impact from the general economic downturn. Concerns about trade restrictions on fresh produce and agricultural labor workers from Mexico due to the 2009 H1N1 outbreak have not materialized. The U.S. hog industry downturn worsened, making it hard to distinguish H1N1's economic impact from overall market conditions. Early estimates suggested up to $400 million in losses for the pork industry post-outbreak. USDA revised second-quarter hog prices lower in May 2009 due to H1N1 effects. Updated estimates in June 2009 indicated potential $270 million income losses for the U.S. pork industry in the second quarter alone. Recent data shows H1N1's economic impact may not be as severe as initially feared. The economic impact of the H1N1 virus on the U.S. pork industry was not as severe as initially predicted. The industry was already facing challenges such as declining pork prices, rising production costs, and reduced meat demand due to the global economic downturn. The H1N1 outbreak further worsened the situation, leading to trade restrictions in key export markets like Russia and China. Despite efforts to downsize and increase efficiency, the industry still experienced income losses, with estimates reaching $270 million in the second quarter of 2009. The H1N1 outbreak had a limited impact on the U.S. pork industry, which was already facing challenges like declining prices and rising production costs. Despite trade restrictions in key export markets, overall production volumes remained stable, leading to downward pressure on prices. USDA purchased pork products for federal assistance programs, predicting price recovery in the second half of 2009. Smithfield Foods Company reported that H1N1 had only a short-term effect on U.S. fresh pork demand. In August, Smithfield reiterated that quarterly returns would be favorable despite existing hog market conditions. USDA predicted low pork prices through 2009. Market forecasts for 2010 suggest U.S. hog producers may break even as prices align with production costs. U.S. pork exports for May and June 2009 were significantly lower compared to 2008. USMEF reported that April pork exports were better than predicted amid the economic downturn. Total 2009 pork export volumes are estimated to be lower overall. Overall, 2009 saw a decrease in pork export volumes due to economic conditions and trade restrictions related to the H1N1 flu virus. Analysts predict that 2010 exports will increase but remain slightly below 2008 levels. Despite lower pork prices, supplies are also down, and the impact of the H1N1 outbreak on pork sales is uncertain. In 2009, pork export volumes decreased due to economic conditions and H1N1-related trade restrictions. Analysts predict a slight increase in 2010 exports but below 2008 levels. Uncertainty remains regarding the impact of the H1N1 outbreak on pork sales. NPPC requested USDA assistance to compensate for industry losses post-2009 H1N1 outbreak. In response to the 2009 H1N1 outbreak, NPPC requested USDA assistance including a $50 million purchase program for pork products, removal of export restrictions, surveillance program for swine diseases, and keeping the US-Canada border open for hog movement. In August, NPPC asked for up to $250 million in support for pork purchases. Another group requested a $200 million sow buy-out program. In September 2009, USDA announced a $30 million purchase of pork products. USDA announced purchases of $30 million in pork products in September 2009, followed by an additional $50 million in November. These purchases aim to stabilize prices, stimulate the economy, and provide high-quality food for nutrition assistance programs."
