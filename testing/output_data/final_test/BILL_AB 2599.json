    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 261 of the Penal Code in California is amended to define rape as non-consensual sexual intercourse under various circumstances, including when the victim is incapable of giving consent due to a mental disorder or disability, or when force or fear is used. If a person is unable to resist or give consent due to intoxication or unconsciousness, and the accused knew or should have known about this condition, it constitutes rape under California Penal Code Section 261. This includes situations where the victim is unconscious, asleep, unaware of the act, or deceived by the perpetrator. (5) If a person is deceived by the accused into believing the act is committed by someone else known to the victim, it constitutes rape. (6) Rape also includes acts accomplished against the victim's will through threats of future retaliation involving kidnapping, false imprisonment, extreme pain, bodily harm, or death. In cases of rape, if the act is done against the victim's will by threatening to use the authority of a public official to incarcerate, arrest, or deport the victim, it is considered rape. The threat can be direct or implied, and the victim must have a reasonable belief that the perpetrator is a public official. The age of the victim and their relationship to the defendant are factors to consider in determining the existence of duress. Section 262 of the Penal Code is amended to define \"menace\" as any threat showing intent to harm. Rape of a spouse includes acts accomplished against their will through force, violence, duress, or incapacitation by substances. Unconsciousness or inability to resist or give consent also constitutes rape. The act of rape can occur when the victim is unconscious, unaware, or unable to resist due to the perpetrator's actions. Threatening retaliation against the victim or others can also constitute rape if there is a reasonable possibility of the threat being carried out. The act of rape can occur when the victim is unconscious, unaware, or unable to resist due to the perpetrator's actions. Threatening to use the authority of a public official to incarcerate, arrest, or deport the victim or another, with the victim believing the perpetrator is a public official, can also constitute rape. Duress is defined as a threat of force, violence, danger, or retribution that coerces a reasonable person to perform an act they would not have otherwise done. Factors such as the victim's age and relationship to the defendant are considered in determining the existence of duress. If probation is granted for a violation of this section, conditions may include payments to a battered women's shelter or reimbursing the victim for counseling and other expenses. Menace is defined as a threat or act showing intent to harm another. The court must assess the defendant's ability to pay fines, restitution, or payments to a battered women's shelter as part of probation. Community property cannot be used to pay for restitution to an injured spouse if the injury was caused by the criminal acts of their spouse. No reimbursement is required by this act according to the California Constitution. The costs incurred by a local agency or school district will be due to creating a new crime, eliminating a crime, changing penalties, or altering crime definitions."
