    "content": "The people of California enact the following. Section 6601 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to require evaluation of individuals in custody under the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation who may be sexually violent predators at least six months before their scheduled release from prison. A petition may be filed if the individual was in custody for a determinate prison term, parole revocation term, or hold under Section 6601.3 at the time of filing. The petition cannot be dismissed if custody was later deemed unlawful due to a good faith mistake of fact or law. This applies to petitions filed on or after January 1, 1996. The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation and the Board of Parole Hearings screen individuals for sexually violent predatory offenses based on their history. If deemed likely to be a sexually violent predator, the person is referred to the State Department of State Hospitals for further evaluation. The State Department of State Hospitals evaluates individuals using a standardized assessment protocol to determine if they meet the criteria of a sexually violent predator. Factors considered include mental disorders, criminal and psychosexual history, sexual deviance, and severity of mental disorder. On or before January 30, 2016, the State Department of State Hospitals will consult with a committee to make recommendations for possible changes to the standardized assessment protocol for evaluating sexually violent predators. The State Department of State Hospitals will update the standardized assessment protocol by March 1, 2016, as recommended by the California State Auditor. This includes formal supervisory review, a checklist for evaluations, and training requirements for evaluators. The person must be evaluated by two psychiatrists or psychologists designated by the Director of State Hospitals. If both evaluators agree that the person has a diagnosed mental disorder and is likely to commit sexual violence without treatment, a petition for commitment can be filed. The evaluation reports and supporting documents will be provided to the county attorney for possible commitment proceedings. If one professional disagrees with the evaluation results, the Director of State Hospitals will arrange for further examination by two independent professionals. If two independent professionals agree that a person meets criteria for commitment, a petition for commitment can be filed. The purpose of the evaluation is to determine if the person meets criteria for involuntary commitment. Any independent professional designated by the Secretary of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation or the Director of State Hospitals must have at least five years of experience in diagnosing and treating mental disorders. This includes psychiatrists and licensed psychologists with a doctoral degree in psychology. These requirements also apply to professionals appointed by the court for evaluations in other proceedings under this article. If the State Department of State Hospitals deems a person a sexually violent predator, the Director of State Hospitals will request a petition for commitment to be filed in the designated county. Evaluation reports and supporting documents will be provided to the county's designated attorney for possible petition filing in superior court. If the county's designated counsel agrees, a petition for commitment will be filed in the superior court of the county where the person was convicted. The district attorney or county counsel will handle the proceedings, and the county board of supervisors will designate who is responsible. Time limits in this section do not apply in the first year of operation. An order issued by a judge under Section 6601.5 can toll parole for a sexually violent predator. The county's designated attorney must notify the State Department of State Hospitals within 15 days of deciding on a commitment petition. The director will execute a declaration to activate this section once enough state employees are hired for required evaluations, or by January 1, 2013. Section 6604.9 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended. Section 6604.9 of the Welfare and Institutions Code is amended to require annual mental condition examinations for sexually violent predators in state custody. The examination must be conducted by a qualified professional and signed by the Director of the State Department of State Hospitals. Indigent individuals may request a court-appointed expert for the examination. The annual report for sexually violent predators in state custody must consider if the person still meets the criteria, and if conditional release or discharge is appropriate with community protection measures. The report is filed with the court and served to the prosecuting agency and the committed person. If the State Department of State Hospitals determines that a sexually violent predator no longer meets the criteria, they can petition the court for conditional release or unconditional discharge. The court will consider the petition following specified procedures. An oversight board is created to advise the Legislature and Governor on sexually violent predators. The court orders a show cause hearing upon receiving a petition for unconditional discharge. The oversight board for sexually violent predators consists of seven members representing various organizations. They meet at least six times per year and include a representative of the private defense bar and an evaluator with experience under Article 4 of Chapter 2 of Division 6. The oversight board for sexually violent predators meets at least six times per year and submits an annual report to the Governor and Legislature with recommendations on evaluating sexually violent predators in state hospitals. The report must comply with government code requirements."
