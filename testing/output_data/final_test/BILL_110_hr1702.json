    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Common Sense Budget Act of 2007\". Congress finds that the Department of Defense's budget is larger than the total defense spending of all other countries combined. Despite this, the United States ranks 42nd in infant mortality globally. $60 billion of the defense budget is spent on weapons for Cold War-era threats, while education funding has decreased to less than 8% of the proposed 2008 defense outlays. While schools are cutting programs in music, foreign language, and physical education, 46 million individuals in the US lack health insurance at some point each year. Additionally, a third of public schools need extensive repairs, serving 14 million children, and 85% of public schools, 73,000 facilities, serving 40 million students, require attention. The total cost for repairs and replacements in schools is over $120 billion. Research shows US middle school students rank 9th in science and 15th in math internationally. The Department of Defense couldn't account for over $1 trillion in funds in 2003. The United States spends over $20 billion annually on maintaining its nuclear arsenal, with many obsolete weapons. The Department of Defense is also investing billions in developing space weapons, contrary to White House policy on arms control and nonproliferation. The United States faces challenges in arms control and nonproliferation, with allies opposing the development of space weapons to prevent an arms race. To enhance national security, the US should reduce reliance on foreign oil by investing in sustainable energy sources and prioritize sustainable development and humanitarian aid in foreign policy to address terrorism effectively. To address the ability of terrorist organizations to recruit effectively, the United States should increase funding for sustainable development and humanitarian assistance programs to tackle global challenges like poverty, illiteracy, unemployment, disease, and disaster. SEC. 3. REDUCTIONS IN AMOUNTS AVAILABLE FOR DEFENSE AND ENERGY PROGRAMS. Reductions in amounts available for Department of Defense and Department of Energy programs for fiscal year 2008 by $47 billion and $13 billion respectively. $10 billion allocated for school facilities modernization and $9 billion for other domestic programs. $9 billion allocated for State child health plans, $5 billion for employment and training activities, $10 billion for energy efficiency and conservation programs, and $13 billion for sustainable development initiatives. The Secretary of State may allocate funds for sustainable development and humanitarian assistance programs to address global challenges. $5 billion is allocated to the Secretary of Homeland Security for improving safeguards, $5 billion to reduce the deficit, and $3 billion for Veterans' health care. SEC. 4. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act takes effect 90 days after enactment."
