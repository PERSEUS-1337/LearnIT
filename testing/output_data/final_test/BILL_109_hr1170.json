FINDINGS.\" Summarized chunk:\nThe Congress finds that Ukraine has adopted procedures allowing citizens to emigrate and travel freely since 1997, has made progress towards democracy since 1991, and is committed to enforcing internationally recognized labor standards. Ukraine, as a member state of the OSCE, is committed to developing governance in line with human rights standards, including freedom of the media and equality for national minorities. Legislation has been enacted to protect these rights. Ukraine has enacted legislation to protect against incitement to violence based on discrimination, including anti-Semitism. They have also returned confiscated properties to national and religious minorities, facilitating their reemergence in Ukrainian society. Additionally, Ukraine is committed to establishing a legal framework for this process in the future. Ukraine has made progress towards a free market economy and has normal trade relations with the US since 1992. They are seeking admission to the World Trade Organization, but issues like intellectual property rights, access for US agricultural products, tariff reductions, and customs reform need to be addressed. The President may determine that Title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 should no longer apply to Ukraine and proclaim the extension of permanent normal trade relations treatment to Ukrainian products. After this extension, chapter 1 of Title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 will cease to apply to Ukraine. The trade agreement between the United States and Ukraine from June 23, 1992, remains in force, granting the U.S. specific safeguard rules to address import surges from Ukraine. Congressional oversight is required for Ukraine's accession to the WTO negotiations. The President must notify Congress within 5 days of the US-Ukraine bilateral agreement on WTO accession. A report detailing the agreement must be transmitted to Congress within 15 days. Congressional Oversight Resolution can be introduced within a 30-day period after the initial notification. Congress must consider a Congressional Oversight Resolution regarding the US-Ukraine agreement on WTO accession within a 30-day period. The resolution expresses Congress's view on whether the agreement adequately serves US interests. Procedures for considering Congressional Oversight Resolutions must adhere to specific provisions outlined in the Trade Act of 2002."
