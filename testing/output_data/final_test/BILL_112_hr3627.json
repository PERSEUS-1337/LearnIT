    "content": "The Act is titled the \"School Access to Emergency Epinephrine Act.\" Congress finds that nearly 6,000,000 children in the United States have food allergies, with teenagers and young adults at the highest risk of fatal food-induced anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction that can be life-threatening, especially for individuals with asthma. Studies show that a significant number of epinephrine administrations in schools involve individuals with previously unknown allergies. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) emphasizes the importance of prompt administration of epinephrine for anaphylaxis to prevent rapid decline and death. Physicians can provide standing orders for schools to have epinephrine injectors, as recommended by the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology. The American Academy of Pediatrics suggests keeping an anaphylaxis kit with medications in each school. Anaphylaxis kit should be kept with medications in each school and made available to trained staff for administration in an emergency. According to the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network, there are no contraindications to the use of epinephrine for a life-threatening reaction. Preference for states in administering epinephrine by school personnel. Section 399L of the Public Health Service Act is amended to give preference to states that require self-administration of medication in schools, specifically for treating asthma and anaphylaxis. The amended section of the Public Health Service Act gives preference to states that allow secondary school students to self-administer medication for asthma or anaphylaxis if prescribed by a healthcare practitioner and demonstrated necessary skills. The amended Public Health Service Act allows secondary school students to self-administer prescribed medication for asthma or anaphylaxis if they have necessary skills and a written treatment plan from a healthcare practitioner. Parents or guardians must submit required documentation to the school. The amended Public Health Service Act allows secondary school students to self-administer prescribed medication for asthma or anaphylaxis with a written treatment plan. Authorization allows possession and use of medication in school, school-sponsored activities, and transit. The State requires that backup medication provided by a student's parent or guardian be kept at the student's school for prompt access during asthma or anaphylaxis emergencies. Information maintenance is also mandated by the State. The State mandates that information related to asthma or anaphylaxis emergencies be kept on file at the student's school for easy access. This requirement does not affect liability under other laws. Additionally, school personnel must be allowed to administer epinephrine as required by the State. Authorized personnel can administer prescribed epinephrine to students believed to be having an anaphylactic reaction, kept in a secure and accessible location. The State law ensures that school employees and agents will not be liable for administering epinephrine to students with anaphylactic reactions, except in cases of willful or wanton conduct. State law does not override state laws on students with allergies or asthma self-administering medication. Definitions include 'elementary school,' 'secondary school,' and 'health care practitioner.' The curr_chunk defines terms related to medication administration in schools, including 'medication,' 'self-administration,' and 'authorized personnel.'"
