    "content": "The \"National Hurricane Research Initiative Act of 2007\" defines key terms and establishes the National Hurricane Research Initiative under the National Science Foundation and the Department of Commerce. The National Hurricane Research Initiative is established by the Under Secretary and the Director for research purposes based on a National Science Board report. It aims to set research objectives and make recommendations to relevant boards, utilizing expertise from various entities. The National Hurricane Research Initiative focuses on improving hurricane forecasting, resilient infrastructure, and mitigating impacts on coastal populations and environments. Grants are provided for research in predicting hurricane intensity changes, including rapid changes in storm size, motion, structure, and intensity. Research focuses on understanding storm dynamics, ocean-atmosphere interactions, and predicting storm surge, rainfall, flooding, high winds, tornadoes, and storm surge risk through observations, theory, modeling, and probabilistic mapping. Improved observations of hurricanes and tropical storms through various technologies to enhance understanding of storm complexity and interaction with the environment. Research also includes assessing vulnerable coastal infrastructure for better engineering assessments. Research focuses on assessing vulnerable coastal infrastructure like levees, seawalls, and drainage systems for hurricane damage vulnerability. Additionally, there is a study on the interaction of hurricanes with engineered structures to improve building designs in hurricane-prone areas. Another aspect is researching the relationship between hurricanes, climate, and natural ecosystems to enhance understanding of their complex interactions. Technologies for disaster response and recovery research focuses on improving emergency communication networks for government and non-government entities during disasters, including cyber-security measures. This includes examining the impacts of hurricanes on ecosystems over long and short periods of time, such as coral reefs and wetlands. Research focuses on improving hurricane-related information dissemination for public and government officials, including enhancing evacuation planning and computational capabilities for efficient disaster response. The National Hurricane Research Initiative aims to enhance visualization tools, analytic systems, and computational facilities for hurricane research. Collaboration with other agencies, research institutes, universities, and disaster-response organizations is crucial for utilizing expertise and capabilities to achieve the initiative's goals. The National Hurricane Research Initiative involves collaboration with various entities such as NASA, NIST, DHS, DOE, DARPA, EPA, USGS, and Army Corps of Engineers. The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy will coordinate these activities through the National Science and Technology Council. Grants will also be provided for the initiative. The National Hurricane Research Initiative involves collaboration with various entities and grants will be awarded to State and local agencies, universities, and nongovernmental entities for research purposes. The Under Secretary and Director will develop best practices for projects funded by grants and organize national seminars and forums for researchers to collaborate on improving hurricane intensity. The National Hurricane Research Initiative will allocate $285,000,000 annually from 2008 to 2018 for basic and applied research to enhance hurricane intensity forecasts and impact projections. The Undersecretary and Director will issue a request for proposals within 120 days of the Act's enactment to fund research projects over a 10-year period. SEC. 4. NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE DATABASE. The Under Secretary and the Director are required to establish a National Infrastructure Database for cataloging and characterizing physical, social, and natural infrastructure. This database will provide information to government officials and researchers to improve public policy related to hurricanes and tropical storms, measure hurricane impacts, and develop recommendations for improved building codes and urban planning practices. The National Infrastructure Database is a virtual environment that provides necessary resources to users. $20,000,000 is authorized for each fiscal year from 2008 to 2018 for this purpose. SEC. 5. NATIONAL HURRICANE RESEARCH MODEL. The Under Secretary and the Director are required to develop a National Hurricane Research Model for integrative research, knowledge transfer, experimental research on hurricanes, training of researchers and forecasters, and obtaining measurable results. The model will link theoretical, physical, and computational models from various fields and be a physically distributed and highly coordinated working environment for research from the National Hurricane Research Initiative. Initiative can be supported with quantitative metrics and promote collaboration in facilities, cyber infrastructure, software integration, and data collection platforms. $130,000,000 is authorized annually from 2008 to 2018 for this purpose."
