    "content": "The \"Direct Billing Act\" is cited as the short title. An amendment to the Public Health Service Act adds Title XXVII, which includes restrictions on billing and a prohibition under section 2701. It is unlawful for individuals or entities providing ancillary health services to bill anyone other than the patient. Physicians can only bill for ancillary services if they were personally provided or supervised by the referring physician or a member of the same group practice. Physicians can only bill for ancillary services if personally provided or supervised by referring physician, a member of the same group practice, or individuals employed by the physician or group practice. This section does not apply to ancillary health services covered under Medicare. \"Exceptions to the rule that physicians can only bill for ancillary services if personally provided or supervised by referring physician, a member of the same group practice, or individuals employed by the physician or group practice.\" A person providing ancillary health services can bill for services rendered to the recipient's family member, third party payor, health maintenance organization, hospital, skilled nursing facility, or employer responsible for payment. Payment for services can be made by a governmental agency, substance abuse program, clinic, or health care provider designated as tax-exempt for specific health-related services. The curr_chunk discusses exceptions to the need for confidentiality in providing ancillary health services, including situations involving research studies, legal requirements for confidentiality, and entities approved by the Secretary to receive claims.

Any amounts collected in violation must be refunded promptly to the individual. Physicians collecting such amounts are also liable for refunds to the recipient or payer. Additionally, repeated claims are subject to penalties. Repeatedly presenting bills or claims for services known to be ineligible for payment may result in a civil money penalty of up to $5,000 per instance. The Social Security Act's provisions on penalties apply similarly. Violation of section 2701 can lead to suspension, revocation, or limitation of laboratory certification after a hearing. Refunds must be promptly issued for amounts collected in violation of the section. The Secretary has the authority to exclude individuals or entities from participation in Medicare programs if they violate section 2701. This exclusion can also extend to State health care programs receiving Federal funds. The provisions of the Social Security Act regarding penalties apply to these exclusions.
