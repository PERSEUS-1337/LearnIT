    "content": "Recent media reports suggest movement in negotiations on amending the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) in the 110th Congress. House and Senate committees have been active in oversight activities related to the Administration's warrantless surveillance programs. An unclassified summary of the National Intelligence Estimate on the terrorist threat to the U.S. Homeland was released in July 2007, highlighting the evolving threat from Islamic terrorist groups. The Director of National Intelligence emphasized the need for modernizing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to address the evolving threat from Islamic terrorist groups, particularly Al Qaeda. He proposed changes including not requiring a court order for gathering foreign intelligence from overseas targets and providing liability protection for those aiding in intelligence collection efforts. The Protect America Act of 2007 was enacted to address concerns raised by the Director of National Intelligence regarding foreign intelligence collection efforts. A 15-day extension was passed to allow for further consideration of amending FISA, ensuring the intelligence community had necessary authority. The House rejected H.R. 5349 to extend the sunset provision by 21 days. Senate bills aim to extend the sunset to 210 days or July 1, 2009. The Protect America Act sunseted on February 16, 2008, with transitional provisions in place. Both the House and Senate passed bills for a longer-term statutory approach, including H.R. 3773, the RESTORE Act of 2007. On October 9, 2007, H.R. 3773 was referred to the House Judiciary Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. The bill was reported out of both committees with amendments on October 12, 2007. On November 15, 2007, the House passed H.R. 3773. The FISA Amendment Act of 2007, S. 2248, was reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee by Senator Leahy with an amendment in the nature of a substitute. The motion to proceed with the measure was invoked by a vote of 76-10 after some debate. After breaking for the holidays, the Senate resumed activities on S. 2248 in January 2008. A modified version of the Senate Judiciary Committee's amendment was tabled, but Senator McConnell objected to considering the House-passed bill. Senator Rockefeller proposed an amendment to S. 2248, which faced a failed cloture motion by Senator McConnell. Several other amendments were proposed and considered before an agreement was reached on February 12th. On February 12, 2008, S.Amdt. 3911 to S. 2248 was agreed to by the Senate after a cloture motion. The bill was passed with amendments by a vote of 68-29. H.R. 3773 was then taken up, amended with the text of S. 2248, and passed by the Senate. The House Rules Committee reported H.Res. 1041 on March 12, 2008, which passed two days later. The House agreed to a House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 3773, the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, by a vote of 213-197. Negotiations are ongoing to resolve differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill. The House amendment to the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 includes provisions for surveillance targeting individuals believed to be outside the United States, with approval required from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. The House bill amends the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 to require approval from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court for surveillance targeting non-U.S. persons outside the United States. The FISC has 30 days to review certifications, targeting procedures, and minimization procedures before approving or denying an acquisition order. The Attorney General, in consultation with the DNI, must adopt guidelines for compliance with the bill's limitations and submit them to relevant committees. If the FISC finds the certification and procedures satisfactory, it will approve the use of surveillance. The FISC must approve certifications and procedures for surveillance under the Fourth Amendment. In non-emergency situations, deficiencies must be corrected before the order is approved. In emergency situations, the Attorney General and DNI can authorize surveillance temporarily, with FISC review required within seven days. The FISC must approve certifications and procedures for surveillance under the Fourth Amendment. In non-emergency situations, deficiencies must be corrected within 30 days or cease the acquisition. The Senate bill does not require prior approval by the FISC for certain procedures, instead requiring submission within five days. In emergency situations, the Attorney General and DNI can prepare certifications for immediate action. The Senate bill mandates the Attorney General and DNI to certify surveillance procedures within seven days. If the FISC approves, surveillance can continue; if not, corrections must be made within 30 days or cease. The House clarifies that certain acquisitions do not require FISA applications for non-U.S. persons outside the U.S. The House bill clarifies that certain acquisitions of non-U.S. persons outside the U.S. do not require FISA applications. Both bills allow for targeting of U.S. persons outside the U.S. for up to 90 days with FISC approval, and require notice and application for emergency authorizations. The acquisition authorized by the Attorney General on an emergency basis would terminate when the information is obtained, denied by the court, or after seven days. Without a FISC order, no information acquired can be used in proceedings unless the target is not a U.S. person. Information concerning a U.S. person from the acquisition cannot be used without consent, except in cases of threat with approval from the Attorney General. The House and Senate bills differ in language regarding these provisions. The House and Senate bills differ in language emphasizing the exclusivity of FISA for electronic surveillance. The House amendment adds a new section to FISA, stating that FISA procedures are the exclusive means for surveillance, except with express statutory authorization. The Senate amendment also emphasizes FISA as the exclusive means for electronic surveillance. Both the House and Senate bills aim to expand the definition of \"foreign power\" and \"agent of a foreign power\" under FISA to address groups or individuals involved in international proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. They also allow federal officers conducting surveillance to consult with law enforcement to investigate such activities. The House and Senate bills differ in their treatment of electronic communication service providers who assisted the government with warrantless electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence purposes between September 11, 2001, and January 17, 2007. The Senate's version includes retroactive immunity for providers meeting certain criteria, while the House measure does not provide retroactive immunity for assistance in connection with the Terrorist Surveillance Program or other intelligence activities post-9/11. The House amendment allows for court examination of state secrets privilege in civil actions against electronic communications service providers post-9/11. It also includes an audit of the Terrorist Surveillance Program. The Senate amendment does not have similar provisions. The House bill includes provisions for court examination of state secrets privilege in civil actions against electronic communications service providers post-9/11 and an audit of the Terrorist Surveillance Program. It also establishes a Commission on Warrantless Electronic Surveillance and provides additional manpower and training for FISC applications. The Senate Amendment to H.R. 3773 does not address these issues. The curr_chunk discusses the definition of \"foreign power\" and \"agent of a foreign power\" as outlined in title I of FISA. It includes various criteria such as foreign governments, factions of foreign nations, groups engaged in international terrorism, and entities directed and controlled by foreign governments. The curr_chunk defines individuals who may be considered agents of a foreign power under FISA, including those who engage in clandestine intelligence activities or international terrorism. Individuals who may be considered agents of a foreign power under FISA engage in clandestine intelligence activities, sabotage, international terrorism, false identities, aiding or abetting, or conspiring with others. \"International terrorism\" involves violent or life-threatening acts that violate criminal laws. The curr_chunk defines \"sabotage\" as activities violating certain laws and \"foreign intelligence information\" as data related to foreign activities. The curr_chunk defines \"foreign intelligence information\" as data necessary for the protection of the United States against attacks, terrorism, and clandestine activities by foreign powers or their agents. It also defines \"electronic surveillance\" as the acquisition of wire or radio communications through surveillance devices. The curr_chunk discusses the acquisition of wire or radio communications of a particular United States person in the United States without consent, under circumstances where privacy is expected and a warrant would be required for law enforcement purposes. The curr_chunk discusses the use of surveillance devices to acquire information from wire or radio communications in the United States under circumstances where privacy is expected and a warrant would be required for law enforcement purposes. The curr_chunk discusses the minimization procedures for electronic surveillance under section 507A of title 28, United States Code, focusing on the acquisition, retention, and dissemination of nonpublicly available information concerning unconsenting United States persons. The curr_chunk discusses procedures for the retention and dissemination of information related to crimes for law enforcement purposes, as well as restrictions on disclosing communication contents involving a United States person in electronic surveillance. The curr_chunk defines \"United States\" as areas under US territorial sovereignty and \"aggrieved person\" as the target of electronic surveillance. It also explains that a \"wire communication\" is any communication carried by a wire, cable, or similar connection. The curr_chunk further defines \"Person\" as any individual or entity, \"Contents\" as information related to a communication, and \"State\" as any US state or territory."
