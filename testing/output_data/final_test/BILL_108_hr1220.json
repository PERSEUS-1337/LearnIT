    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Anti-Pyramid Promotional Scheme Act of 2003\". It includes findings related to pyramid promotional schemes. The Congress finds that pyramid promotional schemes, chain letters, and related schemes are deceptive enterprises that threaten the financial well-being of citizens, especially with the global reach of the Internet. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals made an error in defining a pyramid promotional scheme in Webster v. Omnitrition Int'l, Inc. (79 F.3d 776; 9th Cir. 1996). SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act, an \"appropriate inventory repurchase program\" refers to a plan or operation that repurchases current and marketable inventory from participants upon termination of their business relationship, based on commercially reasonable terms. The program must be clearly described in recruiting literature, sales manuals, or contracts, including how the repurchase is exercised and disclosure of ineligible inventory. The term \"reasonable terms\" refers to repurchasing inventory within 12 months at not less than 90% of the original cost. \"Compensation\" is any payment of value, and \"consideration\" excludes certain purchases like goods for resale. The term \"current and marketable\" refers to inventory that is unopened, unused, and within its reasonable use or shelf-life period for goods, or the unexpired portion of any contract for services and intangible property. It does not include inventory that has been clearly described. Inventory includes goods and services like promotional materials, sales aids, and sales kits that independent salespersons must buy. Inventory loading is when salespersons are pushed to buy more than they can sell or use in a reasonable time. A participant in a plan or operation can be an individual, corporation, partnership, or organization. Promoting involves inducing others to join a scheme. A pyramid promotional scheme focuses on recruiting participants rather than selling goods or services. SEC. 4. RULES TO PROHIBIT OPERATING PYRAMID PROMOTIONAL SCHEME. The Federal Trade Commission must create a rule within a year of this Act's enactment, making it unfair or deceptive to promote pyramid schemes through interstate or foreign commerce. This rule does not prohibit compensation based on purchases in legitimate plans. Compensation in legitimate plans is based on purchases of goods, services, or intangible property for personal use, consumption, or resale, without promoting inventory loading and with an appropriate inventory repurchase program. SEC. 5. STATE ENFORCEMENT. State officials can take action in State court for violations of State laws. The attorney general of any State can bring action in federal court to stop pyramid schemes and obtain relief for residents of that State or territory. Federal officials can seek relief for residents of all States and territories. The court can grant temporary restraining orders, preliminary or permanent injunctions, or other appropriate relief on behalf of residents of all States and territories. SEC. 6. NO LIMITATION ON OTHER FEDERAL CLAIMS. This Act does not restrict Federal officials from taking action against pyramid schemes for other violations of Federal law."
