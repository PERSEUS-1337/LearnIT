    "content": "The NLRA grants the right to engage in collective bargaining to \"employees\" but not to supervisors. A supervisor is defined as an individual with authority over specific functions that require independent judgment, not just based on job title. The NLRA defines a supervisor as someone with authority over functions requiring independent judgment. The NLRB and U.S. Supreme Court have interpreted this definition in cases like NLRB v. Kentucky River Community Care, Inc. where professional or technical training was considered in determining supervisor status. The NLRB concluded that nurses were not supervisors as they lacked sufficient independent judgment. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit disagreed with the NLRB's position, affirming a three-part test for determining supervisory status. In Kentucky River case, the Court disagreed with the NLRB's definition of independent judgment for supervisors, stating that it was too restrictive and could eliminate supervisors from the NLRA. The Court disagreed with the NLRB's definition of independent judgment for supervisors, stating that it was too restrictive. The Court indicated that when an employee exercises functions with sufficient independence, the NLRB typically finds supervisory status. Four justices dissented, arguing that the NLRB's interpretation was rational and consistent with the NLRA. In 2006, the NLRB revisited the issue of supervisory status in Oakwood Healthcare, Inc. Oakwood Healthcare, Inc. employed around 181 RNs in 10 patient care units at an acute care hospital, with many serving as charge nurses responsible for overseeing their units. The NLRB aimed to define terms like \"assign,\" \"responsibly direct,\" and \"independent judgment\" in relation to the charge nurses' supervisory status. The NLRB defined terms like \"assign\" and \"responsibly direct\" in relation to charge nurses' supervisory status, considering legislative history and Supreme Court precedent. \"Assign\" refers to designating employees to places or tasks, while \"responsibly direct\" applies to overseeing work performed. The NLRB defined \"responsibly direct\" as overseeing work and being held accountable for the performance of tasks by others. Accountability includes having the authority to direct work, take corrective action, and face adverse consequences for improper task performance. The NLRB clarified that for a supervisor to exercise \"independent judgment,\" they must make decisions free from external control, not dictated by company policies or higher authorities. If choices are obvious or based on workload equalization, they are considered routine and not requiring independent judgment. The NLRB determined that 12 permanent charge nurses were supervisors under the NLRA, as they assigned employees but did not responsibly direct them. The nurses made assignments based on workload equalization, not independent judgment. The NLRB found that charge nurses at Oakwood Healthcare exercised independent judgment in assigning nursing personnel based on skill, experience, and patient needs, despite following a written policy for assignments. The NLRB determined that charge nurses at Oakwood Healthcare used independent judgment in assigning nursing personnel based on skill, experience, and patient needs, despite following a written policy. The NLRA prohibits interference with employees' rights to engage in collective bargaining. In Capital Service, Inc. v. NLRB, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit noted that section 8(b)(1)(A) is seen as a counterpart to section 8(a)(1), with both sections having the same standard for determining unfair labor practices. The focus is on whether the misconduct \"reasonably tends\" to restrain or coerce employees, regardless of the actual effect. Courts have emphasized that the actual effect of misconduct is immaterial. In Int'l Union of Operating Engineers, AFL-CIO v. NLRB, the Third Circuit stated that coercion and intimidation are not determined by the effectiveness of the misconduct. Section 8(a)(1) of the NLRA prohibits violence or threats against employees for exercising their rights, including verbal threats affecting employment. The Supreme Court in NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., Inc. clarified that employers can communicate their views on unionism as long as there are no threats or promises of benefit. Employers can communicate their views on unionization as long as there are no threats or promises of benefit. The legality of employer communication is determined by the totality of the circumstances and the economic dependence of employees on their employers. Interrogating employees about union sympathy may also be considered unlawful. Employers interrogating employees about union sympathy may violate labor laws, as it can instill fear of discrimination. Factors considered include timing, place, information sought, interrogator's identity, and employer's preference. Violations were found when employees were interrogated after performance reviews despite resistance. The NLRB found violations related to unfair labor practices, including interrogation after performance reviews despite resistance by the employee. Other violations included using violence or threats by a union, encouraging employees to quit if not union members, and pressuring employees to sign union authorization cards. In one case, a local union engaged in misconduct to get non-members to leave their jobs at an Amoco refinery. The NLRB found that a local union engaged in coercive behavior towards non-members at an Amoco refinery, pressuring them to quit their jobs and volunteer for layoffs. This conduct was deemed a violation of section 8(b)(1)(A) which prohibits union actions threatening job security due to employees' refusal to join the union. Unions have been found to violate section 8(b)(1)(A) by engaging in misconduct such as pressuring employees to quit or be laid off for not joining, refusing to refer dissident members for jobs, and threatening job loss for contesting a union election. Employers can make antiunion speeches without allowing equal union reply, as long as they are noncoercive. The employer's premises are considered the natural forum for airing views, similar to how union halls are for unions. Unions are not unduly hindered by not being allowed to hold group meetings on employer premises, as they have other means of communication with employees. Last-minute speeches by employers before elections have been distinguished from other speeches. The NLRB prohibits employers from making election speeches on company time or holding massed assemblies of employees within 24 hours before an election, as it can unfairly influence the outcome. In NLRB v. Babcock & Wilson Co., the Court ruled that employers can restrict the distribution of union literature on company property if it does not impede employees' collective bargaining rights. In Babcock v. NLRB, the Court found that employers can restrict union literature distribution on company premises if other communication channels are available. However, if employees are beyond reasonable union communication reach, employers must allow union access. Lechmere v. NLRB reaffirmed this ruling, emphasizing the availability of alternative communication methods. The Court in Lechmere emphasized that union access to an employer's property is only required when employees are beyond reasonable communication reach. Logging camps, mining camps, and mountain resort hotels were cited as examples where access would be permitted. The union must prove employee isolation and show that no other reasonable means of communication exists. In this case, the Court found that the union had reasonable access to retail employees through mailings, phone calls, and home visits."
