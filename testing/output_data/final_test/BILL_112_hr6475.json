    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Digital Coast Act of 2012\". The lack of accurate geospatial information about the US coastal region is a liability for managing the environment, infrastructure, economy, and public safety. Over 153 million people currently live near the coast, with an additional 12 million expected in the next decade. Coastal counties have a higher population density than the national average. On a typical day, over 1,540 permits for single-family home construction are issued in coastal areas. The construction of single-family homes in coastal counties, along with other commercial and institutional construction, supports the population. Over half of the Nation's economic productivity is in coastal regions. Remote sensing and geospatial data are crucial for managing the coastal zone, including flood prediction and community resilience. The Digital Coast exemplifies effective Federal partnerships with local and State governments. Federal partnerships with various entities for effective collaboration. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Digital Coast is a constituent-driven effort to provide geospatial data and tools for coastal and emergency management. Remote sensing and other geospatial activities involve collecting and disseminating data on Earth's features and boundaries. The curr_chunk discusses airborne remote sensing data, lidar, and services provided by various professionals. It also defines terms like \"Secretary\" and \"State\" in the context of the United States. The curr_chunk defines terms related to coastal regions, including the definition of \"coastal region\" and \"Federal Geographic Data Committee.\" The curr_chunk focuses on building the digital coast. The Secretary will establish and implement the Digital Coast to collect priority coastal data for resource management constituents, including elevation, land use, habitat, parcels, and socioeconomic data. The focus is on filling data needs and gaps using remote sensing and geospatial data acquisition. The Secretary will make data and integrated products accessible via the Digital Coast and develop decision support tools using integrated data. Data will be documented to Federal Geographic Data Committee standards and raw data will be archived by NOAA. The Secretary will coordinate activities to maximize data sharing and integration with other Federal efforts, coastal States, local governments, and nongovernmental entities. The Secretary will coordinate with nongovernmental entities, establish standards for interoperability of geospatial data, coordinate with the Federal Geographic Data Committee, and utilize contracts for data sharing. The Secretary will utilize contracts with the private sector to collect remote sensing and geospatial data, considered as \"surveying and mapping\" services, in accordance with selection procedures in title 40, United States Code. SEC. 5. COASTAL SERVICES CENTERS. The Secretary will establish Coastal Services Centers within the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to support coastal and ocean decision-making, enhance capabilities of managers, and manage the Digital Coast program. The Secretary will manage the Digital Coast program, convene coastal managers for dialogues, and collaborate with various entities to provide data and tools. Financial agreements may be entered into with different governmental levels to support the implementation of the Act. The Secretary will collaborate with various entities to provide data and tools for the Digital Coast program. Registration fees may be collected to support training, workshops, and conferences related to the Act. Authorization of appropriations of $85,000,000 for each fiscal year from 2013 to 2018 is granted to the Secretary to implement the Act."
