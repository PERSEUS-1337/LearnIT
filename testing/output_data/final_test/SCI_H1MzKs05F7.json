    "content": "Neural networks have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial images, with imperceptible perturbations leading to different predictions. Adversarial vulnerability increases with the gradients of the training objective, growing as the square root of the input size for most network architectures. Convolutional Neural Networks have also been found to be vulnerable to adversarial examples, with imperceptible changes driving their performance down to chance level. Adversarial examples are small input changes causing large output variations due to large gradients of the neural network with respect to its inputs. The relationship between the gradient norm of the training objective and adversarial vulnerability is supported by theoretical and empirical arguments. Neural networks like CNNs and feed-forward networks are vulnerable to adversarial noise due to their large gradients with input dimension d. Experimental results support this vulnerability, and while some defense schemes exist, the focus is on explaining their effects through first-order analysis. Research is needed to design neural network architectures with smaller gradients to mitigate adversarial vulnerability. Adversarial examples are small modifications of images that fool classifiers into predicting different classes. They are related to large gradients in neural networks. Adversarial images are constructed by adding a perturbation to the original image within a certain norm. The focus is on imperceptible adversarial examples. Adversarial vulnerability is the probability of a successful attack on a classifier by perturbing the input image within a certain norm. Adversarial damage measures the decrease in accuracy after an attack, with the 0-1-loss damage being a lower bound for vulnerability. The decrease in accuracy after an attack is measured by adversarial damage, which serves as a lower bound for adversarial vulnerability. Evaluating adversarial vulnerability with L 0/1 -adversarial damage is tempting, but in practice, a smoother loss function like cross-entropy loss is used. The classifier is considered robust if a small adversarial perturbation results in only a small variation in the loss function. The dual norm plays a crucial role in adversarial noise, aligning with the coordinates of the loss function. Higher-order terms may dominate Taylor expansions for finite perturbations, but experiments suggest the first-order term is significant. Lemma 2 is proven by considering the relationship between p-norm and q-norm. The dual norm is important in adversarial attacks, with Lemma 2 showing that vulnerability depends on the attack norm, size, and the gradient of the loss function. First-order vulnerabilities are significant and can help protect against iterative attack methods. The vulnerability to adversarial attacks depends on the attack norm, size, and the expected dual norm of the loss function gradient. The choice of norm reflects sensitivity to image perturbations and the classifier's perception. The threshold should be based on the norm and input dimension, with the perturbation scaling with the input dimension. The vulnerability to adversarial attacks depends on the attack norm, size, and the expected dual norm of the loss function gradient. The threshold for p-attacks should be based on the norm and input dimension, with the perturbation scaling like d. In Section 3, the main contributions are discussed, including the estimation of Ex \u2202x Lq for standard feed-forward nets. Additionally, two defenses are briefly mentioned, and a new training objective is introduced based on the loss after an attack. The new loss introduced in this section, with a factor of 2, is related to a regularization scheme called double-backpropagation. It aims to decrease sensitivity to input perturbations to improve generalization, particularly against adversarial examples. Training with a specific norm helps protect against attacks, and experiments suggest it may also defend against other types of attacks. The new technique introduced is adversarially augmented training, which involves augmenting the training set with perturbations to maximize loss-increase locally. This method, first introduced as FGSM 1-augmented training, aims to improve generalization and defend against attacks. Adversarially augmented training involves penalizing the dual norm of the gradient with weight /2, akin to using a regularizer. This method aims to improve generalization and defend against attacks by training with perturbations. In this section, the analysis evaluates the size of \u2202 x L q for various neural network architectures, including fully-connected networks and CNNs. The gradient-norms are shown to be independent of network topology, with a focus on how changing q affects the size of \u2202 x L q. The vulnerability to adversarial attacks scales with the input-dimension d, and coefficients of \u2202 x L must grow slower than 1/d to be robust against attacks. The analysis evaluates the size of \u2202 x L q for different neural network architectures, showing that coefficients of \u2202 x L must grow slower than 1/d to be robust against attacks. The standard weight initialization scheme causes the average coordinate-size |\u2202 x L| to grow like 1/ \u221a d instead of 1/d, impacting adversarial vulnerability. The next theorems generalize the previous toy example to a wide class of feedforward nets with ReLU activation functions, including fully connected nets and convolutional layers. The proofs rely on a set of hypotheses regarding neuron behavior and weight characteristics. The next theorems generalize the previous toy example to a wide class of feedforward nets with ReLU activation functions, including fully connected nets and convolutional layers. The weights from different layers are independent and satisfy certain conditions at initialization, which may not hold after training. These assumptions are crucial for analyzing neural nets and have been widely used in prior work. Theorems in Section 4 generalize vulnerability of fully connected nets with ReLU activations. Networks are increasingly vulnerable to p-attacks with growing input-dimension, independent of network-topology. Symmetry assumption on neural connections is used for analysis. The symmetry assumption (S) states that all input nodes have the same path-degrees statistics to the output in fully connected networks, CNNs, and strided layers. Theorem 5 discusses the vulnerability of feedforward networks with linear connections and ReLU activation functions. The net's activation functions satisfy assumptions (H) and output logits fed to cross-entropy-loss L. If the net also satisfies symmetry assumption (S), Theorems 4 and 5 are proven in Appendix B. The main proof idea is that He-initialization compensates for the number of paths in the network, making the gradient norm independent of network topology. Corollary 6 shows vulnerability of CNNs with ReLU activations to attacks with growing input-resolution. The network gradient is dampened when strided layers are replaced by average poolings due to average-pooling weights not following the He-init assumption. Empirical verification of the first-order Taylor approximation is done in Section 4.1. Adversarial vulnerability and the average 1-norm of \u2202xL grow as predicted by Corollary 6. Adversarial vulnerability is approximated using attacks from the Foolbox package with an attack-threshold of size 0.005. The study investigates the impact of different regularization strengths on adversarial vulnerability in trained networks. Results show that protecting against one attack type also protects against others, and various methods achieve similar accuracy-vulnerability trade-offs. Multiple CNNs with the same architecture are trained on CIFAR-10 images using specific regularization values. The study explores the effect of different regularization strengths on adversarial vulnerability in trained networks. Results indicate that defending against one type of attack also defends against others, with various methods showing similar accuracy-vulnerability trade-offs. Multiple CNNs are trained on CIFAR-10 images with specific regularization values, utilizing methods such as penalization and adversarial augmentation. The validity of the first-order Taylor expansion in adversarial vulnerability is supported by various observations. The study examines the impact of different regularization strengths on adversarial vulnerability in trained networks. Results show that defending against one type of attack also defends against others, with similar accuracy-vulnerability trade-offs. Various CNNs are trained on CIFAR-10 images with specific regularization values, using methods like penalization and adversarial augmentation. The duality between adversarial-augmented training and regularization constants is illustrated, supporting the validity of the first-order Taylor expansion in adversarial vulnerability. The upper row plots confirm the rescaling of x-axis, showing equivalent accuracy-vulnerability trade-offs for different regularization methods. The L1 and L2 norms can be used interchangeably, indicating protection against various attacks. This suggests a duality between adversarial training and regularization constants in defending against attacks. The study confirms that penalizing \u2202 x L(x) 1 during training decreases E x \u2202 x L 1 and drives down E x \u2202 x L 2. Theorems predict linear growth of the average 1-norm of \u2202 x L with input dimension d, affecting adversarial vulnerability. CNNs were trained on upsampled CIFAR-10 images to test these predictions. The study shows that penalizing gradients during training reduces their norms and influences adversarial vulnerability. CNNs were trained on upsampled CIFAR-10 images to validate these findings. The network architecture included batchnorm, ReLU layers, max-pooling, and dilated convolutions. Experimental results suggest that neural networks tend to recover their prior gradient properties outside the training points. The experiments suggest that networks with high gradients are vulnerable, and traditional training methods do not address this issue. Robust training algorithms need to overcome these problematic priors, often using gradient penalization techniques. Despite advancements, current methods struggle to protect networks effectively, especially in generalizing to test data. This highlights the need for more data or simplifying model complexity when generalization fails. Large fully connected nets often fail to generalize to out-of-sample examples due to needing prohibitively many training points. Observations suggest that networks tend to recover their prior properties outside of training points, with large gradients. The evolution of gradient norms on training and test sets show a clear increase on the test set, indicating the need for more data or model complexity reduction when generalization fails. The text discusses the need for new architectures with smaller gradients to address adversarial vulnerability. It contrasts previous linear models with a theory that shows vulnerability increases like \u221ad, independent of architecture. The experiments confirm the idea that adjusting for weight dimension-dependence is crucial. The experiments confirm that neural networks are \"too linear-like\" and vulnerable to adversarial attacks due to the growing dimensionality of the architecture. Introducing average poolings with smaller weight sizes can increase vulnerability by providing more room for noise manipulation. This vulnerability is independent of the data's intrinsic dimensionality or geometry. The vulnerability of neural networks to small perturbations is linked to larger average perturbations, regardless of data dimensionality or geometry. Previous studies have connected adversarial vulnerability to large gradients of loss, but have not proposed explicit penalizers. Different approaches have been suggested for robustifying networks, such as double-backpropagation and gradient-penalties, but their connections to adversarial augmentation and FGSM remain unexplored in experiments. The comparison between gradient-regularization and adversarial-augmentation is essential to test the validity of the first-order Taylor expansion. BID9 introduced the cross-Lipschitz-penalty, focusing on adversarial vulnerability rather than damage, which offers better accuracy-to-vulnerability ratios. This penalty deals with one number, \u2206L, simplifying the process compared to other approaches involving all K. Theoretical guarantees involve all K logit-functions and their gradients. Contractive auto-encoders use penalizing network-gradients to regularize encoder-features. Adversarial training as a generalization method involves searching for parameters in a \"flat minimum region\" of the loss. Gradient regularization of generative models appears in Proposition 6 of Ollivier (2014). The gradient regularized objective is the first-order approximation of the robust training objective. The robust training objective is a first-order approximation that has a history in math, machine learning, and adversarial vulnerability. BID3 proposes new network architectures with small gradients by design. Adversarial vulnerability increases with the gradients of the loss, as shown by the relationship between gradient norms and vulnerability. Usual feed-forward nets are vulnerable to attacks with growing input dimension. The text discusses the vulnerability of neural networks to p-attacks with increasing input dimension. While usual training can mitigate this vulnerability during training, it persists on the test set. The suggestion is to either gather more data or explore architectures with naturally smaller gradients to bridge the generalization gap. The use of strided convolutions in CNNs does not offer protection against these attacks. The text explores the effectiveness of average-pooling layers in protecting against adversarial examples in neural networks. The use of strided convolutions does not provide defense, but replacing them with convolutions with stride 1 plus average-pooling may dampen input-to-output gradients and offer protection. Theorem 7 discusses the impact of average-pooling layers in a network architecture. The text discusses the impact of average-pooling layers in neural networks for defending against adversarial examples. Theorem 7 suggests replacing strided convolutions with convolutions with stride 1 followed by average-pooling to make networks more robust. Experimental results show improved robustness, although networks remain vulnerable compared to the theorem's suggestion. The experimental setup involved testing the impact of average-pooling layers on CNNs trained on CIFAR-10. Results showed that networks with average pooling layers were more robust to adversarial images compared to strided and max-pooling layers, but still more vulnerable than suggested by Theorem 7. The experimental results showed that networks with average pooling layers were more robust to adversarial images compared to strided architectures, but still more vulnerable than suggested by Theorem 7. The gradients after training were significantly higher than at initialization, indicating a violation of assumptions when using average-poolings instead of strided layers. Further investigations are needed to understand this phenomenon. The statistical properties of the logit gradients \u2202 x f k shape \u2202 x L. Let P(x, k) be the set of paths from input neuron x to output-logit k. The gradient \u2202 x f k is the sum of all path-products \u03c9 p whose path is active, i.e. \u2202 x f k (x) = p\u2208P(x,k) \u03c9 p \u03c3 p. Equation 8 demonstrates the statistical properties of the probability of an image belonging to a class according to the network. The cross-entropy loss is defined as L(x, c) = -log q_c(x), where c is the target class label. The gradients \u2202 x f_k(x) are shown to be K centered and uncorrelated variables, leading to the conclusion that \u2202 x L(x) is the sum of K uncorrelated variables with zero-mean. Equation 9 can be rewritten to show the norm of the gradients \u2202 x L(x). The norm of the gradients \u2202 x L(x) is controlled by the total error probability, indicating that reducing classification error is effective against adversarial examples. The computational graph of a neural network is identified as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to prove algebraic equalities, focusing on statistical weight-interactions. The proof involves reasoning on a random walk in a DAG, showing that the probability of reaching an input-node is 1. This is based on the sum of probabilities along paths, leading to an average probability of 1/d for each input. Lemma 9 states that under the symmetry assumption (S), the multiset D(x, o) is independent of x. This leads to a conclusion related to graphs and gradients using assumptions (H). Lemma 10 shows that under assumptions (H), path-products of distinct paths starting from the same node satisfy certain conditions. If a path includes a non-average-pooling weight, then the expected value of the path-product is 0. Theorem 5 is proven by showing the independence between ReLU killings and weights, using Lemmas 9 and 10. The gradient coordinates scale like 1/\u221ad and \u2202x o q like d. Lemma 8 can be used to show results even without the symmetry assumption (S). Theorem 11 states that for a feed-forward network with linear connections and ReLU activation functions, the output is independent of input-dimension d. If the network satisfies the symmetry assumption (S), additional properties hold. Theorem 11 states that for a feed-forward network with linear connections and ReLU activation functions, the output is independent of input-dimension d. If the network satisfies the symmetry assumption (S), additional properties hold. The average-pooling nodes have constant weights equal to 1/(in-degree) and disjoint input nodes. Lemma 10 and Lemma 9 show the relationship between path-products, leading to a minimal perturbation to fool the classifier. The Cross-Lipschitz Regularization introduces a method to fool the classifier by minimizing the gradient differences between classes. Unlike previous methods, it considers the interaction between classes and weights the summands based on class probabilities. The Cross-Lipschitz Regularization minimizes gradient differences between classes based on class probabilities to sharpen the margin. The threshold for an attack should scale with the dimensions, and the perturbation norm should maintain a signal-to-noise ratio. The threshold for an attack should scale with the dimensions, and the perturbation norm should maintain a signal-to-noise ratio. The inclusion of p-balls in 2-balls adjusts the threshold for varying p-attack norms, while decreasing image dimension keeps the average squared value of pixels unchanged. This explains how to adjust the threshold of a given p-norm when the dimension varies. The signal-to-noise ratio for different p-attacks depends on pixel-statistics of images. For p = 1 or \u221e, the situation is similar to p = 2. The threshold for attacks scales with dimensions, and perturbation norm maintains signal-to-noise ratio. Adjusting the threshold for p-attack norms involves including p-balls in 2-balls. The SNR of p-sized p-attacks on any input x will be equal to its fixed upper limit 1/. The mean SNR over samples x is the same (1/) for p = {1, 2, \u221e}. An experiment was conducted with a 12-class dataset of 80,000 3x256x256-sized RGB images. The experiment involved a 12-class dataset of 80,000 3x256x256-sized RGB images. After training, vulnerability and gradient norms increase like \u221ad. Using a 2-attack threshold of size 2 = 0.005 \u221ad and deep-fool attacks, the curves remain consistent across dimensions. In adversarially-augmented training, gradients can be backpropagated through the adversarial perturbation \u03b4, resulting in no significant difference compared to usual augmented training. This variant was tested on a 12-class dataset with consistent results across dimensions."
