    "content": "Existing attention mechanisms focus on individual items in a memory collection. Area attention proposes attending to a group of spatially or temporally adjacent items, allowing for varying granularity based on learned coherence. Area attention allows a model to focus on multiple areas in memory, improving performance in tasks like neural machine translation and image captioning. This novel concept is parameter-free and efficiently computed using summed area tables, enhancing accuracy in deep learning tasks. In recent architectures like Transformer, self-attention involves queries and memory from the same modality for either encoder or decoder. Each item in the memory has a key and value, where the key is used to compute the probability regarding how well the query matches the item. The output from querying the memory with the query is then calculated as the sum of all the values in the memory weighted by their probabilities. Area attention is proposed as a general alternative to item-based attention mechanisms in models like Transformer. It aims to address limitations in modeling complex attention distributions by allowing the model to focus on specific areas of the memory during training. In this paper, area attention is proposed as a mechanism for models to focus on structurally adjacent groups of items in memory. It allows for attention calculation at varying granularities, with each area containing one or more items. Area attention can be used in multi-head attention, leading to improved results compared to regular attention mechanisms in recent models. Recent studies show that area attention outperforms regular attention in various models for tasks like machine translation and image captioning. Different model architectures, such as LSTM seq2seq and encoder-decoder Transformer, have been explored. Item-grouping and segment-based approaches have been considered in language-specific tasks, with some works representing a sentence segment by comparing the encoding of the first and last tokens. The encoder captures contextual dependency of tokens using LSTM or Transformer. Area attention represents a segment as the mean of vectors without contextual dependency. A new method for calculating the mean of vectors in each area is proposed. Previous works focused on rich representations for segments in coreference resolution tasks. Area attention operates on encodings that have not captured contextual dependency between tokens. The proposed area attention method does not rely on contextual or dependency information in each item, unlike previous methods. Various approaches have been used to capture structures in attention calculation, such as modeling dependencies between items or encouraging attention on contiguous segments. In image captioning tasks, attention has been applied to object proposals and semantic concepts. The proposed area attention method allows a model to attend to information at varying granularity without the need for special networks or additional loss functions. It can be easily applied to existing single or multi-head attention mechanisms, enhancing Transformer architecture and achieving state-of-the-art results on various tasks. An area is defined as a group of structurally adjacent items in memory, and by incorporating area attention, the model can focus on sequential or temporally adjacent items. The proposed area attention method allows a model to attend to information at varying granularity without special networks or additional loss functions. An area is a group of structurally adjacent items in memory, allowing the model to focus on sequential or temporally adjacent items. In the 1-dimensional case, tasks like machine translation or sequence prediction are categorized, while in the 2-dimensional case, tasks like image captioning are considered. The model can form area memory by combining adjacent items in the sequence or any rectangular region in a grid. In the proposed area attention method, models can focus on information at varying granularity by defining areas as groups of adjacent items in memory. These areas can be generated by combining adjacent items in a sequence or forming rectangular regions in a grid. The number of areas that can be generated depends on the maximum size allowed for each area and the dimensions of the memory grid. Key and value are defined for each area to enable attention to specific information within the original memory. In the proposed area attention method, models define areas as groups of adjacent items in memory to focus on information at varying granularity. The key of an area is the mean vector of the key of each item in the area, while the value is the sum of all value vectors in the area. This allows for calculating attention without introducing any parameters to be learned. The proposed method defines areas as groups of adjacent items in memory to focus on information at varying granularity. Features such as standard deviation, height, and width of each area are considered, and a multi-layer perceptron is used to combine these features. Discrete values are projected onto a vector space using embedding, and a single-layer perceptron followed by a linear transformation is used to combine them. The proposed method defines areas in memory to focus on information at varying granularity. A nonlinear transformation is used, and a summed area table optimization technique is employed to reduce computational complexity. This technique is based on a pre-computed integral image and allows for constant time calculation of features in rectangular areas. The proposed method utilizes a 2-dimensional memory grid with a pre-computed integral image for efficient calculation of features in rectangular areas. This allows for quick computation of key values such as vector sum, mean, and standard deviation in constant time. The proposed method utilizes a 2-dimensional memory grid with a pre-computed integral image for efficient calculation of features in rectangular areas, including vector sum, mean, and standard deviation. The area attention was experimented on tasks like neural machine translation and image captioning, with Transformer showing state-of-the-art performance on certain translation tasks. The Transformer model achieved state-of-the-art performance on WMT 2014 English-to-German and English-to-French tasks. It heavily utilizes attention mechanisms and variations were explored to study the impact of area attention on the model. The Transformer model variations include Small, Base, and Big, with different hidden layer sizes and attention heads. Training batches consisted of approximately 32,000 tokens and were trained on 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs for 250,000 steps. Training times varied for different attention mechanisms. For the Big Transformer model, a smaller batch size of 16,000 tokens was used due to memory constraints. The model was trained for 600,000 steps with different attention mechanisms taking varying amounts of time per training step. Area attention was applied to each Transformer variation, improving performance across all models. The performance of Transformer Big with regular attention did not match the baseline due to differences in batch size and attention mechanisms used. Area attention with Transformer Big achieved BLEU 29.68 on EN-DE, surpassing the state-of-the-art result of 28.4. A 2-layer LSTM was used for both encoder and decoder, with multiplicative attention for encoder-decoder alignment. Different LSTM sizes and attention heads were explored to study the impact of area attention on translation tasks. LSTM's sequential computation makes it slower compared to Transformer. To improve GPU utilization, larger batch sizes were used for training LSTM models compared to Transformer. Models with 256 or 512 LSTM cells were trained for 50,000 steps with a batch size of approximately 160,000 tokens. For models with 1024 cells, a smaller batch size of around 128,000 tokens was used due to memory constraints, and the model was trained for 625,000 steps. Area attention consistently improved LSTM architectures similar to Transformer, with better performance in all conditions. The study compared Transformer and LSTM models for character-level translation tasks, finding that area attention consistently improved Transformer performance. The best BLEU score achieved was 34.81 for English-to-French translation. Area attention outperformed baselines in most conditions for English-to-French character-level translation tasks, showing more substantial improvement in smaller models. Image captioning involves using a deep architecture with an image encoder like ResNet and a language decoder like LSTM or Transformer. In image captioning, attention mechanisms play a crucial role in improving captioning quality. A champion condition in the experimental setup of BID13 achieved state-of-the-art results using pre-trained Inception-ResNet for image embeddings and Transformers for encoding and decoding. The experiment aims to explore how area attention, including self-attention and encoder-decoder attention, enhances captioning accuracy. The dimension of Transformer is 512 with 8 heads, and the maximum area size allowed is varied for investigation. The study explores the use of area attention in image captioning, varying the maximum area size for investigation. Models were trained on COCO dataset with 82K training images and tested on COCO40 and Flickr 1K test sets. Evaluation was based on CIDEr and ROUGE-L metrics for captioning accuracy. The study experimented with adding area attention of different maximum sizes to the image encoder self-attention and encoder-decoder attention layers. Models with area attention outperformed the benchmark on CIDEr and ROUGE-L metrics. The best results were achieved with 3x3 area attention, which added a small fraction of parameters compared to the benchmark model. In this paper, a novel attentional mechanism called area attention is introduced, allowing the model to attend to areas containing one or a group of items in memory. The size of an area can vary based on the coherence of adjacent items, enabling the model to attend to information at different granularities. Area attention contrasts with item-based attention mechanisms and was evaluated on two tasks. Area attention, a novel attentional mechanism, was evaluated on tasks like neural machine translation and image captioning using Transformer and LSTM models. State-of-the-art results were achieved on both tasks with area attention."
