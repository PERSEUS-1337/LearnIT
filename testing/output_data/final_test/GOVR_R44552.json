They were both part of the TPP until 2017. Relations have improved with naval visits and agreements like the Wellington and Washington Declarations. In November 2016, a U.S. naval ship visited New Zealand for the first time since 1983. Jacinda Ardern, at 37 years old, became the youngest female Prime Minister of New Zealand after the September 23, 2017 election. She leads a Labour-led coalition government following nine years of center-right rule. New Zealand has a population of approximately 4.5 million and shares values with the United States. The country was first settled by Polynesian-Maori people in the 10th century. In the 10th century, Dutch navigator Abel Tasman discovered the western coast of New Zealand. English Captain James Cook circumnavigated and mapped the islands in 1769, 1773, and 1777. The 1840 Treaty of Waitangi established relations between Maori and Pakeha communities. New Zealand granted women the right to vote in 1893, becoming the first country to do so. New Zealand gained Dominion status in 1907 and full independence from Britain in 1947. New Zealand gained full independence from Britain in 1947 and formed an alliance with Australia and the United States known as ANZUS. The country's demographic makeup includes a significant Maori and Pacific Islander population, with Auckland being the world's largest Polynesian city. Queen Elizabeth II is the constitutional head of state, with the Governor General acting on the advice of the Prime Minister's Cabinet. New Zealand is a unicameral, mixed-member-proportional (MMP), parliamentary democracy with approximately 120 seats in parliament. MMP was introduced in 1996 after a referendum in 1993. Under this system, parties winning at least one electorate seat or 5% of the party vote get seats in parliament. The National Party and Labour Party are the main political parties. Relations between the United States and New Zealand improved during former Prime Minister John Key's tenure. Under former National Party Prime Minister John Key (2008-2016), who resigned in 2016, New Zealanders were asked in March 2016 to choose whether to keep their current national flag, which includes Britain's Union Jack, or adopt a new flag without it. The referendum chose to keep the current flag, despite some advocating for a change to better reflect a multicultural and independent New Zealand. The Green Party's electoral performance has declined in recent elections, receiving 5.3% of the vote in 2005, 6.72% in 2008, and 11.06% in 2011 before dropping to 10.7% in 2014 and 6.3% in 2017. The Green Party's specific policy opposes New Zealand's involvement in US-led military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The 2017 election resulted in a coalition government led by Labour with support from the Green Party and New Zealand First. The center-left bloc holds 63 of 120 seats in parliament. Former Prime Minister Bill English became Opposition Leader. Ardern's government aims to tighten immigration and curb foreign property ownership. The government in New Zealand is expected to tighten immigration, curb foreign property ownership, raise the minimum wage, build affordable housing, address child poverty, aim for zero carbon emissions, and establish an independent climate commission. New Zealand First, led by Winston Peters, is part of the coalition government. Peters is known for his protectionist and conservative economic nationalist views, advocating for immigration curbs, trade deal renegotiation, central bank role adjustments, and stronger ties with Australia. Relations between the United States and New Zealand were strained in the mid-1980s due to differences over nuclear policy. New Zealand's nuclear-free legislation prohibited visits from nuclear-powered or nuclear-armed ships, leading the US to suspend alliance commitments. Despite these differences, the relationship has since improved, as seen with a US naval ship visit to New Zealand in 2016 to assist in evacuating civilians. The United States and New Zealand have strengthened their relationship in recent years, focusing on common interests and strategic objectives. They collaborate on promoting security and development in the South Pacific, including patrolling Exclusive Economic Zones to prevent threats.

They also engage in joint humanitarian and disaster relief exercises, as well as Antarctic scientific research. Several organizations and groups help promote bilateral ties between the two countries. The U.S.-N.Z. Council was established in 1986 to promote cooperation between the United States and New Zealand. The first New Zealand-United States Partnership Forum was held in April 2006 to advance bilateral relations. Foreign Minister Peters met with Secretary of State Tillerson in November 2017. In June 2017, residents of Wellington, New Zealand protested the Trump Administration's withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accords. New Zealand offered to take 150 refugees from an Australian detention center in Papua New Guinea, mostly from Afghanistan, Iran, Burma, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Syria. Australian Prime Minister Turnbull preferred to continue an existing arrangement negotiated with former President Obama, involving the relocation of asylum seekers to the United States in exchange for Australia accepting Central American refugees. Close defense cooperation between the United States and New Zealand dates back to World War II. During World War II, U.S. military personnel were stationed in New Zealand for battles against Japan. New Zealand later joined the ANZUS alliance in 1951 and the UKUSA Agreement in 1956, forming the \"Five Eyes\" alliance. The Government Communications Security Bureau in New Zealand handles intelligence cooperation and cybersecurity, ensuring the integrity of government information and analyzing cyber incidents. The GCSB in New Zealand handles intelligence cooperation, cybersecurity, and critical infrastructure. It has two communications interception stations and during the mid-1980s, the United States suspended its alliance commitments due to differences over nuclear policy. New Zealand legislation made the country nuclear-free, barring visits from nuclear-powered or nuclear-armed ships. In the mid-1980s, New Zealand distanced itself from nuclear weapons but maintained ties with the United States and the ANZUS alliance. A poll in 1987 showed that 70% of New Zealanders supported a ban on nuclear ships in their ports, while 66% wanted to remain allied with Australia and the United States. Bilateral defense relations improved after New Zealand's military contributions in Afghanistan and Iraq, demonstrating its value as a partner to the U.S. The early 2000s saw a significant improvement in relations when New Zealand sent special forces to Afghanistan and military engineers to support U.S.-led efforts. The Wellington Declaration of 2010 marked a significant turning point in United States-New Zealand relations, establishing a strategic partnership based on shared democratic values and common interests. It emphasized the importance of maintaining peace, prosperity, and stability in the region, promoting free trade, and protecting freedom, democracy, and human rights. The agreement reaffirmed close ties and outlined future cooperation and political dialogue. The agreement between the United States and New Zealand emphasized the need for enhanced regional and global cooperation on security, practical collaboration in the Pacific, and joint efforts on climate change and nuclear proliferation. Former President Obama praised New Zealand's role in international affairs, leading to the establishment of an annual strategic dialogue and the 2012 Washington Declaration on Defense Cooperation. The Wellington Declaration improved bilateral ties between the United States and New Zealand, with enhanced strategic dialogue and defense cooperation. Subsequent developments, such as the lifting of a ban on New Zealand naval ship visits to the United States in 2012, and joint military exercises against Islamist extremists, have strengthened their defense and security cooperation. The two nations share common objectives and participate in RIMPAC to build a peaceful Asia-Pacific region. The New Zealand navy ship will dock at Pearl Harbor Naval Base for the first time in over 30 years, symbolizing renewed engagement in mutual defense and security in the Asia-Pacific region. Former Secretary of Defense Hagel praised the bilateral defense relationship in 2014. A study suggested a restored alliance between the United States and New Zealand. The Strategic Dialogue in May 2015 covered cooperation on maritime security, ISIL counteraction, Trans-Pacific Partnership, Ocean health, and development efforts. New Zealand contributes to the global coalition against the Islamic State by deploying troops to train Iraqi soldiers in Taji, Iraq. The training includes weapons skills, combat operations, medical, and logistical skills. The mission has been extended through June 2018. United States Deputy Secretary of Defense Bob Work praised the ANZAC Spirit of New Zealand and Australian troops for their long history of serving together to ensure safety and security.

This independent defense policy contrasts with its historical support for Great Britain. New Zealand's defense policy has shifted towards international peace operations, maritime security, and cybersecurity. Approximately 140,000 New Zealand troops served in World War II, fighting in places like Crete, El Alamein, and the Pacific. They also fought alongside American and allied troops in Korea and Vietnam. New Zealand's 2016 Defense White Paper emphasizes protecting Southern Ocean resources, the South Pacific, and Antarctica. The 2016 Defense White Paper highlights challenges for the New Zealand Defence Force, including maintaining awareness in the Exclusive Economic Zone, supporting Antarctic operations, and addressing cyber threats. The paper also outlines a commitment to investing close to $20 billion in Defence capabilities over the next 15 years. Observers note that New Zealand's defense spending is lower compared to allies like Australia and the United States, with defense spending estimated at 1.1% of GDP in 2014. The 2016 Defense White Paper highlighted challenges for New Zealand's Defense Force, with defense spending at 1.1% of GDP in 2014 compared to 1.8% for Australia and 3.5% for the United States. The Public Consultation Document in 2015 described New Zealand's evolving strategic environment, noting growing interests beyond the region and increasing challenges to the international system. It also mentioned improved relations with the United States, China's rising global influence, and escalating military spending in Southeast Asia. New Zealand's relationship with the South Pacific is influenced by its population with Polynesian or Pacific Island backgrounds. It has the world's fourth-largest Exclusive Economic Zone and collaborates with Pacific Island states through the Pacific Islands Forum. The forum focuses on regional security, sustainable fisheries, and climate change. New Zealand works to combat Illegal, Unregulated, and Unreported (IUU) fishing in the region, estimated to be worth millions annually. It also plays a key role in promoting peace and stability in the South Pacific.

New Zealand has pledged to increase foreign assistance to the South Pacific by $100 million, reaching a total of $1 billion in expenditures over the next three years. China has also become a significant aid donor in the region, with much of its assistance in the form of concessional loans. China may soon overtake the United States as the second largest donor in the region. New Zealand has shown commitment to peace in the Pacific Island region through participation in operations like RAMSI in the Solomon Islands. They have also played a crucial role in stabilizing Timor-Leste after its independence from Indonesia. New Zealand's involvement in the Pacific Island region includes stabilizing Timor-Leste after its independence from Indonesia and facilitating peace in Bougainville. They responded to a call for international assistance in 2006 and currently have military and police personnel in Timor-Leste. New Zealand played a key role in peace efforts between the Government of Papua New Guinea and rebels on Bougainville. The Burnham I and II dialogues hosted by New Zealand were crucial in the Bougainville Peace Agreement of 2001, leading to a planned self-determination referendum by mid-2020. New Zealand, along with Australia, provided aid to Fiji after Cyclone Winston in 2016, marking a significant engagement since restoring diplomatic ties in 2014. Sanctions were imposed on Fiji by New Zealand and other nations after a government takeover in 2006. Fiji's Prime Minister Bainimarama implemented a \"Look North\" policy, strengthening relations with China. China has sent specialized vessels to Fiji for satellite tracking. Bainimarama suggested allowing China and Japan to join the Pacific Islands Forum. Other countries like India and Russia are also showing interest in Fiji, with India considering establishing a satellite monitoring station and Russia sending weapons and advisors for training.

Despite rising risks of conflict in the Asia Pacific region, the assessment remains cautiously optimistic due to economic incentives from global integration. The 2016 Defence White Paper emphasizes the central role of Asia in shifting global power dynamics, projecting Asia to surpass North America and Europe by 2030. By 2030, Asia is projected to exceed North America and Europe combined in global power, driven by China's sustained economic growth. China's expanding presence in Antarctica and the South Pacific is of interest to New Zealand. China is enhancing its research capabilities in Antarctica, leading to increased international activity in the region. Antarctica is becoming contested by new players like China, drawn by its resources. This has caught the attention of Wellington, as noted in the 2016 Defence White Paper. New Zealand's strong interest in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean is highlighted in the 2016 Defence White Paper. Despite the UK's shift in trade relationships, New Zealand has successfully diversified its export markets to include China, Australia, the EU, the US, and Japan.

New Zealand also backs efforts to limit global temperature rise and reduce emissions from livestock and rice production. In 2009, New Zealand formed the Global Research Alliance on Agricultural Greenhouse Gases to reduce emissions from livestock, cropping, and rice production. The Ardern Labour Government is expected to focus on environmental issues, following the past emphasis of the Labour Party. Former Prime Minister Helen Clark aimed for New Zealand to lead on climate change and be carbon neutral. Despite a 24.1% increase in gross emissions from 1990 to 2015, emissions were slightly lower in 2015 compared to 2014. Agriculture (47.9%) and energy (40.5%) were the main contributors to emissions in 2015. The New Zealand Green Party's support for the government will drive a progressive environmental agenda. The Labour Party's environmental policy focuses on water and climate change, with plans to restore rivers and lakes, assist farmers with waterway protection, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. They aim for net zero emissions by 2050 and have criticized the National Party's lack of a specific plan to reduce emissions. New Zealand has committed to reducing emissions by 30% below 2005 levels by 2030. The New Zealand Green Party has proposed initiatives such as a levy on nitrate pollution from agriculture and a 11-point Climate Protection Plan, including passing a Zero Carbon Act and planting 1.2 billion trees to reach net zero emissions by 2050.
