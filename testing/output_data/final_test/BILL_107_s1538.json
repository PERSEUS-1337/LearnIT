    "content": "The Act is titled the \"High Plains Groundwater Resource Conservation Act\" and its purpose is outlined in the findings and purposes section. The High Plains Aquifer, primarily the Ogallala Aquifer, has seen a significant decline in water table levels, especially in the Southern Ogallala Aquifer. Areas in Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas have experienced declines of over 100 feet from 1950 to 1997. The saturated thickness of the aquifer has also decreased by over 50 percent in some areas. The percentage of the High Plains Aquifer with a saturated thickness of 100 feet or more declined from 54 percent to 51 percent between 1980 and 1997. Decreased water levels in the aquifer, along with higher pumping costs, raise concerns about the long-term sustainability of irrigated agriculture in the region. Hydrological modeling by the US Geological Survey suggests that reductions in groundwater pumping at the farm or local level have limited impact on conserving the water table, creating a disincentive for water conservation measures. Incentives are needed to promote conservation efforts. The purpose of this Act is to promote groundwater conservation on the High Plains to extend the useable life of the High Plains Aquifer. Incentives are necessary for conservation efforts, and reliable information on aquifer recharge rates and water levels is crucial for policymakers and groundwater users. SEC. 3. HIGH PLAINS GROUNDWATER CONSERVATION ASSISTANCE. The Food Security Act of 1985 is amended to include a new section, SEC. 1240I, which establishes the HIGH PLAINS AQUIFER GROUNDWATER CONSERVATION INCENTIVES PROGRAM. In this section, definitions are provided for terms related to the High Plains Aquifer, including the High Plains, High Plains Aquifer, and High Plains Aquifer States. The High Plains Aquifer is a groundwater reserve located in several states. In fiscal years 2002 through 2011, the Secretary will offer cost-share payments, incentives, and technical assistance to producers who contract with the High Plains Aquifer Groundwater Conservation Incentives Program. The program aims to save groundwater resources per acre. Producers in areas with significant aquifer declines will have priority participation. The High Plains Aquifer Groundwater Conservation Incentives Program offers cost-share payments to producers implementing structural and land management practices to save groundwater resources per acre. Eligible practices include improving irrigation systems, purchasing new equipment, converting acreage to dryland production, and modifying cropping patterns. The High Plains Aquifer Groundwater Conservation Incentives Program offers incentive payments for producers who implement practices to save groundwater resources per acre. Contracts can cover structural or land management practices for a term of 3 to 10 years. The Secretary will establish a selection process for applications for financial assistance for structural practices that offer similar groundwater conservation benefits. The process will consider cost projections and other factors to minimize program costs and maximize conservation benefits. The Secretary will establish a selection process for applications for financial assistance for structural practices that offer groundwater conservation benefits. Producers must obtain the owner's approval if they are tenants. Incentive payments will be awarded for land management practices, with cost-share payments not exceeding 50% of the projected cost of the practice. The Secretary determines projected costs for land management practices and provides incentive payments to encourage producers. Payments are made if there will be a net savings in groundwater resources. The Secretary can modify or terminate contracts if needed. The Secretary can modify or terminate contracts if the producer agrees or if it is in the public interest. The Secretary may also terminate a contract if the producer violates it. Producers must implement agreed practices and comply with additional conditions to receive payments. The Secretary is responsible for providing payments and assistance. The Secretary provides cost-share or incentive payments for implementing conservation practices. There is a limit of $50,000 for cost-share payments per producer under multi-year contracts. The Secretary sets a limit on incentive payments to maximize groundwater conservation. Financial and technical assistance, including planning assistance, is provided for High Plains groundwater conservation. Financial and technical assistance, including engineering design, is provided to States, tribes, counties, and conservation districts for developing groundwater conservation plans in the High Plains. Federal funding for each plan is capped at 50% of the total cost, with a maximum of $50,000 for planning in any one political subdivision. State administration is required for approval of assistance to High Plains Aquifer States. The Secretary may provide annual funding to Plains Aquifer States for groundwater conservation plans. Plans must achieve significant water savings from the High Plains Aquifer to be certified. The Secretary may provide annual funding to Plains Aquifer States for groundwater conservation plans that must cover a sufficient area, set goals, identify measures, define a plan of action, include an annual evaluation process, and allow for plan modification if goals are not met. The Conservation Reserve Program Enhancement allocates funds from the Commodity Credit Corporation to support groundwater conservation plans in Plains Aquifer States, with specific funding amounts designated for fiscal years 2002 through 2011. Eligible lands can earn bid points for significant per acre savings of groundwater resources if removed from agricultural production. The Conservation Reserve Program Enhancement allocates funds to support groundwater conservation plans in Plains Aquifer States. Eligible lands can earn bid points for significant per acre savings of groundwater resources. Authorization of appropriations is granted to carry out the provisions of this Act."
