    "content": "In December 2014, Congress passed the Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation Act of 2014 (RAMIA), which established a Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NMI) program within the Commerce Department's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). President Obama signed the bill into law on December 16, 2014, after proposing the concept in his FY2013 budget. In March 2012, President Obama proposed the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI) with $1 billion in funding. In 2013 and 2014, he renewed his call for the NNMI in his budget requests. Bills were introduced in 2013 to establish a Network for Manufacturing Innovation, with H.R. 2996 passing the House in 2014. In August 2014, S. 1468 was reported by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. In December 2014, provisions of H.R. 2996 were included in the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 (P.L. 113-235) as Title VII of Division B, the Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation Act of 2014 (RAMIA). RAMIA, signed into law by President Obama on December 16, 2014, establishes a Network for Manufacturing Innovation, amending the National Institute of Standards and Technology Act. The Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation Act of 2014 aims to enhance U.S. manufacturing competitiveness, promote advanced manufacturing research and technology, support workforce development, and create jobs. It directs the Secretary of Commerce to establish a Network for Manufacturing Innovation. The Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation Act of 2014 aims to create jobs by establishing a Network for Manufacturing Innovation program. This program supports centers for manufacturing innovation that focus on advanced manufacturing challenges and technologies to retain or expand industrial production in the United States. The curr_chunk discusses the potential of advanced manufacturing methodologies and technologies to enhance U.S. manufacturing competitiveness and drive investment in production capacity. It emphasizes the importance of collaboration among various industrial entities, research institutions, and government entities to promote innovation and technology commercialization. The act authorizes activities of a center to include research, development, and demonstration projects to reduce the cost, time, and risk of commercializing new technologies and improvements in existing technologies, processes, products, and research and development of materials to solve precompetitive industrial problems with economic or national security implications. The act authorizes activities of manufacturing centers, including research, development, and demonstration projects to commercialize new technologies and improve existing ones. It allows existing manufacturing centers to be classified as centers for manufacturing innovation. President Obama initiated the establishment of several centers prior to the enactment of RAMIA. The Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation Act of 2014 recognizes manufacturing centers under Federal law or executive actions. The National Additive Manufacturing Innovation Institute (NAMII) is led by the Department of Defense (DOD) and other federal agencies are involved in establishing manufacturing centers. The Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation Act of 2014 recognizes manufacturing centers under Federal law or executive actions, including centers led by the Department of Defense (DOD) and other federal agencies. These centers, such as the Digital Manufacturing and Design Innovation Institute, Lightweight and Modern Metals Manufacturing Innovation Institute, and others, may be considered for inclusion in the Network for Manufacturing Innovation. The Secretary of Commerce is authorized to award financial assistance for planning, establishing, or supporting manufacturing centers. The Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation Act of 2014 authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to award financial assistance for planning, establishing, or supporting manufacturing centers. The act requires an open and competitive process for soliciting applications, peer review by a diverse group of individuals, and a conflict of interest policy to ensure transparency and accountability in the selection process. The Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation Act of 2014 authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to award financial assistance for manufacturing centers based on merit and performance measures. The selection process involves collaboration with federal departments and agencies, considering the potential for advancing domestic manufacturing and economic impact. The Center for Manufacturing Innovation focuses on financial support from non-federal sources to promote a sustainable business model without long-term federal funding. It aims to increase non-federal investment in advanced manufacturing research, engage with small and medium-sized enterprises, carry out educational activities, and advance economic competitiveness in the United States. The Center for Manufacturing Innovation aims to enhance economic competitiveness in the United States by focusing on novel manufacturing processes, materials, technologies, and supply chain integration. It also emphasizes leveraging regional assets and promoting education and training for veterans and individuals with disabilities. RAMIA includes provisions for center funding, limiting financial assistance to seven years after initial award and total federal assistance awarded. The Secretary of Commerce may make exceptions for centers exceeding 50% federal funding under RAMIA. Preference is given to centers seeking less federal share. Funding decreases each subsequent year, with exceptions for centers meeting goals and identifying non-federal funding sources. NIST can use $5 million per year for FY2015-FY2024 from Industrial Technology Services account for Network for Manufacturing. The RAMIA act authorizes the Department of Energy to transfer up to $250 million to NIST for the Network for Manufacturing Innovation program. The Secretary of Commerce can accept funds and resources from covered entities for the program. A National Program Office within NIST will oversee the program's planning, management, and coordination. The RAMIA act authorizes the Department of Energy to transfer up to $250 million to NIST for the Network for Manufacturing Innovation program. The program aims to collaborate with federal departments and agencies involved in advanced manufacturing, develop a strategic plan, establish cooperation procedures, and incorporate the NIST Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership for small and medium-sized entities. The RAMIA act directs the Secretary of Commerce to establish a clearinghouse of public information related to the program, solicit recommendations from stakeholders, and transmit the strategic plan to relevant committees. Federal government employees can be detailed to the National Program Office without reimbursement or loss of civil service status. RAMIA requires reports and audits for the NMI program, including annual reports from recipients of federal assistance detailing finances and performance. The Secretary of Commerce must report annually to Congress on program performance until December 31, 2024. The RAMIA requires the Comptroller General of the United States to conduct assessments of the NMI program every two years, covering the program's success and a final assessment by December 31, 2024. Each assessment includes a review of program management, coordination, and industry utility. The Comptroller General assesses the NMI program every two years, reviewing management, coordination, and industry utility. Recommendations for legislative and administrative action are provided to improve the program. The Secretary of Commerce is authorized to appoint personnel, enter contracts, and transfer funds to other federal agencies for program implementation. RAMIA allows funds to be used for program implementation, transfer of funds to agencies for financial assistance awards, and use of resources from covered entities. It also applies the provisions of the Bayh-Dole Act to funding agreements for new or existing centers. The Bayh-Dole Act of 1980, also known as the University and Small Business Patent Procedures Act, establishes the NMI program and addresses policy issues related to federal government support for technological innovation. There is a debate on the appropriate role of the government in fostering innovation, ranging from a hands-off approach to targeted investments in technologies and industries. Support for federal funding decreases as technologies move towards commercialization. The debate over federal support for technological innovation intensifies as technology advances towards commercialization. Advocates argue for a strong federal role citing economic, national security, and societal benefits, while critics raise concerns about government intervention skewing technology development and competition. The NMI program focuses on advanced manufacturing research and innovation, with differing views on government intervention in technology development. Critics argue it may lead to inefficient capital allocation and corporate welfare, while others prefer a technology-neutral approach like reducing taxes and regulations to support manufacturers. Analysts have varying opinions on the health of the U.S. manufacturing sector. Some analysts question the need for the Network for Manufacturing Innovation program, expressing concerns about the risk of \"hollowing-out\" of U.S. manufacturing due to companies moving production offshore and other nations' efforts to attract manufacturing operations. The need for a National Network for Manufacturing Innovation program is supported by factors such as tax holidays, worker training incentives, market access, and access to rare earth minerals. U.S. manufacturing employment has been on a decades-long declining trend, with a significant drop from 2001 to 2010. The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation highlights the importance of addressing technology and talent issues in U.S. manufacturing competitiveness through an NMI-like federal program. Innovations from firm investments can benefit competitors, leading to underinvestment in manufacturing R&D. Market failures like large capital investments and training costs hinder scaling up manufacturing processes. Foreign governments use policies to attract manufacturing firms, while the federal government provides minimal support for U.S.-based manufacturing research. The U.S. lacks support for manufacturing-focused research activities, with funding scattered among agencies. Academia prioritizes originality over engineering advances. Some analysts view the manufacturing sector positively, citing growth in output and productivity. Manufacturing employment grew by 707,000 jobs between 2010 and 2014. Many analysts attribute U.S. manufacturing job losses to global trends like technology-driven productivity improvements, capital-labor substitution, offshoring, and foreign competition. Some believe the NMI program is unnecessary, arguing that the private sector should handle it and the government shouldn't favor specific industries. Some may question the effectiveness of the NMI program, suggesting funds be used for other manufacturing support or deficit reduction. Concerns include duplication of existing federal programs and fragmentation of efforts to help manufacturers. There are doubts about the impact of additional federal funding on innovation and the ability of the manufacturing base to absorb it. Some advocate for increased federal funding for manufacturing R&D and a more direct role for the government. In a July 2014 Wall Street Journal article, former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers argued that the loss of manufacturing jobs is inevitable due to technology and market forces, similar to the earlier loss of agricultural jobs. Summers emphasized the need to focus on providing good jobs in the future rather than just increasing production. Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers argued that government policies should adapt to the information age. The NMI appropriations in P.L. 113-235 are relatively small but could pave the way for future funding increases. The act allows the Secretary of Commerce to use up to $5 million for the NMI program from the NIST Industrial Technology Services account, contingent on annual appropriations. The NMI program's funding from the NIST ITS account depends on annual appropriations, subject to congressional prioritization and restrictions. In FY2015, $138.1 million was appropriated, with $130.0 million for the Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership and $8.1 million for NIST's Advanced Manufacturing Technology Consortia program. Congress did not provide explicit funding for the NMI in FY2015. For FY2016, Congress may increase funding for the ITS account to support the NMI program, reduce funding for existing programs, or leave the decision to NIST. The NMI program's funding from the NIST ITS account depends on annual appropriations and the Department of Energy's authority to transfer funds to NIST. The availability of funds for the NMI program may be subject to prioritization and restrictions, and the Secretary has the authority to accept funds, services, and equipment for the program. The Secretary has the authority to accept funds, services, equipment, personnel, and facilities from any covered entity to fund the program. The allocation of funds from NIST, DOE, or other agencies for program management activities or centers is not specified. The act authorizes the establishment of centers for manufacturing innovation and a network of these centers, with the National Program Office designated as a convener. However, the purpose, federal role, and activities of the network are not specified. Congress may consider amending the act to clarify these points. Congress may consider amending the act to clarify points regarding the National Manufacturing Innovation (NMI) program, which is authorized through FY2024. The Comptroller General of the United States is required to make a final assessment by December 31, 2024. There are no specifications for a federal role after FY2024, so Congress may decide whether to continue the NMI or let it expire. Oversight hearings may be conducted to ensure the program is operating as intended, including funding, interagency cooperation, center establishment, and integration with existing federal manufacturing activities."
