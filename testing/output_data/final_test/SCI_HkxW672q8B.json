    "content": "Rectified linear units (ReLUs) are popular activation functions for neural networks. This paper focuses on learning a generative model with nonlinearity modeled by ReLU functions. The goal is to learn network parameters under a specific model, showing that the column space of the matrix can be recovered with an error of O(d) under certain conditions on the distribution of the bias vector. ReLU(X) is a matrix obtained by applying the ReLU function on each coordinate of matrix X. ReLUs are key in deep neural networks for faster training. Signal vectors in Y can be images, speech signals, etc., approximated by a map g : R k \u2192 R d. This paper focuses on a specific model with a single layer ReLU-network. The paper discusses a specific model with a single layer ReLU-network, focusing on learning network parameters under a generative model. It aims to recover the model parameters from observations and latent vectors, with the bias vector being random. This problem is related to dictionary-learning. The paper explores learning network parameters for a single-layer ReLU-network in a generative model context. It addresses recovering model parameters from observations and latent vectors, with a random bias vector. This problem is related to dictionary-learning and aims to provide theoretical guarantees for single-layer networks. The unsupervised problem of learning latent vectors was recently studied with random Gaussian vectors. Different approaches like autoencoders and generative adversarial networks (GAN) have been used to solve this problem. A new method proposed in the paper is seen as an alternative to GANs and focuses on isolated 'decoder' learning. The problem is similar to matrix completion, where the task is to recover unknown entries by exploiting prior knowledge. The text discusses learning latent vectors using random Gaussian vectors and a new method focusing on isolated 'decoder' learning as an alternative to GANs. It involves matrix completion to recover unknown entries with prior knowledge about matrix M and observation vectors represented as M = AC. The bias in the model is random for each coordinate but consistent across different signal vectors. The weight matrix A is learned from the observation matrix Y using a network that maps a latent vector to a signal vector. In the context of learning latent vectors and isolated 'decoder' learning, the text discusses matrix completion to recover unknown entries in matrix M = AC. The challenge lies in estimating a low-rank matrix from partial observations, where the randomness of bias affects the observation process. Existing matrix completion methods are not directly applicable due to this unique observation mechanism. Our method for matrix completion guarantees the recovery of matrix AC from Y with a limited error, despite differences in observation models compared to existing methods. Our method guarantees the recovery of matrix AC from Y with limited error using matrix perturbation results. We aim to extend this technique to multi-layer networks, although rigorous guarantees for parameter learning in this context are currently lacking. The text discusses the challenges of obtaining provable guarantees for parameter learning in multi-layer networks. It focuses on estimating matrix M from observation matrix Y and defines sets of matrices based on certain observations. The text also mentions probability density functions and log-likelihood in the context of observing Y given X. The text discusses recovering matrix M from observation matrix Y using a specific program. It defines parameters like \u03c9 p, flatness, and Lipschitz associated with a function. The program's performance is characterized in Theorem 1, assuming certain conditions are met with probability at least 1 \u2212 C 0. The text discusses recovering matrix M from observation matrix Y using a specific program. The proof of Theorem 1 is omitted due to page limit. It involves showing properties of the observation matrix Y and bounding the right-hand side using standard techniques. The recovered matrix M is denoted as M = M + E, where E is a perturbation matrix with bounded Frobenius norm. The text discusses recovering parameters of a single-layer ReLU network by solving for matrix A given M = M + E = AC + E. Using matrix-perturbation theory, it is shown that the column space of A can be recovered within an error of O(d) in Frobenius norm. Future directions include extending the method to multi-layer networks. The text discusses recovering parameters of a single-layer ReLU network using matrix completion techniques. Recovery is guaranteed only up to a Frobenius norm error, creating challenges in handling dense bounded norm noise. Coherence conditions on the matrix parameters are necessary for successful recovery in multi-layer networks. Recovery of parameters in multi-layer networks requires an algorithm resilient to dense noise and unique factorization of matrices. Additional assumptions can simplify the factorization process, especially with structured matrices like those in ReLU networks. Analytical success with two layers would pave the way for extending the process to multiple layers."
