    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature in California recognizes the importance of protecting service animals and clarifying the use of \"support\" animals in rental housing. They aim to provide guidance to landlords and tenants on including support animals in residential leases, distinguishing them from service animals and pets, and ensuring they are not excluded by \"no pets\" policies. This is outlined in Section 1941.7 of the Civil Code. Section 1941.7 of the Civil Code in California outlines conditions for tenants with support animals in rental housing. Tenants must notify and get approval from the landlord, ensure the animal is housebroken, does not disturb other tenants, and does not affect insurance availability or price. If these conditions are met, tenants cannot be prohibited from having a support animal on the premises. If a residential lease includes specified conditions, breaching any of them constitutes a breach of the lease. This section does not impact security deposit laws or the right to possess a service animal. \"Prescribed\" is defined as \"prescription\" under the Business and Professions Code. A service animal includes guide dogs, signal dogs, and service dogs. A tenant may keep a support animal on the property with a prescription from a California-licensed mental health professional. The tenant must also comply with all relevant laws and regulations. A tenant can have a support animal on the property with a prescription from a California-licensed mental health professional. The landlord can terminate the tenancy or deny accommodations if the support animal was brought without notice, is not housebroken, causes financial hardship, jeopardizes property insurance, poses a threat, or if the tenant does not adhere to all standards. An extra charge or security deposit may be required for maintaining a support animal. Illegal species or state/federally protected animals cannot be kept as support animals. For compliance with state and local ordinances, owners of assistance dogs and support animals must adhere to health and licensure requirements. A support animal, defined as a support dog, companion animal, emotional support animal, or assistive animal, does not include guide dogs, signal dogs, or service dogs."
