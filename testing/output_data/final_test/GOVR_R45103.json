These activities are addressed by various federal land management agencies, including the Department of the Interior and the U.S. Forest Service. This report provides background information on hunting and fishing activities on federal lands. This report focuses on recreational hunting and freshwater fishing activities on federal lands and freshwaters, excluding state or private property, commercial activities, or ocean/marine recreational fishing. It discusses major federal statutes, administrative actions, and potential issues facing Congress related to hunting and fishing. It does not address specific legislation on firearms. Hunting and fishing are seen as traditional American pastimes integral to conservation and wildlife management. Proponents argue that these activities connect people to the land, promote conservation, and generate revenue. However, concerns have been raised about potential conflicts between conservation interests and sportsperson activities, as unsustainable hunting and fishing practices can harm ecosystems and species. Finding a balance among multiple authorized uses for federal lands is considered a role for Congress. Some stakeholders believe that federal lands offer the best opportunities for hunting and fishing activities, sparking debates on prioritizing these activities. Proponents argue for greater access to sportsperson activities on federal lands to benefit all Americans, while others express concerns about potential marginalization. Hunting and fishing are important activities on federal lands, with debates on prioritizing these activities. Concerns have been raised about potential marginalization of other users and impacts on conservation efforts. These activities also contribute significantly to the outdoor economy, including wildlife viewing and camping. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service conducts surveys every five years to estimate participation and expenditures related to hunting, fishing, and wildlife watching. Participation in hunting ranged from 11.5 million to 14.0 million sportspersons between 1996 and 2016. Participation in hunting and fishing varied between 11.5 million to 14.0 million individuals. Wildlife watching increased from 62.9 million in 1996 to 86.0 million in 2016. In 2016, over 101 million Americans participated in wildlife-related activities, generating $156 billion in expenditures. In 2016, there were 2.2 million fewer hunters in the United States compared to 2011. Wildlife watching had 86.0 million participants who spent an average of $882 each. The survey results show a large portion of the U.S. population participates in hunting and fishing, contributing to local and national economies. Supporters advocate for greater access to federal lands for hunting and fishing, while others suggest shifting management plans to support nonconsumptive wildlife activities like bird watching. Hunting and fishing are also important for conservation efforts. Federal lands and waters provide opportunities for hunting and fishing, with 36% of hunters using public lands in 2011. The federal government owns 640 million acres of land, accounting for 28% of the U.S. land. Hunters in the western U.S. heavily utilize public lands, while those in the eastern U.S. do so to a lesser extent. Federal lands and waters, managed by various agencies, provide hunting and fishing opportunities. BLM, NPS, FWS, and FS oversee 95% of federal acreage, with DOD and USACE managing 2% each. Each agency has its own mission, leading to varied policies on hunting and fishing activities. Federal and state laws influence hunting and fishing regulations on agency units. States manage wildlife within their borders, requiring hunters and anglers to have relevant state licenses. Federal lands can be managed for hunting and fishing as open unless closed (e.g., BLM lands) or closed unless open (e.g., NPS lands). The default status of land management agencies is reflected in whether lands are open unless closed or closed unless open for hunting and fishing. Justification for opening or closing lands is based on compatibility with agency missions. There is a wide variation in the portion of lands open to hunting and fishing, with BLM and FS reporting high percentages of open lands for these activities. Approximately 80% of federal lands and waters are open to hunting and fishing, with the majority administered by the FWS and NPS. FWS administers about 86 million acres for hunting, while NPS manages 70 units mandated for hunting and 6 authorized for it. Other agencies also allow hunting and fishing on their lands. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) administers 248 million acres of federal lands in the United States, mainly in western states and Alaska. BLM manages public lands based on multiple use and sustained yield principles, as defined by the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA). Multiple use includes recreation, grazing, timber, energy development, wildlife conservation, and more, while sustained yield ensures renewable resources are utilized in a manner consistent with multiple use. BLM lands are open to hunting and fishing, with over 99% accessible under federal and state laws. Restrictions may apply for reasons like public safety or compliance with the law. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) regulates hunting and fishing on BLM lands, requiring consultation with the state except in emergencies. BLM regulations allow closures and restrictions to protect people, property, and resources. The National Forest System (NFS) administers 193 million acres of land in the US, established to improve federal forests and provide timber. The Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960 expanded NFS uses. The National Forest System (NFS) manages land for various activities including outdoor recreation, rangeland management, and wildlife and fish management. Similar to BLM, NFS allows hunting and fishing with some restrictions for public safety and resource management. Some areas have specific directives for hunting and fishing. The FWS administers 89 million acres of federal land within the National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS) in the United States, with a primary mission to conserve and manage plants and animals. The NWRS includes national wildlife refuges, wildlife ranges, management areas, and waterfowl production areas. The National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS) administers federal land to conserve plants and animals. Refuges are managed for specific purposes, with wildlife-dependent recreational uses like hunting and fishing prioritized. Hunting and fishing are allowed in some of the 566 wildlife refuges, with 374 offering these activities. Hunting and fishing are allowed in many National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS) units, with 336 allowing hunting and 277 allowing fishing. Additionally, 37 out of 38 wetland management districts in the NWRS permit hunting, and 34 allow fishing. The National Park System, managed by the National Park Service (NPS), consists of 417 units with diverse titles like national park, national monument, and national historic site. The NPS has a dual mission to conserve natural and historic objects while providing for public enjoyment. Hunting and fishing are allowed in National Park Service (NPS) units based on authorization or statutory mandates. The park superintendent determines if hunting is consistent with safety and resource management principles. Recreational fishing is permitted when authorized by law and anglers must follow approved methods and state regulations. Hunting is allowed in 70 NPS-managed units and authorized in 6 more, with elk harvest permitted in 1 additional unit for population control. The Bureau of Reclamation manages 6.6 million acres of land and water, with 289 projects providing recreation areas. The Federal Water Project Recreation Act of 1965 governs recreation and wildlife facilities on BOR lands. The Bureau of Reclamation manages wildlife facilities on BOR lands and waters, with opportunities for outdoor recreation considered for projects. Lands and waters may be closed for hunting and fishing, or designated as special use areas for public interest reasons. As of September 30, 2014, the DOD administered 11.4 million acres of federally owned land in the United States, with management responsibilities under the Secretary of Defense. The Sikes Act governs the management of military lands. The Sikes Act requires the DOD to develop a natural resources management plan for installations with significant resources in cooperation with FWS and state agencies. It also mandates providing lands for conservation and multipurpose use, including hunting and fishing, consistent with military mission. Access for hunting and fishing on DOD lands is determined at the installation level based on compatibility with natural resource management and military needs. The DOD policy determines access for hunting and fishing on installations based on compatibility with natural resource management and military needs. Some installations may be open to the public, while others may be restricted to servicemembers. The total acreage of DOD lands open for hunting and fishing is unknown. Federal laws apply state fish and game laws to hunting and fishing on military installations, with the Secretary of Defense able to waive certain state laws for public health or safety reasons. The Secretary may waive certain state laws for hunting and fishing on military installations, with a 30-day notice requirement. DOD can issue permits and collect fees for these activities, but the primary purpose of DOD lands is to support mission-related activities. Other uses like recreation are allowed if compatible with the military mission. The Department of Defense (DOD) has regulations in place to manage natural resources and public access, including hunting and fishing, on military installations. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) manages 12 million acres of lands and waters for recreational opportunities, with hunting and fishing allowed in most areas except where prohibited by the overseeing USACE district commander. Fishing is allowed in most areas managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, subject to federal, state, and local laws. Fishing accounts for 18% of freshwater fishing in the U.S., with roughly 6.6 million hunter visits annually. Federal laws govern hunting and fishing on federal lands, even if they conflict with state laws. Federal laws govern hunting and fishing on federal lands, outlining the purpose and mission of specific agencies and determining access to lands and waters. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 implements conventions between the United States and Great Britain, with subsequent amendments. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) of 1918, amended multiple times, regulates the take and transport of migratory game birds, with the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) having regulatory authority. It prohibits the take, possession, or trade of migratory birds unless permitted by regulation, applies to native species in the US, and authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to regulate hunting seasons for migratory birds. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act allows the Secretary of the Interior to regulate hunting seasons for migratory game birds, with the Fish and Wildlife Service setting the outside limits annually. States and tribes can establish their own hunting seasons within the federally approved framework. The Duck Stamp Program requires waterfowl hunters to annually purchase a federal hunting stamp in addition to state licenses. Duck stamps support bird habitat conservation by funding the acquisition of \"waterfowl production areas\" through the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund. The Duck Stamp Program funds habitat conservation by acquiring \"waterfowl production areas\" through the Migratory Bird Conservation Act. The stamp price has increased to $25, with proceeds over $15 going towards conservation easements. Since 1934, duck stamps have generated over $950 million for conservation. The Endangered Species Act protects imperiled species and their ecosystems, with prohibitions on interactions once a species is listed as threatened or endangered. The Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act and the Federal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration Act mandate excise taxes on hunting- and fishing-related equipment, with proceeds diverted to conservation and education programs. Products taxed include firearms, ammunition, sport fishing equipment, and boat motors. In FY2016, excise taxes on sport fishing equipment and boat motors totaled $787 million for Pittman-Robertson and $628 million for Dingell-Johnson. Federal lands and waters in Alaska are managed differently due to laws like ANILCA, which govern recreational and subsistence hunting and fishing activities. ANILCA emphasizes the importance of hunting and fishing in Alaska and mandates a subsistence hunting and fishing program for national parks in the state. ANILCA mandates subsistence hunting and fishing programs in Alaska's national parks and allows sport hunting and fishing in national preserves. International sport hunting is regulated by the country where it occurs and may be subject to treaties like CITES. Appendix I species, most threatened with extinction, are protected under CITES, but sport hunting is not considered commercial. Import and trade of foreign trophies into the US are regulated by laws like the ESA. The import of sport-hunted trophies of endangered species into the United States is prohibited unless an enhancement of survival permit is obtained. The same rules apply for threatened species, with exceptions for limited trophy imports. Illegal killing of foreign species and importing them into the US violates the Lacey Act, which regulates wildlife trade. Laws such as the Lacey Act prohibit the purchase of wildlife in violation of foreign laws. Other relevant laws include the Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Fisherman's Protection Act. Hunting and fishing issues are addressed through various policy mechanisms, including executive orders and the designation of national monuments for conservation and recreation purposes. President George W. Bush issued Executive Order 13443 (E.O. 13443) on August 16, 2007, to expand and enhance hunting activities on federal lands. This order directed federal agencies to increase hunting opportunities for the public and establish the Recreational Hunting and Wildlife Resource Conservation Plan and the Wildlife and Hunting Heritage Conservation Council. The conservation plan provided a 10-year strategy to implement E.O. 13433, with Secretary Zinke introducing secretarial orders S.O. 3347 and S.O. 3356 to expand hunting and fishing opportunities on federal lands. S.O. 3347 required reports on E.O. 13443 implementation and recommendations for enhancing recreational fishing, to be shared with relevant councils. The Wildlife and Hunting Heritage Conservation Council and the Sport Fishing and Boating Partnership Council provided recommendations to DOI to expand access for hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting activities, improve habitat, manage predators, and increase public access to federal lands. S.O. 3356 directed DOI bureaus to collaborate with states, tribes, and territories to enhance conservation and recreational opportunities on federal lands and waters. DOI bureaus and offices are implementing recommendations from S.O. 3347 to increase access to DOI lands and waters for sportsperson activities, update regulations and management plans, improve opportunities for underrepresented groups, and enhance hunting and fishing traditions. Reactions to S.O.s 3347 and 3356 have been mixed, with proponents emphasizing increased access to federal lands for hunting and fishing, while critics argue that these activities are already included in existing land use plans. The purpose of the order was to distract from other administrative activities that could diminish environmental protection of federal lands, such as increasing energy and mineral production and altering national monuments. Issues related to hunting and fishing are routinely considered by Congress, including access to federal lands, types of land open to hunting and fishing, regulations, reauthorization of laws, and use regulation. Access to federal lands and waters for hunting and fishing is a concern for hunters and anglers. Limited access can reduce opportunities for outdoor recreation, including hunting and fishing. Congress may consider reauthorizing or amending laws related to hunting and fishing, as well as regulating ammunition and tackle on federal lands. Some argue for increasing efforts to ensure public lands are accessible for outdoor recreation like hunting and fishing, while others believe the focus should be on managing existing lands and addressing maintenance backlogs. There are also debates about transferring federal lands to states and bills in the 115th Congress aim to improve access to federal lands for recreation. The bills aim to improve access to federal lands and waters for hunting, fishing, and outdoor recreation. They seek to streamline permitting processes, increase opportunities for veterans, extend recreation seasons, and designate new national recreation areas. Some stakeholders support these efforts, while others suggest adjustments to the bill language. Some stakeholders believe more federal lands and waters should be open to hunting and fishing, arguing that these areas are owned by all Americans and should benefit hunters and anglers. However, others argue that some lands should be kept off-limits for conservation and preservation purposes. Some bills in the 115th Congress aim to clarify that BLM and FS lands are open to hunting and fishing unless specifically closed. The bills outline procedures for closing lands, including public comment and stakeholder notification. The focus is on codifying the open unless closed policy for hunting and fishing activities on federal lands. Both S. 733 and S. 1460 aim to establish the policy for all agencies and departments to enhance hunting and fishing activities. Controversy surrounds the provisions regarding hunting and fishing on BLM and FS lands, with some arguing for protection and others concerned about prioritization. Congress regularly considers reauthorizing laws related to hunting and fishing on federal lands. Issues related to hunting and fishing on federal lands may arise due to laws like the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) and the North American Wetlands Conservation Act (NAWCA). Some argue for greater access to federal lands to support wildlife populations, while others believe acquiring more federal land is not the best conservation approach. Stakeholders suggest using LWCF for maintaining existing federal land rather than acquiring new lands. Additionally, there are calls to amend the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act to better support states and hunters. Several bills in the 115th Congress aim to amend the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) to support hunter and angler retention and recruitment. Proposals include providing permanent authorization for LWCF and allocating funds for projects to secure recreational public access on federal lands for hunting, fishing, and other recreational purposes. Perspectives on reauthorizing LWCF vary, with proponents citing its importance in acquiring and protecting lands for public access, while opponents argue for flaws in its current form. Opponents argue that the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) is flawed and should not prioritize acquiring new lands. Several bills in the 115th Congress aim to extend the North American Wetlands Conservation Act (NAWCA) through FY2022 or FY2023. These bills also propose amendments to NAWCA, including requirements for notification, long-term management of acquired property, and limitations on land acquisition by the federal government. Some argue that NAWCA supports hunting and fishing activities by improving bird populations and wetland habitat. Several bills in the 115th Congress aim to extend the North American Wetlands Conservation Act (NAWCA) through FY2022 or FY2023. Some argue that NAWCA supports hunting and fishing activities by improving bird populations and wetland habitat. Bills such as H.R. 788, H.R. 3668, H.R. 4489, S. 593, S. 733, and S. 1460 would amend the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act to allow more funding for target ranges. H.R. 2591 and S. 1613 would provide financial and technical assistance to states for hunting and recreational shooting promotion. Regulation of ammunition and tackle based on lead content is a contentious issue. Regulation of lead in ammunition and fishing tackle is a contentious issue. Lead in ammunition is regulated for hunting waterfowl, coots, and certain species, while lead in other ammunition and tackle is not federally regulated. Some argue that further regulation is unnecessary and costly, citing existing regulations for waterfowl hunting. Others believe that lead in fishing tackle and ammunition poses environmental risks. Lead in fishing tackle and ammunition is harmful to the environment, threatening species and consumer health. Ammunition is currently exempt from regulation under the Toxic Substances Control Act, while tackle has been exempted through annual appropriations bills. Administrative actions have been taken to address this issue, such as FWS Director's Order 219 phasing out lead ammunition and tackle on FWS-managed lands. However, DOI Secretary Zinke rescinded this order, sparking mixed reactions on the impact of continued lead use on wildlife and the environment. Lead in fishing tackle and ammunition poses a threat to wildlife and the environment. Legislation in the 115th Congress has addressed this issue, with bills like H.R. 3354 and S. 1460 aiming to prohibit the regulation of tackle based on lead content. H.R. 3668 also seeks to prevent DOI and USDA bureaus from regulating ammunition or tackle with lead content. These bills are part of the broader discussion on hunting and fishing legislation in Congress. The 115th Congress has introduced four bills addressing sportsperson-related issues, including legislation on lead in fishing tackle and ammunition. Certain issues outside the scope of the report are included in these bills."
