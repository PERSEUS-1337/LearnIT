    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Quadrennial Energy Review Act of 2014\". Congress finds that the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology recommends developing a Governmentwide Federal energy policy with regular strategic Quadrennial Energy Reviews. The Department of Energy has conducted a Quadrennial Technology Review, serving as the basis for coordination with other agencies. A Quadrennial Energy Review would establish integrated, Governmentwide national energy policies. The Quadrennial Energy Review aims to establish integrated national energy objectives, coordinate actions across Federal agencies, identify resources for energy technologies, and provide an analytical base for policy decisions. It should consider Federal budgetary resources and aim to enhance energy security, create jobs, and mitigate environmental harm. The Quadrennial Energy Review aims to establish national energy objectives, coordinate actions across Federal agencies, identify resources for energy technologies, and provide an analytical base for policy decisions. It will involve substantial input from Congress, the energy industry, academia, nongovernmental organizations, and the public to enhance energy security, create jobs, and mitigate environmental harm. The Quadrennial Energy Review under Section 801 of the Department of Energy Organization Act aims to establish national energy objectives, coordinate actions across Federal agencies, and provide an analytical base for policy decisions. It involves input from various stakeholders to enhance energy security, create jobs, and mitigate environmental harm. In this section, definitions are provided for terms such as Director, Federal Laboratory, Interagency Energy Coordination Council, and Quadrennial Energy Review. The Director refers to the head of the Office of Science and Technology Policy. Federal Laboratory includes federally funded research centers. The Interagency Energy Coordination Council is a council established for energy coordination. The Quadrennial Energy Review aims to set national energy objectives and inform policy decisions. The Quadrennial Energy Review is a comprehensive multiyear review that focuses on energy programs and technologies, establishes energy objectives across the Federal Government, and covers specific areas. An Interagency Energy Coordination Council is established every 4 years to coordinate the Quadrennial Energy Review, with designated co-chairpersons. The Interagency Energy Coordination Council is led by government officials appointed by the President and the Director. It includes representatives from various government departments at level I or II of the Executive Schedule. The Quadrennial Energy Review involves the Environmental Protection Agency and other relevant federal organizations. It aims to provide an integrated view of national energy objectives and policies, aligning research programs, incentives, regulations, and partnerships. The President must submit a report to Congress by August 1, 2015, and every 4 years thereafter, including an integrated view of short- and long-term energy goals. The Quadrennial Energy Review aims to provide an integrated view of short-, intermediate-, and long-term objectives for Federal energy policy, including anticipated Federal actions and resource requirements to achieve these objectives. It also includes an analysis of the prospective roles of various parties in achieving these objectives. The Quadrennial Energy Review includes an analysis of energy use sectors such as commercial and residential buildings, the industrial sector, transportation, and electric power. It also covers requirements for energy technology innovation, policy options for increasing domestic energy supplies and efficiency, and an evaluation of energy storage. The curr_chunk provides an evaluation of energy storage, transmission, and distribution requirements, an integrated plan for Federal Laboratories' involvement in energy programs, portfolio assessments for resource deployment, mapping of linkages between research and programs, and identification of demonstration projects with funding sources and timelines. The curr_chunk identifies public and private funding needs for energy technologies, assesses global competitors, and identifies policy gaps to accelerate technology adoption. The curr_chunk outlines a priority list for implementing energy objectives, analyzing points of leverage for policy intervention, and making recommendations for executive branch organization changes to facilitate Federal energy policies. Interim reports may be prepared as part of the Quadrennial Energy Review. The Secretary of Energy will provide an Executive Secretariat for the Quadrennial Energy Review to offer necessary support. Federal agencies must cooperate and provide assistance as needed. This Act does not override any existing Federal laws unless expressly stated."
