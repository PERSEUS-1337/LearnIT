The alliance must be prepared for security contingencies that may involve the rapid deployment of agile forces. The Kosovo conflict in 1999 highlighted a disparity in defense capabilities between the United States and its NATO allies, emphasizing the need for transformation in response to the changing threat landscape. The European threat environment has evolved since the collapse of the Berlin Wall, prompting the development of transatlantic security initiatives to bridge the technology gap between the U.S. and European forces. The European Security and Defense Policy (ESDP) was established after the Balkans conflicts in the 1990s, aiming to create rapid reaction forces for various military tasks. In 1999, EU states set \"headline goals\" for a 60,000-strong crisis management force, deployable within two months and sustainable for one year. In 2004, Brussels announced plans for the formation of 13. In 2004, Brussels announced the planned formation of 13, 1500-troop battlegroups for rapid deployment to crisis areas. The EU created the European Defense Agency to coordinate European defense capabilities. In January 2007, the EU confirmed the battlegroups were fully operational. NATO launched the Defense Capabilities Initiative in April 1999 to improve its ability to fulfill collective defense commitments and prepare for emerging security challenges. The Defense Capabilities Initiative (DCI) aimed to enhance NATO core capabilities through 59 \"action items\" in various categories. However, goals were not met as most countries did not increase defense spending as required. The aftermath of September 11 exposed allied military limitations compared to the United States, with NATO invoking Article 5 for the first time during the war in Afghanistan. Initially, the US relied on its own military before allied forces joined in larger numbers after the Taliban's defeat. After the Taliban's defeat, NATO allies were not initially invited to contribute due to lacking military capabilities for a high-tech campaign. The Prague Capabilities Commitment (PCC) was approved in November 2002 to address interoperability issues and improve operational capabilities in response to evolving defense needs and the security threat post-9/11. PCC aims to resuscitate the Defense Capabilities Initiative (DCI) by focusing on combatting terrorism and emphasizing air capabilities. The Prague Capabilities Commitment (PCC) was approved in November 2002 to address interoperability issues and improve operational capabilities in response to the security threat post-9/11. PCC focuses on combatting terrorism, emphasizing air capabilities, and requires specific commitments from NATO members in eight key areas. The Prague Capabilities Commitment (PCC) emphasizes multinational commitments and pooling of funds to enhance operational capabilities. Smaller countries can combine resources to purchase hardware, such as conversion kits for bombs, strategic air transport capabilities, tanker aircraft, and sealift assets. PCC also values role specialization, with countries like Romania offering alpine troops and Hungary having a skilled engineering corps. The Prague Capabilities Commitment (PCC) focuses on specific, quantifiable commitments from member states to enhance operational capabilities. Countries like Romania offer alpine troops, Hungary has a skilled engineering corps, and the Czech and Slovak Republics have units trained in countering chemical and biological weapons. PCC aims to avoid vague requirements and ensure countries acquire specific equipment. Subsequent NATO summits in Istanbul, Riga, and Bucharest did not introduce new extensive programmatic objectives for enhancing alliance capabilities. At the Istanbul summit, NATO leaders reaffirmed their commitment to improving capabilities through the Prague Capabilities Commitment (PCC). They praised multinational efforts to acquire lift, refuellers, and AGS, and agreed to transform military capabilities to be more modern and deployable. Some nations were urged to invest in deployable capabilities, and a NATO Active Layered Theater Ballistic Missile Defense program was approved for force protection. At the November 2006 Riga summit, NATO leaders reaffirmed their commitment to building on capabilities from previous summits in Prague and Istanbul. They highlighted progress in force adaptation and support for expeditionary operations, focusing on key activities. A major achievement was the establishment of cooperative initiatives to enhance airlift capacity, including the Strategic Airlift Interim Solution and the NATO Strategic Airlift Capability. This involved member states pooling funds to purchase aircraft for international operations. The 2008 Bucharest summit declaration highlighted progress on key capabilities for NATO operations, including special operations, networking, intelligence sharing, missile defense, and anti-CBRN capabilities. It emphasized the importance of acquiring specific capabilities such as strategic airlift and communications for missions like those in Afghanistan. The declaration also pointed towards a possible future NATO missile defense system. The 2008 Bucharest summit declaration emphasized progress on key capabilities for NATO operations, including special operations, networking, intelligence sharing, missile defense, and anti-CBRN capabilities. It encouraged member states to bolster defense spending to meet the goals of PCC, which requires restructuring and modernizing their militaries. This implies increased defense spending, with the United States leading in defense expenditures compared to European NATO countries. Germany has drastically reduced its military budget despite being the second-largest military in the alliance. Most assessments of PCC progress are classified. The NATO Parliamentary Assembly (NPA) reports highlighted challenges in assessing the progress of the Partnership for Capability Cooperation (PCC) due to incomplete information and lack of transparency on force goals. Despite this, progress was noted in areas such as sealift, anti-CBRN, and equipping aircraft with precision-guided munitions (PGMs). NATO has also focused on acquiring expeditionary assets like airlift, special forces, and information superiority, driven by operations in Afghanistan. Asset pooling and specialized capabilities remain important. Analysts suggest real improvements have been made based on NATO publications and statements. Some analysts believe there have been improvements in boosting capabilities within NATO, as indicated by statements from defense ministers. Progress has been noted in fulfilling commitments, with some critical deficiencies still present. However, a 2008 study described the results of the Partnership for Capability Cooperation (PCC) as \"mixed.\" NATO is involved in multiple missions and operations, with ongoing efforts to enhance capabilities. The Riga final communiqu\u00e9 highlighted NATO's involvement in six missions on three continents, with a focus on capabilities driven by experiences in Afghanistan. Special forces and strategic lift are seen as critical areas for improvement. U.S. NATO Ambassador Victoria Nuland emphasized the need for increased spending on new military assets. The adoption of DCI and PCC initiatives signifies consensus among member states to strengthen expeditionary capabilities, although some critics question their effectiveness. Some critics question the need for more advanced military capabilities in NATO, citing existing technological superiority and sufficient military capabilities. Concerns are raised about the motives behind the push for advanced capabilities, with skepticism towards defense spending increases and potential boost in sales for arms manufacturers. Analysts challenge the significance of the capabilities gap between the US and NATO allies, while supporters express reservations about member states' willingness to fund necessary changes in defense budgets. Countries that have contributed to overseas NATO missions, especially in Afghanistan, may face challenges due to limited military budgets. The costs of deployment, maintenance, and equipment replacement could hinder modernization efforts. Analysts suggest that new members of the alliance must meet higher capabilities requirements. The debate over NATO burdensharing is ongoing, with concerns raised about Western European countries not fulfilling their promises since the 1950s. The alliance aims to address these issues by focusing on agreed-upon military capability requirements. The alliance aims to address challenges in meeting military capability requirements."
