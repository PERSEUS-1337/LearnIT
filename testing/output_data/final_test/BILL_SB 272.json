    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. The Legislature acknowledges the impact of new information technology on how people access information in California. It recognizes the potential for government to improve services through digitization, citing a study that estimates significant economic benefits. California is seen as a leader in technology, with its tech industry setting new standards for society. In California, cities are utilizing public sector data for operational efficiency and collaboration. Standards should be adopted for data collection and publication to move government towards a more effective digital future. This commitment will lead to greater collaboration, improved accountability, and increased productivity for residents and businesses in California. Local governments in California are required to comply with the California Public Records Act and create a catalog of enterprise systems that must be made publicly available. The catalog should list the enterprise systems used by the agency along with details such as the current system vendor. The California Public Records Act requires local governments to create a catalog of enterprise systems, including details like the current system vendor, product, purpose, data categories, custodian department, data collection frequency, and system update frequency. An enterprise system is defined as a software application or computer system that collects, stores, exchanges, and analyzes information across departments or about the public, serving as a system of record within an agency. An enterprise system shall not include information technology security systems, physical access control systems, infrastructure and mechanical control systems, 911 dispatch systems, systems restricted from disclosure, or specific records collected by the system. This does not grant public access to restricted records or change the process for requesting public records. The local agency may provide a system name, brief title, or identifier instead of disclosing certain information if the public interest served by not disclosing outweighs the public interest served by disclosure. The agency must complete and update a catalog annually by July 1, 2016. The Legislature adds Section 6270.5 to the Government Code to enhance public access to local public body meetings and writings of local agencies. Increased information on data collected by local agencies can help the public access and utilize the information more efficiently. The Legislature limits public access to public documents to protect the security of enterprise systems in public agencies due to the potential negative consequences of releasing sensitive information. No reimbursement is required by this act according to the California Constitution, as any costs incurred by local agencies or school districts would be due to a legislative mandate within the scope of the constitution."
