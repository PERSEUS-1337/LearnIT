    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Motor Systems Market Awareness Act of 2014\". Congress finds that motors and motor-driven systems are significant electricity consumers in the United States, with energy use dependent on motor efficiency and system design. Research on motor efficiency is outdated, data collection on motor importation and sales has ceased, and the last motor market assessment was in 2002. The technology in motor systems has evolved significantly in the past 12 years. A new motor and motor-driven system market assessment is needed to help U.S. manufacturers understand the commercial marketplace and improve global competitiveness. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. The Department refers to the Department of Energy, interested parties include various entities like trade associations and motor manufacturers, and the Secretary is the Secretary of Energy. SEC. 4. MOTOR MARKET ASSESSMENT. The Secretary, with input from interested parties, will assess motors and motor-driven systems in the US, focusing on profiles, purchase practices, and energy efficiency opportunities. The assessment will focus on motor and drive technologies, including advanced motor designs and global supply chain evaluation. The Secretary will conduct an assessment on motor and drive technologies, focusing on reducing heavy rare earth materials in high energy density permanent magnets and factors that may increase domestic manufacturing. A report will be published within 540 days, and recommendations will be developed based on the assessment to update motor profiles periodically and identify technology and research needs. The Secretary will conduct an assessment on motor and drive technologies to reduce heavy rare earth materials in high energy density permanent magnets and increase domestic manufacturing. Recommendations will be developed to update motor profiles periodically and identify technology and research needs for joint industry and government partnership. The Secretary will establish a public awareness program aimed at motor end-users to increase awareness of energy efficiency opportunities, procurement procedures, and decision-making criteria for motor and motor-driven system components."
