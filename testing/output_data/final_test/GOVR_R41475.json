    "content": "The Agriculture appropriations bill funds various agencies including the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Jurisdiction for the bill lies with the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) operates through multiple agencies and offices with a large workforce. Its budget for FY2010 was $126.6 billion, with a focus on food and nutrition programs like SNAP and WIC. Farm and foreign agricultural services also receive significant funding. The USDA's budget for FY2010 was $126.6 billion, with a focus on food and nutrition programs like SNAP and WIC. Farm and foreign agricultural services, including commodity price support, crop insurance, conservation programs, farm loans, and foreign food aid, are also funded. The Forest Service receives about $6 billion, accounting for 60% of the budget for natural resources programs. USDA's organization and budget data for FY2010 may not align with the Agriculture appropriations bill in Congress. Spending discrepancies exist due to different program categorizations and funding types. Foreign agricultural assistance is a separate title in the appropriations bill but is combined with domestic farm support in USDA's \"farm and foreign agriculture\" mission area. Conversely, USDA separates agricultural research, marketing, regulatory programs, and food safety into distinct mission areas, which are grouped with other domestic farm support programs in the appropriations bill. The Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittees have jurisdiction over appropriations for USDA agencies, FDA, and CFTC. FDA and CFTC funding in the Agriculture and Related Agencies appropriations bill is about 2%. The Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittees have jurisdiction over appropriations for USDA agencies, FDA, and CFTC. CFTC funding in the Agriculture appropriations bill is about 2%. Jurisdiction over CFTC appropriations is assigned differently in the House and Senate, with final placement alternating annually between subcommittees. These agencies are included in the Agriculture appropriations bill due to their historical connection to agricultural markets, despite the growth of non-agricultural issues in recent decades. Despite the increasing number and scope of non-agricultural issues at FDA and CFTC, agriculture and food issues remain significant. FDA focuses on medical and drug issues, while food safety responsibilities are shared with USDA. CFTC sees growth in financial futures contracts, but volatility in agricultural commodity markets is a concern. Discretionary and mandatory spending differ in the budget process, with discretionary spending controlled by annual appropriations acts. Spending is controlled by annual appropriations acts and consumes most of the attention during the appropriations process. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees originate bills each year that provide funding for discretionary programs. Eligibility for mandatory programs is written into authorizing laws, and Congress controls spending on these programs through authorizing committees. About 20% of the Agriculture appropriations bill is for discretionary programs, while the remaining 80% is classified as mandatory. Discretionary programs at USDA include conservation, rural development, research, education, credit, WIC, international food aid, meat inspection, and FDA/CFTC appropriations. Mandatory spending focuses on food and nutrition programs like SNAP and child nutrition, farm commodity support, crop insurance, and agricultural conservation/trade programs. The 2008 farm bill sets formulas for mandatory spending on food stamp and child nutrition programs, which have increased due to recession, unemployment, and food price inflation. Annual Agriculture appropriations fund these programs, with supplemental appropriations made if needed. The Commodity Credit Corporation operates on a line of credit with the Treasury and receives annual appropriations for reimbursement and credit maintenance. The Commodity Credit Corporation receives annual appropriations to reimburse the Treasury and maintain its line of credit. Understanding federal spending involves terms like budget authority, obligations, outlays, and program levels. Budget authority is the amount Congress allows agencies to spend, obligations are the funds committed to spending activities, and outlays are the actual money flowing out of agency accounts. Program level is the sum of activities supported by an agency, which may exceed budget authority due to user fees, loans, transfers, and carryover funds. The FY2011 Agriculture appropriations bill saw limited formal committee action in the 111th Congress. Limited formal committee action occurred in the 111th Congress for the FY2011 Agriculture appropriations bill. In the 112th Congress, a full-year continuing resolution was enacted with line-item changes on April 15, 2011. The bill did not see full committee action nor was it reported in the House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee. Agriculture appropriations were enacted as stand-alone bills in FY2010 and FY2006, while omnibus appropriations were used in FY2008 and FY2009. In FY2011, the House passed a full-year continuing resolution covering all 12 regular appropriations bills. Limited formal committee action occurred for the FY2011 Agriculture appropriations bill in the 111th Congress. The bill did not see full committee action or a reported version in the House Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee. The Senate passed H.R. 1473 on April 14, 2011, and the President signed the bill the next day. On March 9, 2011, the Senate voted on H.R. 1 and a substitute amendment, but both failed to pass. In the 111th Congress, the Senate Appropriations Committee reported its version of the FY2011 Agriculture appropriations bill on July 15, 2010. The Agriculture appropriations bill went through an expedited committee procedure in the 111th Congress. Several short-term continuing resolutions were enacted to fund the government before a final agreement was reached. In FY2011, the House passed two bills while the Senate Appropriations Committee reported 11 out of 12 bills, none reaching the floor. The bills that saw House action were Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, and Transportation and Housing and Urban Development. The Senate did not report the Interior and Environment bill. Continuing resolutions maintained prior-year funding and instructions, with the first four CRs keeping discretionary agricultural appropriations at FY2010 levels. The fifth and sixth CRs reduced discretionary appropriations by $10 billion across all 12 bills. In FY2011, two continuing resolutions (CRs) cut $10 billion from selected accounts annually, reducing FY2010 appropriated levels. The Office of Management and Budget allocated funding in a limited way, making operations more restricted. The Administration requested $132.3 billion for Agriculture appropriations in FY2011, with a 9% increase from FY2010, mostly due to mandatory spending. The Administration requested $109.1 billion for Agriculture appropriations in FY2011, with an 11% increase from FY2010. The discretionary amount was $23.2 billion, $187 million less than FY2010. Excluding certain items, the discretionary request was $336 million more than FY2010. P.L. 112-10 provided $19.9 billion in discretionary appropriations, a $3.4 billion reduction from FY2010 levels. The FY2011 Agriculture appropriations bill resulted in a $3.4 billion reduction from FY2010 levels. Discretionary programs in agriculture, conservation, rural development, nutrition assistance, and foreign assistance all saw decreases compared to FY2010 levels. The CFTC budget increased by 20% from FY2010. Tables 2 and 3 provide detailed breakdowns of the appropriations bill by title and agency. Supplemental appropriations are not included in the totals for comparison purposes. The FY2011 Agriculture appropriations bill resulted in a $3.4 billion reduction from FY2010 levels, with discretionary programs in various sectors seeing decreases. Several short-term continuing resolutions were enacted before final agreement on the full-year appropriation, with some accounts in the Agriculture appropriations bill being reduced below FY2010 levels. Earmarks from FY2010 were not continued and had no legal effect. The FY2011 Agriculture appropriations bill resulted in a $3.4 billion reduction from FY2010 levels, with discretionary programs seeing decreases. Funding for rural broadband and housing guaranteed loans was targeted and ultimately reduced in the full-year CR. Agriculture appropriations peaked in FY2010. The section offers perspective on funding type, purpose, relationship to inflation, and other variables from FY1995 to FY2011. Total discretionary appropriations levels in the Agriculture bill are shown in Figure 3, divided between domestic nutrition assistance programs and other programs. The Agriculture appropriations bill has seen an average annual increase of 5.3% over the past 10 years. Mandatory appropriations have increased at a rate of 5.8%, while discretionary appropriations have increased at a rate of 3.0%. The share of the bill going to domestic nutrition has risen from 46% in FY2000 to 72% in FY2011, with total nutrition spending increasing at an average annual rate of 10%. Nutrition program spending has increased faster than non-nutrition spending over the past 5-, 10-, and 15-year periods. Most nutrition program spending is mandatory, with SNAP and child nutrition being primary areas. Mandatory nutrition spending has risen at an average rate of 10.8% per year, while discretionary spending increased at about 4.8% per year. Non-nutrition program spending is more evenly divided between mandatory and discretionary, with slower growth rates compared to nutrition spending. Total Agriculture appropriations have shown positive \"real\" growth above the rate of inflation, with an average annual increase of 3.1% over the past 10 years. Discretionary spending on mandatory components has grown at a 2.9% annual rate since 2006, while discretionary nutrition appropriations were reduced by 17% in the most recent year. Total Agriculture appropriations have increased at an average annual real rate of 3.1% over the past 10 years. Nutrition programs saw a higher average annual real increase of 7.8%, while the rest of the bill had a -3.4% average annual change. The Agriculture bill's share of the federal budget declined from 4.4% in FY1995 to 2.7% in FY2009, before rising to about 3.4% in FY2010-FY2011. The share of the federal budget for nutrition programs also declined but increased in FY2010-FY2011. Agriculture appropriations have remained steady at just under 0.75% of GDP. Agriculture appropriations as a percentage of GDP have risen slightly from FY2000-FY2009 to FY2010-FY2011. Nutrition programs have increased steadily as a percentage of GDP, while non-nutrition agricultural programs have declined. Total Agriculture appropriations have risen slightly on a per capita basis over the past 10 to 15 years. Appropriators have placed limitations on mandatory spending known as CHIMPS in recent years. Changes in mandatory program spending are typically not part of the annual appropriations process as authorization committees establish eligibility rules and payment formulas in multi-year legislation. Funding for mandatory programs is usually assumed to be available without appropriations action. The 2008 farm bill increased mandatory funds available for programs that appropriators or the Administration may want to reduce. The division over funding certain agriculture programs between appropriators and authorizers dates back to the 1930s. Outlays for farm commodity programs were unpredictable and based on multi-year entitlement-like programs. The Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) was created to provide mandatory funding, separating it from the appropriations process. However, tension arose in the late 1990s and 2002 farm bill over using mandatory funds for discretionary programs, leading to a debate between authorizers and appropriators on funding responsibilities. The CCC, created for farm commodity programs, is being questioned for funding non-variable programs like conservation and research. Appropriators limit mandatory spending without changing authorizing laws, using appropriations language to set restrictions on certain programs. This does not affect farm commodity or nutrition assistance programs. The FY2011 appropriation bill includes $2 billion in reductions and savings from farm bill programs, with $924 million in reductions from six mandatory programs. Additionally, there are large rescissions to unobligated balances in other program accounts totaling over $1 billion. These cuts were used to meet the discretionary budget. The FY2011 appropriation bill included $2 billion in reductions and savings from farm bill programs, with $924 million in reductions from six mandatory programs. Congress adopted earmark disclosure rules in 2007 to disclose earmarks and congressionally directed spending items. Earmarks specified in the explanatory statement accompanying the bill generally do not have the same force of law as if they were in the text of the law itself. In FY2011, appropriations earmarks became more formal and were incorporated into the text of the bill. The final FY2011 CR did not include earmark disclosure lists, and the short-term CRs canceled the effect of FY2010 earmarks. Agricultural programs with earmarks in FY2010 were reduced in the last short-term CR by the amount of the earmarks. In FY2011, earmarks were made nonbinding, giving agencies discretion to fund projects based on merit or formula-based criteria. Tables compare the impact of FY2011 appropriations on USDA program areas in more detail than before. The text discusses the impact of FY2011 appropriations on USDA program areas, including the rural development mission area and its three agencies."
