    "content": "The federal bureaucracy has evolved over two centuries through legislative and administrative actions, reflecting the influence of officials with diverse viewpoints. Organizational structures are shaped by competition between Congress and the President. Despite its perceived immutability, the bureaucracy undergoes continual study and alteration in response to changing contexts and priorities. Government reorganization is a process that may be undertaken in pursuit of administrative and political goals, involving purposeful changes in purpose, functions, procedures, assignments, and relationships within departments and agencies. This evolution is driven by changing needs, policy priorities, political contexts, and technology, with potential benefits and drawbacks. Government reorganization involves purposeful changes in purpose, functions, procedures, assignments, and relationships within organizations. It can occur within agencies or among multiple agencies, leading to changes in interagency processes and resource distribution. Congress holds primary responsibility for structurally organizing the executive branch of the federal government and promoting efficiency, transparency, and accountability in governmental operations. The federal government's structure and operations are shaped by Congress through authorizing and appropriations legislation, as well as oversight. Presidents also play a role in reorganizing the executive branch through proposals and administrative tools. Interagency coordinative mechanisms are used to bridge divides between entities with shared missions or functions. The report discusses tools available to Congress, the President, and agency leaders for executive branch reorganization. It also covers interagency coordinative mechanisms used to bridge gaps between organizations. Congress plays a key role in shaping federal agency landscape through legislative processes. Congress plays a crucial role in shaping federal agencies by delegating missions, powers, and funding, confirming leadership, and evaluating agency existence. Reorganization legislation can be initiated by Members, committees, or the President, with proposals referred to government operations committees for review. Reorganization legislation can be influenced by the President and may involve shifting funding and functions between offices within a department or agency. Historical examples include the establishment of the Department of Homeland Security in 2003 after the 2001 terrorist attacks. In 1987, efforts were made in the House to reorganize the Agriculture Department appropriations act for FY1988. A compromise was reached to shift most funds and functions from the assistant secretary office to the Office of the Secretary, following complaints from Jamie L. Whitten about the administration's agricultural conservation programs. In 1987, a compromise was reached to reorganize the Agriculture Department appropriations act for FY1988. Jamie L. Whitten expressed his dissatisfaction with the administration's agricultural conservation programs by cutting funding for Assistant Secretary George S. Dunlop. A new office of assistant secretary for \"special purposes\" was created, but without authority over the Soil Conservation Service or the Forest Service. Directors of those agencies were required to report directly to the agriculture secretary. The President and Congress have roles in reorganizing the executive branch, with the President leading proposals and using executive orders, while Congress can delegate functions to the President. During the 20th century, Congress granted the President limited authority for reorganization through \"presidential reorganization authority.\" This fast-track process facilitated certain reorganization activities, although it is no longer in effect. The President can delegate functions under Section 301 of Title 3 of the U.S. Code. The President of the United States can authorize department heads or officials to perform certain functions without needing approval, ratification, or other action. This authorization must be in writing, published in the Federal Register, and can be revoked at any time by the President. The President can delegate functions to department heads, which can be revoked at any time. This delegation allows for reorganization of authorities among executive branch agencies, but Congress must provide transfer authority for funds and resources. Congress has granted the President limited authority to plan and implement reorganizations in the past. Congress has granted the President limited authority to plan and implement reorganizations in the past, such as in the Foreign Affairs Agencies Consolidation Act of 1998 and the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The President is directed to submit a plan and report to congressional committees within 60 days of enactment, with the ability to modify the plan based on consultations with the committees. The President is directed to submit a reorganization plan to congressional committees within 60 days of enactment, detailing the transfer of agencies, personnel, assets, and obligations to the Department. This plan may include consolidation, reorganization, or streamlining of agencies transferred to the Department. Congress had previously delegated authority to the President for reorganization plans between 1932 and 1984, but this statute is no longer in effect. The \"legislative veto\" process favored the President's reorganization plans as they would go into effect unless Congress rejected them. Presidents regularly used this authority to propose various changes, including creating new organizations like the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was established in 1979. In 1983, the Supreme Court deemed the legislative veto process unconstitutional. Congress then approved the Reorganization Act Amendments of 1984, extending presidential reorganization authority until December 31, 1984. This allowed for an expedited procedure for Congress to consider and approve reorganization plans submitted by the President. The Reorganization Act Amendments of 1984 extended presidential reorganization authority until December 31, 1984. The burden of action was placed on proponents of the plan, making the process more difficult. This authority was never used and lapsed in 1984. Some administrations have advocated for its restoration, while others have not. The Clinton, Bush, and Obama administrations all called for a renewal of presidential reorganization authority, but legislation to renew it was not enacted during the 108th and 112th Congresses. Department heads have discretion to manage operations within statutory mandates. Since the 1950s, agency heads have been delegated powers, duties, and functions of component offices. The head of an Executive department can prescribe regulations for department governance and employee conduct. Congressional directives sometimes outline reorganization authority for departments, like the Homeland Security Act of 2002 granting specific authority to the Secretary of Homeland Security. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 granted the Secretary of Homeland Security broad reorganization authority, allowing for the allocation of functions and establishment of organizational units within the Department. This authority requires notifying Congress 60 days in advance and does not extend to abolishing any agency or program mandated by statute. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 granted the Secretary of Homeland Security broad reorganization authority, requiring advance notification to Congress. The final provision prevents the Secretary from abolishing entities, programs, or functions mandated by statute. Congress has occasionally endorsed agency reorganizations through the appropriations process. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 granted the Secretary of Homeland Security reorganization authority. A budget amendment was submitted in 2005 to modify the appropriations structure for fiscal year 2006. The conferees agreed to abolish the Office of the Under Secretary for Border and Transportation Security and split the Directorate of Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection into two new components. Federal Air Marshals were transferred to the Transportation Security Administration. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 granted the Secretary of Homeland Security reorganization authority, leading to changes in the appropriations structure. Congress can approve or disapprove reorganization actions by limiting funding or delegating authority. Agency heads are constrained by authorizing statutes, and Congress may also limit secretarial reorganization. The Secretary of Energy and Secretary of Homeland Security have reorganization authority, but Congress can limit this power. For example, the Secretary of Energy can reorganize the Department but not the National Nuclear Security Administration. Similarly, the Secretary of Homeland Security can reorganize most parts of DHS except FEMA. Congress may delegate reorganization authority to specific agencies within a department. The U.S. Coast Guard was transferred to the Department of Homeland Security as a \"distinct entity\" with its authorities, functions, and capabilities maintained intact. Congress limited the use of appropriated funds for reorganization activities by the Secretary of Homeland Security starting in May 2007. The U.S. Coast Guard was transferred to the Department of Homeland Security as a \"distinct entity\" with its authorities, functions, and capabilities maintained intact. Congress limited the use of appropriated funds for reorganization activities by the Secretary of Homeland Security starting in May 2007, with subsequent appropriations acts continuing similar provisions. However, the appropriation limitation was not included in the DHS appropriations for FY2017. Some agencies have faced restrictions on reorganization activities without consulting the Committees on Appropriations. The Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2017 restricts the reprogramming of funds for agencies funded by the Act, prohibiting the creation of new programs, elimination of existing programs, or augmentation of programs by more than $5,000,000 or 10 percent. The Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2017 imposes restrictions on fund reprogramming for agencies funded by the Act, limiting the augmentation of existing programs to $5,000,000 or 10 percent, reducing programs by the same amount, and requiring approval for creating or reorganizing offices or programs. Concerns about duplication, overlap, and fragmentation in executive branch programs have been highlighted by federal government observers and addressed in the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010. The statute established new processes for setting goals and measuring performance in crosscutting policy areas to improve coordination among federal agencies. Congress, the President, and agency heads have implemented interagency coordinative mechanisms to bridge divides. Mechanisms set by statute may be more durable, while those established by executive order reflect the President's authority. Agency heads may use directives to establish working groups for communication within agency silos. Interagency coordinative mechanisms aim to promote cooperation among agencies. Interagency coordinative mechanisms, such as working groups, task forces, and memoranda of understanding, are tools used to establish cooperation among agencies with shared missions or overlapping jurisdiction. These mechanisms often lead to changes in procedures and relationships within organizations, and can be established formally or informally through public law, executive order, or administrative directive. They are aimed at promoting cooperation among agencies with generally low profiles. Interagency coordinative groups and formal agreements can clarify relationships among agencies with overlapping jurisdiction. These mechanisms can improve policy formulation, reduce redundancy, increase efficiency, and facilitate oversight and accountability. They help address organizational problems without the need for structural reorganization. Interagency coordinative groups can help clarify relationships among agencies with overlapping jurisdiction, but they may also face challenges such as perceived power imbalance, limited control over resources, and increased bureaucracy. Interagency coordination through memorandums of understanding can lead to reorganization of procedures and relationships between agencies, specifying responsibilities and establishing protocols for sharing information. Such agreements serve various purposes in delineating jurisdictional boundaries and making lasting commitments for cooperation in shared policy areas. Interagency agreements serve various purposes such as delineating jurisdictional lines, establishing procedures for information sharing, collaborating in a common mission, coordinating reviews, and agreeing on substantive policy. In some cases, formal interagency agreements or contracts may be used, requiring congressional action for significant shifts in responsibilities or resources. Another interagency mechanism may be utilized to align with the President's policy direction. Presidents sometimes appoint high-level advisors, known as \"czars,\" to coordinate policy development and implementation among departments and agencies. This can be seen as a reorganization action that shifts authority and decision-making. The role and authority of these advisors can be unclear, leading to controversy and perceived lack of accountability to Congress. Government reorganization is often framed in terms of potential administrative benefits. Government reorganization is often focused on administrative benefits such as improved program effectiveness, efficiency, cost reduction, and policy integration. It also involves political goals as it redistributes power and resources. Government reorganization, while potentially beneficial in the long run, is disruptive in the short term, affecting power dynamics, relationships, and work flow. It impacts government workers, congressional committees, and interest groups, who all strive to achieve outcomes aligned with their interests. The distribution of power and resources during implementation can further shape the reorganization's effects. Increased independence for a regulatory entity may be viewed as beneficial by some, while others see it as limiting the President's control over the executive branch. Different perspectives may weigh potential benefits and drawbacks differently, with some prioritizing efficiency gains over disruptions in functioning. Research suggests that successful governmental reorganizations are characterized by political consensus on goals and approaches, achieved through negotiation and accommodation among affected interests. Unarticulated goals or lack of consensus may lead to instability and further reorganization. Reorganization directives may articulate goals to help achieve consensus. Successful governmental reorganizations require political consensus on goals and approaches, achieved through negotiation and accommodation among affected interests. Reorganization directives should articulate explicit goals and agreed-upon methods to assess progress and evaluate project success."
