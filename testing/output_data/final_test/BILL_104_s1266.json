    "content": "The Act of 1995 is titled the \"Economic Growth and Price Stability Act\" and includes findings and a statement of policy. The Congress finds that in the 25 years prior to the Act of 1995, the US experienced economic growth deterioration due to factors like government spending, deficits, high taxes, and regulation. Micromanagement of the economy did not alleviate economic hardship, and the goals set by the Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978 were not met, causing confusion about monetary policy. The Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978 created uncertainty about the aims of monetary policy, leading to volatility in economic activity and financial markets. There is a need for Congress to clarify the role of the Federal Reserve in economic policymaking to achieve long-term economic growth and lower interest rates. Political leaders worldwide are reforming central banks to focus on combating inflation and implementing appropriate monetary policies. The policy of the United States is to focus on price stability as the primary goal of the Federal Reserve, leading to lower interest rates and supporting economic growth. This is in line with global efforts to reform central banks towards combating inflation and implementing effective monetary policies. The primary goal of the Federal Reserve should be to promote price stability, emphasizing low taxes, respect for private property, and the stable purchasing power of the US currency. SEC. 3. MONETARY POLICY. Amendment to the Federal Reserve Act to emphasize monetary policy. The Federal Reserve System must define and maintain price stability through monetary policy. The Board consults with Congress twice a year on their plans for achieving price stability. The Federal Reserve System consults with Congress twice a year to report on measures taken to achieve and maintain price stability, including numerical assessments and descriptions of variables used for this purpose. The Federal Reserve System will provide Congress with an estimate of the time needed to achieve price stability, considering potential short-term effects on employment and output. SEC. 4. REPEAL OF OBSOLETE PROVISIONS. The Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978 is repealed, and the Employment Act of 1946 is amended to align with section 5(c) instead of section 11(c). The Full Employment and Balanced Growth Act of 1978 is repealed, and sections 2, 4 through 8 are struck, while sections 3, 9, 10, and 11 are redesignated in the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.
