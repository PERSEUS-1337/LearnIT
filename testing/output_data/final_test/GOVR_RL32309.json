BIS requested $2 million for this program in response to GAO reports highlighting deficiencies in foreign availability assessments and technology transfer analyses. Congress did not appropriate funds for this proposal in 2004. BIS also sought additional resources for export enforcement to prevent the diversion of sensitive dual-use items to countries of concern and terrorist entities, requesting an additional $3.8 million for enforcement personnel. However, neither the House nor the Senate Appropriations Committee included funding for these proposals. The House recommended $68.4 million in total funding, with $7.1 million earmarked for compliance inspections related to Chemical Weapons Convention enforcement, and $33.4 million for export administration. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended funding for export administration, licensing activities, and export enforcement. The Conference report enacted a total funding level of $68.393 million, with a reduction in the operations budget to $61.193 million. The Administration requested $320.3 million for the Economic Development Administration in FY2005. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees recommended funding for export administration, licensing activities, and export enforcement, with a total funding level of $68.393 million enacted in the Conference report. The Administration requested $320.3 million for the Economic Development Administration in FY2005. The agency's FY2005 appropriation was $287.9 million, with $257.4 million for EDAP and $30.48 million for S&E, a decrease from previous years. The Administration requested $364.4 million for the Economic Development Administration in FY2004. The House approved $318.7 million, the Senate recommended $387.7 million, and the final appropriation was $315.3 million. Authorization for EDA expired in FY2003, and hearings for reauthorization were held in June 2003. The Economic Development Administration Reauthorization Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-382) was signed into law on October 15, 2004, allowing the Secretary of Commerce to finance over 80% of project costs with federal funds. The bill also gives EDA the authority to let local governments keep surplus funds from projects completed under budget and use excess project funds to increase the federal government's share of the cost. The Administration requested increased funding for the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) in FY2005. The House approved $28.9 million, the Senate recommended $31.55 million, and the Omnibus bill provided $29.9 million for the MBDA. The President also requested $88.4 million for the Commerce Department's Economic and Statistical Analysis programs in FY2005, a $14.2 million increase from FY2004.

The House approved $400 million for 2010 census expenses, with $173.8 million for the short-form census and $146 million for the American Community Survey. Representative Hefley proposed an amendment to eliminate FY2005 funding for the redesigned short-form census, but it was defeated. Representative Wolf stated that the funding provided was the minimal amount viable for the 2010 census. The House approved $400 million for 2010 census expenses, with $173.8 million for the short-form census and $146 million for the American Community Survey. An amendment to eliminate FY2005 funding for the redesigned short-form census was proposed but defeated.

The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended FY2005 funding of $605.8 million for the Bureau. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended $250.6 million for the 2010 census, with a directive to allocate $82.3 million for the Master Address File/Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing System (MAF/TIGER). Additionally, funding for NTIA's Technologies Opportunities Program (TOP) was terminated for FY2005 appropriations. In FY2005, funding for NTIA's Technologies Opportunities Program (TOP) was terminated, with all current grants to be administered until their expiration. The total budget for NTIA in FY2005 is $39.1 million, compared to $51 million in FY2004. NTIA is the executive branch's principal advisory office on domestic and international telecommunications and information technology issues. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) supports U.S. efforts to open foreign markets, advises on international telecommunications negotiations, funds research grants for new technologies, and assists non-profit organizations transitioning to digital transmission. NTIA manages federal use of radio frequency spectrum and has three main budget components: Salaries and Expenses, the Technology Opportunity Program (TOP), and the Public Telecommunications Facilities, Planning and Construction (PTFPC) program. TOP was a competitive grant program for information and telecommunications infrastructure development. The Technology Opportunity Program (TOP) is a competitive, merit-based grant program that supports public broadcast stations and non-profit stakeholders in bringing educational and cultural programs to the public. Despite receiving no future funding, policymakers are considering transferring more responsibilities related to public broadcast transmission and television infrastructure to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Some argue for expanding NTIA's role in spectrum management with increased budget and resources. The US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) is funded by user fees and has a budget authority of $1.555 billion for FY2005, with $1.336 billion coming from current fees and an additional $219 million from a new fee structure mandated in the Omnibus Appropriations Act. This represents a 27% increase over the previous year's budget authority. The USPTO's budget for FY2005 is $1.555 billion, with $1.336 billion from current fees and an additional $219 million from a new fee structure. H.R. 4754 provided a budget authority of $1.523 billion, with $1.314 billion from existing fees and $209 million from expected fee increases. The Senate Committee on Appropriations reported that S. 2809 allocated $1.545 billion to the Patent and Trademark Office for FY2005, including $1.336 billion from current fees and $209 million from a proposed fee increase. This funding was higher than the $1.222 billion provided in FY2004, but still below the anticipated $1.303 billion in fees. Appropriation measures since 1990 have limited the USPTO's ability to use the full amount of fees collected each year, leading to controversy. Opponents argue that agency operations must be financed in the year expenses are incurred, while proponents believe fees help balance the budget. The Omnibus Appropriations Act for FY2005 allocated $708.7 million to NIST, with increases in funding for internal research and development and the Manufacturing Extension Partnership. The FY2005 Commerce, Justice, State appropriations bill allocated $524.9 million to NIST, with increases in funding for the Advanced Technology Program and the Manufacturing Extension Partnership. In FY2005, NIST received $524.9 million, 14% less than FY2004 due to lack of financing for ATP. Funding for intermural research programs would increase by 11.4% to $375.8 million. The Manufacturing Extension Program would receive $106 million, bringing support to pre-FY2004 levels. S. 2809 proposed $784.9 million for NIST, a 29% increase from FY2004, with $383.9 million for the STRS account and $112 million for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership. ATP would be funded at $203 million, 19% more than the current fiscal year. In FY2005, NIST received $524.9 million, 14% less than FY2004 due to lack of financing for ATP. Funding for intermural research programs would increase by 11.4% to $375.8 million. The Manufacturing Extension Program would receive $106 million, bringing support to pre-FY2004 levels. ATP is funded at $203 million, 19% more than the current fiscal year, with $86 million in appropriations for construction activities. Opponents criticize the Advanced Technology Program as \"corporate welfare,\" arguing that the federal government should not invest in research that could be done by the private sector. However, supporters defend ATP, stating it helps businesses, especially small manufacturers, develop crucial technologies for industrial competitiveness. Despite some funding challenges in recent years, Congress has maintained support for ATP and the Manufacturing Extension Partnership program. The Administration's FY2004 budget request and subsequent appropriations substantially decreased federal funding for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) program. However, H.R. 4818 restored financing for MEP in FY2005 to pre-reduction levels. Additionally, the Commerce, Justice, State, the Judiciary and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2005 provided $3.94 billion for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, exceeding the President's FY2005 request by $567 million. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005 provided $3.94 billion for NOAA in FY2005, exceeding the President's request by $567 million. The funding covered NOAA's Operations, Research, and Facilities account, Procurement, Acquisitions, and Construction account, and Other Accounts. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005 allocated funding for NOAA in FY2005, encouraging government outsourcing of mapping and charting functions. It also funded marine services, marine fleet cost-effectiveness, an Ocean Exploration program, an Integrated Coastal Ocean Observation System, seafood safety education, forensic tools for seafood pathogens, and invasive marine species eradication. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005 funded marine research programs under NOAA Fisheries, directed attention to species protection and dolphin encirclement regulations for vessel size. Funding was allocated for NOAA Fisheries labs, fishery conservation, and marine species habitat restoration. The act also supported Climate Change Research activities, emphasizing impacts of abrupt climatic changes and improved coastal weather forecasting for rural Alaskan communities. It encouraged undersea research participants to seek grants through the Ocean Exploration program and approved the establishment of a Pacific Services Center for managing satellite and buoy data.

Funding was allocated for NOAA Fisheries labs, fishery conservation, and marine species habitat restoration. The act also supported Climate Change Research activities, emphasizing impacts of abrupt climatic changes and improved coastal weather forecasting for rural Alaskan communities. It encouraged undersea research participants to seek grants through the Ocean Exploration program and approved the establishment of a Pacific Services Center to manage and distribute satellite and buoy data collected in Hawaii and the Western Pacific Ocean. The act urged Members of Congress to consider and act on the September, 2004 Research Review Team report, which assessed the state of NOAA's laboratory system. The act directed the National Weather Service (NWS) to \"take maximum advantage of capabilities and services ... in the commercial sector,\" and avoid duplicating programs and operations that distract NWS from its core mission. P.L. 108-447 sanctioned NOAA's realignment of financial and administrative organization along functional services, and consolidation of administrative costs under Corporate Services. On the other hand, the act did not approve of the Senate Appropriations Committee's method of reporting NOAA's budget in FY2005, corresponding with the agency's 5-strategic goals.

On the other hand, the act did not approve of the Senate Appropriations Committee's method of reporting NOAA's budget in FY2005, corresponding with the agency's 5-strategic goals. The conference report contained a budget crosswalk to the agency's five strategic goals for NOAA's ORF and PAC accounts. The act also consolidated funding and management of NOAA's premier educational programs under the Program Support budget line. NOAA was directed to report 5-year Acquisition Program Out-Year Budget Estimates, an Office of Management and Budget (OMB) practice discontinued for most non-defense programs three years ago. NOAA would report out-year cost estimates for PAC account programs having a total multi-year costs of more than $5 million. The act also required a report that detailed \"line office personnel, agency overhead, and positions, number of full-time equivalents, and salary-related expenses for each of NOAA's line offices. P.L. 108-477 would fund several construction and land acquisition projects previously authorized on a three-year basis under the Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Program (CELCP). The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005 funded marine research programs under NOAA Fisheries, directed attention to species protection and dolphin encirclement regulations for vessel size. It approved funding for a third Fisheries Research Vessel (FRV#3), long-lead procurement for FRV#4, a new hydrographic research vessel, and increased funding for NOAA Fleet Maintenance. Additionally, it allocated $90 million for the Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund for FY2005 and transferred fees to support the Coastal Zone Management Act. The Senate Appropriations Committee recommended funding of $4.1 billion for NOAA in FY2005, which is a significant increase compared to previous appropriations and the President's request. They also disapproved $700 million in program terminations proposed by the President and recommended NOAA to implement actions from the U.S. Ocean Policy Commission's final report. NOAA implemented actions recommended in the U.S. Ocean Policy Commission's final report. S. 2809 would have allocated $4.5 million to specific programs. Budgets for existing programs like Ocean Exploration and Ocean Health Initiatives would have increased. Excluding funding for the Ocean Commission Initiative, NOAA's recommended appropriations would have been $3.69 billion, similar to FY2004. The House passed H.R. 4754 for FY2005, approving $3.16 billion for NOAA, $210 million less than the President's request. In FY2005, NOAA's budget was $210 million less than the President's request, a 6.6% decrease, and $540 million less than the previous year. Funding cuts affected various NOAA line offices, with the National Ocean Service (NOS) facing a 42% cut, NOAA Fisheries (NMFS) a 29% cut, NOAA Research (OAR) a 23% cut, and Program Support a 14% cut. The National Weather Service (NWS) and NOAA Satellite Programs (NESDIS) were funded at requested levels. The PAC account would have been cut 14.3% below the FY2004 appropriation, with NOS construction projects targeted for termination. The House provided additional budget authority of $79 million derived by transfer from the NOAA Promote and Develop American Fisheries (PDAF) Fund, $13 million from FY2004 deobligations for ORF, and $3 million from FY2004 deobligations in the PAC account. The House appropriated $840 million for the NOAA PAC account, which was $59 million less than the President's request, and nearly $140 million less than FY2004 appropriations. For NOAA's Other Accounts, the House appropriated $80 million for the Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund (PCRF), which was $20 million less than the FY2005 request. It did not approve transferring $3 million to ORF from fees collected in the Coastal Zone Management Fund (CZMF), and zeroed-out funding of $8.1 million requested for fisheries financing programs. In FY2005, President Bush requested $3.38 billion for NOAA, with $2.38 billion for ORF, $898.5 million for PAC, and $104.5 million for Other Accounts. Additional budget authority was provided by the House, including $79 million from the PDAF Fund and $13 million from FY2004 deobligations for ORF. The House also appropriated $840 million for the PAC account, $80 million for the PCRF, and zeroed-out funding for fisheries financing programs. In FY2005, President Bush requested significant cuts for NOAA, including $130.6 million in program terminations for construction projects added by Congress in FY2004. Another $64.4 million in program terminations was requested for NOAA Research. The President also reduced the NOAA Corporate Services budget by $79 million and increased funding for the NESDIS PAC account to $897.9 million for satellite systems. NOAA's FY2005 budget request aimed to meet four major programmatic goals related to climate variability and change. NOAA's goals in FY2005 included enhancing society's ability to plan and respond to variability and change, providing weather and water information, managing coastal and ocean resources, and supporting safe transportation. The agency emphasized ecosystem-based management in response to recommendations from the U.S. Ocean Policy Commission. Proposed cuts in funding for NOAA Fisheries prompted investments in addressing environmental and species concerns. Future implications for NOAA's budget were also discussed in Congress. Legislation was introduced in the 108th Congress to create an organic act for NOAA, consolidating funding for agency operations and programs. H.R. 4546, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Act, was introduced in 2004 to establish a NOAA-wide organic act. In the 108th Congress, legislation was proposed to establish an organic act for NOAA. H.R. 4546 and H.R. 4607 were introduced to reorganize NOAA's administration and create new mission areas, but no further legislative action was taken on these bills. H.R. 4368, introduced in the 108th Congress, aimed to transfer NOAA to the Department of the Interior while maintaining its internal structure. The House Committee on Resources held hearings on this bill, but no further legislative action was taken. Another bill, S. 2647, proposed giving independent status to NOAA and was referred to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. S. 2647 was amended to retain NOAA in the Department of Commerce with greater budget autonomy. H.R. 4900 was introduced but no further legislative action was taken in the 108th Congress. Some support an organic act for NOAA, while others are concerned about its independence from the Secretary of Commerce's budget policy. The bills introduced in the 108th Congress aimed to provide NOAA with greater budget autonomy, but concerns were raised about its independence from the Secretary of Commerce's budget policy. Legislation similar to these bills may be reintroduced in the 109th Congress. H.R. 959 establishes a Coastal Ocean Program to enhance NOAA's research capabilities, while H.R. 1081 focuses on marine and freshwater issues. H.R. 1081 (Ehlers) establishes marine and freshwater research programs to prevent invasive species, educate citizens, and restore ecosystems. H.R. 2535 (LaTourette) seeks to improve economic development programs. Introduced in 2003, both bills were referred to House committees for review and approval. The Transportation and Infrastructure Committee approved H.R. 1561 (L. Smith) on June 25, 2003. The bill aims to modernize patent and trademark fees by lowering filing fees, increasing various fees, and adding new fees for trademark registration. H.R. 1561 was referred to the House Committee on The Judiciary on April 3, 2003, and approved by the Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property on May 22, 2003. H.R. 5117 (Schiff) introduces the FAIR Act, creating the position of Assistant U.S. Trade Representative for Intellectual Property. S. 1218 (Hollings) aims to support and coordinate interagency ocean science programs and develop a comprehensive U.S. research program. S. 1400 (Snowe) and S. 1401 (McCain) focus on ocean and coastal observations, enhancing security at U.S. ports, and reauthorizing the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Introduced in 2003, these bills were referred to various committees for review and development. S. 2280 (Stevens) establishes a national ocean exploration program within NOAA. S. 2647 (Hollings) makes NOAA an independent agency of Commerce. The curr_chunk provides a list of CRS reports on various topics such as state and local sales taxes, e-commerce statistics, manufacturing extension programs, and budget requests for agencies like NOAA and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The reports are authored by different individuals and cover a range of government programs and appropriations. The Judiciary budget is protected from presidential alteration by statute. The total appropriation for the Judiciary in FY2005 was $5.50 billion, with funding for the Supreme Court coming from two separate accounts. The Architect of the Capitol is responsible for the care of the Supreme Court building. The Architect of the Capitol is responsible for the structural and mechanical care of the Supreme Court building and its grounds. Justices appear before appropriations subcommittees to address budget requirements, with the Supreme Court receiving a small share of overall Judiciary funding. In FY2004, the total appropriations for the Supreme Court were $81.2 million. Total appropriations for the Supreme Court in FY2004 were $81.2 million, less than 1.6% of the Judiciary's overall budget of $5.16 billion. The majority of the Judiciary's budget goes towards funding the lower federal courts and related judicial services. The Salaries and Expenses account for the U.S. Courts of Appeals, District Courts, and Other Judicial Services is the largest among the lower court accounts, covering salaries, benefits, and operating expenses for various judicial officers and employees. Other accounts for the lower courts include Defender Services for compensation and expenses of appointed attorneys. The Judiciary budget request includes funding for various entities such as the U.S. Court of International Trade, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, the Federal Judicial Center, and the U.S. Sentencing Commission. The budget is presented to House and Senate appropriations subcommittees after approval by the Judicial Conference. The Judiciary budget request does not fund three \"special courts\" and federal courthouse construction. The requested FY2005 appropriations were $5.70 billion, a 10.6% increase from FY2004. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act provided $5.43 billion in total spending. The FY2005 omnibus bill, after adjustments, allocates $5.43 billion for the Judiciary, a 5.2% increase from FY2004. The act includes a provision for a cost-of-living salary adjustment for Justices and judges. Earlier bills proposed higher funding levels, with the Senate's measure providing $5.36 billion and the House's bill proposing $5.55 billion for the Judiciary. The FY2005 omnibus bill allocated $5.36 billion for the Judiciary, which was $230.2 million above the FY2004 total. The Senate's measure included a provision for a cost-of-living salary adjustment for Justices and judges, while the House-passed bill did not. The Judiciary's FY2005 budget request received two hearings before the House CJS Appropriations Subcommittee. Officials stated that a significant portion of the requested increase was needed to maintain current services. The Judiciary requested a $230.2 million increase in funding for FY2005, with $168 million for programmatic and workload-related needs. This included adjustments to pay and benefits, maintaining IT infrastructure, and legal representation for indigent defendants. Additionally, they sought a 1.7% cost-of-living adjustment for judges and a $55.7 million supplemental appropriation for FY2004. The Judiciary requested a $55.7 million supplemental appropriation for FY2004 to avoid adverse personnel actions in the courts and a three-week suspension of payments to court-appointed attorneys. Ultimately, $26.0 million was approved in FY2005 for compensation of attorneys representing indigent defendants. The federal courts faced critical underfunding in FY2003 and FY2004, with a budget request in FY2005 aimed at catching up. Despite increasing caseloads, funding in FY2004 was lower than in FY2002, leading to layoffs, early retirements, and furloughs for court employees. As of April 2004, layoffs, early retirements, and furloughs affected court staff. The House CJS Subcommittee expressed willingness to address Judiciary's funding needs, but budget constraints made additional funding unlikely. The House Appropriations Committee approved the CJS-Judiciary appropriations bill for FY2005 on June 23, 2004. The House Appropriations Committee approved the CJS-Judiciary appropriations bill for FY2005, providing $5.55 billion for the Judiciary, an 8.0% increase from FY2004. The increase was for inflationary pay adjustments, court security, workload increases, and IT infrastructure support. The Judiciary expressed concerns about Congress approving the budget. The Legal Times reported Judiciary fears of a \"hard-freeze\" on spending in the government-wide FY2005 budget, which could leave courts without funds for jury trials or court-appointed lawyers. Senator Orrin Hatch urged sufficient funding for the Judiciary in FY2005 to avoid crippling effects. Senator Orrin Hatch expressed concerns about the potential impact of budget cuts on the federal Judiciary in FY2005, emphasizing the importance of adequate funding for court operations. The House approved $5.55 billion for the Judiciary, maintaining the Appropriations Committee's recommendations. The Judicial Conference unanimously adopted a resolution urging Congress and the President to provide full-year FY2005 funding for the Judiciary to avoid significant staff cuts and operational expenses reductions. The Chief Justice urged Congress to provide funds for the federal judiciary for FY2005 to avoid staff cuts and operational expense reductions. The Judicial Conference expressed concerns about operating under a continuing resolution at FY2004 funding levels for up to five months. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved $5.36 billion for the Judiciary in FY2005, which was $230.2 million above FY2004 but $343.0 million below the Judiciary's request. The Committee stated that its budget recommendation aimed to maintain current services and retain current employees, not supporting program increases due to planned furloughs and layoffs. The Judicial Conference expressed concerns about potential furloughs, layoffs, and budget cuts. They urged directing funds to prevent personnel separations instead of hiring new employees. The Conference agreed to $225 million in cost-cutting measures, including layoffs and freezing courthouse projects. Up to 4,800 judicial employees could be laid off in FY2005 under a \"hard freeze\" on funding levels. 42 courthouse projects were delayed to reduce future rental growth. The courthouse project plan would be delayed to reduce future rental expenses paid by the Judiciary to the General Services Administration. The Judiciary officials expressed concerns about funding shortfalls in both House and Senate bills for FY2004. The Judiciary officials acknowledged the funding constraints in the House and Senate bills for FY2005. They decided not to appeal for additional funds to meet workload requirements but instead requested minimum funding to maintain FY2004 levels of services. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act was signed into law on December 8, 2004. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act, signed into law on December 8, 2004, provides $5.43 billion in total spending for the Judiciary, a 5.2% increase over FY2004 funding. The act appropriates $5.50 billion for the Judiciary, with a 6.5% increase over FY2004, but total discretionary spending is reduced by 1.34% due to across-the-board cuts. The omnibus bill includes a provision for a cost-of-living salary adjustment for Justices and judges. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act provided a 5.2% increase in total spending for the Judiciary, with a 6.5% increase for Justices and judges' salaries. The omnibus bill averted potential budget cuts that could have led to furloughs and court closures. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act provided funding to avoid budget cuts for the Judiciary, including a 4.7% increase in funding for the Supreme Court's Salaries and Expenses account. The bill also included a 5.2% increase in total spending for the Judiciary and a 6.5% increase for Justices and judges' salaries. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act allocated $58.1 million for the Supreme Court's Salaries and Expenses account, with a 1.34% reduction in total discretionary spending due to across-the-board cuts. Additionally, $10.6 million was requested for Care of the Building and Grounds, a significant decrease from the previous year's appropriation. The FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act provides $9.8 million for Care of the Building and Grounds account, $734,000 below the Court's request. The House approved $10.0 million, while the Senate recommended $10.6 million. The Court requested $3.9 million to maintain current services in FY2005. The Court's budget for building modernization decreased by $21.8 million, with requested program increases totaling $6.7 million for various projects including building security upgrades. The Supreme Court requested funds for security upgrades, including installation of alarms, surveillance systems, and communication systems in the new operations center for the police force. Justices Kennedy and Thomas testified in a hearing about the budget request, with discussions also including the idea of a tunnel between the Court and the Capitol Visitors Center. Justice Kennedy and the subcommittee discussed the feasibility of a tunnel between the Court and the Capitol Visitors Center. Concerns were raised about the Court's transparency in publishing information about its operations. The House Appropriations Committee approved funding for the Court's Salaries and Expenses account at $58.1 million, matching the Court's request, but recommended $10.0 million for the Building and Grounds account, $600,000 below the Court's request. Funding for the Court's kitchen renovation was not included in the recommendation. The House Appropriations Committee did not include funding for the renovation of the Court's kitchen in its recommendations. They requested a report from the Court on improving public access to Supreme Court proceedings within 30 days of the appropriations bill's enactment. The committee encouraged the Court to pursue internet and audio release of Court proceedings. The House Appropriations Committee encouraged the Supreme Court to pursue internet and audio release of court proceedings to provide insight into the Court's operations. They also urged the Court to control the cost of the modernization project and report any changes to the original scope. This request language was adopted in the FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved funding for the Supreme Court's Salaries and Expenses account and Building and Grounds in the FY2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act. The committee emphasized the Court's long-term personnel needs as a top priority. The largest portion of the Judiciary's budget is allocated to the Salaries and Expenses account for Courts of Appeals, District Courts, and Other Judicial Services. In FY2005, the House approved $4.18 billion (75.3% of total Judiciary funding) while the Senate recommended $4.13 billion (77.1% of total Judiciary appropriation). The Judiciary requested $4.32 billion for Salaries and Expenses, a 9.2% increase from FY2004. In FY2005, the Salaries and Expenses account for the Judiciary received $4.18 billion, which was reduced to $4.13 billion due to rescissions in the omnibus act. This amount was below the Judiciary's request of $4.32 billion, representing a 9.2% increase from FY2004. The House Appropriations Committee recommended $74.6 million for court staffing and operating expenses in FY2005, citing adverse personnel actions taken in FY2004. They also proposed additional funding for magistrate judges to help handle the increasing caseloads. The House Appropriations Committee recommended increased funding for court staffing and operating expenses in FY2005, including additional staff to address workload increases and funding for new magistrates in districts with heavy caseloads. They also proposed increased funding for probation and pretrial services offices to enhance offender supervision capabilities. The Senate Appropriations Committee expressed concerns about the Judiciary's request for program increases in FY2005, urging the Judicial Conference to prioritize retaining current personnel and providing funds to assist the courts.
