    "content": "In July 2009, the Senate Appropriations Committee reported on FY2010 State, Foreign Operations Appropriations, providing $375 million in ESF and $52 million in INCLE. The House approved a similar bill with $400 million in ESF and $52 million in INCLE. Congress also approved FY2009 supplemental appropriations, with $439 million in ESF and $20 million in INCLE. Additionally, $1 billion in ISFF funding was rescinded and reappropriated. The Administration's FY2010 budget request included $500 million for Iraq economic aid. The FY2010 DOD budget request included $1.5 billion for the CERP, with no request for the Iraq Security Forces Fund. U.S. assistance to Iraq has been provided through multiple appropriations accounts, and will continue to be closely scrutinized by Congress. In the early years of the U.S. effort in Iraq, most assistance was channeled through the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund (IRRF) and the Iraq Security Forces Fund (ISFF), totaling nearly $21 billion. In 2005, funding for security assistance in Iraq shifted from the State Department to the Department of Defense, a departure from historic practice. The Iraq Security Forces Fund was established under DOD authority, with State making policy and DOD implementing programs. This change was part of the FY2005 emergency supplemental bill. The Iraq Security Forces Fund was shifted to the Department of Defense in 2005, with the Economic Support Fund replacing the IRRF for economic aid by FY2006. ESF funded various economic development and governance efforts, excluding large-scale infrastructure programs and security forces training. It played a significant role in the \"surge\" initiative announced in January 2007. The Economic Support Fund (ESF) funds programs at local and national levels in Iraq, including governance support, infrastructure improvements, job training, vocational education, and democratization efforts. Other accounts like INCLE, Democracy Fund, and Treasury Department Technical Assistance also support rule of law, democratization, and financial issues. Humanitarian concerns are addressed by programs funded under MRA and IDA. Most funding for Iraq reconstruction has been appropriated under emergency supplemental appropriations legislation, as it is \"off-budget\" and does not compete with other aid priorities. Efforts to include Iraq economic assistance in the annual foreign operations appropriations bill have had limited success. In 2005, only $60.4 million of a $414 million request was provided, as some felt there were sufficient unobligated funds in the IRRF. In 2007, Congress rejected most of the regular FY2008 ESF and INCLE request for Iraq. In FY2008, Congress rejected most of the regular ESF and INCLE aid requests for Iraq, only approving humanitarian aid like demining and refugee programs. In FY2009, only demining assistance was approved. The Obama Administration planned to include all Iraq aid in annual appropriations from FY2010 onwards. The Bush Administration's FY2009 request included $397 million for Iraq reconstruction, with $300 million for ESF, $75 million for INCLE, and $20 million for NADR. In FY2008, Congress rejected most regular aid requests for Iraq, only approving humanitarian aid like demining and refugee programs. In FY2009, only demining assistance was approved, with no funds allocated for Iraq reconstruction except for demining assistance. The Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for FY2009 requires Iraq to match assistance on a dollar-for-dollar basis and transition assistance programs to the Iraqi government. It prohibits the use of ISFF funds for infrastructure projects, emphasizing that Iraq should fund its own infrastructure. The Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for FY2009 restricts the use of U.S. funds for infrastructure in Iraq, setting a maximum project cost limit of $2 million. The legislation only authorizes half of the Administration's FY2009 ISFF request, reflecting a move towards a diminished U.S. presence in the country. Total non-humanitarian foreign operations aid request amounts to $482 million. The FY2009 foreign operations assistance request is $605 million, similar to FY2008, but significantly lower than the $2 billion in FY2007. The request includes rescinding $1 billion from the Iraq Security Forces Fund to extend availability of funds until September 2010. The FY2009 foreign operations assistance request is $605 million, with a new appropriation available until September 2010. The trend in ISFF totals would be $5.5 billion in FY2007, $3 billion in FY2008, and $1 billion in FY2009. The Commander's Emergency Response Program (CERP) request was $453 million, to be shared by Afghanistan and Iraq. The $482 million foreign operations request included funds for Economic Support, International Narcotics, Law Enforcement, Military Education, and Narcotics programs. The largest amounts were requested for programs supporting improved governance, such as the Quick Response Fund. The Quick Response Fund ($45 million) is a key tool of the Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) that allow U.S. civilians to maintain a presence in the provinces and bolster local government. Other programs include the Local Governance Program ($55 million), Community Action Program (CAP) ($35 million), Ministerial Capacity Development ($60 million), and Economic Reform ($50 million) to support economic growth in Iraq. Funding was also requested to support national elections later in the year. Key programs supporting economic growth in Iraq include Economic Reform ($50 million) and Agriculture ($43 million). The supplemental request also included humanitarian aid for Iraqi refugees and internally displaced persons. The House-approved bill matched the Administration request for Iraq reconstruction aid, providing funds for various accounts. The House increased funding for the State Department Diplomatic and Consular Programs account for Iraq by 224% to $486 million to support the Iraq Mission through the first quarter of 2010. Funds are allocated for leasing facilities and civilian security needs as U.S. troops draw down. The Senate mostly followed the Administration request for Iraq reconstruction in the FY2009 supplemental. The Senate bill departed from the Administration's request for Iraq funding by not rescinding $1 billion from the FY2009 \"bridge\" supplemental and still appropriating $1 billion in the new supplemental. Additionally, the Senate bill matched the Administration's $150 million request for the State Diplomatic and Consular Programs account. The conference report on H.R. 2346 closely follows the Administration's request for Iraq reconstruction aid, with ESF provided at $439 million, INCLE at $20 million, and IMET at $2 million. The ISFF appropriation from P.L. 110-252 was extended for another year by rescission and reappropriation of $1 billion. $453 million in requested CERP funds is provided, with language specifying the use of at least $15 million of ESF for targeted development programs determined by the Ambassador, focusing on the treatment of women in Iraq. The conference report adopted the $486 million House level for State Operating Expenses, addressing the FY2010 request early to assist the Embassy transition. The FY2010 budget request includes $500 million for Iraq economic aid, with funds allocated for ESF, INCLE, NADR, and IMET accounts. The DOD budget request contains $1.5 billion for the CERP to be shared with Afghanistan, with no request for the Iraq Security Forces Fund. The House authorized $1.3 billion for the CERP, while the Senate authorized $1.4 billion in their respective bills. The House-approved FY2010 DOD appropriations bill, H.R. 3326, provides $1.3 billion, to be shared with Afghanistan. The House bill also includes $400 million in ESF and $52 million in INCLE for State, Foreign Operations Appropriations. The Appropriations Committee recommended specific allocations for USAID's Civilian Assistance Program and democracy and civil society activities. The bill emphasizes the incorporation of women in Iraq's stabilization and government institutions. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported S. 1434 for FY2010 State, Foreign Operations Appropriations, allocating $375 million in ESF and $52 million in INCLE. The committee recommended funding for specific programs like the Marla Ruzicka War Victims Fund and USAID's Ministerial Capacity Development program. The Bush Administration's key policy objectives included the economic and political reconstruction of Iraq, with ongoing debate on aid implementation and effectiveness. The U.S. role in Iraq has evolved since 2003. The U.S. aid program in Iraq has decreased over the years, reflecting a changed role in the country. The FY2010 aid request shows a significant decline in ESF funding. With the dissolution of the CPA in 2004, responsibility for assistance programs shifted to the Secretary of State. As U.S. forces draw down, there will likely be changes in how aid is provided in Iraq. The U.S. aid program in Iraq has decreased over the years, with policy guidance provided to the Iraqi government through the U.S. embassy. An Iraq Transition Assistance Office (ITAO) was established in 2007 to manage funding related to infrastructure, expected to expire in 2010. The embassy oversees activities addressing anti-corruption and rule of law, with U.S. military officers in charge of training Iraqi security forces. The State Department ceded responsibility to DOD for overseeing training and support of Iraqi security forces in 2005. DOD had greater resources and took over training for Interior and Defense ministries. State Department is expected to resume police training in Iraq in FY2010 as troops withdraw. DOD also administered development programs usually handled by civilian agencies. Army Corps of Engineers managed the embassy's Project and Contracting Office. The Army Corps of Engineers, Gulf Region Division (ACE-GRD), oversaw over $10 billion in FY2004-funded infrastructure construction projects. They reported to the Department of State and Department of Defense. USAID managed over $6 billion in assistance, focusing on economic, social, and political development programs. The State Department Inspector General found that aid functions in Iraq were dispersed among various actors and misaligned with traditional roles. Multiple agencies were involved in capacity development activities, but lacked coordination. Recommendations were made to incorporate appropriate assistance programs into USAID's portfolio. The U.S. assistance program in Iraq received funding from the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund (IRRF), totaling nearly $21 billion. Reconstruction priorities shifted over time, with emphasis on security, increased oil production, employment, and democracy. Large-scale economic infrastructure projects like water, sanitation, and electricity were deprioritized due to slow implementation and security concerns. The Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund (IRRF) allocated $5 billion for training Iraqi security forces, $10 billion for economic infrastructure, and a quarter for health, education, and policy reform. Positive outcomes included the completion of 1,200 security facilities, training of half a million security forces, and rehabilitation of health facilities. The Umm Qasr deepwater port and various infrastructure were restored in Iraq. Local governance was strengthened through councils and community associations. Over 6,000 grassroots projects were completed with USAID grants. Voter education and training led to successful elections in 2005. Schools were rehabilitated, teachers trained, and agricultural projects supported. U.S.-funded projects added 2,500 MW to Iraq's generating capacity. In Iraq, U.S.-funded projects increased generating capacity by 2,500 MW. Water and sanitation assistance benefited millions. Oil production rose to pre-war levels by 2008. However, there were delays in health projects, with contracts being revoked and re-awarded to Iraqis. Only 91 of 142 planned clinics will be completed with U.S. funding. Security concerns limited Iraqi train operations. Despite improvements since 2008, security concerns still impact the percentage of Iraqi trains running. Progress on national reconciliation has been slow, and the full impact of U.S. projects on Iraq remains uncertain. Access to clean water is a challenge for over 40% of Iraqis, and many hospitals lack basic supplies despite U.S. health sector efforts. Only 8 out of 1,156 bridges in poor condition have been repaired with U.S. transport assistance. Corruption and instability contribute to diminishing returns from reconstruction efforts. Despite improvements since 2008, security concerns still impact Iraqi trains running. Reconstruction efforts have been affected by the insurgency and lack of stability. A more peaceful environment since 2007 has led to improvements in various sectors. Reconstruction priorities in 2007 reflected the surge strategy and the exhaustion of IRRF funds. Military-security assistance accounted for over 62% of reconstruction appropriations in FY2007-FY2008. Economic-social-democratization assistance has also been a major element of support. The ISFF funded economic-social-democratization assistance in Iraq through three tracks: Security, Economic, and Political. The Security track supported Provincial Reconstruction Teams and USAID efforts for governance and stability. The Economic track focused on infrastructure projects, agriculture, and small businesses. The Political track aimed to improve governance, democratization, and rule of law programs at all levels of government. The Bush Administration's reconstruction aid program from 2007 to 2008 focused on security, sustainability, PRTs, governance, and humanitarian needs. The Obama Administration continued some of these programs but with a significant decrease in overall assistance levels, particularly in ISFF funding which decreased by two-thirds in FY2009. Support for the Iraq security forces will change in the coming months, with training of the military by ITAM and police by the Department of State. The pending drawdown of U.S. troops may lead to a decline in CERP and PRT activities. New AABs have been created to advise Iraqi troops. Economic aid from ESF and INCLE may fall by 17% if the FY2010 Administration request is met. Assistance in Iraq, including economic aid from ESF and INCLE, may decrease by 17% under the FY2010 Administration request. Concerns have been raised about the maintenance and funding of completed large-scale construction projects once handed over to Iraqi authorities, as some projects are not being adequately maintained. For example, power station units rehabilitated with U.S. funds were found to be non-operational due to insufficient maintenance, and Humvees provided to the Iraqi military are reportedly being cannibalized for spare parts instead of being properly repaired. The U.S. effort in Iraq focuses on capacity development and sustainability of infrastructure projects. Assistance includes training for personnel, funding for repairs, and development of policies for efficient use and maintenance. Nearly $300 million in ESF has been used for project sustainment, with additional support for physical protection of key infrastructure. The U.S. infrastructure construction program in Iraq includes security perimeters, lighting improvements, and forward operating base enhancements. The Iraqi government is responsible for long-term sustainability, but as of May 31, 2007, 2,363 projects valued at $5.3 billion were still awaiting transfer. Limited progress has been made in establishing an asset transfer process. Limited progress has been made in establishing an asset transfer process for U.S. infrastructure projects in Iraq. As of October 2008, $13.5 billion in completed projects had 72% transferred locally and 13% transferred nationally, but the data is considered unreliable. P.L. 110-252 withheld $10 million in funding until an agreement was reached with Iraq for asset transfer and maintenance of U.S.-funded infrastructure. As of April 2009, little progress had been made in reaching an agreement with the Iraqi government. Efforts have been made to improve the capabilities of Iraqi government ministries through training and equipping personnel. The Ministerial Capacity Development Program and the National Capacity Development Program (\"Tatweer\") have addressed deficiencies in knowledge of modern administrative systems. USAID's Tatweer program has trained over 70,000 staff in recent years, focusing on budget execution and service delivery to enhance the effectiveness of the Iraqi government. Governments struggle to implement capital budgets for infrastructure projects due to turnover in personnel, security concerns, lack of skilled personnel, and fear of corruption. Only a small percentage of the allocated budgets for 2006 were spent, leading to Congressional scrutiny. U.S. programs, such as Provincial Procurement Assistance Teams, aim to improve budget execution in Iraq. Since 2007, the Iraqi government has made significant progress in improving budget execution through the establishment of new procedures and training programs. In 2008, ministries and governors were allowed to enter into contracts at higher levels, leading to an increase in capital project spending from $3.4 billion in 2007 to $9 billion in 2008. The figure rises to $16 billion when commitments are included, although precise data is difficult to obtain due to definitional disagreements. In 2008, the U.S. spent $23.2 billion on critical sectors in Iraq, while Iraq only spent $3.9 billion from 2005 to June 2008. The U.S. required Iraq to match economic aid appropriations dollar-for-dollar. The U.S. spent $23.2 billion on critical sectors in Iraq in 2008, while Iraq only spent $3.9 billion from 2005 to June 2008. The 2009 Iraqi budget contains $12.5 billion for reconstruction projects, a decrease from the previous year due to falling oil prices. The U.S. Embassy established Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) in mid-2005 to strengthen local government outreach in Iraq. Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) in Iraq, established in mid-2005 by the U.S. Embassy, play a key role in providing access to parts of Iraq. PRTs consist of Embassy, PCO, USAID, military, and other U.S. agency staff, with the State Department as leader. Currently, there are 16 PRTs, including seven embedded PRTs within Brigade Combat Teams, created as part of the January 2007 surge strategy to stabilize areas alongside U.S. and Iraqi military forces. The ePRT staff in Iraq collaborate with local Iraqis to stabilize the area using U.S. and Iraqi government funding to create jobs and meet basic needs. They reconcile various government entities and work on establishing stability and improving local governance. By forming Provincial Reconstruction Development Councils (PRDCs), they identify projects for U.S. financing to strengthen local governments and achieve lasting support. The PRTs also assist provincial governments in enhancing their capacities to interact with the central government and utilize Iraqi government funds effectively. The PRTs in Iraq work on infrastructure projects like roads, bridges, water, sanitation, schools, and health clinics. They use funds from the central government and PRDC to implement these projects, with approval from the Embassy. A Quick Response Fund (QRF) supports local government, NGOs, and small businesses. USAID also runs programs with PRTs to address local concerns. The Community Action Program (CAP) and Community Stabilization Program (CSP) fund projects identified by local associations, addressing economic needs and providing youth programs, enterprise support, and vocational training in strategic cities. The Local Governance Program (LGP) helps build management skills of provincial government personnel. Commander's Emergency Response Program (CERP) funding supports local infrastructure projects in water, sanitation, and power sectors, complementing the work of PRTs and USAID in Iraq. The multiple assistance programs in Iraq, including the Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs), face challenges in coordination due to different agencies, funding sources, and authorities. Criticisms include lack of clear authority, missions, and objectives. Concerns about security obstacles for PRTs have been raised, especially as U.S. forces withdraw. PRTs rely on the military for security, food, and housing, with civil affairs officers making up 10% of staff. The FY2008/2009 supplemental withheld PRT operating expenses and program funds until a strategy for closing out PRTs was reported. Uncertainty exists regarding military support for PRTs until close-out conditions are met. The National Security Council aims to reduce PRTs to 16 by August 2010 and six by the end of 2011, transitioning their mission to a USAID program. Funding for this transition will come from the Department of Defense. The Commander's Emergency Response Program (CERP) funded by the Department of Defense provides money to U.S. military commanders in Iraq for reconstruction efforts. Approximately $4.1 billion has been allocated, with $548 million from Iraqi funds and $3.6 billion from U.S. DOD appropriations. The Iraqi CERP program, funded with $300 million, has ended due to declining oil revenue. CERP supports various reconstruction activities at the local level, including micro-grants, well-digging, and school painting. The Commander's Emergency Response Program (CERP) provides small grants for various reconstruction efforts in Iraq, including infrastructure projects like electric generators, water systems, and schools. Commanders have the authority to approve grants up to $500,000 with minimal bureaucratic hurdles. CERP funds are also used for compensation payments to Iraqi families and salaries for local security forces. The CERP program in Iraq saw a shift in focus from the Sons of Iraq to infrastructure construction projects, with an average grant size increasing over the years. The 2009 Defense Authorization set limits on project costs, with concerns raised about the program's alignment with military and civilian objectives. The SIGIR's concerns include the lack of mechanism to measure CERP project outcomes, high turnover of military personnel affecting project management, and insufficient focus on handing over projects to Iraqis for sustainability. Observers note that CERP grants are allocated without proper training, leading to concerns about the program becoming an alternative development program with little management. The program's early rationale for military-led reconstruction activities is challenged by the presence of civilian ePRT personnel. A SIGIR report highlighted conflicts between CERP funds and PRT efforts to involve local government. The impact of U.S. forces withdrawing from Iraqi cities on CERP effectiveness remains uncertain. Military contact with the local populace is crucial for the CERP's utility in promoting political and economic reconstruction. The U.S. has allocated $23 billion to build Iraqi security forces, with approximately 645,000 personnel in place as of April 2009. Despite initial challenges like poorly trained forces and militia infiltration, progress has been made, with 67% of Iraqi Army combat units now able to operate independently. The U.S. has allocated $23 billion to build Iraqi security forces, with approximately 645,000 personnel in place as of April 2009. Progress has been made in improving Iraqi security forces, but estimates of their proficiency are not publicly disclosed. U.S. security assistance funding now focuses on training and equipment, with efforts to enhance the capacities of the Ministry of Defense and Ministry of Interior. However, police training has not kept pace with the growth in police forces, and logistical challenges persist for the Iraqi military. The Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction (SIGIR) was established in response to concerns about reconstruction funds being wasted. SIGIR has conducted numerous audits, project assessments, and investigations, with estimates of $3-$5 billion wasted. Stuart W. Bowen, Jr. has been the SIGIR since its inception, and in a recent review report, it was found that the assistance program was burdened by waste but not fraud. The program was burdened by waste due to overuse of cost-plus contracts, high contractor expenses, and program delays. While some fraud was uncovered, it was a small percentage of the overall reconstruction investment. Misconduct centered on the CPA's handling of Iraqi funds, with inadequate controls over $8.8 billion. An April 2005 audit found that CPA managers in Iraq couldn't account for over $96.6 million in cash. Another audit in October 2005 revealed $20.5 million in missing funds and $2.6 million in excessive payments. Several U.S. citizens were charged and convicted for mishandling these funds. In 2007, more individuals were indicted, with four convicted and one pleading guilty. Investigations into reconstruction programs funded by the U.S. have uncovered poor project implementation and questionable management, often attributed to the Army Corps of Engineers. The Army Corps of Engineers oversees U.S.-funded projects in Iraq. SIGIR auditors assess project sites for proper work. Some projects, like the Basrah Children's Hospital, have faced issues such as cost overruns and delays. USAID failed to report on project costs and delays due to limited oversight staff. In September 2006, the Baghdad Police College, a $75 million construction project by Parsons, had deficiencies in wastewater plumbing. The Mosul police headquarters, costing $1 million, also had issues. A $218 million first responders network had communication problems. Only 6 out of 150 planned health care centers were completed after $186 million spent by Parsons. The construction of primary health care centers by Parsons was incomplete, with only 14 out of 150 centers finished. Iraqi firms were contracted to complete 121 partially constructed centers. A project to run oil pipelines under the Tigris River failed due to unsuitable subsoil conditions, leading to a waste of $76 million in funds. Task Force Shield, a program to protect oil and electricity infrastructure, was unsuccessful despite $147 million spent, attributed to a lack of clear management structure. Auditors were unable to determine the effectiveness of training programs and weapon purchases for Iraqis. An audit of \"design-build\" contracts for infrastructure projects revealed high administrative costs, with significant overhead expenses on projects by KBR and Parsons. Factors contributing to the high overhead include security concerns and delays in government direction. Inadequate accounting systems were found in four out of five contracts examined. Additionally, $133 million in funds for Iraqi security forces resulted in the purchase of 370,000 weapons without spare parts or accountability measures, leading to some weapons ending up on the black market. DynCorp spent $44 million on an unused residential camp for international police trainers. The audit found mismanagement of funds in various projects, including $44 million spent on an unused residential camp and $36 million for unaccounted weapons. Poor contract administration was identified in the State Department Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement. Lack of proper documentation and accountability was also noted in a $1.2 billion contract for training Iraqi police. Additionally, a $38 million project to provide a new accounting system for the Iraq Ministry of Finance was of limited use and suspended due to unclear government support. The Security Forces Fund found a lack of accountability for $1 billion in equipment purchase contracts. A 2008 audit revealed issues with the Nassriya water treatment plant, leading to water production at one fifth of its capacity due to government failures. Potential fraud of $6.7 to $8.4 million was found in the USAID Community Stabilization Program, leading to the suspension of the project in a Baghdad district. Waste from contract terminations, poor planning, and cost estimates resulted in $6.9 million being wasted on a water-supply project. In one case, $6.9 million was wasted on a water-supply project when task orders were terminated at the 60% design stage due to lack of funds. Another instance involved $142 million spent on task orders for fire station and police training facilities that were terminated. A 2008 audit of the $98 million Fallujah Waste Water Treatment System revealed a system costing three times the original estimate but serving only one third of the homes planned. The original U.S. plan for a low-power, low-maintenance system was rejected by the Iraqi Public Works Ministry, leading to a new system requiring thousands of gallons of fuel per day with no commitment from the Ministry. Numerous reports and articles have analyzed, criticized, and recommended action on the progress of reconstruction efforts. Several analysts have reviewed and provided recommendations on the reconstruction aid progress in Iraq. Notable sources include Anthony Cordesman, David Rieff, George Packer, Kenneth M. Pollack, John Hamre, James Fallows, and the Center for Strategic and International Studies. They have assessed the reconstruction efforts in Iraq in various publications. Several analysts have reviewed and provided recommendations on the reconstruction aid progress in Iraq, including Larry Diamond, James Fallows, Rajiv Chandrasekaran, George Packer, International Crisis Group, T. Christian Miller, SIGIR, and Glenn Zorpette. They have assessed the reconstruction efforts in Iraq in various publications.
