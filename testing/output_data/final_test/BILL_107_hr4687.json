    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Construction Safety Team Act\" and establishes National Construction Safety Teams. The Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology can establish National Construction Safety Teams to investigate building failures causing loss of life. Teams aim to determine technical causes to improve building safety in the United States. The National Institute of Standards and Technology can establish National Construction Safety Teams to investigate building failures, determine technical causes, evaluate evacuation procedures, recommend improvements to building standards, and suggest research for structural safety enhancements. The Director shall develop procedures for the establishment and deployment of Teams, including addressing conflicts of interest, defining circumstances for Team deployment, determining Team size, guiding information disclosure, conducting investigations, and providing additional resources as needed. The Director will provide additional resources and services to Teams, ensure investigations do not impede search and rescue efforts, give regular public briefings, guide Teams in evidence preservation, coordinate with other entities for research, and address any other relevant issues. The Director is also required to promptly publish information related to the investigations. The Director is required to promptly publish final procedures in the Federal Register developed under paragraph (1). SEC. 3. COMPOSITION OF TEAMS.\n\nTeams are formed by the Director with a designated leader and members including NIST employees, other experts, and government contractors.\n\nSEC. 4. AUTHORITIES. During building failure investigations under the Act, authorized Team members can enter properties, inspect records and building components, and conduct necessary tests. During building failure investigations, authorized Team members can enter properties, inspect records, building components, and conduct tests while avoiding unnecessary interference with services and coordinating with search and rescue efforts. The National Institute of Standards and Technology coordinates investigations with researchers and federal agencies, as well as cooperates with state and local authorities. Team investigations have priority over other federal agency investigations. The National Transportation Safety Board has priority over Team investigations. If a criminal act is suspected, the Team must relinquish investigative priority to law enforcement. This does not affect the Team's authority to continue the investigation. The Team must preserve evidence of a criminal act if suspected during their investigation under the Act. SEC. 5. BRIEFINGS, HEARINGS, WITNESSES, AND SUBPOENAS. The Director or his designee may conduct hearings, administer oaths, and require witnesses and evidence through subpoena to carry out the Act. Regular public briefings on investigative proceedings and findings are required, with a final briefing after the report is issued. Public hearings may be held by the National Institute of Standards and Technology to gather testimony and inform the public during investigations. Witnesses in investigations under this Act can be summoned from anywhere in the United States and are entitled to fees and mileage. Subpoenas must be issued by the Director and can be served by designated individuals. Failure to obey a subpoena may result in civil action by the Attorney General in a district court. The court may punish failure to comply with a subpoena as contempt of court. SEC. 6. ADDITIONAL POWERS. The Director may support Teams by procuring services, requesting resources from government agencies, conferring with employees, accepting voluntary services and gifts, making contracts with nonprofits, and providing nongovernmental members with reasonable support. The Director may support Teams by procuring services, requesting resources from government agencies, conferring with employees, accepting voluntary services and gifts, making contracts with nonprofits, and providing nongovernmental members with reasonable compensation for their time. SEC. 7. DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION. The general rule is that records, information, or investigations submitted or received by a Team must be made available to the public upon request and at a reasonable cost. Exceptions include information protected by law or not to be released until a required report is issued. Protection is provided for voluntarily submitted safety-related information. The National Institute of Standards and Technology shall not disclose voluntarily provided safety-related information if it is not directly related to the building failure being investigated and could inhibit the voluntary provision of such information. Additionally, public safety information received during an investigation under this Act will not be publicly released if it may jeopardize public safety. SEC. 8. NATIONAL CONSTRUCTION SAFETY TEAM REPORT. Within 90 days of completing an investigation, a Team must issue a public report with analysis of building failure causes, evacuation procedures recommendations, building standards improvements, and actions to prevent future failures. The National Institute of Standards and Technology will review the public report issued by the National Construction Safety Team and collaborate with relevant agencies to conduct research and promote the adoption of recommended improvements in evacuation procedures, building standards, and other preventive actions. The National Institute of Standards and Technology will review the public report issued by the National Construction Safety Team and collaborate with relevant agencies to promote recommended improvements in evacuation procedures, building standards, and other preventive actions to prevent future building failures. The National Institute of Standards and Technology will provide an annual report to Congress detailing investigations conducted by Teams, recommendations made, and actions taken to enhance building safety and structural integrity. An Advisory Committee will also be established. The Director will establish an advisory committee to advise on implementing the Act, review procedures, and issue reports. The committee will submit an annual report to Congress evaluating Team activities and implementation of recommendations. The advisory committee's duration is exempt from the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The advisory committee established under this section is exempt from the Federal Advisory Committee Act. The National Institute of Standards and Technology's activities in response to the September 11, 2001 attacks are subject to the authorities and restrictions of this Act. An amendment is made to the National Bureau of Standards Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1986. The Act does not grant the Institute authority to mandate building standards. Authorization of appropriations is granted for the Institute to carry out the Act. The curr_chunk is about the roles of the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Vice President of the United States as President of the Senate."
