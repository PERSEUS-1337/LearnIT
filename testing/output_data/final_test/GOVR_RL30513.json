    "content": "President Clinton signed P.L. 106-522 (formerly H.R. 5633) on November 22, 2000, appropriating funds for the District of Columbia for FY2001. The House and Senate approved H.R. 5633 between election day and Thanksgiving. Earlier versions of the act were passed in October, but the President threatened to veto due to objections regarding the inclusion of funding for Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State. The Senate passed H.R. 4942 for the District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY2001, including special federal payments of $448 million for court operations and criminal justice activities. The city's budget also includes increased funding for public education and economic development. The District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority approved the city council-passed budget for the 2001 fiscal year. The Authority approved a city council-passed budget for the 2001 fiscal year, including $445.4 million in special federal payments. Changes in the city's financial condition have led to improvements, such as a budget surplus for the third consecutive year. Proposed amendments in the city's home rule charter may alter the structure and efficacy of the District government. The Authority's role has shifted from direct management to oversight of the District government, supported by congressional backing for Mayor Williams' reform efforts. This change follows a budget surplus for the third year, proposed amendments to the city's home rule charter, and challenges in special education, foster care, Medicare fraud, and court operations. Resignations of the CFO and superintendent have also occurred amidst a 13-week delay in the city's financial report. The District of Columbia Management Reform Act of 1999 transferred administrative authority for the District's largest agencies to the mayor, aiming to improve city services and financial solvency. Reforms, federal assistance, and economic growth led to three consecutive years of budget surpluses. The District achieved budget surpluses for three consecutive years, meeting the requirement for the abolition of the Authority and the return of home rule. The CFO's delayed release of the FY1999 surplus report strained relationships and led to her resignation. The CFO's resignation was requested by eight council members due to various failures. Alice Rivlin noted a budget surplus for FY2000 and projected fund balance for FY2001. The city's public education system has undergone changes and will face challenges ahead. The challenges facing the city's Board of Education include improving student performance, supporting charter schools, hiring a new superintendent, and addressing issues with special education students. In 1999, there was a controversy over the chairmanship of the Board of Education, leading to the replacement of Wilma Harvey with Robert Childs. This highlighted the need for reform in the school board system in the District of Columbia. The debate over the size and election method of the Columbia school board was settled by voters in a referendum in 2000. Supporters of elected boards believe in accountability and democracy, while detractors argue they can be too focused on local interests and partisan politics. Appointed boards are seen as bringing more expertise. The debate over the size and election method of the Columbia school board was settled by voters in a referendum in 2000. Supporters of elected boards believe in accountability and democracy, while detractors argue they can be too focused on local interests and partisan politics. Appointed boards are seen as bringing more expertise. The mayor and city council settled on a hybrid board with both elected and appointed members after considering various proposals. The Board of Education in the District of Columbia was reduced from 11 to seven members, with residents given the option to choose between a nine-member elected board or a five-member board appointed by the mayor. Despite initial approval, there was criticism from Alice Rivlin, chair of the Authority, who warned of potential division. Eventually, a bill was approved by the city council and mayor to restructure the Board of Education pending voter referendum and congressional review. The Act aims to amend the District's Home Rule Act by reducing the school board to nine members, allowing voters to elect members from new districts, appointing an at-large President of the Board of Education, and giving the mayor the power to appoint four members with city council approval. The Board of Elections and Ethics certified a referendum question for a hybrid school board, estimating the special election costs at $371,000. The special election costs approximately $371,000. Voters approved the ballot question on June 27, 2000, and candidates for the new school board will appear on the November 7, 2000, general election ballot. Concerns were raised about the mayor's use of city resources and funds during the campaign. The Office of Campaign Finance ruled against the mayor on June 16, 2000, directing them to stop using government employees and resources for the campaign. The Board of Elections and Ethics upheld this ruling on September 6, 2000. The Mayor plans to appeal to the Court of Appeals to continue using government resources for the campaign. Congress has shown support for the charter school movement in the District of Columbia by providing additional funds and legislative authority. Public charter schools in the District have gained popularity, with nearly one in eleven school children enrolled in them. The District of Columbia School Reform Act of 1995 was amended by Congress last year to include charter schools as eligible entities for school construction and repair funds, providing $5 million in funds for public charter schools. The Public Charter School Board supports the conversion of Paul Junior High School to a charter school, despite opposition from some members of the Emergency Transitional Education Board and the superintendent of public schools. Two-thirds of parents at Paul Junior High School also support the conversion. This debate highlights issues surrounding the transfer of public school buildings to charter schools. The city council passed emergency legislation placing a moratorium on public school building conversions to charter schools, affecting future conversions. The authority to dispose of surplus schools was transferred to the mayor's office. Special education funding and addressing the needs of special education students have been a focus for House and Senate appropriators. District officials promised to address education-related issues. The FY2000 appropriations act for the District included $30 million for special federal payments to address the backlog in evaluating special education needs. Despite efforts to address concerns, the District's special education program has shown little progress in meeting the needs of special education students, who make up 15% of total public school enrollment. Bus services for students with special needs are frequently delayed. Bus services for special education students are often late or nonexistent, leading to significant missed class time. The school system is offering parents stipends to cover transportation costs in exchange for forfeiting their child's right to school bus service. Additionally, a special committee was established to investigate special education delivery issues. The city council formed a special committee to investigate special education services, with a deadline extended to September 2000. The superintendent placed top administrators on leave and implemented changes to address longstanding issues, including transferring assessment responsibilities to school principals. In 1999, a panel heard arguments for voting representation in Congress for citizens of the District of Columbia. Two cases were consolidated and argued before a special panel of judges. The District of Columbia currently elects a non-voting delegate to Congress. The plaintiffs argue for full congressional voting representation based on the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause, claiming that District residents are deprived of a republican form of government. The Justice Department argues that the Constitution only grants voting representation to states, not the District of Columbia. The Constitution outlines the composition of the House of Representatives and the Senate, as well as Congress's power over the District of Columbia. A three-judge panel ruled that District residents do not have a legal right to voting representation in Congress, a decision later appealed to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court affirmed the ruling that District residents do not have voting representation in Congress. The majority opinion suggested seeking political remedies such as statehood, federal enclave creation, or voting with Marylanders. The courts continue to impact the District government. The District government's budget for FY2001 allocates 7% of total general fund expenditures to court-appointed receivers, overseeing agencies like Child and Family Services, Mental Health Services, and District Columbia Jail Medical Services. Mayor Williams appointed a liaison to work on returning these agencies to District control. The progress of returning agencies under receivership to District government control has been uneven. The Housing Authority was returned by September 2000, but Child and Family Services and Mental Health Services still face challenges. A plan approved by Judge Thomas Hogan aims to return control of Child and Family Services by summer 2001 and elevate it to a cabinet level agency. Mental Health Services is set to return by April 2001. Health Services is set to return to District control by April 2001, and Jail Medical Services by the end of the year with the mayor's efforts. City officials are seeking greater budget coordination with court-appointed receivers. The District of Columbia Receivership Accountability Act of 2000 was introduced to enhance financial accountability and management of District funds. The District of Columbia Receivership Accountability Act of 2000 requires court-appointed receivers to consult with the mayor and CFO for budget preparation, follow procurement policies, undergo audits, and ensure costs align with standards. The Housing Authority, under receivership since 1995, may return to city control this year. Public housing residents elected three tenants to a board of commissioners for policy setting and contract approval. The court-appointed receiver for Child and Family Services requested $60 million in additional funds following the death of Brianna Blackmon, a 23-month old child who died after being returned to her mother, who had previously been charged with child neglect. This incident led to recommendations for additional training for social workers and requiring field reports to be provided to judges before hearings on a child's status. The court-appointed receiver for Child and Family Services requested $60 million in additional funds to improve agency services, including higher payments to foster parents and hiring more social workers. District Court Judge Thomas Hogan approved a plan to return agency control to the District, with requirements for elevating the agency to a cabinet level, developing licensing standards, and giving the agency responsibility for investigating abuse and neglect cases. On March 6, 2000, U.S. District Judge Thomas F. Hogan approved a plan to return the agency to District control after it deteriorated while in receivership since 1997. The plan involved removing the court-appointed receiver, placing the agency under an interim receiver, and transferring control to the District by April 2001. A monitor will oversee the District's administration of mental health services for the first six months post-takeover. The state of mental health services in the District was highlighted by a disturbing incident at a group home on February 29, 2000. Advocates for the mentally ill raise concerns about firetraps in group homes. Mental health officials mention lack of responsibility for housing once patients are deemed eligible for independent living. Approximately 200 unregulated homes exist in the District, with cases of fraud, neglect, and abuse reported. Recent testimonies highlight 24 deaths of group home residents with mental disabilities in 1999. In 1999, there were 24 deaths of group home residents with mental disabilities, totaling 159 deaths since 1993. The mayor pledged to improve health services for mentally retarded adults, including reporting all deaths in group homes for autopsy, forming a review committee, and hiring an outside contractor to assess residents' medical status. Legislation will be developed to create a commission to restructure services for mentally retarded group home residents. In May 2000, a former head of the day program branch of the District's Mental Retardation and Development Disabilities Administration was convicted of defrauding the city of $1.6 million in Medicaid funds. The District of Columbia jail's medical services, under receivership since 1995, have excessively high costs prompting city officials to seek removal of the receiver. The per-inmate per-day medical cost of $19 is far higher than the city's average. The District of Columbia's per-inmate per-day medical cost of $19 is significantly higher than the city of Baltimore's $5.18 cost. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 led to changes in the District's corrections system, including the closure of the Lorton Correctional Facility. Currently, D.C. felons are being transferred to federal and privately-run prisons, with public review of sentencing recommendations. The U.S. Parole Commission's role in parole decisions for D.C. offenders is also a current concern. The Director of FBOP testified about the challenges in transferring 2,300 D.C. felons to federal prisons due to overcrowding and the closure of Lorton. Efforts are being made to meet the closure deadline by negotiating with Virginia to house 900 felons. Transfer to private facilities is delayed due to environmental and legal issues. Advisory Commission on Sentencing is involved in the process. The 1997 National Capital Revitalization Act mandated the restructuring of DC's sentencing system to comply with federal guidelines, eliminating parole and indeterminate sentencing for felons. The Advisory Commission on Sentencing made recommendations for criminal sentencing reform, with new rules taking effect in 2000. The Advisory Commission on Sentencing recommended establishing a unitary sentencing system by abolishing parole for all offenders, providing training for judges on the switch from indeterminate to determinate sentencing, and allowing courts to impose supervised release periods based on the statutory maximum sentence. The Advisory Commission on Sentencing recommended abolishing parole for all offenders and establishing a unitary sentencing system with supervised release periods based on statutory maximum sentences. Public hearings have been held to increase awareness of new sentencing provisions, with a target date set for voting on the District of Columbia Sentencing Reform Act of 2000. The U.S. Parole Commission now makes parole release decisions for D.C. felons, with the D.C. Board of Parole retaining supervision authority. The D.C. Board of Parole supervised and revoked parole for D.C. parolees until August 5, 2000, when the U.S. Parole Commission took over jurisdiction. The Advisory Commission on Sentencing recommended legislation for maximum terms of imprisonment for revocation of supervised release. No additional funding was requested for the District of Columbia in the FY2000 budget recommendations. The Clinton Administration's FY2000 budget includes $445.5 million in federal payments to the District of Columbia, with a focus on the courts and criminal justice system. This includes funding for the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency, court operations, and the trustee overseeing the District corrections systems. The President's proposed federal payments to the District of Columbia for the federal prison system account for 84% of the budget. The Authority approved a $5.5 billion budget for FY2001, including a $150 million reserve fund. The budget also includes increased funding for public education, economic development, and general government support. Congress must approve the budget. The Committee recommends creating a separate appropriation for Defender Services in the District of Columbia Courts due to previous misuse of funds. An additional $18 million would be transferred from interest-bearing accounts, with $5 million available for FY2001 as unobligated funds. The $5 million available for FY2001 is a carryover of unobligated funds from FY2000, not included in total special federal payments for FY2001. The Administration's budget for FY2001 does not include general provisions, aiming to eliminate arcane, irrelevant, or inappropriate provisions from last year's appropriations act. Congress appropriates federal payments to fund certain activities and reviews the District's entire budget, including local funds. House and Senate subcommittees must approve and may modify the District's budget, reconciling versions in a joint conference committee for final passage. After reconciling the budget in a joint conference committee, the House and Senate pass it. The District's budget is then sent to the President for approval. The Congressional Budget Act requires passing a concurrent budget resolution with spending ceilings. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved a $441 million suballocation for the District, $4 million less than requested for FY2001. The House Appropriations Committee approved a $414 million budget authority for the District of Columbia for FY2001, $4 million less than requested. The bill includes $384 million for courts, prisons, and criminal justice activities, $14 million for a college scholarship program, and $7 million for a New York Avenue Metro station. Additional funds of $18 million are directed to complete the federal contribution for the station. The District's approved budget for FY2001 includes $5.496 billion in total operating expenses, with a proposed increase in funding for the Authority eliminated. The proposed severance packages for staff were criticized as excessive by the House Appropriations Committee. The Authority's budget of $6.5 million for FY2001 was double that of its FY2000 appropriation. The bill includes controversial provisions such as barring federal funding for needle exchange programs to reduce AIDS/HIV spread among drug users. An amendment allows city and private funds for such programs but prohibits federal funding. Another rejected amendment aimed to restrict needle distribution near certain facilities. The Committee included a provision in the appropriations bill that would require employers to pay for contraceptive services, even if they object on religious or moral grounds. The chairman of the House District of Columbia Appropriations Subcommittee tried to prohibit this provision. During the markup, an amendment allowing contraceptive parity was approved. In 2000, the House passed H.R. 4942, the District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY2001 by a close vote. An amendment was approved to transfer $100,000 for a study of the District's tax structure to help finance construction of a New York Avenue Metrorail station. The total federal contribution for the station would be $25 million. The House passed H.R. 4942, the District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY2001, with amendments including prohibiting public funding for needle exchange programs and penalties for minors possessing tobacco products. An amendment to eliminate a provision prohibiting the Health Insurance Coverage for Contraceptive Act of 2000 was rendered moot after a veto by Mayor Williams. The Senate Appropriations Committee reported a bill appropriating funds for the District of Columbia for FY2001, including $445 million in special federal assistance. The funds would be allocated to courts, prisons, criminal justice activities, a college scholarship program, and construction of a New York Avenue Metro station. The District's budget approved by the committee includes $4.680 billion in general fund operating expenses and $654 million in enterprise funding. The budget for FY2001 includes $5.334 billion in total operating expenses, with a proposed increase of $3.360 million for severance pay. The Authority is preparing to be phased out in anticipation of the District meeting the requirement for four consecutive years of balanced budgets. The bill includes controversial provisions such as barring federal and city funding for needle exchange programs, with the option for private funds to finance them. The Senate Appropriations Committee includes provisions on financing a needle exchange program with private funds, prohibiting the medical use of marijuana, and restricting funds for abortions. The bill also mandates a comprehensive financial management policy and amends the Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Act regarding the hiring and dismissal of the Chief Financial Officer. The Senate bill proposes changes to the city's reserve fund requirements, including the creation of two new funds: a contingency reserve fund for unforeseen needs and an emergency reserve fund for unanticipated expenses. This comes after the dismissal of CFO Valarie Holt due to delays in financial reporting. The Senate bill requires a 4% reserve of each year's operating budget for unforeseen needs like natural disasters. Deposits of 0.5% are needed to meet the emergency cash reserve requirement by FY2008. The bill was passed by the Senate and a conference version was agreed upon by House and Senate conferees. H.R. 4942, the conference report accompanying the bill, included appropriations for the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State. Despite the threat of a veto, the House approved the bill on October 26, 2000, and the Senate approved it on October 27, 2000. The President indicated he would veto an otherwise acceptable District Appropriations Act due to objectionable provisions in the bill. Congress later passed H.R. 5633, which did not include appropriations for the mentioned departments. President Clinton threatened to veto H.R. 5633 due to the lack of provisions for the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State. However, the bill was quickly passed by both the House and Senate on November 14, 2000. President Clinton signed H.R. 5633 into law on November 22, 2000, allocating $444.975 billion in federal payments to the District of Columbia for various purposes, including corrections, criminal justice, college tuition assistance, and infrastructure projects. The District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY2001 includes $5.5 billion in general and enterprise fund expenditures, with increases in funding for public education, economic development, and public works. There were cuts in other government activities, such as public safety and repayment of loans. The bill also includes controversial social rider provisions. The District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY2001 includes provisions that bar the use of funds for needle exchange programs to reduce the spread of AIDS and HIV among drug users. It also restricts the distribution of hypodermic needles near certain facilities. The District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY2001 includes provisions allowing the District to pass laws for health insurance coverage of contraceptive prescriptions, with a conscience clause for employers. It also prohibits decriminalization of marijuana for medical use, lobbying for statehood, and funding for abortion services except in specific cases. The District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY2001 includes provisions for establishing two reserve funds: a contingency reserve fund for unforeseen needs and an emergency reserve fund for unanticipated expenses. The act phases out the requirement for a $150 million reserve fund and mandates the city to deposit at least 0.5% of each year's operating budget to meet the 4% set-aside requirement for the emergency cash reserve. The District of Columbia Appropriations Act for FY2001 mandates the city to deposit at least 0.5% of each year's operating budget to meet the 3% contingency fund requirement by FY2006. Additionally, the act proposes establishing two reserve funds: a \"contingency reserve fund\" and an \"emergency cash reserve fund\" to replace the current $150 million reserve fund."
