    "content": "According to CRS analysis, IS supporters have been involved in 67 homegrown violent jihadist plots between 2014 and early June 2016, dominating the landscape. The FBI had over 900 investigations of IS suspects in the US in November 2015, posing a significant challenge for law enforcement agencies. The 67 plots can be categorized into three groups based on the actions taken by the plotters to support the terrorist group. The Departed, The Returned, and The Inspired are categories of American foreign fighters involved in IS-related plots. These individuals either plan to leave the US to fight for IS, have trained or fought with IS and returned to the US, or are inspired by IS propaganda to carry out attacks within the country. 41 out of 67 IS-related plots involved individuals in these categories, with most either departing for Syria or considering such a trip. The Islamic State has influenced individuals to either travel to Syria or carry out attacks in their home countries. They have encouraged American and European sympathizers to commit attacks during Ramadan and praised those involved in the San Bernardino shooting. Since 2014, individuals inspired by Islamic State propaganda have considered attacking targets in the United States, with five successful attacks out of 28 cases. According to CRS estimates, 5 out of 13 homegrown violent jihadist attacks since 9/11 were inspired by the Islamic State. These attackers had no sustained, in-person contact with foreign terrorist organizations, operating as DIY terrorists who acquired skills online or from social media aligned with terrorist ideologies. Some individuals inspired by terrorist organizations like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State have carried out attacks in the United States. These attackers often drew motivation from online sources or charismatic figures like Anwar al-Awlaki. For example, Omar Mateen pledged allegiance to the Islamic State before carrying out a mass shooting in Orlando, while Edward Archer shot a police officer in Philadelphia. These attackers operated as DIY terrorists, acquiring skills and justification for their actions from online sources. The FBI is investigating an incident where a man assaulted a police officer in his patrol vehicle, confessing to the crime and mentioning the Islamic State. In a separate incident, a husband and wife killed 14 people in a shooting at a social services facility in San Bernardino, CA, pledging allegiance to the Islamic State. In 2011, Farook and neighbor Marquez planned a terrorist attack on State Route 91 and Riverside Community College in California using firearms and explosives. The rifles they obtained were used in the San Bernardino shooting. Farook radicalized Marquez with extremist ideology. In November 2015, Faisal Mohammad stabbed a student at the University of California, Merced. In March 2016, FBI investigation revealed evidence that Faisal Mohammad may have been inspired by Islamic State propaganda. In May 2015, Elton Simpson and Nadir Soofi were killed in Garland, TX, while trying to attack an exhibition. Abdul Malik Abdul Kareem conspired with them but was not directly involved in the shootout. Kareem was found guilty of supporting the Islamic State in March 2016. The threat of IS foreign fighters to U.S. interests includes unidentified Americans fighting for the Islamic State, some of whom may return home undetected, while others may never come back. Additionally, foreign IS adherents from outside the U.S. or non-American fighters within IS ranks could pose a risk by attempting to enter the United States. The U.S. law enforcement must identify and preempt potential terrorists linked to the Islamic State, drawing on resources developed post-9/11. Additional efforts target IS threats, including maintaining datasets to stop known or suspected terrorists from traveling to IS territory. The National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) uses the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE) as a central repository of information on international terrorist identities, helping authorities track and prevent potential threats. TIDE includes information on individuals involved in terrorism activities, excluding purely domestic terrorism. In late 2013, TIDE held identities of 1.1 million people, including 25,000 U.S. citizens and residents. NCTC works with European partners to track foreign fighters in Syria. TIDE serves as an analytic tool for identifying and sharing information on terrorists. NCTC's Pursuit Group uses this information to identify foreign fighters entering Syria with connections to the Homeland. The cache of documents received in 2016 included personnel files of over 22,000 alleged IS members, potentially aiding intelligence agencies. The Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) is crucial for identifying terrorism-related threats, containing biographic identifiers and biometric information of individuals with ties to terrorism. TIDE feeds into the TSDB, which held around 800,000 people in November 2014. The Terrorist Screening Center (TSC) maintains the TSDB with information from the Terrorist Watchlist. Screening and interdiction, law enforcement investigation, and government activities aim to prevent terrorist activity. Portions of the TSDB are shared with federal agencies for screening activities like background checks and reviewing passport and visa applicants. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) uses the Terrorist Screening Database (TSDB) to identify known or suspected terrorists, including Americans who have joined the Islamic State. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Transportation Security Administration (TSA) rely on the TSDB to screen travelers at U.S. borders, potentially intercepting returning American IS members. CBP uses TSDB to test travelers' identities and mitigate risks posed by those destined for the US, including Americans who fought with the Islamic State. DHS coordinates with allies on foreign fighters, and CBP works to address risks at each stage of the international travel process. DHS has expanded liaison with international officials on foreign fighters involved in Syria and Iraq. State Department and DHS focus on visa security to identify IS fighters seeking U.S. visas. The State Department Bureau of Consular Affairs issues visas and uses tools for national security reviews, including \"Kingfisher Expansion\" (KFE) program that examines all visa applicants for terrorism connections. ICE, under DHS, operates the Visa Security Program to prevent terrorists and criminals from entering the US through legal visas. They conduct fraud checks, investigations, and provide training to State Department officials. In 2014, DHS expanded information collection from Visa Waiver Program (VWP) travelers through ESTA to enhance security measures for travelers from VWP countries. ESTA is used by CBP to assess potential security risks before travelers board flights to the United States, denying thousands of risky travelers entry. However, ESTA is a biographic, not biometric, security check. In 2015, DHS enhanced security criteria for countries in the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) and Congress passed legislation with new eligibility requirements for the VWP. Foreign travelers in the VWP now need to use e-Passports, and the FBI focuses on investigating terrorism cases involving suspects known as \"the departed\" and \"the returned.\" The FBI investigates terrorism cases involving suspects known as \"the departed,\" \"the returned,\" and \"the inspired.\" They collaborate with other U.S. federal agencies, state, local, and foreign governments for assistance. Joint Terrorism Task Forces (JTTFs) led by the FBI coordinate federal counterterrorism investigations across the country, with over 100 JTTFs nationwide. Joint Terrorism Task Forces (JTTFs) are multiagency teams that investigate terrorism and terrorism-related crimes. They gather leads, evidence, and information, analyze it, and help develop cases for prosecution in federal court. JTTF members share information with federal, state, and local partners to coordinate counterterrorism efforts. Over 4,100 federal, state, and local law enforcement officers and agents work on JTTFs, more than four times the total prior to 9/11. The development of state and major urban area fusion centers has increased information sharing on terrorist threats. These centers, controlled by state and local entities and supported by the federal government, bring together law enforcement professionals to share threat information and intelligence analysis. Sharing includes reporting suspicious activity for investigation and exchanging finished intelligence on existing threats. The U.S. government faces the challenge of preventing radicalized individuals from turning into terrorists, especially in relation to the Islamic State. Efforts by the FBI, DHS, and NCTC focus on understanding motivations for radicalization. Counter-radicalization approaches involve government engagement with affected communities, with a strategy aimed at countering violent extremism (CVE), primarily in the domestic arena. The Administration's CVE strategy focuses on countering the radicalization of potential terrorists, including violent jihadists. A Countering Violent Extremism Task Force was created to coordinate federal efforts and partnerships in this area. The task force, consisting of representatives from 11 departments and agencies, will organize federal research and analysis, engagements, and technical assistance to support ongoing and future CVE initiatives. The Countering Violent Extremism Task Force will coordinate federal outreach, engagement, and technical assistance to CVE stakeholders. They will manage communications, interventions, and develop multidisciplinary programs with stakeholders. Examples of interagency efforts include supporting locally based violent extremism prevention and intervention pilot frameworks. The DHS and NCTC conduct exercises with local law enforcement and community leaders to prepare for terrorist threats. The Community Awareness Briefing informs communities about terrorist recruitment, including efforts by extremist groups in Syria and Iraq. The office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties in DHS engages with communities on topics like Syria and World Refugee Day."
