    "content": "Since 1988, Congress has passed laws regarding television reception via satellite, including the Satellite Home Viewer Act (SHVA) and its amendments. The most recent law is the Satellite Home Viewer Extension and Reauthorization Act (SHVERA), which made changes to provisions for consumers receiving analog \"distant network signals\" and \"local-into-local\" network signals. Eligibility criteria are based on signal strength, distant and local signals, and unserved households. Signal strength is determined by proximity to a TV station's transmitter. The inner circle near the transmitter receives a strong \"Grade A\" TV signal, while the outer circle gets a weaker \"Grade B\" signal. Beyond the outer circle are \"white areas\" with no signal. Signal strength determines eligibility for receiving distant network signals via satellite. Local-into-local signals are retransmitted within the same local area, while distant network signals come from outside the local affiliate's area. signals were first offered to satellite television subscribers in 1999 under the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act (SHVIA), permitting local-into-local signals for eligible households. Only unserved households can receive distant network television signals via satellite, defined as those unable to receive a \"grade B\" signal via an over-the-air antenna or with satellite TV dishes on recreational vehicles or commercial trucks. In the late 1990s, satellite television companies broadcast distant network signals to ineligible subscribers, leading to a lawsuit by broadcasters. PrimeTime 24 violated the Satellite Home Viewer Act by retransmitting signals to both served and unserved households. A federal court ruled in favor of broadcasters, but Congress allowed \"grandfathered subscribers\" to continue receiving signals until 2004 under the SHVIA legislation. Subscribers could also opt for local-into-local signals when available. In 2004, Congress passed SHVERA, which differentiated subscribers into three groups: grandfathered, other, and future subscribers. Those receiving distant network signals illegally had to choose between them or local-into-local signals. Legally receiving households also had to make this choice within 60 days of notification. Under SHVERA, households who received distant network signals legally had the option to receive both distant network signals and local-into-local signals if local-into-local service was available in their area on January 1, 2005. If local-into-local service became available later, they had to choose between the two. Subscribers who signed up for satellite television after December 8, 2004, could receive distant network signals if local-into-local service was not available in their area. Once local-into-local service was offered, they had to switch to that service and could no longer receive distant network signals. Subscribers receiving distant network signals before SHVERA was enacted could continue to do so if local-into-local was not available. Those who signed up for satellite TV after SHVERA could receive distant network signals if local-into-local was not offered. Once local-into-local became available, they had to choose between the two services. In 1998, EchoStar Communications (DISH Network) was found to violate the Satellite Home Viewer Act. Despite legal battles, their distant network signals remained unaffected. However, in 2006, an Atlanta appeals court issued a permanent injunction on EchoStar's carriage of all distant signals. Negotiations were held with major broadcast networks to set new terms for EchoStar's services. EchoStar reached settlements with three major broadcast networks but not with FOX due to allegations of unfair competition. A Florida district court upheld an injunction and voided a proposed settlement, setting a signal cutoff date for December 1, 2006. Several major networks including CBS, NBC, and EchoStar were involved in a legal dispute. Legislation was introduced to lessen the impact of an injunction, but none passed before the December 1, 2006, signal cutoff date."
