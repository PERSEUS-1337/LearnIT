    "content": "The purpose of this Act is to increase global stability and security, reduce trafficking and discrimination, and decrease the number of stateless individuals who are excluded from civil society. Congress finds that the right to a nationality is a fundamental human right, essential for regional stability and security. Millions of people were displaced and deprived of their nationalities after World War II, leading to adverse effects of statelessness in the 21st century. The adverse effects of statelessness impact an estimated 11,000,000 people worldwide, leading to severe hardships and discrimination, including the inability to pursue lawful employment, own property, and enjoy legally protected family bonds. Stateless individuals are vulnerable to trafficking and organized criminal groups. Victims of trafficking struggle with repatriation and accessing essential services, urging the international community to prioritize birth registration and provide better pathways to legal residency or citizenship. Respecting the right of nationality enhances regional security by offering peaceful avenues for addressing grievances. Countries have the sovereign right to determine citizenship procedures, linked to preventing statelessness. The 1954 and 1961 Conventions aim to prevent statelessness and protect individuals without effective nationality. Approximately 11 million people worldwide face de jure or de facto statelessness due to various factors. Individuals who are stateless face challenges such as lack of nationality, rights to residence, travel, work, education, healthcare, property ownership, voting, and holding office. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights emphasizes the importance of birth registration and acquiring nationality for every child. UNICEF works with governments to promote birth registration and documentation, facing challenges in resources. Women have equal rights to transmit nationality to their children. UNHCR works to prevent statelessness and provide remedies. The UNHCR lacks resources to systematically address statelessness and provide solutions for millions of stateless individuals. The United Nations is addressed in Section 3. The policy of the United States is to work with the international community to support the UNHCR in addressing statelessness issues and promoting the rights of stateless individuals. This includes increasing UN attention to statelessness, coordinating efforts to reduce statelessness globally, and urging UN country teams to take action in affected countries.
