The Postal Civil Service Retirement System Funding Reform Act of 2003 amends definitions in Section 8331 of title 5, United States Code, including changes to the terms \"normal cost\" and \"fund balance.\" The Postal Civil Service Retirement System Funding Reform Act of 2003 introduces new definitions related to dynamic assumptions for retirement systems in determining actuarial costs and liabilities. It also amends Section 8334(a)(1) of title 5, United States Code, regarding deductions and contributions. The Postal Civil Service Retirement System Funding Reform Act of 2003 introduces changes to Section 8334(a)(1) of title 5, United States Code, regarding contributions for employees, including those of the United States Postal Service. The Postal Civil Service Retirement System Funding Reform Act of 2003 amends Section 8334(k) of title 5, United States Code, regarding employee contribution deductions. The Postal Civil Service Retirement System Funding Reform Act of 2003 amends Section 8348(h) of title 5, United States Code, defining Postal supplemental liability as the estimated excess of future benefits over deductions from employees' basic pay. The United States Postal Service's financial obligations under Section 8334 include future contributions, Fund balance payments, and other appropriate amounts determined by the Office. The actuarial present value of future benefits is computed in accordance with actuarial practices and principles. The Office includes military and volunteer service benefits for USPS employees in the actuarial present value calculation. A schedule is set to pay off the Postal supplemental liability by 2043. The Office will redetermine the Postal supplemental liability annually from 2003 to 2038, establishing new amortization schedules for each fiscal year. The liability will be liquidated by 2043. After 2038, a new schedule will be set for a 5-year liquidation period, following actuarial practices. The United States Postal Service must pay determined amounts to the Office based on actuarial practices and principles, with interest calculated at the rate from the most recent valuation of the Civil Service Retirement System. Any established amortization schedule will override previous ones. Payments under this subsection will disregard a portion of the unfunded liability that will be liquidated through these payments. The Postal Service can request reconsideration and review of determinations made by the Office, subject to the same process as provided under section 8423(c). Certain provisions of law are repealed, but payments made before the enactment of this Act are not affected. The enactment of this Act under provisions of law repealed by paragraph (1) is not affected. SEC. 3. DISPOSITION OF SAVINGS ACCRUING TO THE UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE. Savings accruing to the United States Postal Service from this Act will be used to reduce postal debt in specific fiscal years and maintain postage rates unchanged. The savings accrued by the Postal Service from the Act will be considered operating expenses and held in escrow until otherwise provided by law. The Office of Personnel Management will calculate the savings each fiscal year based on a specific methodology outlined by July 31, 2003. The Postal Service must submit a plan to the House Committee on Government Reform and the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, formulated in consultation with the Postal Service, allowing for reconsideration of computations and adjustments by the Board of Actuaries. The Postal Service must report the amount applied towards reducing postal debt in each report under section 2402 of title 39, including the size of the postal debt before and after the application of the plan. The Congress believes that the savings from the Act will help the Postal Service maintain postage rates until 2006. Some savings should be used for postretirement health benefits, not executive bonuses. The Postal Service must submit a proposal for reconsideration of debt reduction plans. The United States Postal Service is required to submit a proposal detailing how savings from the Act should be spent after fiscal year 2005. Considerations include debt repayment, postretirement healthcare benefits, and capital investments for productivity and cost savings. The United States Postal Service must submit a proposal on how savings from the Act should be allocated, including debt repayment, postretirement healthcare benefits, productivity and cost-saving capital investments, delaying postal rate increases, and any other relevant matters. The President's Commission on the USPS will also be involved. The General Accounting Office will review and report on the proposal within 60 days, and legislative action must be taken within 180 days of receiving the proposal. After receiving the Postal Service's proposal and the General Accounting Office's evaluation, Congress will reconsider how the Postal Service's savings should be utilized. If a surplus is determined by the Office of Personnel Management, the Postmaster General will be informed, and necessary actions will be taken. The Postmaster General must submit a report to Congress detailing how the Postal Service plans to use any surplus, along with any necessary legislation. The determination date for this action is set for September 30, 2025, or an earlier date when all postal employees under the Civil Service Retirement System have retired. The savings accruing to the Postal Service as a result of the Act will be calculated annually. The term \"postal debt\" refers to the outstanding obligations of the Postal Service as determined under title 39, United States Code. SEC. 4. EFFECTIVE DATE. This Act and its amendments will take effect on the enactment date, with specific amendments applying to pay periods starting after that date."
