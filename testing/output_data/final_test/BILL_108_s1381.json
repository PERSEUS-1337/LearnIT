    "content": "The Act titled \"Reforestation Tax Act of 2003\" includes a section on partial inflation adjustment for timber in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The \"Reforestation Tax Act of 2003\" allows taxpayers with qualified timber gain to deduct a percentage of the gain from gross income. Qualified timber gain refers to long-term capital gain from timber sales. The qualified percentage is determined by multiplying 3 percent by the number of years the taxpayer held the timber. Estates and trusts can also claim this deduction, excluding gains from capital assets sales. The tax code allows income beneficiaries of trusts to include gains from capital asset exchanges in their gross income. Coordination with maximum capital gains tax rates includes qualified timber gain with an election under section 1203. The tax code is amended to exclude qualified timber gain from net capital gain calculations for corporations. A deduction for timber is allowed in computing adjusted gross income, and technical amendments are made to exclude deductions under sections 1202 and 1203.

SEC. 3 introduces a 100 percent deduction for reforestation expenditures to replace amortization, effective for sales or exchanges after December 31, 2002. In the case of qualified timber property, a deduction is allowed for reforestation expenditures paid or incurred by the taxpayer. Qualified timber property refers to land in the U.S. used for growing trees for commercial purposes. Reforestation expenditures are direct costs for planting and caring for trees. Reforestation expenditures are direct costs incurred for forestation or reforestation, including site preparation, seeds or seedlings, labor, and tools. Expenditures reimbursed under governmental cost-sharing programs are not included unless reimbursed amounts are included in the taxpayer's gross income. The amendment to the tax code allows for the deduction of reforestation expenditures as if the life tenant were the absolute owner of the property. Additionally, the amortization of reforestation expenditures will no longer apply to amounts paid or incurred after a certain date. The amendments made by this section apply to reforestation expenditures and the application of passive activity loss limitations to timber activities. The amendments in this section exempt individuals in closely held entities engaged in timber activities from certain Treasury Regulations if management hours are typically less than 100 per year. Definitions include \"timber activity\" as tree-related tasks and \"closely held entity\" as ownership by 5 or fewer individuals or family members. The amendments made by this section apply to taxable years starting after December 31, 2002."
