    "content": "The algorithm Guided-VAE enhances generative model learning through latent representation disentanglement. It introduces unsupervised and supervised strategies to improve modeling and control capabilities over vanilla VAE. The unsupervised strategy involves a lightweight decoder for learning latent transformations, while the supervised strategy uses an adversarial mechanism for disentangling latent variables. Guided-VAE is transparent and simple for representation and disentanglement learning tasks. The resurgence of autoencoders and variational autoencoders has led to advancements in representation learning and generative modeling. Generative adversarial networks focus on the generation process but do not target disentanglement learning. In this paper, the authors introduce Guided-VAE as a method to improve the transparency, interpretability, and controllability of VAE representation learning. Two versions of Guided-VAE are designed: an unsupervised version and a supervised version. The goal is to enhance the quality of reconstruction/synthesis in VAEs by providing guidance to the latent variables. Guided-VAE aims to improve VAE representation learning by making latent variables interpretable and controllable. It is learned in a multi-task fashion, utilizing the VAE's flexibility. In unsupervised Guided-VAE, a deformable PCA is learned in addition to the standard VAE backbone. Two decoders, Dec main and Dec sub, reconstruct input data x in different ways. In Guided-VAE, a secondary decoder learns geometric deformation and a linear sub-space. Supervised Guided-VAE introduces a subtask by making one latent variable discriminative while the rest are adversarially discriminative. This is achieved using an adversarial excitation and inhibition formulation. The training process is carried out in an end-to-end multi-task learning manner, resulting in a generative model that retains VAE properties while making specified latent variables semantically meaningful. Guided-VAE is applied to data modeling and few-shot learning with favorable results on MNIST, CelebA, and Omniglot datasets. Our work introduces Guided-VAE, a new generative model disentanglement learning method that enhances variational autoencoders (VAE) by incorporating latent variable guidance. Unsupervised Guided-VAE utilizes deformable PCA to guide VAE learning, while supervised Guided-VAE employs an adversarial mechanism to promote disentanglement and controllability of latent variables. This approach improves VAE controllability and is applicable to various generative modeling tasks. The text discusses the importance of disentanglement learning in representation learning, focusing on enhancing variational autoencoders (VAE) for generative modeling. Various methods and approaches, including adversarial training, have been adopted to make VAE more controllable and transparent. Various methods have been used to enhance variational autoencoders (VAE) for generative modeling, such as \u03b2-VAE and \u03b2-TCVAE. Additionally, connections between robust PCA and VAE have been observed. Incorporating the transparency of PCA and the modeling power of VAE, a sub-encoder called deformable PCA is developed to guide the VAE training process in an integrated manner. The sub-encoder can be removed after training, and disentanglement learning in supervised Guided-VAE is achieved by encouraging one latent variable to correspond to an attribute while keeping the rest uncorrelated. Our supervised Guided-VAE model targets generic generative modeling using an adversarial excitation and inhibition formulation, minimizing discriminative loss for the desired latent variable while maximizing classification error for the rest. It differs from DANN and adversarial autoencoder approaches in purpose, formulation, and network structure. DIVA method enforces disjoint domain invariance, unlike ours. The Guided-VAE model differs from other methods like DIVA and DSN by incorporating intermediate supervision and connections to fairness disentanglement learning. It presents unsupervised and supervised versions, following the standard VAE definition. In the Guided-VAE model, input data X is encoded by the encoder network with parameters \u03c6 to produce variational probability model q\u03c6(z|x). The decoder network with parameters \u03b8 reconstructs samples x = f\u03b8(z) to estimate log likelihood by maximizing the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO). The training process aims to find optimal (\u03b8, \u03c6) by minimizing reconstruction loss and KL divergence between variational and prior distributions. In the unsupervised Guided-VAE model, a deformable PCA is introduced as a secondary decoder to guide training. The secondary decoder, Dec sub, uses z def for deformation/transformation and z cont for content determination. The PCA model includes basis B = (b 1 , ..., b K ) and a deformable PCA loss is defined. The method follows the spirit of PCA optimization and a general formulation for learning PCA. The unsupervised Guided-VAE model introduces a fixed basis function B and a probabilistic PCA model. It involves training data X with T attributes and ground-truth labels. Each attribute uses an adversarial excitation and inhibition method with a hinge term for maximization. The excitation process aims for latent variable z t to correspond to the attribute label. Classifier C t makes predictions for the attribute using the remaining latent variables z rst t. The unsupervised Guided-VAE model introduces a fixed basis function B and a probabilistic PCA model for training data with T attributes and ground-truth labels. The adversarial excitation and inhibition method is used for each attribute, with a hinge term for maximization. Classifier Ct predicts the attribute using the remaining latent variables z rst t, aiming for independence between z rst t and the attribute label. The formulation in eq. (7) is similar to domain-adversarial neural networks, encouraging and discouraging different parts of the features for the same type of classification. The unsupervised Guided-VAE model demonstrates improved disentanglement of latent embeddings compared to previous methods on the MNIST dataset. It also shows potential for enhancing classification performance. Additionally, a supervised guidance approach using adversarial excitation and inhibition is applied to the CelebA dataset, with promising results for few-shot classification tasks on the Omniglot dataset. The Guided-VAE model on the MNIST dataset utilizes latent variables for rotation, scaling, and content information. It outperforms previous methods in disentanglement and classification. The model also shows promise for few-shot classification tasks on the Omniglot dataset. Our Guided-VAE model disentangles geometry properties like rotation angle and stroke thickness from content information on the MNIST dataset. It outperforms \u03b2-VAE and JointVAE in generating meaningful disentangled representations. The basis in the PCA part primarily captures content information, and we compare reconstruction error among different models using three settings for deformation/transformation: Rotation, scaling, and both. Our Guided-VAE model disentangles rotation and scaling information using latent variables, achieving added disentanglement without sacrificing reconstruction capability. Classification tasks are performed on latent embeddings to predict digit classes, with the model outperforming \u03b2-VAE in generating meaningful representations. The Guided-VAE disentangles latent variables into deformation and content variables, using affine transformation. Higher dimensional latent variables lead to lower classification errors. It outperforms vanilla VAE and \u03b2-VAE, with validation of disentanglement effectiveness. Classification tasks are performed using different parts of latent variables as input features for the classifier. The Guided-VAE disentangles latent variables into deformation and content variables, achieving successful disentanglement between them. Higher dimensions in latent variables result in better disentanglement. Qualitative results on the CelebA dataset show traversal of latent variables representing attributes like emotion, gender, and color. The Guided-VAE disentangles latent variables into attribute and content information, showing better isolation of attributes compared to \u03b2-VAE. In supervised Guided-VAE, a classifier is trained to predict attributes using the disentangled attribute latent variable z t or the remaining latent variables z rst t as input features. The supervised Guided-VAE uses latent variables to predict attributes, with a focus on encouraging target variables to predict specific attributes while discouraging others. This disentanglement process leads to lower classification errors and allows for control over generated images based on attribute variables. The supervised Guided-VAE uses latent variables to predict attributes, enabling control over generated images based on attribute variables. An external binary classifier is pre-trained for each attribute, allowing for tuning of latent variables to enable or disable specific attributes in the generated images. In this section, the proposed method is applied to few-shot classification using adversarial excitation and inhibition in the Neural Statistician. The Mixup method is also utilized in the supervised guidance network. Results could not be reproduced as reported in the Neural Statistician. Comparison is made with Matching Nets and Bruno, where Guided-VAE shows equivalent performance to Bruno. A series of ablation experiments are conducted. In a series of ablation experiments, the Guided-VAE model is validated by excluding the geometry-guided part. The experiment involves using a PCA-like decoder instead of a deformable PCA, with all latent variables controlled by the light decoder. Additionally, an experiment using the adversarial excitation method is conducted, showing traversal results on latent variables. The results from the adversarial excitation method outperform the discriminative method in controlling latent variables. The Guided-VAE utilizes lightweight guidance for better controllability and transparency in disentanglement learning. The Guided-VAE method improves controllability and transparency in disentanglement learning. An experiment on MNIST shows how the percentage of data in the guided sub-network affects prediction accuracy. Increasing samples in the guided sub-network leads to consistent improvement in the last half of latent variables. Adding more samples to guide the sub-network improves disentanglement, leading to better representation of content information in the second half latent variables. This improvement allows the first half latent variables to capture more geometry information. Training with a large number of samples also results in increased accuracy, possibly due to the partial influence of classes on geometry information."
