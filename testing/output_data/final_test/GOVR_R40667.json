    "content": "An anaerobic digestion system (AD system) captures methane from manure handling, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and producing clean energy. Livestock operations emit methane from manure, contributing to total U.S. methane emissions. Anaerobic digestion has the potential to reduce these emissions by capturing methane and producing biogas. The anaerobic digestion system captures methane from manure, reducing emissions and producing biogas for renewable energy purposes. Legislation focuses on ethanol, not biogas, due to unfavorable economics for compressing biogas into liquid fuel. Successful cases use biogas for electricity generation or heat production. AD systems can help livestock producers become energy self-sufficient and potentially sell electricity. Over 160 AD systems operate on farms nationally. The low adoption rates of anaerobic digestion technology on farms nationally may be due to high capital costs, reliability concerns, and payment rates for generated electricity. Congress could encourage adoption by identifying primary benefits, determining if captured methane counts as a carbon offset, and exploring additional financing options. Monitoring a public-private partnership between the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Innovation Center for U.S. Dairy could provide insights on collaborative techniques to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from dairy operations. The agreement aims to expedite the adoption of anaerobic digesters by US dairy farms through USDA programs. USDA funded 30 more digesters in FY2010. Anaerobic digestion breaks down manure in a closed facility, reducing methane emissions. The report discusses AD systems, technology adoption, challenges, and congressional concerns. Anaerobic digestion systems break down manure to produce biogas, liquid effluent, and dry matter. Biogas can be used for energy or flared, liquid effluent can be used as fertilizer, and dry matter can be sold as a soil amendment or used for animal bedding. AD systems offer benefits like odor reduction and can help mitigate environmental pollution from livestock operations. The design and construction of an AD system are based on factors like total solids content of the manure, feedstock quantity and quality, demand for effluent, and use of captured biogas. AD systems in the United States are used on dairy cow, swine, and poultry operations. Over 80% of operating AD systems are on dairy cow operations. Some argue for simpler, lower-cost AD systems on dairy cow operations, while others note challenges in installing AD systems on swine operations due to existing manure storage methods. Some argue against using AD systems on poultry operations due to dry litter requiring more resources for transport and digestion. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, 21 times more effective at trapping heat than CO2 over a 100-year timeframe. Efforts to capture methane from anthropogenic sources may help mitigate climate change in the near term. Efforts to capture methane from animal agriculture, specifically through manure management, can provide significant climate change abatement. Emission factors and conversion factors are used to estimate methane emissions, considering livestock population data and waste characteristics. Capturing methane with an AD system is beneficial as it reduces emissions of this harmful greenhouse gas. Capturing methane from managed manure in agricultural sources, such as swine and dairy cattle, can qualify as a carbon offset in climate change mitigation efforts. Accurate quantification and verification of methane captured from an anaerobic digestion (AD) system is crucial for ensuring actual reductions in emissions. Additionally, the production of biogas from AD systems can serve as a renewable energy source, consisting of 60%-70% methane and 30%-40% carbon dioxide. Biogas, consisting of methane and carbon dioxide, can be explosive if exposed to air. Its quality and quantity vary based on system factors. It can be used for heat production or electricity generation, either through burning in a boiler or using an engine-generator set. Upgraded biogas can be sold to a natural gas utility. Typically, producers choose either electricity generation or heat production due to cost considerations. Biogas can be used for heat production or electricity generation. Manure from cows can supply fuel for electricity generation. Sales to a utility require a contractual agreement and meeting environmental requirements. Net metering is an option for selling electricity to electric utilities. Biogas must contain at least 50% methane to be used as a fuel. Biogas with a minimum 50% methane concentration can be used as a fuel. It needs to be cleaned, upgraded, and compressed for use in a mobile engine. Flaring biogas destroys methane, producing carbon dioxide and water. Carbon dioxide has a longer atmospheric lifetime compared to methane. Federal funding has supported the installation of over 160 anaerobic digestion systems on farms, producing 454,000 MWh of electricity annually. These systems prevent 1,160,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent emissions per year, comparable to the emissions of 225,000 passenger vehicles. The environmental impacts of flaring methane versus releasing unused biogas into the atmosphere are being investigated further. Financial assistance for anaerobic digestion (AD) system installation is available through federal and state legislation, including loans, grants, tax credits, and production incentives. The Section 9007 Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) provides $255 million in mandatory funding for 2009-2012, with an additional $25 million per year in discretionary funding. For FY2012, $70 million is available, with grants not exceeding 25% of project costs and loan guarantees capped at $25 million. The maximum combined loan and grant amount cannot exceed 75% of the project cost. Financial assistance for anaerobic digestion projects includes the Renewable Electricity Production Tax Credit (REPTC) offering a tax credit for electricity generated from open-loop biomass. Technology deployment barriers exist due to complexity, with successful systems operated by knowledgeable producers. Challenges include economic factors and addressing various concerns for the technology to reach its full potential. Anaerobic digestion systems face challenges such as high capital costs, which can range from hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars depending on the system type and size. Approximately one-third of the total cost is spent on electrical generation equipment. Some producers may find it more cost-effective to forgo electricity production to save money. Anaerobic digestion technology has improved over time, leading to better performance rates. Producers may hesitate to adopt this technology due to past poor performance, but current data shows significant advancements. Mandatory reporting by an independent third party could help boost confidence in the improved technology. Financially, a positive return is most likely at dairy cow operations with at least 500 cows and swine operations with at least 2,000 total head of confinement capacity. The lack of a national engineering practice standard for anaerobic digestion technology may deter some producers from investing in the technology. Producers may have doubts about technology reliability and the release of proprietary information through a national reporting program. Having a standard that lists performance criteria, safety precautions, and design elements reviewed by a standards organization could address these concerns. The USDA NRCS issued an anaerobic digester conservation practice standard in 2009. Utility collaboration and rates for electricity generated from AD systems vary by state. Net-metering agreements may limit profitability. Gas utility companies may be reluctant to accept renewable energy fuel from AD systems. Unquantifiable benefits like odor reduction add value. Operation and maintenance of AD systems are important considerations. The agricultural community, especially the livestock industry, may have opportunities in clean energy and environmental legislation with anaerobic digestion technology. Congress is considering legislation for energy generation and greenhouse gas reduction. Identifying primary benefits of AD systems, such as renewable energy or emission reduction, can guide policy decisions. The potential benefits of anaerobic digestion technology in clean energy and environmental legislation include determining policy support, encouraging adoption for achieving goals, considering methane capture as a carbon offset, and identifying financial support for technology implementation. Financial support for technology implementation is crucial, with federal assistance available in the form of loans and grants for anaerobic digestion system construction. A shorter payback period could be achieved by providing producers with a higher monetary sum for the energy generated and transferred to a utility company through a federal electricity rate premium. Increasing tax credits, such as raising the value for agricultural livestock waste nutrients, could further enhance the economic return for anaerobic digestion technology."
