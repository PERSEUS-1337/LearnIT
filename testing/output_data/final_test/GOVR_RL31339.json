    "content": "Prior to Operation Desert Storm in 1991, President George H.W. Bush urged Iraqis to overthrow Saddam. The US decided against military intervention due to UN restrictions and fears of a costly occupation. After the war, Shiite Muslims and Kurds rebelled, but the Republican Guard forces suppressed the uprisings. Many Iraqi Shiites blamed the US for not intervening on their behalf. During the Clinton Administration, the United States supported Kurdish and Shiite factions in Iraq, leading to the emergence of leaders in post-Saddam politics. This support included funding for opposition groups after a failed coup attempt in July 1992. During the Clinton Administration, the United States supported Kurdish and Shiite factions in Iraq, leading to the emergence of leaders in post-Saddam politics. This support included funding for opposition groups after a failed coup attempt in July 1992. Congressional calls to overthrow Saddam grew due to Iraq's obstructions of U.N. WMD inspections, resulting in the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998, which authorized support for efforts to remove Saddam's regime. The Iraq Liberation Act of 1998 authorized support for regime change in Iraq, providing up to $97 million in defense assistance to opposition groups. President Clinton emphasized regime change as part of U.S. policy towards Iraq, but the act specified that military force should not be used for this purpose. Post-Saddam \"transition assistance\" was also outlined in the act, coinciding with Iraqi obstruction of U.N. weapons inspections. This led to a U.S. and British bombing campaign in December 1998, followed by the designation of seven groups eligible for military assistance in February 1999. The Iraq Liberation Act of 1998 authorized support for regime change in Iraq, providing up to $97 million in defense assistance to opposition groups. Seven groups were designated to receive U.S. military assistance, but were judged insufficiently capable for combat training or weapons deployment in Operation Iraqi Freedom. The major anti-Saddam groups included the Iraqi National Congress (INC) and Iraq National Accord (INA), formed on a platform of human rights, democracy, and Kurdish autonomy. The Iraq National Accord (INA) was founded after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait and initially supported by Saudi Arabia. Led by Dr. Iyad al-Allawi, it later earned the patronage of the CIA. The INC, with authoritarian leadership, selected Ahmad Chalabi to run it daily. The Clinton Administration supported the INA in 1996 after internal INC squabbling. Baghdad launched a military incursion into northern Iraq in August 1996 at the invitation of the Kurdistan Democratic Party. The Kurdistan Democratic Party invited Baghdad to help capture Irbil from the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. The Kurds seek to incorporate northern Iraq areas into their region run by the Kurdistan Regional Government. There is friction between the Kurds and the central government, with the KDP and PUK having around 100,000 peshmerga fighters providing security in the region. In May 1994, the KDP and the PUK clashed over territory and control of the Kurdish regional government in Irbil. Shiite Islamist factions like Ayatollah Sistani and ISCI have become dominant in post-Saddam politics in Iraq. Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani is the most senior Shiite cleric in Najaf. Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, a prominent Shiite cleric in Najaf, was part of the Hawza al-Ilmiyah in Iraq during Saddam's rule. He follows a quietist approach but has influenced post-Saddam political issues. The Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq (ISCI) and the Da'wa Party, both pro-Iranian Shiite groups, have been competing against each other after their alliance weakened. Ayatollah Sistani's mentor was Ayatollah Abol Qasem Musavi-Khoi, who led the Hawza until his death in 1992. Ayatollah Hakim's sons, including the late ISCI leader Abd al-Aziz al-Hakim, were members of the Da'wa Party before founding SCIRI in 1982 under Iranian patronage. SCIRI later changed its name to ISCI in 2007 and became the best organized party within the Shiite political groupings in Iraq. The Da'wa Party, led by Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, did not join the U.S.-led effort to overthrow Saddam Hussein. Moqtada Al Sadr's faction emerged as a significant factor post-Saddam's fall. Some Bush Administration officials advocated for regime change in Iraq, but initially continued containment policy after 9/11 attacks. The Bush Administration shifted to an active regime change effort in Iraq after the September 11 attacks, characterizing Iraq as part of an \"axis of evil\" in 2002. This followed initial efforts to prevent the erosion of containment of Iraq through a \"smart sanctions\" plan. The Bush Administration labeled Iraq as part of an \"axis of evil\" in 2002, leading to discussions about confronting Iraq militarily. Concerns were raised about the consequences of invading Iraq, including the challenges of building a democracy post-conflict. The Bush Administration's public case for confronting Iraq was based on the belief that Iraq posed a \"grave and gathering\" threat due to its alleged WMD programs. The justification for war included the Downing Street Memo and the House passing H.J.Res. 75 in December 2001. President Bush and Prime Minister Blair denied seeking information to justify war against Iraq. The Bush Administration believed Iraq posed a threat due to alleged WMD programs. Iraq was accused of rebuilding WMD programs and not complying with U.N. resolutions. Concerns included Iraq using WMD against its own people and neighbors, and the potential transfer of WMD to terrorists. The Duelfer report found no WMD stockpiles but suggested Iraq retained the intention to reconstitute WMD programs in the future. The U.S.-led search for WMD in Iraq ended in December 2004, with some chemical weapons from the Iran-Iraq war found. UNMOVIC's work was terminated in 2007. Iraq was linked to Al Qaeda, but the 9/11 Commission found no evidence of a direct operational link. The Bush Administration deployed troops to Kuwait in 2002 and built up Iraqi opposition before ordering an invasion of Iraq in early 2003. Covert activities against Saddam Hussein were authorized, and major opposition groups were invited to Washington for training in August 2002. The Bush Administration trained opposition groups in Washington and Hungary before the invasion of Iraq. President Bush sought U.N. support for enforcing WMD-related resolutions on Iraq. Iraq reluctantly accepted Resolution 1441 for U.N. inspections. Iraq reluctantly accepted Resolution 1441 for U.N. inspections, leading to the resumption of WMD inspections in November 2002. UNMOVIC Director Hans Blix and IAEA Director Mohammad El Baradei reported to the Security Council that Iraq did not actively cooperate but had not denied access to sites and might not possess WMD. The 107th Congress passed H.J.Res. 114, authorizing military force against Iraq to enforce U.N. resolutions, despite no U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing force. The U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing force was adopted despite opposition from countries like France, Russia, China, and Germany. On March 16, 2003, a summit in the Azores rejected diplomatic options, leading to an ultimatum for Saddam Hussein to leave Iraq within 48 hours. The Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) began on March 19, 2003, with a coalition force overwhelming Iraq's military. The U.S. military faced stiff resistance from Iraqi units and irregulars during Operation Iraqi Freedom. Some evaluations suggest a focus on combating irregular forces rather than armored forces. No WMD was used by Iraq, but they fired ballistic missiles into Kuwait. Saddam Hussein was captured in December 2003 and later convicted for crimes against civilians. The U.S. aims for a unified, democratic, and federal Iraq. The U.S. aims for a unified, democratic, and federal Iraq that can sustain, govern, and defend itself. Tensions remain among Shiite Arabs, Sunni Arabs, and Kurds. The transition to Iraqi sovereignty has taken place in stages after the fall of the Saddam regime. The U.S. initially set up an occupation structure for reconstruction. The U.S. government personnel led reconstruction efforts in Iraq after the fall of Saddam, establishing the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA) in April 2003. Ambassador L. Paul Bremer replaced Jay Garner to head the \"Coalition Provisional Authority\" (CPA) in May 2003. After replacing Jay Garner, L. Paul Bremer established the \"Coalition Provisional Authority\" (CPA) in Iraq. He appointed the non-sovereign \"Iraq Governing Council\" (IGC) in July 2003, which selected a cabinet in September with a Shiite Muslim majority. Resentment grew among Sunnis due to decisions like \"de-Baathification\" and not recalling Saddam-era military members. The Bush Administration set conditions for the end of U.S. occupation in Iraq, including the completion of a new constitution and national elections by late 2005. Grand Ayatollah Sistani pushed for early Iraqi sovereignty, leading to the decision to return sovereignty by June 30, 2004, and hold national elections by the end of 2005. The Transitional Administrative Law (TAL) outlined a roadmap for political transition, with elections for a transitional National Assembly by January 31, 2005, and drafting a permanent constitution by August 15, 2005. The TAL outlined a roadmap for political transition in Iraq, including elections for a transitional National Assembly by January 31, 2005, drafting a permanent constitution by August 15, 2005, and national elections for a full-term government by December 15, 2005. The Kurds maintained their autonomy and militia force, while Sistani's opposition led to the selection of a government by U.N. envoy Lakhdar Brahimi on June 1, 2004. The handover ceremony occurred on June 28, 2004, with a government led by Sunni tribal figure Ghazi al-Yawar as president and Iyad al-Allawi as Prime Minister. After the handover in Iraq, a U.S. Ambassador established diplomatic relations, and a U.S. embassy opened on June 30, 2004. The embassy is staffed with about 1,100 personnel. The Ambassador is Christopher Hill, overseeing the new U.S. Embassy built by First Kuwaiti General Trading and Construction Co. The Iraq Reconstruction and Management Office took over advising Iraq's ministries. The Iraq Transition Assistance Office (ITAO) focuses on promoting efficiency in Iraq's ministries and managing projects built with U.S. reconstruction funds. The Project Contracting Office (PCO) under the Army Corps of Engineers is training Iraqis to sustain infrastructure projects like roads, power plants, and school renovations. Three key votes in 2005 established the current structure of Iraqi governance. The Sunni Arabs boycotted the Kurdish regional assembly, allowing the Shiite United Iraqi Alliance to dominate the national government. A constitution was approved in 2005, with Sunni opposition centered on the provision for weak central government and federalism. The constitution provided for a special amendment process to appease Sunnis, but remains incomplete. In 2005, Sunnis formed electoral slates to strengthen their position and demanded a new Prime Minister, leading to Nuri al-Maliki's appointment in 2006. Political reconciliation is crucial for reducing U.S. presence in Iraq. Major legislative and political achievements have been made since 2008. Since 2008, there have been significant legislative and political achievements in Iraq, including the adoption of reform laws and the passage of national budgets. However, the reconciliation process is deemed incomplete, leading to concerns as U.S. troop levels decrease. Despite some alliances forming across sectarian lines, the Sunni-Shiite divide persists, highlighted by ongoing violence. Three bombings targeted government buildings in downtown Baghdad, killing 125 Iraqis and leading to the replacement of the Baghdad security commander by Maliki. U.S. officials emphasized the need for national oil laws and public services improvement, stating that reconciliation was an Iraqi process that the U.S. could assist with but not implement alone. Efforts to pass major legislation, including an anti-corruption law and a national flag law, were deadlocked. U.S. officials focused on urging Iraqi factions to agree on an election law for national elections in January 2010, which was delayed until December 2009 with the election set for March 7, 2010. The provincial elections in Iraq were delayed until December 2009, with the election set for March 7, 2010. The elections aimed to boost Sunni-Shiite reconciliation but also caused strains between the KRG and the central government. Provincial councils in Iraq hold significant power in choosing governors and governing administrations, allowing for patronage distribution and influencing provincial politics. The elections were initially planned for October 1, 2008, but were delayed due to Kurdish objections over integrating disputed territories into the KRG. The Kirkuk dispute was temporarily set aside, and a revised provincial election law was passed on September 24, 2008. The revised provincial election law was passed on September 24, 2008, in Iraq, leading to elections by January 31, 2009. Approximately 14,500 candidates, including 4,000 women, competed for 440 provincial council seats in Arab-dominated provinces. Turnout was around 51%, with results certified on March 29, 2009. Provincial councils began convening under the incumbent governor, selecting administrations by May 12, 2009. Council terms last four years from the first convention. The January 2009 elections in Iraq strengthened Maliki's political position and brought Sunni Muslims further into the political structure. The elections also incorporated Sunni tribal leaders and exposed strains within the Sunni bloc. The 2009 elections in Iraq led to the fracturing of the main Sunni bloc, with hardline Sunni Arabs gaining control of the Nineveh provincial council from the Kurds. Tensions have risen due to Kurdish territories in Nineveh and clashes have occurred over Kurdish encroachment. The U.S. commander in Iraq proposed deploying forces to build confidence between Kurds and the central government ahead of the 2010 national elections. ISCI formed a new coalition, the Iraqi National Alliance, to compete in the elections, potentially causing a setback for Maliki. The Iraqi National Alliance, including ISCI, the Sadr movement, Ibrahim al-Jafari, Ahmad Chalabi, and the Fadhila Party, did not promise to renominate Maliki as Prime Minister. Maliki formed his own coalition dominated by his State of Law Coalition, with speculation on Adel Abd al-Mahdi as a potential choice. The major Kurdish parties may run separately from Maliki, and some senior Sunni tribal figures were not incorporated into his new coalition. Some senior Sunni tribal figures from the \"Awakening\" movement have not joined Maliki's coalition. Other anti-Maliki coalitions have formed, including one led by former Prime Minister Allawi and Sunni Arab leader Saleh al-Mutlaq. Interior Minister Jawad al-Bolani has also formed an anti-Maliki bloc. District and sub-district elections were scheduled for July 31, 2009, but preparations are lacking, with the U.N. mission suggesting they may be held in 2010. The U.N. mission in Iraq suggests that elections may be held in 2010, including provincial elections in Kurdish-controlled provinces and Kirkuk. The Kurds are concerned about unresolved issues with Maliki and the planned U.S. forces departure. The Kurds are worried about the U.S. forces leaving Iraq, fearing they will be vulnerable to Arab influence without U.S. military presence. Despite central government opposition, the Kurds agreed to export oil with Baghdad, with 17% of proceeds going to the KRG. They are pushing for a referendum on Kirkuk's affiliation with the KRG, which has been delayed by the Bush and Obama administrations. The Kurds reluctantly agreed to postpone the referendum on integrating Kurdish-inhabited cities into the KRG. UNAMI recommended shared control of Kirkuk, but negotiations have not progressed. The Bush Administration claimed progress on reconciliation in 2008, but implementation will determine lasting effects. The Iraqi government is gaining diplomatic support from its neighbors, except Iran, despite resentment towards Shiite and Kurdish dominance. Arab ambassadors were absent in Iraq, but countries like Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Kuwait, Jordan, Syria, Qatar, Oman, and Egypt have sent ambassadors or announced plans to do so in response to U.S. pressure. Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Oman are sending diplomats to Iraq for logistical arrangements. Arabia, Qatar, Oman are arranging logistics for embassies in Iraq. In 2009, Iraq appointed its first Ambassador to Syria in 30 years. Jordan's King Abdullah and Iranian President Ahmadinejad visited Iraq in 2008. Kuwait's Foreign Minister visited in 2009, but issues from the 1990 invasion of Kuwait still affect relations. The United States is building regional support for Iraq. The United States built regional support for Iraq through an ongoing \"Expanded Ministerial Conference of Iraq's Neighbors\" process, involving Iraq's neighbors, the Gulf monarchy states, Egypt, and the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. Meetings were held in Baghdad, Egypt, and Kuwait to discuss aid for Iraq, establish working groups on security, fuel supplies, and refugees, but future meetings are uncertain due to Iraq's stabilization. No progress was made on debt relief issues. The Iraq Compact countries meeting in Sweden on May 30, 2008, did not make progress on debt relief. The State Department's 2008 human rights report highlighted widespread abuses due to violence and weak government performance. The October 26, 2009, report on International Religious Freedom attributed restrictions on religious minorities to terrorists and criminal gangs. Christians in Mosul blamed Kurds for forcing them to leave to strengthen Kurdish influence. In the run-up to the January 2009 provincial elections, about 1,000 Christian families reportedly fled Nineveh Province in October 2008, but most returned by December 2008. In late 2009, around 10,000 Christians in northern Iraq fled areas near Kirkuk due to bombings and intimidation. Some blame Al Qaeda in Iraq for the attacks, with UNAMI providing humanitarian assistance. Kurdish leaders deny allegations of abuses against Christians in the Nineveh Plain. The FY2008 Consolidated Appropriation earmarked $10 million in ESF. Before the latest rounds of violence in Nineveh, more than 100,000 Christians had left Iraq since the fall of Saddam Hussein. Christian priests have been kidnapped and killed; the body of Chaldean Catholic archbishop Faraj Rahho was discovered in Mosul on March 13, 2008, two weeks after his reported kidnapping. An attack on the Yazidis in August 2007, which killed about 500 persons, appeared to reflect the precarious situation for Iraqi minorities. U.S. military forces do not specifically protect Christian communities. The Iraqi government pledged to protect Christian sites in 2009. The State Department report details how funds were spent on democracy and governance programs in Iraq, including empowering women and promoting independent media. The U.S. government allocated significant funds for democracy promotion in Iraq, including appropriations in FY2006, FY2007, FY2008, and FY2009, totaling $382 million requested for various democracy-building initiatives. About $71 million was specifically designated for \"Rule of Law\" programs. The U.S. government allocated $159 million for building and securing courts, training legal personnel, and promoting legal reform in Iraq. Additionally, $10 million was designated for resolving real property disputes, including Kurdish claims in Kirkuk. Other funds were used for empowering local governments through the Community Action Program. The Community Action Program (CAP) allocates about $50 million per year for local reconstruction projects, voted on by village and town representatives. The Provincial Reconstruction Development Committees (PRDCs) and Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) also fund projects for secure conditions. U.N. resolutions assign a role for the United Nations in post-Saddam reconstruction and governance, with UNAMI headed by Ad Melkert since July 7, 2009. UNAMI, with offices in Iraq and Jordan, has expanded responsibilities including promoting political reconciliation, planning a national census, mediating the Kurd-Arab dispute, updating voter registries, and assisting with the constitution review process. U.N. Resolution 1830 renewed UNAMI's mandate until August 2009. The Iraq Study Group calls for increased U.N. participation in promoting reconciliation in Iraq. Since the fall of Saddam Hussein, around $50 billion has been allocated for reconstruction in Iraq, including funding for security forces. The Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund received about $20.9 billion in two supplemental appropriations. As violence decreased in 2007 and 2008, the Bush Administration agreed that Iraq, with its oil revenues, should start covering its own reconstruction and security costs. U.S. aid to Iraq, especially to the ISF, has decreased significantly since FY2008. In FY2009, around $609 million in civilian economic aid was provided. In H.R. 2346, $609 million in civilian economic aid was provided for Iraq, with $500 million requested for FY2010. The IRRF funds were allocated for various sectors including Security, Law Enforcement, Justice, Public Safety, Infrastructure, Civil Society, Democracy, Electricity, Oil Infrastructure, Water Resources, Sanitation, Transportation, Communications, Roads, Bridges, Construction, Health Care, Private Sector Development, Education, and Refugees. The US provided $609 million in civilian economic aid for Iraq, including funds for Security, Law Enforcement, Justice, Public Safety, Infrastructure, Civil Society, Democracy, Electricity, Oil Infrastructure, Water Resources, Sanitation, Transportation, Communications, Roads, Bridges, Construction, Health Care, Private Sector Development, Education, and Refugees. The focus on protecting and rebuilding Iraq's oil infrastructure has been successful, with production nearly at pre-war levels. Iraq still needs to import refined gasoline due to insufficient refining capacity. The Iraqi government needs to import refined gasoline due to insufficient refining capacity. Concerns exist regarding the development of Iraq's oil industry and foreign energy firms receiving contracts to explore the country's vast reserves. International investment is tied to the passage of hydrocarbons laws, with some worried that U.S. firms may be favored. Recent auctions of Iraqi fields have yielded limited agreements, with past deals with Russian and Chinese firms facing scrutiny. Iraq has signed agreements with Chinese and South Korean firms worth billions to develop oil fields and assist in industrial reconstruction. The Iraq Study Group recommends encouraging investment in the oil sector and eliminating corruption. Various investors, including companies from Norway, Switzerland, Turkey, South Korea, Canada, and the U.S., are operating in the Kurdistan region, which the central government considers illegal without national oil laws. The Kurds in Iraq have agreements with various international companies like Canada's Western Zagros and Turkey/U.S.'s A and T Energy. They rely on the national oil pipeline system for exports, leading to disputes. The Bush Administration lifted U.S. sanctions on Iraq to encourage private investment, with Executive Order 13303 protecting Iraqi assets. On July 29, 2004, President Bush issued Executive Order 13350 ending a trade and investment ban imposed on Iraq. Iraq was designated a beneficiary of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) on September 8, 2004, allowing duty-free imports to the U.S. On September 24, 2004, Iraq was removed from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism, enabling foreign assistance, international loans, and arms sales. The FY2005 supplemental removed Iraq from a list of countries for which the U.S. withholds contributions to international organizations. The U.S. is urging other countries to forgive Iraq's debt, which totals about $116 billion. Iraq has received $12 billion in debt relief from non-Paris Club creditors and $20 billion in commercial debt relief. Remaining debt is estimated at $52 billion to $76 billion. Iraq's debt, including that owed to the Paris Club, is estimated between $52 billion and $76 billion. The Persian Gulf states, mainly Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, have been hesitant to forgive Iraq's debt of approximately $55 billion. However, the UAE agreed to write off all $7 billion of Iraqi debt in 2008. Iraq settled its debt with Bulgaria in August 2008. The United States forgave 100% of Iraq's $4.1 billion debt in 2004. Iraq also cleared its debts to the IMF by repaying $470 million earlier than required. Iraq has made efforts to repay its debts to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and has a Stand-By Arrangement with the Fund. The United States employed a multi-faceted approach to securing Iraq after the fall of Saddam Hussein. A strategy revision in January 2007, known as the \"troop surge,\" helped quiet the security environment. President Obama announced a winding down of U.S. military involvement in Iraq by the end of 2011. The U.S. military headquarters in Baghdad, headed by General Raymond Odierno, may request a continued military presence in Iraq. Sunni insurgents aim to restore political dominance, with some seeking to bring back the Baath Party to power. The central government has refused to negotiate with representatives of Saddam confidant Izzat Ibrahim al-Duri. Al Qaeda in Iraq (AQ-I), led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi until his death in 2006, has been responsible for the majority of suicide bombings in Iraq, aiming to incite Sunni-Shiite conflict and undermine U.S. involvement. Initially composed of foreign Sunni fighters, it has transitioned to being led by Iraqi nationals, with reduced capability for high-profile attacks. The Iraqi Sunni insurgency, including AQ-I, conducted high-profile attacks using various tactics like RPGs, IEDs, and suicide attacks. This insurgency caused U.S. casualties and Sunni-Shiite violence, leading to debates on the U.S. commitment in Iraq. Other active Sunni insurgent groups included Jaysh Mohammad, Jaysh Al Islami, the 1920 Revolutionary Brigade, and Jaysh Rijal al-Tariq al-Naqshabandi. In 2007, insurgent groups in Iraq targeted various groups and infrastructure, including civilians, U.S. authorities, foreign contractors, and energy facilities. Attacks included exploding chlorine trucks and targeting bridges. Sunni insurgents established bases in Baghdad neighborhoods and provinces like Diyala and Nineveh. Anbar Province saw a shift when Iraqi Sunnis sought U.S. military assistance against AQ-I in August 2006. In Anbar Province, Sunni Iraqis sought U.S. military help against AQ-I due to abuses like killings and forced marriages. The \"Awakening\" movement led by tribal figures turned against AQ-I, with U.S. commanders supporting them by forming the \"Sons of Iraq\" (SoI) from former militants. These fighters, mostly Sunni, were recruited to end anti-U.S. operations in exchange for security responsibilities. The Sons of Iraq (SoI) program recruited Sunni fighters in Anbar Province to combat AQ-I, with about 95,000-100,000 members. They received Defense Department funds and shared information with U.S. forces, contributing to the stabilization of Iraq since 2007. This program caused tensions between Maliki and U.S. officials due to its legitimization of Sunni armed capabilities. The Sons of Iraq program, which recruited Sunni fighters to combat AQ-I, caused tensions between Maliki and U.S. officials. Maliki resisted U.S. plans to integrate all SoI into the Iraqi Security Forces, allowing only 20% to join. The Iraqi government has been paying SoI fighters $350 per month, with concerns about payment disruptions mostly unrealized. Transitioning SoI to ISF or civilian employment has been slower than expected, with 13,000 SoI receiving ISF assignments and 9,600 getting civilian jobs as of September 2009. Delays have been encountered in reintegration efforts for the remaining fighters. The flow of foreign fighters from Syria into Iraq has decreased, but there are delays in reintegrating remaining fighters. Syria has not prioritized stopping foreign fighters entering Iraq, leading to tensions between the two countries. The US conducted a raid into Syria in 2008, targeting an AQ-I organizer. Despite this, there have been efforts to improve relations with Syria. In August 2009, U.S. CENTCOM officials visited Syria to discuss cooperation on preventing the flow of fighters into Iraq. The Obama Administration announced the return of an ambassador to Syria after a four-year hiatus. Sunni insurgents receive funding from wealthy donors in neighboring countries like Saudi Arabia. Sectarian violence in 2006 and 2007 was characterized as a \"civil war\" due to Sunni-Shiite conflicts. The violence in Iraq, sparked by the 2006 bombing of the Askariya Shiite mosque in Samarra, led to a wave of sectarian attacks between Sunnis and Shiites. By late 2006, sectarian violence became the primary security challenge in Iraq, surpassing the Sunni-led insurgency. However, since November 2007, there has been a significant decrease in Sunni-Shiite violence, attributed to the U.S. \"troop surge\" and the ceasefire of the Mahdi Army. The rejection of militia-based Shiite parties in the 2009 provincial elections also contributed to the reduction in sectarian violence. Some believe that the segregation of Sunnis and Shiites in Baghdad following the civil war has helped decrease overall sectarian violence. Segregation has helped reduce sectarian violence in Baghdad since major HPA's in April 2009. Sunnis lost the \"battle for Baghdad,\" with the city's Sunni population decreasing due to violence. The Samarra mosque was bombed in 2007, leading to reprisal attacks on Sunni mosques. The shrine is being reconstructed with UNESCO's help. Shiite militias participated in the violence, with some still active. Not all Shiite militias have been against the United States. The Badr Brigades, linked to the mainstream ISCI faction, were originally trained by Iran's Revolutionary Guard during the Iran-Iraq war. Led by Hadi al-Amiri, they were not considered anti-U.S. and folded into the ISF during 2005-2007. Many viewed ISCI as an Iranian puppet, and their operations in southern Iraq did not weaken Saddam's regime. Saddam's grip on power was challenged by militias like the Mahdi Army led by Sadr, which was considered anti-U.S. and a significant source of sectarian violence in Iraq. The JAM largely abided by a ceasefire in 2007, possibly to avoid direct confrontation with U.S. forces. Since the ceasefire in 2007, U.S. commanders have been monitoring Shiite militias like the \"Special Groups\" and offshoots such as Asa'ib Al Haq, Kitaib Hezbollah, and the Promised Day Brigade. Sadr is working to consolidate these militias under his control, with Asa'ib al-Haq reconciling with the government in 2009. The Treasury Department designated Khata'ib Hezbollah as a Foreign Terrorist Organization in 2009, the only Shiite militia group to receive this designation. U.S. reports warn of Shiite militias potentially destabilizing Iraq after the departure of U.S. forces. In 2007 and 2008, there was increased Shiite-on-Shiite violence in southern Iraq, particularly between ISF units and Sadr's JAM, competing for power and resources. In August 2007, violent clashes between Sadr's JAM and ISF in Karbala resulted in over 50 deaths, leading Sadr to declare a ceasefire. In September 2007, British forces redeployed from Basra to the airport, handing over control to Iraqis in December 2007. The responsibility for security in Basra then fell entirely on the ISF. In March 2008, Maliki ordered an ISF offensive against militias in Basra, initially facing challenges as ISF units surrendered to JAM militiamen. A settlement brokered by Iran favored Sadr's terms, seen as a setback to the ISF. Following setbacks in Basra, subsequent U.S. and Britain-backed operations by the ISF reduced JAM activities in Basra and nearby provinces. JAM fighters in Sadr City fired rockets on the International Zone, prompting U.S. and ISF forces to push into the district. An agreement in May 2008 led to a decrease in JAM activities in Sadr City, with Sadr announcing a transformation of his movement into a cultural and social organization in July 2008. In 2008, continued military activities by \"special companies\" of Mahdi fighters were authorized. Some fighters retreated into Iran and were influenced by Tehran. Rocket attacks into the International Zone resumed in June 2009, and Shiite militias were arming in Basra in August 2009. Iran remains a significant challenge to Iraq's stability and independence, but there is less direct Iranian involvement in militant activities due to Iraqi government messages to cease interference. Iran's Revolutionary Guard has been arming Shiite militias in Iraq with explosives and weapons, including EFPs. US forces have arrested Iranian agents and Hezbollah operatives involved in smuggling Iranian weaponry to Iraq. Iran's support for Shiite militias in Iraq led to direct talks between the US and Iran to stabilize Iraq, following a recommendation from the Iraq Study Group. The Bush Administration initially rejected the recommendation but eventually engaged in talks with Iran in 2007 to address Iraq's security challenges. The group met for the first time on August 6, 2007 in Baghdad, but subsequent meetings were postponed due to disagreements over the agenda and participants. Iran suspended talks in May 2008 and announced no further meetings in February 2009. Despite outreach efforts by President Obama, Iranian influence in Iraq persists, with many Iraqi leaders seeking advice and assistance from Tehran. In January 2009, Maliki visited Iran to reassure them about the U.S.-Iraq SOFA. Iran urged Maliki to take control of \"Camp Ashraf,\" where Iranian oppositionists were protected by U.S. forces. Iraq took control of the camp and announced plans to move residents to a detention center. An altercation at the camp in July 2009 resulted in casualties. Security on Iraq's northern border remains fragile. Turkey remains concerned about potential Kurdish separatism, particularly fearing that Iraqi Kurds may seek independence and incite similar movements among Turkey's Kurds. The Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) is a key player in Kurdish separatism in Turkey, with Turkey accusing Iraq's Kurds of harboring PKK guerrilla groups. Tensions escalated in 2007 when Iraqi Kurdish leader Barzani hinted at stirring unrest among Turkish Kurds. This situation has prompted U.S. involvement, including the appointment of an envoy to Turkey in 2006. Turkey's parliament approved a move into northern Iraq against the PKK in 2007. The Turkish military has used this authority sparingly, possibly due to pressure from U.S. officials. Turkey's President visited Baghdad in 2009, and Iran has been shelling border towns in northern Iraq due to concerns about the PJAK group. Iran has threatened a ground incursion against PJAK, a group staging incursions into Iran. The Obama Administration labeled PJAK a foreign terrorist entity primarily for its affiliation with the PKK and activities against Turkey. The \"troop surge\" in Iraq in 2007, involving additional U.S. forces, is credited for positive developments in the country since 2008. The troop surge in Iraq in 2007, involving additional U.S. forces, led to positive developments in the country. Forces, along with Iraqi soldiers, held neighborhoods cleared of insurgents, leading to the rejection of militants by the population. Despite progress, recent major bombings have raised concerns about jeopardizing the accomplishments. Recent major bombings in central Baghdad killed over 100 Iraqis and caused the replacement of the commander of the Baghdad Brigade. The attacks prompted Prime Minister Maliki to explain the security lapse to the COR, delaying a meeting with Secretary of Defense Gates. Despite the violence, U.S. military officials note an overall reduction in violence compared to the period from 2004-2007, when Anbar Province was a major focus of counter-insurgency efforts. In 2006, Anbar Province was the most restive Iraqi city, with daily shelling of the provincial governor's office. Despite multiple major operations to clear insurgents, violence persisted. The \"clear, hold, and build\" strategy aimed to create stable areas by positioning Iraqi forces and U.S. reconstruction experts. Operation Together Forward was based on this strategy in August-October. The U.S. strategy in Iraq included forming Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) to assist local governing institutions. There are currently 24 PRTs, with 8 embedded with U.S. military units. The \"surge\" was declared ended in July 2008 after reducing violence indicators. After the \"surge\" ended in July 2008, Gen. Petraeus recommended a drawdown of 8,000 forces by February 2009, which was later amended to remove the forces by the end of 2008. U.S. force levels were at about 130,000 by the June 30, 2009 pullout from Iraqi cities. President Obama clarified plans to draw down troops in line with the U.S.-Iraq Security Agreement, closing U.S. bases in cities by June 30, 2009. U.S. forces in Baghdad redeployed to larger bases outside the city. Iraq refused U.S. requests to base combat forces in certain areas. Iraq refused U.S. requests to base combat forces in Sadr City and Mosul. Maliki declared victory on June 30, 2009, as Iraqi forces took over U.S. checkpoints. President Obama's plan aims to withdraw all combat troops by August 31, 2010, leaving a residual presence for training and counter-terrorism missions until the end of 2011. The drawdown is on track despite recent challenges, with the U.S. military presence standing at about 130,000 troops at the time of redeployment from the cities. The U.S. military presence in Iraq is planned to decrease from 130,000 to 50,000 troops by August 2010, focusing on training and supporting the ISF. There is speculation that U.S. troops may still be needed beyond this time, with the Security Agreement possibly being amended. President Obama expressed concerns about security deteriorating in July 2009. President Obama expressed concerns about security deteriorating in July 2009, but did not indicate adding U.S. forces if needed. General Odierno's plan to partner U.S. forces with ISF and peshmerga in northern Iraq has not been substantially implemented, raising concerns about an open-ended commitment. The need for U.S. troops to stay in Iraq beyond 2011 depends on the progress of the ISF. The United States believes the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) are capable of handling security responsibilities as the U.S. withdraws. Recent reports praise the ISF's professionalism and performance in combat operations against AQ-I. Interior Minister Jawad Bolani is credited for removing militiamen from the ISF, contributing to its progress. The ISF, under Interior Minister Jawad Bolani, has improved in professionalism and effectiveness, with the National Police being considered more efficient. Despite previous concerns, the Interior Ministry has been reformed, but doubts remain about ISF's readiness to secure Iraq from internal and external threats post-U.S. withdrawal. Gen. Dubik and the Iraqi Defense Minister predicted ISF readiness by 2012 for internal threats and 2018-2020 for external threats. The ISF, led by Interior Minister Jawad Bolani, has shown improvement in professionalism and effectiveness, particularly with the National Police. Despite past criticisms, the Interior Ministry has undergone reforms. However, concerns persist regarding the ISF's ability to secure Iraq post-U.S. withdrawal, with doubts about their readiness for internal and external threats. Gen. Dubik suggested ISF could assume the lead internal security role between 2009 and 2012, but challenges remain such as ethnic and sectarian imbalances within units and potential infiltration by militias or insurgents. Appointments to senior commands in the Iraqi military are reportedly biased towards Shiite figures, causing Sunni distrust. The \"Facilities Protection Force\" has been involved in sectarian violence and efforts are being made to bring it under control. The Ministry of Interior oversees the issuance of badges and supervision of weapons used by the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF). The U.S. strategy focuses on training the ISF to take over security responsibilities. The Foreign Military Sales program has provided equipment worth billions of dollars to Iraq since 2005. The Foreign Military Sales program has provided Iraq with various military equipment, including tanks, armored vehicles, helicopters, and patrol boats. Iraq has requested to purchase F-16 aircraft, but the approval is uncertain due to concerns about potential misuse. Additionally, Iraqi officials are evaluating combat aircraft previously owned by Saddam Hussein for potential use. Iraq has plans to buy 2,000 retrofitted T-72 tanks from Eastern European suppliers to strengthen its armored force. In addition, Iraq has purchased 24 Eurocopters from France and is considering buying 18 Mirage F-1's. The European Union is discussing small arms sales with Iraq, and Iraq has also ordered $100 million in light equipment from China for its police forces. This purchase was partly due to delays in the delivery of U.S. weapons. The slow delivery of U.S. weapons was a concern highlighted by the Iraq Study Group. Most non-U.S. foreign troops have left Iraq, with some attributing the lack of international participation in peacekeeping to the absence of U.N. approval for the invasion. Partner force drawdowns began with Spain's withdrawal in 2004, leading to pledges from some nations to continue training the Iraqi Security Forces or increase contributions in Afghanistan. In 2004, Spain withdrew its 1,300 troops from Iraq following the Madrid bombings. Other countries like Honduras, the Dominican Republic, and Nicaragua also withdrew their personnel. Ukraine and Bulgaria reduced their forces after insurgent attacks and elections. South Korea decreased its troop contribution from 3,600 to 1,200 by late 2007. South Korea reduced its troop contribution in Iraq from 3,600 to 1,200 by late 2007, and further extended the deployment until the end of 2008 with only 600 troops. Japan completed its withdrawal of a 600-person military contingent in Samawah in July 2006 but continued to provide air transport. Italy, Denmark, Lithuania, and Georgia also withdrew their troops from Iraq in various stages between 2006 and 2007. In August 2008, the United States airlifted Georgian troops back home to deal with the Russian incursion into Georgia. Poland's 900 troops left Iraq in December 2008, along with forces from other countries like Armenia, Slovakia, Denmark, and Ukraine. Tonga, the Czech Republic, and Azerbaijan also held mission close-out ceremonies in early December 2008. Australia's 550 person contingent left Iraq in June 2008. Australia will provide $160 million in aid to Iraqi farmers and maintain naval and other forces in the region. British forces have been reduced from 7,100 to about 4,000, with a focus on an \"overwatch\" mission in southern Iraq. On March 31, 2009, Britain handed over its main base in Basra to the United States and formally ended its combat mission. The Iraqi National Assembly approved a security agreement with Britain to allow about 100 British personnel to secure Iraq's southern oil ports and train Iraqi Navy and other ISF forces. NATO countries have agreed to train the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) through NTM-I and provide funds or equipment. European Union leaders also trained Iraqi police, administrators, and judges. The Bush Administration asserted that it had sought U.N. and partner country involvement in Iraq efforts, with U.N. Security Council Resolution 1483 recognizing the CPA as a legal occupation authority. Negotiations are ongoing to extend the NTM-I mission through 2011. Resolution 1483 recognized the CPA as a legal occupation authority, while Resolution 1511 authorized a multinational force under U.S. command. Resolution 1546 endorsed the U.S. handover of sovereignty and authorized a coalition force to protect U.N. personnel in Iraq. The U.S.-led coalition retained the ability to take and hold prisoners as per an annexed exchange of letters between the United States and Iraq. Resolutions 1637, 1723, and 1790 extended the coalition's mandate annually, with reviews scheduled on June 15 of each year. Despite a vote in Iraq's parliament, the mandate was extended in December 2007. Resolution 1859 (December 22, 2008) renewed the provision for Iraq's oil revenues to be deposited in the Development Fund for Iraq (DFI) and audited by the International Advisory and Monitoring Board (IAMB). The resolution also continued U.N. protection for Iraqi assets from attachments and lawsuits, giving Iraq control over its oil revenues. In 2007, Iraqi leaders sought to end Iraq's Chapter 7 U.N. status, signed a \"Declaration of Principles\" with the U.S. to replace the U.N. mandate with a bilateral agreement by December 2008. This agreement outlined the future political and economic relationship between the two countries, allowing U.S. forces to operate in Iraq beyond the U.N. mandate expiry. The Security Agreement and related strategic framework agreement were negotiated and approved by Iraq's parliament on November 27, 2008, by a vote of 149-35. A law requiring a national referendum on the pact by July 31, 2009, could trigger a termination of the pact one year later. The possibility of a full U.S. withdrawal in early 2011 was considered. The Security Agreement, ratified in January 2009, provides immunities for U.S. troops and civilian employees in Iraq. It includes a timetable for U.S. withdrawal by the end of 2011 and mandates coordination with a joint U.S.-Iraq military committee. U.S. combat forces ceased patrols in Iraqi cities by June 30, 2009, aligning with President Obama's draw-down plans. The Security Agreement ratified in January 2009 includes a timetable for U.S. withdrawal by the end of 2011 and mandates coordination with a joint U.S.-Iraq military committee. The final draft also included a provision that U.S. forces cannot use Iraq as a base to attack other countries. The \"Green Zone\" was handed over to Iraqi control on January 1, 2009, and the agreement does not allow for permanent U.S. bases in Iraq. The FY2008/9 supplemental, FY2009 defense authorization, FY2009 supplemental, and FY2010 Defense Authorization contain provisions prohibiting the establishment of permanent military installations or bases in Iraq and control over Iraq's oil resources. Non-binding resolutions passed by the COR aimed to ease Sunni concerns over government abuses and repression. Opposition to the pact mainly came from the Sadr movement. The Obama Administration may consider options if security in Iraq deteriorates as the US reduces its involvement. The Iraq Study Group report offered recommendations later adopted by the Bush Administration, including transitioning to Iraqi security self-reliance and continued combat against AQ-I. The troop surge strategy delayed the transition to ISF-led combat. The Bush Administration considered a temporary surge in Iraq, backed regional diplomacy, and renewed commitment to Arab-Israeli peace. Additional support for stabilizing Afghanistan was not specified in President Bush's Iraq plan. The Obama Administration may consider options for Iraq's security as US involvement decreases. The Obama Administration has emphasized increasing U.S. troops and aid for Afghanistan, setting benchmarks for the Iraqi government, and giving more control over police units to the Iraqi Ministry of Defense. President Bush signed legislation linking U.S. economic aid to progress on Iraqi benchmarks. The United States has pushed Iraq to pass oil laws to attract foreign investment. Economic aid to Iraq has increased, but U.S. aid is decreasing due to improved Iraqi finances. Legislation to revive the Iraq Study Group and adopt its recommendations was proposed but not included in the foreign aid bill. In June 2007, proposed legislation (S. 1545) aimed to adopt the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group as U.S. policy. Some argued for increased troop levels in Iraq to prevent Sunni insurgents from re-infiltrating cleared areas, but this option faded in 2008 due to progress from the surge. President Obama might reconsider this if security worsens, but it is unlikely the U.S. will send additional troops once a major drawdown has begun. The Bush Administration consistently opposed this option. The Bush Administration opposed the option of rapid withdrawal from Iraq, citing concerns about the readiness of Iraqi security forces, potential civil war, AQ-I activities, Al Qaeda threats, and involvement of regional powers. Supporters of immediate withdrawal argued that the invasion was a mistake, the U.S. presence could reignite insurgency, and U.S. forces were policing a civil war. Members of the \"Out of Iraq Congressional Caucus\" supported immediate withdrawal. Some Members criticized the Obama draw-down plan as too slow, questioning why 50,000 U.S. forces would remain after August 2010. Representative John Murtha introduced a resolution calling for U.S. withdrawal \"at the earliest practicable date\" and maintaining an \"over the horizon\" U.S. presence in Kuwait. The Bush Administration opposed a withdrawal timetable, citing concerns about insurgents waiting out a U.S. withdrawal. The Iraq Study Group suggested winding down the U.S. combat mission by early 2008 but did not recommend a firm timetable. The Iraq Study Group suggested winding down the U.S. combat mission by early 2008 without a firm timetable. Iraqi leaders negotiated a withdrawal timetable in the Security Agreement. Various legislation for a U.S. withdrawal timetable did not pass, but an FY2007 supplemental appropriations bill required progress on political benchmarks by July 1, 2007, with redeployment starting by March 1, 2008. The House passed H.R. 1591 on March 23, 2007, with a goal for U.S. withdrawal by March 1, 2008. President Bush vetoed the conference report on May 1, 2007. A House bill, H.R. 2956, mandated withdrawal within 120 days and completion by April 1, 2008. An amendment to H.R. 1585 proposed a similar provision. In November 2007, an FY2008 supplemental appropriation suggested a target date of December 15, 2008 for U.S. withdrawal. In the 109th Congress, the debate over setting a timetable for U.S. withdrawal from Iraq continued. Senator Levin introduced an amendment to compel the Administration to work on a withdrawal timetable in 2006. A related amendment by Senator Warner required an Administration report on conditions for withdrawal. This measure passed with bipartisan support. In the 109th Congress, there was a debate over setting a timetable for U.S. withdrawal from Iraq. Senator Levin introduced an amendment for a withdrawal timetable in 2006, which passed with bipartisan support. In June 2006, the Senate debated Iraq-related amendments to a defense authorization bill, with one setting a deadline for U.S. redeployment from Iraq and another calling for redeployment by the end of 2006. President Obama later announced a mission scale-back in 2009. President Obama announced a mission scale-back in 2009, following the Security Agreement requiring U.S. forces to pull out of Iraqi urban areas by June 30, 2009. In 2007, there were discussions about planning for a withdrawal, with Secretary of Defense Gates touring facilities in Kuwait to assess redeployment capabilities. In 2007, Senator Hillary Clinton was briefed on planning for withdrawal from Iraq and introduced legislation requiring contingency planning. The Iraq Study Group recommended increased regional diplomacy and forming a \"contact group\" of major countries and Iraqi neighbors. The Bush Administration took steps in this direction, and experts expected the Obama Administration to continue this trend. The Obama Administration indicated a wind down of the Iraq stabilization mission as Iraq stabilized. Some argue the regional dimension is crucial now to address possible deterioration post U.S. drawdown. Bills in Congress support the Iraq Study Group recommendation for an international conference on Iraq. Ideas in previous resolutions included timetables for U.S. withdrawal and recruitment of new force donors. In 2004, Secretary of State Powell considered a Saudi proposal for a contingent. The United States may consider a Saudi proposal for Muslim countries to provide peacekeeping troops in Iraq. Iraqi leaders fear Sunni Muslim states would favor Sunni factions. Some experts suggest appointing an international mediator for negotiations with Iraq's major factions. Congressional members once requested a special envoy for political reconciliation efforts in Iraq. Despite legislative achievements and security improvements, lasting political reconciliation remains elusive, and Iraq may face renewed violence in the future. Some suggest the need for political restructuring in Iraq to achieve reconciliation, especially involving Sunni Arabs. However, there is uncertainty on how to incentivize Sunni leaders to fully support a Shiite-led government. Sunni resentment may persist due to expected Shiite dominance after the 2010 elections. One proposed solution is a government reshuffle to include Sunni Arabs in key positions. The U.S. may face limitations in determining a new power structure in Iraq, with suggestions for a \"Lebanon model\" where key positions are allocated to different factions to address Sunni grievances and avoid civil war. Some argue against U.S.-led changes to avoid appearing undemocratic. Some suggest a \"Lebanon model\" for Iraq to prevent civil war by allocating key positions to different factions. There are debates on supporting Shiite and Kurdish factions, with views on the \"80% solution\" favoring them due to Sunni resistance. Opponents argue that Sunni cooperation is increasing, making the strategy unnecessary. Some argue for a multi-sectarian government in Iraq, while others fear further repression of Sunni Arabs with US support for Shiites and Kurds. There are also suggestions to partition Iraq into three separate countries. Some suggest partitioning Iraq into three separate countries, but this idea is widely opposed due to concerns about violence, instability, and the high percentage of mixed Sunni-Shiite Arab families in Iraq. This recommendation was rejected by the Iraq Study Group. Expert Leslie Gelb and others are proposing the formation of three autonomous regions in Iraq, each dominated by a major community, to prevent all-out civil war. This idea, known as \"soft partition,\" aims to preserve Iraq's territorial integrity while implementing federalism. Some argue that decentralization is already happening, with power shifting to Sunni tribes and fewer U.S. troops in the Shiite south. Similar approaches have been successful in other regions like the Balkans. Some suggest implementing a \"soft partition\" in Iraq, creating autonomous regions for different communities to prevent civil war. Proponents believe this approach, successful in the Balkans, could bypass political deadlock in Iraq. Critics argue it may lead to independence movements and fail to consider Iraq's national identity. The international community initially planned to preserve a central government in Yugoslavia, but it broke up into several countries due to the push for independence. There are concerns that autonomous regions in Iraq could fall under the influence of neighboring countries, leading to potential bloodshed as populations move to areas dominated by their sect or group. The idea of federalism or decentralization gained support with the passage of an amendment to an FY2008 defense authorization bill. The FY2008 defense authorization bill amendment supports a political settlement in Iraq based on federalism, creating a federal Iraq with regions. Many Iraqi factions oppose the amendment due to concerns about autonomy and potential influence from neighboring countries. Many Iraqis opposed the amendment supporting federalism in Iraq, fearing it could lead to partition. The U.S. Embassy in Iraq clarified that the amendment was not about dividing Iraq into separate states. Vice President Biden's visit in 2009 was criticized for his past support of federalism, but U.S. officials stated that dividing Iraq into autonomous regions was not U.S. policy. In 2007, there was substantial discussion about the possibility of the United States ousting Maliki, either through force or by influencing the COR to vote no confidence in his government. Some suggest replacing Maliki with a military strongman or someone more willing to compromise with Sunni Arabs. Former Prime Minister Allawi is positioning himself as an alternative figure. However, experts in the United States see no concrete signs of President Obama considering this option. Some believe economic reconstruction is key to calming Iraq, as it could create jobs, improve services, and build confidence in the government. Others doubt economic improvements alone can solve Iraq's deep-rooted political issues. Another idea is to establish an Iraqi fund to distribute oil wealth equitably among all citizens. Senator Hillary Clinton and Senator John Ensign proposed the creation of an \"Iraq Oil Trust\" modeled after the Alaska Permanent Fund to ensure equitable sharing of Iraq's oil wealth. Some Members suggest that Iraq should take on more financial responsibility and that U.S. reconstruction funding for Iraq should be reduced, possibly provided as loans instead of grants. The FY2009 defense authorization (P.L. 110-417) includes a provision for U.S.-Iraq negotiations on Iraq defraying some U.S. combat costs, which the Administration opposed in its signing statement. The Administration argues that Iraq is already taking on more financial burden, and U.S. assistance to Iraq has decreased since FY2007."
