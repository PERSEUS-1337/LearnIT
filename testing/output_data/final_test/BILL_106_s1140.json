    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Health Care Worker Needlestick Prevention Act\" and includes requirements for needlestick prevention. The Health Care Worker Needlestick Prevention Act mandates the use of needleless systems and sharps with engineered sharps injury protections to prevent the spread of bloodborne pathogens in workplaces. Non-managerial direct care health care workers must participate in identifying and evaluating these safety measures. The bloodborne pathogens standard applies to all employers unless they can prove that needleless systems and sharps with engineered sharps injury protections are not suitable for their work facility or not commercially available. The standard requires the use of these safety measures to prevent the spread of bloodborne pathogens. The amendment requires employers to include needleless systems and sharps with engineered sharps injury protections in their exposure control plan. They must also maintain a separate contaminated sharps injury log with specific information for each exposure incident. The exposure incident report should include details such as the type and brand of sharp involved, job classification of the exposed employee, department where the incident occurred, procedure being performed at the time, how the incident occurred, body part involved, and whether the sharp had engineered sharps injury protections. The exposure incident report should include details such as whether the protective mechanism was activated before the injury, employee training on device use, and the injured employee's opinion on the need for engineered sharps injury protections. The exposure incident report should include details on whether the protective mechanism was activated before the injury, employee training on device use, and the injured employee's opinion on the need for engineered sharps injury protections. Additionally, all direct care health care workers must receive adequate training on needleless systems and sharps with engineered injury protections. SEC. 3. NATIONAL CLEARINGHOUSE ON SAFER NEEDLE TECHNOLOGY. The Director of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health will establish a national database on needleless systems and sharps with engineered injury protections. Evaluation criteria will be developed for selecting these systems, along with a training curriculum. A national system will be set up to collect data on needlestick injuries in healthcare. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health will collect data on needlestick injuries among healthcare workers and have access to employer records. $15,000,000 is authorized for this purpose. SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS. The Act defines key terms such as bloodborne pathogens, contaminated, direct care health care worker, and employer in relation to occupational exposure to infectious materials. The Act defines terms related to occupational exposure to infectious materials, including engineered sharps injury protections and needleless systems. The term \"sharp\" refers to any object in a healthcare setting that can penetrate the skin, leading to exposure incidents. This includes needle devices, scalpels, broken glass, and dental instruments. A \"sharps injury\" is any injury caused by a sharp object, such as cuts or needlesticks. A sharp object in a healthcare setting can cause injuries like cuts, abrasions, or needlesticks. A sharps injury log is a record that meets specific requirements. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will require non-exempt Medicare hospitals to comply with the bloodborne pathogens standard for their employees. The Act will be effective upon enactment, with the Secretary of Labor taking necessary actions within a year."
