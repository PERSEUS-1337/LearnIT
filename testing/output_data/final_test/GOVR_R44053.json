Subtotals are provided for each component, along with totals for individual titles and components in the entire bill. Total FY2016 funding for DHS components from all sources, outside of the defense budget function, competes for discretionary spending allocations under the Budget Control Act. House Homeland Security Subcommittee Chairman John Carter expressed concern over the proposed $1.5 billion increase for DHS, which absorbs a significant portion of non-defense discretionary spending. Congress aims to adhere to budget constraints despite the Administration's budget request. The Administration proposed a 1.3% pay increase for civilian federal employees and military members in its FY2016 budget request. DHS employees, mostly civilians, may not see a steep rise in their budget as the Senate and House Appropriations Committees suggest absorbing the cost within existing funds. Military pay raise was fully funded according to the House Appropriations Committee report. The military pay raise was fully funded, and an executive order authorized a 1.3% pay adjustment for federal civilian employees in January 2016. The FY2016 Homeland Security Appropriations Act included a provision prohibiting structural pay reform affecting more than 100 positions or costing over $5 million until Congress is notified. The Senate Appropriations Committee report highlighted hiring difficulties at the Department of Homeland Security, with delays in bringing funded positions on board due to various reasons. Hiring times have increased department-wide and at Customs and Border Protection, leading to challenges in recruitment and retention of qualified applicants. The U.S. Secret Service, however, improved its hiring times according to the committee report. The Senate Appropriations Committee report highlighted hiring challenges at the Department of Homeland Security, with delays in bringing funded positions on board. Despite improvements in hiring times at the U.S. Secret Service, the hiring process still takes a long time. The report directed DHS to develop strategies to reduce hiring times and track hiring actions with metrics. Chronic personnel shortages and lengthy hiring times are jeopardizing DHS's homeland security mission. The DHS is facing hiring challenges and is expected to be significantly understaffed by the end of FY2015. The House report expresses doubts about DHS's ability to spend the requested funds for FY2016 and reduces funding accordingly. The report mandates the USM to analyze attrition and hiring issues, develop a corrective action plan, and provide monthly updates to the committee. Additionally, DHS is directed to report on a strategy for reducing hiring times. The committee directed DHS to provide a report on reducing hiring times and metrics, including a root cause analysis and corrective action plan. Monthly reports on hiring metrics were mandated to begin in January 2016. Outside the appropriations process, DHS was granted special authority to expedite hiring of cybersecurity professionals. The Senate and House Appropriations Committees are concerned about the Department of Homeland Security's lack of a consistent methodology for determining personnel requirements and costs. They are requesting reports and briefings on balancing technology needs with manpower costs to support DHS operations. The committee directed the OCFO to provide quarterly briefings on the progress of a force structure analysis for the FY2018 budget request. DHS components have funding limitations for reception and representation expenses, ranging from $2,000 to $34,425. The Senate and House-reported bills include limitations on reception and representation expenses totaling $177,505 and $166,955 respectively.

The Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2016 allocated $169,655 for official reception and representation expenses. Additional perspectives on FY2016 DHS appropriations can be found in various CRS reports. The CRS analysts and specialists contribute to DHS appropriations reports, detailing budget authority, obligations, and outlays in federal government spending. Budget authority is established through appropriations acts or direct spending legislation, determining the amounts available for federal agencies to spend. The Antideficiency Act prohibits agencies from obligating more funds than enacted budget authority. Budget authority may be indefinite, with Congress enacting language providing \"such sums as may be necessary.\" Budget authority can be one-year, multiyear, or no-year, with obligations incurred when federal agencies engage in transactions. Outlays are the funds spent during the fiscal year, and budget authority may not always match outlays due to multiyear or no-year obligations. Budget authority allows federal agencies to incur obligations and authorize payments from the Treasury. Discretionary and mandatory spending make up the total funds available for spending, with discretionary spending appropriated yearly by Congress. Mandatory spending, also known as direct spending, is not subject to annual appropriations acts. Mandatory spending, also known as direct spending, consists of budget authority and resulting outlays provided in laws other than appropriations acts. Some mandatory entitlement programs must be appropriated each year. Within DHS, Coast Guard retirement pay is an example of appropriated mandatory spending. Offsetting collections are funds collected by the federal government as part of a business-type transaction and are not considered federal revenue. DHS net discretionary budget authority is composed of discretionary spending minus any fee or fund collections that offset discretionary spending. The DHS budget includes mandatory entitlement programs like the Secret Service and Coast Guard retired pay accounts, funded by permanent or annual appropriations. Additionally, there are offsetting Trust and Public Enterprise Funds in the DHS budget. The DHS budget includes offsetting Trust and Public Enterprise Funds, which are not appropriated by Congress but are available for obligation. The budget authority for annual appropriations, including DHS, is determined through a two-stage congressional budget process involving 302(a) and 302(b) allocations. Congress sets overall spending totals in the annual concurrent resolution on the budget, which are then allocated among appropriations committees for enactment in annual appropriations bills. The appropriations committees allocate 302(a) discretionary funds among subcommittees for appropriations bills, known as 302(b) allocations. These allocations enforce budget discipline and may be adjusted during the year. No subcommittee allocations are developed for conference reports or enacted appropriations bills. Table A-1 shows comparable figures for the 302(b) allocation for FY2015. The President's request for FY2016 Homeland Security appropriations, House and Senate subcommittee allocations, and Budget Control Act discretionary spending caps for FY2012 and FY2013 were discussed. The overall cap for FY2015 discretionary spending is $1,014 billion, with separate limits for defense and nondefense spending. Most of the DHS budget falls under nondefense. The DHS budget for FY2016 is $521 billion for nondefense spending, with adjustments allowed under the Budget Control Act for overseas contingency operations, emergency spending, and disaster relief. Adjustments for disaster relief are limited and determined by OMB. The OMB determines the allowable adjustment for disaster relief based on a formula using a rolling average of spending over the last ten fiscal years. For FY2014, the allowable adjustment was $12,143 million, with only $5,717 million exercised. In FY2015, the allowable adjustment was $18,430 million, with $11,913 million from the rolling average and $6,517 million carried over from FY2014. FY2016 had an allowable adjustment of $14,125 million."
