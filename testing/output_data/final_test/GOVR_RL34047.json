The ACAA aimed to overrule a Supreme Court case and balance protecting individuals with disabilities from discrimination while ensuring general passenger safety. This inquiry is timely given public concerns about infectious diseases in air travel. The Air Carrier Access Act (ACAA) was passed in 1986 to address discrimination against individuals with disabilities when traveling by air. It prohibits discrimination by air carriers based on disability and includes regulations for passengers with communicable diseases. Proposed amendments aimed to provide aggrieved individuals with legal recourse. The Air Carrier Access Act (ACAA) protects individuals with disabilities from discrimination when traveling by air. It defines \"qualified\" individuals with disabilities and leaves implementation to the Department of Transportation. Regulations were initially implemented in 1990 to enforce the ACAA. The Department of Transportation originally implemented regulations to enforce the Air Carrier Access Act (ACAA) on March 6, 1990. The ACAA prohibits air carriers from discriminating against individuals with disabilities in the provision of air transportation. Carriers cannot require passengers to accept special services, ensuring equal treatment for all passengers. However, there are exceptions for safety reasons. In Deterra v. America West Airlines, discriminatory conduct was noted when a person in a wheelchair was asked to move to the front of a ticket line without requesting special service. The Air Carrier Access Act (ACAA) prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in air transportation. Carriers can refuse service for safety reasons or if it violates FAA, TSA, or foreign government requirements. The ACAA applies to both government and commercial air carriers, impacting nearly all air carriers that transport passengers. The ACAA, which prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in air transportation, now applies to foreign air carriers as well. Regulations were revised in 2008, with new provisions effective from 2009. Foreign air carriers must comply with the ACAA for flights to or from U.S. airports, including addressing communicable diseases. Courts consider communicable diseases as falling within the scope of \"disability\" under the ADA. The ACAA prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in air transportation, including those with communicable diseases. Carriers are restricted from refusing transportation, delaying passengers, imposing unequal conditions, or requiring medical certificates, unless the passenger poses a direct threat to others. Carriers have discretion in determining if a passenger poses a \"direct threat\" based on an individualized assessment. They must consider the nature, duration, and severity of the risk, the probability of harm occurring, and if reasonable modifications can mitigate the risk. Carriers must choose the least restrictive response and take specific actions to fulfill the ACAA's nondiscrimination requirement. These are minimum standards set by the Department of Transportation regulations. The ACAA sets minimum accessibility requirements for aircraft, including movable aisle armrests, priority space for folding wheelchairs, accessible lavatories, and on-board wheelchairs for passengers with disabilities. Airlines must comply with these regulations to ensure nondiscrimination. Air carriers must allow individuals with disabilities to travel with service animals and permit them to accompany the passenger at any seat. An attendant may be required for safety reasons in specific situations such as traveling in a stretcher or having severe impairments. Air carriers must allow individuals with disabilities to travel with service animals and permit them to accompany the passenger at any seat. Carriers must accept service animal identification cards, tags, and credible verbal assurances as proof. Airlines must also allow qualified individuals to bring ventilator or respirator equipment into the cabin and stow assistive devices in designated areas. The regulations require carriers to assist individuals with disabilities with boarding and deplaning, not count assistive devices towards carry-on baggage limits, and not require individuals with disabilities to sit in specific seats. Carriers must comply with FAA, PHMSA, TSA, or foreign government requirements for stowing carry-on items. Carriers must comply with FAA or foreign government safety requirements for accommodating passengers with disabilities. Advance notice may be required for certain accommodations or equipment. Security screening procedures for individuals with disabilities should be the same as for those without disabilities, with exceptions for assistive devices that may conceal weapons. In recent cases, federal circuits have ruled that private individuals cannot sue airlines for discrimination under the ACAA. Instead, individuals can complain to the Department of Transportation (DOT) and file petitions for review with federal circuit courts if DOT does not investigate. This limits individuals' ability to enforce the ACAA through federal courts, relying on DOT for enforcement. Some experts argue that DOT's enforcement is weak, as it is handled through its enforcement office rather than its civil rights office. DOT has investigated numerous ACAA complaints. The Civil Rights Act of 2008 proposed amending the ACAA to allow for a private right of action, as judicial decisions have limited individuals' ability to sue airlines for discrimination. Congress expressed concern that DOT's enforcement of ACAA violations is insufficient due to lack of resources. The 110th Congress did not pass legislation to protect individuals with disabilities. The 111th Congress has not introduced similar legislation."
