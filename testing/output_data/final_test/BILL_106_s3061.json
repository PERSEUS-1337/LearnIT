Negotiations must begin within 60 days, focusing on global transparency and cooperation among governments. Criteria include designating competent authorities in member states. Member states must designate a competent authority for disseminating recall information on motor vehicles and equipment to the public and other foreign authorities. They should cooperate internationally through information exchange and joint action. Information on competent authorities must be made available through a collective Internet site managed for the international agreement. Member states should disseminate final guidelines on motor vehicle recalls widely to relevant government departments. Developed states should assist developing states in implementing the agreement and ensuring compliance. Member states should establish a framework for oversight and review to assess the effectiveness of the agreement and share domestic laws with other states. The President should include guidelines on recalls for enterprises exporting motor vehicles in international agreements. Enterprises exporting autos or auto parts globally should disclose all relevant information about recalls to the competent authorities in the country of recall initiation and the country of incorporation. Consumer awareness of recalls for motor vehicles should be prioritized, especially in neighboring countries. Enterprises should cooperate with national authorities in countries requesting information about motor vehicle recalls to ensure consumer safety. The United States government coordinates information on foreign recalls of motor vehicles or equipment to ensure consumer safety. The President designates the Secretary of Transportation as the authority for recalls of motor vehicles or equipment. The Secretary advises the President in negotiations and collaborates with other relevant officials. Until international database is established, the Secretary must maintain an official website with detailed information. The Department of State will establish procedures for U.S. embassies to inform the Secretary of Transportation immediately about recalls of motor vehicles or equipment in foreign countries. The Secretary will then notify the Senate and House Commerce Committees."
