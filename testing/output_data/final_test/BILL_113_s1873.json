    "content": "The \"Protect Student Borrowers Act of 2013\" aims to make institutions of higher education share the risk of student loan defaults. This Act requires these institutions to assume some of the default risk for student loans under part D of title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965. Section 454 of the Higher Education Act of 1964 is amended to include institutional risk-sharing requirements for student loan defaults. Each institution of higher education participating in the direct student loan program must accept these requirements if applicable. Institutions with a high cohort default rate must pay a risk-sharing payment based on the volume of student loans in default. The payment is determined as a percentage of the total loan amount, including interest and fees. Institutions with high default rates must pay a risk-sharing amount based on loan volume. The payment is a percentage of total loan amount, including interest and fees. Institutions with high default rates must pay a risk-sharing amount based on loan volume, which is a percentage of the total loan amount, including interest and fees. The Secretary may waive or reduce these payments for institutions meeting certain criteria. \"Institutions with approved student loan management plans may have reduced risk-sharing payments based on default rates. The payment amount is 15 percent of the total loan amount for defaulted students.\" The risk-sharing payment for institutions with different cohort default rates is 10 percent for rate (2)(B) and 5 percent for rate (2)(C) of the total loan amount for defaulted students. An institution receiving a waiver or reduced risk-sharing payment must show progress in implementing a student loan management plan, including effective financial aid counseling for students. The plan should analyze loan management strategies. The institution must implement a student loan management plan analyzing risk factors and taking actions to minimize defaults. Waivers or reductions in risk-sharing payments may be granted for eligible institutions under specific criteria. The institution of higher education must not refuse admission or financial aid to a student based on the perception of default risk for a loan under this part. A separate account is established in the Treasury of the United States for the deposit of risk-sharing payments collected under this subsection. The Secretary can use up to 50 percent of the funds for delinquency and default prevention or rehabilitation contracts. The Secretary will reserve funds for a Federal Pell Grant fund to offset future shortfalls in funding. This will begin with the cohort default rate for the 2014 cohort, including students entering repayment in fiscal year 2014. The Secretary will report annually to Congress on this information. The House of Representatives will provide information on institutions subject to risk-sharing payments, required payments, amounts collected, waivers granted, reductions in payments, and use of funds from payments. The House of Representatives will provide information on risk-sharing payments for institutions, including details on delinquency and default prevention or rehabilitation, and the amount reserved for the Federal Pell Grant program. SEC. 4. CONTRACTS AND COOPERATIVE AGREEMENTS. Section 456 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to allow the Secretary to enter into contracts or cooperative agreements for delinquency and default prevention at institutions of higher education with high default rates or serving high-risk student loan borrowers. The Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to help prevent default on student loans by targeting high-risk borrowers and increasing successful loan rehabilitations. The Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to ensure financial responsibility by institutions, including meeting all financial obligations such as risk-sharing payments, refunds, and repayments to the Secretary for incurred liabilities and debts."
