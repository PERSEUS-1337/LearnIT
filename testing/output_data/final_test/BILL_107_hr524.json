    "content": "The Act titled \"Electronic Commerce Enhancement Act of 2001\" is also known as the \"Electronic Commerce\" Act. It includes findings related to electronic commerce. The Congress finds that electronic commerce, especially business-to-business transactions among small and medium-sized manufacturers, is rapidly growing in the United States. This sector plays a critical role in the economy and can benefit from e-commerce by developing new products, markets, and improving efficiency in interactions with suppliers and customers. The National Institute of Standards and Technology's Manufacturing Extension Partnership program helps small and medium-sized manufacturers utilize electronic commerce to interact with customers, suppliers, and the public, as well as for support functions like personnel services and training. The program has successfully assisted businesses in remedying Y2K computer issues in collaboration with the Small Business Administration. The growth of electronic commerce relies on the ability of different systems to exchange information. Developing interoperability standards and testbeds will ensure compatibility and enhance the continued expansion of electronic commerce. SEC. 102. REPORT ON THE UTILIZATION OF ELECTRONIC COMMERCE. The Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology will establish an Advisory Panel to address challenges faced by small and medium-sized manufacturers in utilizing electronic commerce technologies. The Panel will include representatives from relevant organizations and will report within 12 months of the Act's enactment. The Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology will establish an Advisory Panel to address challenges faced by small and medium-sized manufacturers in utilizing electronic commerce technologies. The Panel will report to the Committee on Science of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate on the immediate requirements of small and medium-sized manufacturers to integrate electronic commerce technologies. The report will describe current utilization of electronic commerce practices, assess the need for encryption and data security, and identify interoperability issues. The Advisory Panel will provide a 3-year assessment of small and medium-sized manufacturers' needs for integrating electronic commerce technologies. The report will include an economic assessment of interoperability impact, recommendations for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership program, and suggestions for utilizing electronic commerce technologies and practices. The report will provide a 3-year planning document for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership program in electronic commerce and recommendations for addressing interoperability issues. SEC. 103. ELECTRONIC COMMERCE PILOT PROGRAM. The National Institute of Standards and Technology's Manufacturing Extension Partnership program, in consultation with the Small Business Administration, will establish a pilot program to help small and medium-sized manufacturers integrate electronic commerce technologies. The goal is to provide them with information to make informed decisions in utilizing e-commerce goods and services through a competitive grants program for Regional Centers for the Transfer of Manufacturing Technology. The program will consult with the Advisory Panel. The Partnership program will consult with the Advisory Panel and use their reports. TITLE II--ENTERPRISE INTEGRATION\n\nSEC. 201. ENTERPRISE INTEGRATION ASSESSMENT AND PLAN. The Director will assess enterprise integration standards and activities in major manufacturing industries in the US, working with industry representatives to identify current state, remaining steps, and roles of NIST and private sector.
