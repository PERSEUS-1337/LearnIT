    "content": "Since 1971, Congress has funded intercity passenger rail service primarily through Amtrak, covering operating losses and infrastructure improvements. Amtrak's Northeast Corridor offers the fastest rail service in the US, reaching speeds of 160 mph for short distances. Congress allocated significant funds in 2008 and 2009 for the development of higher-speed intercity passenger rail services. The High-Speed Intercity Passenger Rail (HSIPR) Grant Program was established in 2008 to finance development of faster intercity passenger rail services by state governments. Despite significant funding, the results of this investment in new services are not yet apparent. Congress rarely funded intercity passenger rail before 2008, but the Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 authorized federal grants totaling $2.225 billion over five years to help states develop rail infrastructure. President Barack Obama proposed spending on high-speed rail projects as part of an economic stimulus program to address a recession. Congress approved $8 billion for grants to states for high-speed and intercity passenger rail services in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The President declared high-speed rail development as a priority and requested an additional $1 billion annually for this purpose. This priority was reflected in the FY2010 Department of Transportation Appropriations Act. The FY2010 Department of Transportation Appropriations Act allocated $2.5 billion for high-speed and intercity passenger rail grants to states. Congress has not provided further funding for the HSIPR program, despite repeated requests from the Administration. The 112th Congress rescinded $400 million previously appropriated for this purpose. In December 2015, the Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act authorized $2.2 billion for improving intercity passenger and freight rail systems, funded from the general fund. For FY2016, the FAST Act authorized $200 million for intercity passenger rail grants, but Congress did not appropriate any funding. There is no single statutory definition of high-speed rail, with different definitions based on maximum speeds. The Federal Railroad Administration had a functional definition that focused on time-competitiveness with air and auto travel markets. The Federal Railroad Administration defines high-speed rail as service competitive with air and auto travel for distances of 100 to 500 miles, with speeds of at least 110 mph. FRA categorizes rail service into Core Express (125-250+ mph), Regional (90-125 mph), and Emerging (up to 90 mph) tiers. FRA, primarily a rail safety agency, began grantmaking in 2008 and received $8 billion for rail grants in 2009. In 2009, Congress allocated $8 billion for rail grants in ARRA, which included funding for high-speed rail, intercity passenger rail service, and grants to relieve congestion on the railroad network. The Federal Railroad Administration issued guidance combining grant programs from PRIIA, ARRA, and FY2009 DOT appropriations into four categories: Projects, Programs, Planning, and FY2009 Appropriations Projects. In 2009, the Federal Railroad Administration introduced Appropriations Projects as an alternative to Track 1 grants, utilizing FY2009 funding with a 50% match requirement. FRA received 278 preapplications for HSIPR grants, ultimately awarding 108 grants in the first round and 50 in the second round to 32 states and the District of Columbia. Reflecting the goals of the high-speed rail funding in ARRA, the grants aimed to stimulate the economy. The HSIPR grants in ARRA had short-term goals of stimulating the economy and long-term goals of developing a high-speed rail network. Many small grants were awarded for quick completion, with a few large grants accounting for the majority of funding. Grants for high-speed rail projects in Florida, Wisconsin, and Ohio were declined due to concerns over potential cost overruns. The HSIPR program faced challenges with funding allocation, with a significant portion of grants being reallocated to other projects. Congress mandated that unspent funds be returned to the Department of Transportation. By July 2016, over half of the HSIPR projects had been completed, including major grants exceeding $100 million for high-speed rail development in various corridors. The California High-Speed Rail Authority plans to build a 520-mile dedicated rail line between San Francisco and Los Angeles, with speeds up to 220 mph. Approved by voters in 2008, the project aims to connect the two cities in under three hours. The total cost is estimated at $55.3 billion, with a first phase including service to Merced. The California High-Speed Rail Authority has received $3.9 billion in HSIPR grants for a new rail line project. Construction began in the Fresno area in January 2015, with the initial segment extending from Merced to Shafter. The estimated cost for this segment is $7.3 billion. The California High-Speed Rail Authority received $3.9 billion in HSIPR grants for a new rail line project, with construction starting in the Fresno area in January 2015. The project aims to open service between San Jose, Merced, and Bakersfield in 2025, and between San Francisco and Los Angeles in 2029. Several projects funded by the authority to improve commuter rail lines are expected to be completed by 2021, with the goal of reducing travel time and increasing rail usage. The project funded by the California High-Speed Rail Authority aims to improve rail transportation by adding a parallel track, upgrading main tracks for faster service, improving grade crossings, constructing new tracks and sidings, installing fencing, upgrading train control signals, repairing bridges, renovating stations, and purchasing new high-speed train sets. The project is intended to increase passenger rail trips and prevent potential degradation of existing services due to increased freight rail traffic. The HSIPR grant work on the 304-mile corridor funded by 11 grants totaling $600 million has not yet resulted in travel time reductions or service frequency increases as of September 2016. The project includes purchasing Norfolk Southern track, a flyover to reduce delays, and infrastructure improvements to increase track speeds. Currently, there has been a 10-minute reduction in trip times between Chicago and Detroit, with a projected additional 20-minute reduction and improved on-time performance expected by the end of 2016. The Illinois and Iowa departments of transportation received $230 million in grants to upgrade track and signaling systems and build new stations for 79-mph passenger rail service between Chicago and Iowa City. Illinois received $177 million for Phase 1 (Chicago-Moline) while Iowa received $53 million for Phase 2 (Moline-Iowa City). Illinois's Phase 1 work was delayed but a revised schedule is being developed. Iowa is working on preliminary engineering for Phase 2 but lacks funding for state and local matches. The Washington State Department of Transportation is administering the Pacific Northwest Rail Corridor Improvement Program (PNWRC Program) with 11 HSIPR grants totaling $809 million. The goal is to improve the Amtrak Cascades route between Portland, OR, and Vancouver, British Columbia. Several components have been completed, but as of September 2016, there have been no travel time reductions or service frequency increases on this corridor. The Southeast High-Speed Rail Corridor received eight HSIPR grants totaling $740 million, with $630 million allocated for improvements between Charlotte and Raleigh. As of September 2016, the work has not resulted in travel time reductions or service frequency increases. Plans include adding two daily round-trips between Seattle and Portland, with a projected 10-minute trip time reduction. North Carolina DOT plans to introduce a fourth daily train in 2017 and a fifth in 2019, improving on-time performance. A total of 11 HSIPR grants totaling $983 million were awarded for projects on the Northeast Corridor (NEC), with the bulk of funding going to two projects in New Jersey. As of September 2016, the HSIPR grant work has not resulted in travel time reductions or service frequency increases on the NEC. Completion of the projects is expected to reduce trip times and improve on-time performance. Many of the grants were for small projects that have already been completed, with exceptions for the California High-Speed Rail Corridor and the Chicago-Iowa City project. The completion of major projects funded by HSIPR grants, including the Chicago-Iowa City project, is scheduled for fall 2017, seven years after receiving funding. Criticism has been directed at the time taken to complete these projects, but it is noted that the timeline is not unusually long compared to similar surface transportation projects. The grants for these projects were awarded in 2010, with some planning and environmental work done prior. The HSIPR projects have faced challenges such as community opposition, funding issues, and the need for states to create rail planning agencies. Many states had to hire professionals with experience in passenger rail projects before construction could proceed. Project completion sometimes required additional federal assistance, which was uncertain. The California High-Speed Rail Corridor project faced challenges with funding and delays in development. Despite receiving a $520 million HSIPR grant, additional funding from DOT's TIGER program was needed for a new station in Raleigh, NC. The project had been in development since 2004, with a state referendum in 2008 approving borrowing funds. Congress authorized the HSIPR grant program in ARRA in 2010, providing further assistance for the project. The California High-Speed Rail Corridor project received an HSIPR grant in 2010, but faced lawsuits and funding challenges. The project, with an estimated cost of around $64 billion for Phase 1, has been delayed due to environmental and engineering obstacles. Further funding is also a concern as the project progresses through final design. The California High-Speed Rail Corridor project faces funding challenges as the estimated cost is much higher than the current funding available. Government funding is crucial for high-speed rail projects as private investment is difficult to secure due to high initial costs and uncertain revenue generation. The proposed high-speed rail projects in Texas and Florida are not entirely free from federal funding, despite claims of no reliance on public funds. Federal loans and subsidies are likely to play a significant role in financing these ventures, raising questions about the true independence from taxpayer money. Lessons from past experiences with federal support for high-speed and intercity passenger rail projects emphasize the importance of predictable funding. Uncertainty in funding levels can lead to project delays and higher costs, hindering efficient planning and implementation. Funding certainty is crucial for hiring and retaining transportation project experts, essential for project completion. The availability of HSIPR funding led to delays in starting construction due to the need for repeated environmental impact analyses. Many states were unprepared for the sudden funding opportunity, leading to challenges in planning and grant management for rail projects. The FRA struggled to manage billions of dollars for rail projects quickly, facing conflicting responsibilities of approving grants fast to stimulate the economy while ensuring funds were well used. Limited staff resources delayed some HSIPR projects, with major transportation projects facing long timelines and political risks. The HSIPR program faced political uncertainty at both the federal and state levels, leading to a dramatic halt in funding after the change from the 111th to the 112th Congress. State administrations in Florida, Ohio, and Wisconsin withdrew support for HSIPR projects, causing delays and interference with fund utilization. The program lacked predictable funding, raising concerns about its future development. The HSIPR program faced funding challenges due to the lack of a dedicated revenue source, making it difficult to secure predictable funding. Calls for a dedicated funding source for rail projects have been made, but Congress has not taken action yet. Intercity passenger rail projects for low- and moderate-speed service are more cost-effective as they involve track improvements rather than extensive construction. High-speed rail projects are much more expensive, posing financial and political challenges for federal support. Most federally assisted rail projects operate below 125 mph and do not qualify as high-speed rail. The limited funds in HSIPR hinder the development of true high-speed rail. Congress did not prioritize funding for a single project, leading to objections from members regarding the California High-Speed Rail Corridor and Amtrak's Northeast Corridor projects. Political challenges and objections to intercity passenger rail funding persist due to perceived economic inefficiency and potential technological advancements."
