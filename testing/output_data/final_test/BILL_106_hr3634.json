    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"Saving Women's Lives through International Family Planning Act of 2000\". The Congress finds that international family planning funds save women's lives by providing reproductive health care, including prenatal, postpartum, and HIV/AIDS education. Over 585,000 women die from pregnancy complications annually, with millions more facing health issues. Additionally, more than 5,800,000 people are infected with HIV/AIDS. International family planning programs play a crucial role in combating the physical, social, and economic devastation caused by HIV/AIDS. These programs also help address environmental issues exacerbated by rapid population growth, such as air and water pollution, wildlife habitat loss, and climate change. By giving women the option to choose the number and spacing of their children, family planning contributes to slowing global population growth and improving family management worldwide. Improving access to family planning resources worldwide reduces mortality risks for women and children. Voluntary family planning services uphold the right to plan family size and decrease abortion rates. Data from the International Conference on Population and Development in 1994 supports these findings. Development in 1994 estimated that providing family planning and health services would cost $17 billion by 2000. The US and other donor countries agreed to contribute one-third of the funds, with the US expected to provide nearly $1.9 billion in 2001. Restoring funding to 1995 levels would help ensure global access to family planning and reproductive health care. International organizations are crucial in meeting the needs of the world's population exceeding 6 billion. Nongovernmental organizations are vital for addressing various needs in society and promoting democratic participation. They should receive adequate funding without restrictions on free speech, and US assistance should be provided on equal terms as to governments. International organizations and programs are authorized to receive funding for fiscal year 2001, with $366,000,000 allocated for specific provisions. Additionally, $35,000,000 is designated for the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). SEC. 4. POPULATION PLANNING ASSISTANCE. $541,600,000 appropriated for population planning activities and assistance in fiscal year 2001 under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. Nongovernmental and multilateral organizations eligible for population planning assistance. The Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development may not impose stricter requirements on nongovernmental and multilateral organizations for population planning assistance than those applied to foreign governments."
