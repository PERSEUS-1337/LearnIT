FINDINGS.\" \"Congress finds that the United States exercises sovereignty over Puerto Rico pursuant to the Treaty of Paris, and continues to carry out all Federal responsibilities with respect to Puerto Rico.\" Congress provided for civil administration of Puerto Rico in 1917, granting US citizenship with rights determined by Congress. In 1950, Puerto Ricans adopted a constitution establishing self-government within the Commonwealth structure, subject to US Constitution and Federal law. The United States is committed to respecting the principle of self-determination in resolving Puerto Rico's political status, in accordance with the Constitution and Federal law. SEC. 2. REFERENDA. The policy of the United States is to allow residents of Puerto Rico to freely express their political status preferences through a self-determination process. Options include maintaining current status, becoming a state, or pursuing independence. Referendums must involve eligible residents of Puerto Rico.

Options A and B on the ballot represent the choices for Puerto Rico's self-determination process towards permanent full self-government through separate sovereignty or statehood. \"Part one of the ballot presents options for Puerto Rico's self-determination process, including separate sovereignty or statehood.\" The residents of Puerto Rico can choose between maintaining the current Commonwealth status or pursuing separate sovereignty or statehood through a self-determination process authorized by Congress. Residents of Puerto Rico can choose between maintaining the current Commonwealth status or pursuing separate sovereignty or statehood through a self-determination process authorized by Congress. Part Two of the ballot presents voters with a choice between independence, free association, or full integration into the United States constitutional system. Option A in Part Two of the ballot offers residents of Puerto Rico the choice of separate sovereignty, where the territory would become a separate sovereign nation with full authority over its internal and external affairs, no longer governed by the United States Constitution and laws. The sovereignty, nationality, and citizenship of the United States in Puerto Rico will terminate with approval of separate sovereignty by Congress and residents. Birth in Puerto Rico will no longer confer US citizenship, but individuals can retain it for life through allegiance and election as prescribed by Congress. Option B on the ballot offers statehood for Puerto Rico. Residents of Puerto Rico will have statehood status and rights secured under the United States Constitution, with full and equal citizenship rights, including voting rights in elections for President and Vice President. Residents of Puerto Rico will have statehood status with full citizenship rights, including voting rights in elections for President and Vice President, representation in the Senate, and proportionate representation in the House of Representatives. Instructions for voters in a referendum include selecting Option A or Option B in Part One, and voting on Part Two regardless of their Part One choice. In a referendum in Puerto Rico, voters must choose between Option A or Option B in Part One, with Part Two determining the preference for separate sovereignty or statehood if Option B is approved in Part One. Ballots with both options marked in Part Two will not be counted, but either Part One or Part Two will be valid if properly cast. SEC. 3. IMPLEMENTATION. If voters approve continuation of current status or reject transition, referenda on Puerto Rico's political status will be held every 4 years. If statehood is chosen, the President must submit legislation for Puerto Rico's admission within 180 days. The curr_chunk discusses legislation for Puerto Rico's admission as a State of the Union or separate sovereignty, with procedures for approval by residents. If separate sovereignty is chosen, a plan for transition to an international relationship governed by a treaty must be submitted to Congress."
