    "content": "The \"Quality Assurance in Drug Testing Act\" aims to address drug abuse in the workplace by implementing quality assurance measures in drug testing. Congress recognizes drug testing as an effective deterrent to drug abuse when conducted with quality assurance. The Act amends the Public Health Service Act to include laboratory certification standards for drug testing. The \"Quality Assurance in Drug Testing Act\" requires toxicological analysis for drug testing programs to be conducted in certified laboratories meeting specific standards set by the Secretary within a year of enactment. The certification criteria aim to maximize the testing scheme's predictive value and consider the practices of drug testing programs conducted in accordance with appropriate standards. The Secretary must annually review and update certification criteria for drug testing, considering scientific advances and employer zero-drug tolerance practices. SEC. 2702 outlines the Anti-Drug Abuse Policy. SEC. 2702 outlines the employer's written anti-drug abuse policy, including procedures for drug testing, privacy safeguards, availability of treatment programs, and penalties for violations. The employer must provide notice of the anti-drug policy to applicants and employees subject to testing, including penalties for violations and procedures for explaining positive test results. SEC. 2703 of the policy requires employers to establish a drug-free awareness program as part of their drug testing program to educate employees on the dangers of drug abuse, the employer's drug-free workplace policy, available counseling and treatment programs, and the penalties for drug-related violations. Employers can require applicants to pass a drug test for a drug-free workplace. Employees can be tested based on reasonable suspicion, scheduled medical exams, or after accidents involving serious harm. Employees can be randomly selected for drug testing in sensitive positions or areas where drug abuse is a known issue. Random selection must be done impartially to avoid discrimination or harassment. \"Employee protections are outlined in Section 2505, ensuring fair treatment during random drug testing in sensitive positions.\" The employer must inform the applicant or employee of the drug testing policy, cannot take adverse action based on unconfirmed positive results, must provide an opportunity to be informed of and explain confirmed positive results. The employer must provide a reasonable opportunity for an employee to explain confirmed positive drug test results. It is prohibited for an employer to retaliate against an employee for exercising their rights under this title. Sensitive employees with positive initial drug test results may be transferred temporarily without loss of compensation until confirmatory test results are received. If confirmatory test is negative, immediate reinstatement is required. SEC. 2706. CONFIDENTIALITY. Prohibits disclosure of drug test information except to specific parties listed. Permitted disclosures include the applicant or employee, employer, court/governmental agencies, and drug abuse treatment providers. SEC. 2707. EMPLOYER PRACTICES. The text chunk discusses employer actions related to maintaining a safe and drug-free workplace. Employers are allowed to take necessary actions, including termination, in cases of confirmed positive drug tests, refusal to take a drug test, or tampering with a drug testing specimen. Employers can also require employees to participate in a drug treatment program if they test positive for drugs or refuse to submit to a test. An employee who tests positive for drugs, refuses a drug test, or tampers with a drug test specimen may be refused placement in a sensitive position by the employer. Employers must provide information on drug abuse treatment programs to employees as part of the drug-free awareness program. The Secretary is required to establish a certification program for laboratories conducting toxicological urinalysis for drug testing and issue necessary regulations. Enforcement and relief measures are outlined in Section 2710. The certification program for laboratories conducting drug testing must comply with enforcement procedures and sanctions outlined in section 353. Employees can file complaints with the Secretary of Labor within 30 days of alleged unlawful discharge or discrimination. The Secretary will investigate complaints of violations within 30 days and notify the employer of the results. An order will be issued within 30 days after the investigation, unless a settlement is reached. The Secretary will issue an order based on a settlement with the employer, providing relief or denying the complaint after a public hearing. If a violation is found, the employer must provide suitable relief such as reinstatement, promotion, and payment of lost wages and benefits. An employee or employer can request a review of the order. An employee or employer can request a review of an order issued by the Secretary in the United States Court of Appeals. Failure to comply with the order may result in the Secretary filing a civil action in the district court to enforce it. The court may award litigation costs to the prevailing party in a final order under this subsection. Good faith compliance with the standards in this title is an affirmative defense for employers. Employers are not required to establish drug testing programs or make employment decisions based on test results. \"SEC. 2711. EFFECT ON OTHER LAWS.\" This title preempts any State or local laws related to drug testing of applicants or employees. It prohibits laws on certification of testing laboratories, requirements for drug testing programs, and other related matters. Federal agencies like the Secretary of Transportation can still issue regulations on drug and alcohol testing. The effective date of this title is 2 years after enactment, with a prohibition on section 2701(a) taking effect no less than 1 year after the certification program is established. The terms defined in this title include 'applicant' as someone who applies for a job, 'drug' as substances that can affect work performance, 'drug abuse treatment program' as a program to help with drug-related issues, and 'drug test' as a procedure to detect substances in the body. The curr_chunk defines terms related to employment drug testing, including 'employee' as an individual working for an employer, 'employer' as the entity employing individuals, and 'sensitive employee' as someone in a position with high trust responsibilities. Professional athletes are treated similarly to employees under section 2714(g) but are not covered by section 2706(a)."
