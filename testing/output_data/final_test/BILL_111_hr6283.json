    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Repealing Ineffective and Incomplete Abstinence-Only Program Funding Act of 2010\". Congress finds that the United States has a high teen pregnancy rate and a significant number of sexually transmitted infections among young people. Despite a previous decline in teen pregnancy rates, there was a 3 percent increase in 2006. Additionally, young people aged 15 to 25, who make up only a quarter of the sexually active population, contract half of the 19 million STIs annually. Abstinence-only-until-marriage programs have been discredited by evidence, including a 2007 study finding them ineffective in preventing teen sex, reducing pregnancy rates, or positively impacting sexual behavior. The Institute of Medicine recommends ending these programs due to their poor fiscal and public health policy. Leading medical and public health professional groups oppose abstinence-only-until-marriage approach as antithetical to science principles. They stress the need for comprehensive sexuality education including information about contraception. $1.5 billion in Federal funding for abstinence-only-until-marriage programs is criticized for not teaching teens about preventing unintended pregnancy or STIs, including HIV. A 2005-2006 survey shows that 82% of US adults support comprehensive sex education that includes information on abstinence and contraception. Comprehensive sex education helps teens delay sexual intercourse, increase contraceptive use, and reduce the number of partners. Programs promoting both abstinence and contraception do not increase sexual behavior. Teens benefit from education that includes both aspects. Teens benefit from comprehensive sex education that includes information on both abstinence and contraception. Research shows that teens who practice contraception consistently are more likely to continue doing so in future relationships. The Personal Responsibility Education Program (PREP) funds programs that emphasize both abstinence and contraceptive use for pregnancy and STI prevention. The Personal Responsibility Education Program (PREP) funds evidence-based programs addressing adulthood preparation topics such as healthy relationships, adolescent development, financial literacy, educational and career success, and healthy life skills. The text chunk discusses the elimination of the abstinence-only education program under Title V of the Social Security Act. It includes the rescission of unobligated funds for fiscal year 2010 and the reprogramming of these funds for the Personal Responsibility Education Program (PREP) for fiscal years 2010 through 2014."
