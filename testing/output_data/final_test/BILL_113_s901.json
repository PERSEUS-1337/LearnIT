The evaluation criteria for applicants seeking grants for witness protection programs include the presence of witness intimidation, cases not prosecuted due to intimidation, homicides per capita, serious violent felonies or drug offenses per capita, organized crime presence, and other criteria determined by the Attorney General.

Federal administrative costs for carrying out this section should not exceed 5% of the funds appropriated for the fiscal year. Authorization of appropriations for funds under this section is necessary to carry out the fiscal year's activities."
