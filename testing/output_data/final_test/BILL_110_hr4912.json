    "content": "The text introduces a new subpart in the Internal Revenue Code regarding the treatment of prepaid derivative contracts. It includes sections on the treatment and definitions of such contracts. The new subpart in the Internal Revenue Code addresses the inclusion of interest accrual amounts from prepaid derivative contracts in the holder's gross income. Any amount included is treated as interest and increases the holder's basis in the contract. Losses on the disposition of such contracts are treated as ordinary losses up to the amount of basis increases. The new subpart in the Internal Revenue Code addresses the treatment of distributions from prepaid derivative contracts. Distributions are not included in gross income, reduce the adjusted basis of the contract, and any excess is treated as gain. Adjusted basis is determined after any adjustments for the taxable year. Interest accrual amounts are also addressed in the section. The interest accrual amount for prepaid derivative contracts is calculated based on the holder's adjusted basis at the beginning of the taxable year and the monthly Federal short-term rate or the credited rate. If a taxpayer acquires or disposes of a contract during the year, the interest accrual amount is prorated. The interest accrual amount for prepaid derivative contracts is calculated based on the holder's adjusted basis at the beginning of the taxable year. If a taxpayer acquires a contract during the year, the interest accrual amount is prorated based on the portion of the year the contract was held. Special rules apply to publicly traded prepaid derivative contracts. Contracts for publicly traded prepaid derivative contracts are subject to limitations on the amount includible for tax purposes. The amount included in taxable income cannot exceed the fair market value of the contract at the end of the year plus any distributions to the holder, minus the holder's adjusted basis in the contract from the previous year. The excess interest accrual amount on publicly traded prepaid derivative contracts in a taxable year increases the holder's interest accrual amount for the following year. The adjusted basis in such contracts for succeeding years is determined without limitations. The section excludes certain prepaid derivative contracts from its provisions if they are held for less than 1 year and disposed of in the same year or marked to market under specific provisions. The Secretary will issue regulations to prevent the avoidance of the section's purposes. \"SEC. 1290.
