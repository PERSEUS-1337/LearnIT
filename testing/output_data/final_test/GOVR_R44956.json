The case may determine if cell phone users have Fourth Amendment privacy rights in their location data. The Fourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures, requiring a warrant for searches that violate privacy expectations. The Supreme Court's third-party doctrine has implications for this case. The Supreme Court, under the third-party doctrine, has ruled that no expectation of privacy exists for information voluntarily disclosed to third parties. In cases like United States v. Miller and Smith v. Maryland, the Court held that obtaining information from banks or phone companies without a warrant does not violate the Fourth Amendment because the information was voluntarily shared by the individual. In Carpenter v. United States, the petitioner was convicted of robberies based on cell site location information (CSLI) obtained without a warrant from his wireless carrier. The case questions the application of the third-party doctrine to modern technology and the privacy of information shared with phone companies. In Carpenter v. United States, the court held that the government's warrantless collection of historical CSLI did not violate the Fourth Amendment based on the third-party doctrine. The court reasoned that location data transmitted to a carrier is not protected like the content of personal communications. The Sixth Circuit decision in Carpenter v. United States aligns with other federal appellate courts in rejecting Fourth Amendment challenges to the warrantless collection of historical CSLI. Some judges have expressed doubts about using outdated cases to analyze privacy expectations in the smartphone era. The Supreme Court in Carpenter v. United States declined to apply third-party cases, instead voting to uphold Carpenter's convictions on an independent ground. The Court has considered Fourth Amendment cases in the context of modern technology, such as in United States v. Jones where police violated the Fourth Amendment by attaching a GPS tracking device to a suspect's vehicle. The Supreme Court in Carpenter v. United States upheld Carpenter's convictions on an independent ground. In United States v. Jones, the Court found a Fourth Amendment violation when police attached a GPS device to a vehicle without consent. Five Justices expressed concerns about warrantless tracking violating privacy expectations. This suggests a reluctance to view warrantless CSLI collection as a simple third-party disclosure issue. The Supreme Court's decision in Carpenter could lead to calls for congressional action to balance privacy concerns with law enforcement needs, as suggested by Justice Alito in a previous case. He highlighted the Wiretap Act as an example of legislative action to address such issues. The Stored Communications Act (SCA) used in Carpenter's case also reflects an attempt by the legislature to balance privacy and law enforcement interests. The Supreme Court is considering the balance between privacy and law enforcement in modern CSLI collection under the Stored Communications Act (SCA), which has not been amended since 1994. In another case, Christie v. NCAA, the Court is examining a federal statute's impact on New Jersey's sports gambling prohibition and the Tenth Amendment. This decision could have implications for federal regulation of sports gambling and the anti-commandeering doctrine. The Supremacy Clause of the Constitution establishes federal laws as supreme over state laws, allowing federal law to preempt conflicting state actions. While the federal government can influence state activities, the anti-commandeering doctrine recognizes states' substantial sovereign powers under the Tenth Amendment. The anti-commandeering doctrine, based on the Tenth Amendment, prohibits Congress from forcing state political branches to carry out federal regulatory functions. In cases like New York v. United States and Printz v. United States, the Supreme Court ruled that the federal government cannot compel states to adopt specific laws or take possession of certain materials, as it would violate states' sovereignty. In Printz v. United States, the Court applied anti-commandeering principles to state executive officials, ruling that a law requiring gun background checks by state officers was unconstitutional. The Christie case will clarify the line between permissible preemption of state regulations and impermissible conscription of state political branches by the federal government. It involves the conflict between the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act and a 2014 New Jersey law allowing sports gambling at casinos and racetracks. The 2014 New Jersey law allows sports gambling at most casinos and racetracks without state penalty, with restrictions on other locations, New Jersey sporting events, collegiate teams, and gambling by persons under 21. The NCAA and sports leagues challenged the law under PASPA, leading to a federal court injunction. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit upheld the injunction, characterizing New Jersey's partial repeal as selectively dictating where and who can gamble on sports. The Third Circuit found that the law effectively authorized sports gambling. The Third Circuit ruled that the 2014 New Jersey statute effectively authorized sports gambling, despite arguments that PASPA did not compel the state to enforce federal laws. The court suggested that New Jersey could selectively repeal sports gambling restrictions in a way that would not conflict with PASPA. New Jersey challenged the Third Circuit's ruling on the 2014 sports gambling law, arguing that PASPA unconstitutionally commandeered the state's legislative process. The Supreme Court agreed to review whether PASPA violates the anti-commandeering doctrine. Christie's case raises complex questions about Congress's authority to displace state laws. The Court has the authority to displace state laws regulating private activity. PASPA may bar states from partially repealing laws that undermine federal policy. A decision in New Jersey's favor could have significant ramifications for federal regulation of sports gambling. If PASPA is struck down, it would eliminate the federal government's regulations. If New Jersey's argument prevails, it could eliminate federal regulations on intrastate sports gambling. The Court may choose to separate PASPA's prohibition on sports gambling authorization from regulations on governmental entities, leaving federal rules intact. The legality of private sports gambling under New Jersey law remains uncertain and contested in litigation. The 2014 New Jersey law is unclear and contested in litigation. If the Court strikes down part of PASPA, there may be additional litigation to determine new boundaries of federal sports-gambling regulation. The Third Circuit's decision would raise difficult questions, including the rejection of New Jersey's anti-commandeering argument. The circuit court suggested that partial repeals may not violate PASPA, but did not provide further explanation. The Third Circuit's decision on the authorization of sports gambling in violation of PASPA raised questions about selective repeals and federal preemption statutes. The High Court's ruling could impact how Congress structures preemption statutes and the federal government's ability to regulate other areas like recreational marijuana or concealed carrying. The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in Gill v. Whitford, a case that could impact how redistricting maps are drawn. The Court is asked to establish a standard for determining unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering. While the Court has invalidated maps as racial gerrymanders, it has not done so for partisan gerrymandering. The Supreme Court has not invalidated a map due to partisan gerrymandering. Previous cases have struggled to establish a standard for adjudicating claims of unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering. In the 2004 case Vieth v. Jubelirer, the Court could not agree on a standard for assessing such claims, leading to a nonjusticiable political question. Justice Kennedy concluded that without neutral principles or limits on judicial intervention, the claims were not justiciable, but did not rule out the possibility of judicial relief in the future. In the case of Whitford, the Supreme Court was divided on whether partisan gerrymandering claims are within the scope of judicial review. A federal district court panel decision held that a Wisconsin state legislative redistricting map is an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander, violating the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the guarantees of free speech and association under the First Amendment. The court found that the redistricting map in Wisconsin aimed to entrench one party's control of the legislature based on political affiliation, leading to a disparity between vote share and power. For example, in the 2012 election, the Republican Party received 48.6% of the vote but won 60 out of 99 seats in the Assembly. This asymmetry among districts was assessed using a new measure. The court introduced a new measure called the \"efficiency gap\" (EG) to assess district asymmetry. The EG measures wasted votes and identifies redistricting methods like \"cracking\" and \"packing\" that diminish voter power. It is a tool to gauge the extent of electoral manipulation in favor of one party. The court introduced the \"efficiency gap\" (EG) as a measure of district asymmetry, assessing cracking and packing of voters. It does not mandate proportional representation but evaluates the deviation from expected vote-seat relationship. The dissent criticized the \"entrenchment test\" and denounced the EG as enshrining a phantom constitutional right to proportional representation based on votes won. The Supreme Court issued a stay on a lower court's decision regarding partisan gerrymandering in Wisconsin. The case involves arguments on procedural grounds and the merits of the case, with the appellants arguing that statewide claims of partisan gerrymandering are nonjusticiable. The Elections Commission maintains that challengers in political gerrymandering cases are restricted to disputing the boundaries of their own districts, not the entire statewide map. The Election Commission argues that the appellees have failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted by not articulating a \"limited and precise\" legal standard for redistricting maps. They criticize the tests proffered as likely to \"sow chaos\" because they fail to provide clear metrics for evaluation in court. The appellees, registered voters in Wisconsin, argue that they have standing to challenge the redistricting map. The registered voters in Wisconsin argue that they have standing to challenge the redistricting map based on claims of racial and partisan gerrymandering. They assert that partisan gerrymandering claims are justiciable under a test requiring discriminatory intent and effect without legitimate justification by the legislature. They maintain that the test is based on the neutral principle of partisan symmetry. The appellee voters argue that partisan gerrymandering claims are justiciable under a test based on the neutral principle of partisan symmetry, as determined by measures such as the EG. The Supreme Court's ruling in Gill v. Whitford could have significant implications for future claims of partisan gerrymandering. The Court may reject lower court standards for dismissing claims of unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering, potentially leading to more challenges to electoral maps nationwide. A stay in the case could indicate a higher chance of ruling in favor of the Elections Commission. The Court might also establish new standards for evaluating future claims, impacting how maps are drawn in the future. The Supreme Court is set to hear a case involving a vendor refusing services for same-sex weddings due to religious objections, which could impact anti-discrimination laws. This case implicates the Free Speech and Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment. The Free Speech Clause protects the right to speak freely and refrain from speaking against one's beliefs. In a case involving a St. Patrick's Day parade, the Supreme Court ruled that forcing organizers to include a group would violate their expressive rights. GLIB's speech at a parade would be seen as part of the overall message, protected by the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. The Supreme Court has ruled that laws restricting religious practices must be justified by a compelling interest and narrowly tailored. However, individuals must still comply with neutral laws, even if they conflict with their religious beliefs. In Masterpiece Cakeshop, the dispute arose when the owner, Jack Phillips, refused to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple, citing his religious beliefs. The Colorado Civil Rights Commission found Phillips in violation of the Anti-Discrimination Act and ordered him to stop discriminating against same-sex couples. Masterpiece Cakeshop and Phillips appealed the order to sell wedding cakes to same-sex couples. The Supreme Court granted the baker's petition, arguing that forcing him to make a cake for a same-sex wedding compels him to express a message he disagrees with. Phillips claims the state is applying its law in a viewpoint discriminatory manner. The Commission argues that making a cake does not entail compelled speech but is commercial conduct. The Supreme Court will have to decide if making a cake for a same-sex wedding is expressive enough to implicate the First Amendment. Phillips argues that Colorado violated the Free Exercise Clause by discriminating against him. Phillips claims Colorado violated the Free Exercise Clause by discriminatorily applying public accommodations law, burdening his religious beliefs. Colorado singled him out for making cakes celebrating same-sex marriage, while allowing other bakers to decline. The respondents argue the state's anti-discrimination statute is neutral and serves a compelling state interest. The Court must determine if the statute is constitutional or restricts religious practices, subjecting it to strict scrutiny. Phillips argues that Colorado's public accommodations law violated his religious beliefs by selectively applying it to him. The Court must decide if the law should be subject to strict scrutiny, considering the state's anti-discrimination statute and the government's interest in combating discrimination. The Court must determine if Colorado's public accommodations law violates Phillips' religious beliefs by selectively applying it to him. If the law passes strict scrutiny, it may not need to address the standard that applies. Masterpiece Cakeshop offers a chance to clarify the First Amendment's protections of speech and religion and how they balance against anti-discrimination laws. This case will be viewed in the context of cases like Obergefell v. Hodges, which recognized same-sex couples' right to marriage. The Court's decision in Masterpiece Cakeshop could impact federal laws regarding discrimination based on sexual orientation, potentially leading to Congress getting involved. Congress may intervene by enacting protections for speech and religious beliefs or modifying federal statutes on discrimination in public accommodations."
