The \"Patient Freedom from Restraint Act of 1999\" mandates that facilities receiving Medicare or Medicaid funds must protect residents from abuse, seclusion, and restraints for discipline or convenience. Staff must be trained annually on proper restraint use and alternatives. The \"Patient Freedom from Restraint Act of 1999\" requires facilities to provide residents with information on their rights to freedom from restraints and seclusion, as well as contact information for protection and advocacy agencies. This information must be made available to residents and their guardians, and posted conspicuously in the facility. The \"Patient Freedom from Restraint Act of 1999\" mandates that facilities can only use restraints and seclusion to ensure immediate safety, with written orders from a physician specifying duration. This applies to psychiatric treatment, care for the mentally retarded, and residential treatment for children. The \"Patient Freedom from Restraint Act of 1999\" requires written orders from a physician specifying the duration and circumstances for using restraints and seclusion. Emergency exceptions are allowed, but standing orders are prohibited. Restraints and seclusion should be a last resort and used in the least restrictive manner after other approaches have failed. The \"Patient Freedom from Restraint Act of 1999\" mandates that restraints and seclusion should be used as a last resort in the least restrictive manner after other approaches have failed. Covered facilities must not use restraints and seclusion simultaneously and must record each incident in patient records. The \"Patient Freedom from Restraint Act of 1999\" requires covered facilities to document each use of restraint or seclusion, including type, duration, rationale, and alternatives considered. This information must be available for inspection by relevant agencies. Each covered facility must submit periodic reports on the use of restraints and seclusion to the Secretary and protection and advocacy agencies. Reports on all sentinel events must also be submitted to the appropriate agencies. Facilities must submit reports on incidents involving residents or patients, including deaths within 14 days of discharge, within 7 days of the incident or receipt of information. The Secretary requires covered facilities to submit annual reports on sentinel events involving residents or patients. Within one year of enactment, a protocol for recording and reporting information must be established in consultation with protection and advocacy agencies. The Secretary mandates covered facilities to submit annual reports on sentinel events, with a protocol established in consultation with advocacy agencies. The Secretary also compiles and publishes an annual summary of these reports and establishes guidelines for peer review organizations to review policies on restraints and seclusion. Non-compliance may result in sanctions, including loss of Medicare and Medicaid funding. The training of staff must comply with regulations to avoid disqualification from Medicare and Medicaid programs. Failure to report sentinel events may result in a civil money penalty of up to $5,000 per violation. Definitions for terms like restraints are provided in this section. The term 'restraints' refers to chemical or physical restraints, with chemical restraints involving medication to immobilize or induce unconsciousness, and physical restraints involving mechanical restrictions on movement. The term 'seclusion' means confinement of an individual alone in a room or area from which the individual is physically prevented from leaving. Seclusion is the involuntary confinement of a resident in a room from which they are physically prevented from leaving. A sentinel event is an unexpected occurrence causing substantial physical or psychological harm to a resident, including injuries like burns, fractures, or internal organ damage. The requirements of subsections (a)(1) and (c) of section 1164 of the Social Security Act, as added by subsection (a), apply to restraints and seclusion used on or after the first date of the first month that begins more than 6 months after the date of the enactment of this Act. The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall establish the protocol within 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act for reporting requirements. Covered facilities are first required to record information and submit reports. The requirement for reporting restraints and seclusion under section 1164(c) of the Social Security Act must be fulfilled within 2 months of the protocol's establishment. Annual training and posting information obligations also apply after specified effective dates."
