    "content": "Days before Taiwan's presidential election in March 2008, the U.S. positioned two aircraft carriers east of Taiwan in response to potential provocations. The ruling Democratic Progressive Party proposed a referendum for Taiwan to join the U.N., while the opposition Kuomintang proposed a referendum to rejoin the U.N. using Taiwan's formal name. The U.S. was concerned about these referendums and their impact on peace and stability in the region. The People's Republic of China warned against symbolic referendums in Taiwan, fearing de jure independence. The Bush Administration shared these concerns, viewing President Chen's referendum as provocative. However, only 36% of voters participated, rendering the referendums invalid. The KMT urged a boycott, labeling the referendums as political gimmicks. The KMT presidential candidate Ma Ying-jeou won the election with a 17 percent margin of victory, gaining 58.5 percent of the votes. The turnout rate was 76 percent, and his inauguration is set for May 20, 2008. With the KMT's victory in the legislative elections, they will control both the Legislative Yuan and Executive Yuan in the government. Taiwan's stock market rallied 4 percent higher after the election results were announced, leading to a sense of relief and optimism among the majority of Taiwan's people. On the Monday after the election, Taiwan's stock market rallied 4 percent higher, with wide expectations of Ma's victory. President Bush congratulated Ma Ying-jeou, calling Taiwan a \"beacon of democracy.\" Concerns arose about Beijing's assessment of a \"highly dangerous period\" during Taiwan's elections. The Bush Administration agreed with PRC's warnings and criticized President Chen Shui-bian. The Bush Administration criticized President Chen Shui-bian's referendum in Taiwan as a unilateral step towards independence, with Deputy Secretary of State John Negroponte and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Thomas Christensen opposing it. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice called the referendum \"provocative,\" leading to criticism of the Administration for aligning with Beijing's reaction. The Bush Administration aligned with Beijing's reaction, criticized Taiwan's referendum as provocative, and interfered in Taiwan's democracy. Critics rebuked these actions, urging the Administration to remain neutral in Taiwan's presidential campaign to avoid undermining U.S. support for Taiwan. The Bush Administration's stance on Taiwan's referendum and democracy fed Beijing's belligerence, leading to a dangerous miscalculation of U.S. interests. Taiwan's U.N. membership is impossible due to China's opposition. Different future scenarios for Taiwan include greater stability with a unified KMT and weak DPP, or greater instability with KMT dominance. These scenarios have implications for U.S. security interests in stability and deterrence. The near-term outlook for Taiwan's future is positive for stability and progress in policy-making, including defense policies. Taiwan is a mature democracy experiencing its second democratic turnover in power. The March 2008 presidential election was held without major issues, marking Taiwan's fourth direct, democratic presidential election since 1996. In March 2008, President Chen reversed doubts on power transfer before the election. Ma's victory was decisive, leading to DPP's resignation. With Ma as president, KMT will dominate both legislative and executive branches, ending past gridlock. Ma is seen as a unifying leader, contrasting with Chen's divisive politics. The DPP's defeat in the presidential election marks a decline in its political power over the last three years. The party struggles to pass on leadership to a new generation and attract centrist voters. Ma's victory represents a shift towards a new generation of leadership in the KMT, appealing to younger voters. The DPP fails to adjust and regain support despite President Chen's unpopularity and electoral losses. The DPP's defeat in the presidential election signals a decline in its political power, struggling to pass on leadership and attract centrist voters. Despite challenges, the DPP still holds at least 40 percent of votes, and a stronger opposition could benefit Taiwan's democracy. The party's unpopularity and the demise of its hardline ally, the Taiwan Solidarity Union, have raised concerns about a potential purge of moderates within the DPP. However, institutionalized checks and balances in Taiwan favor stability and security, aligning with U.S. interests. Both DPP and KMT presidential candidates have moved towards centrist positions regarding Taiwan's future. Both the DPP and KMT presidential candidates shifted towards centrist positions on Taiwan's policies and identity, focusing on stronger defense, closer economic ties with the PRC, and repairing relations with the United States. Taiwan's voters support moderate policies, preferring the status quo over extreme directions like declaring independence or surrendering Taiwan's status. The unresolved question of Taiwan's identity and sovereignty separate from the PRC continues to challenge U.S. management of peace and stability in the region. The current situation in the Taiwan Strait poses challenges for U.S. management of peace and stability. Despite reduced tensions, the PRC's insecurity about Taiwan persists due to its democratic model. The PLA's military buildup raises concerns about a shift in the military balance favoring the PRC. Instability remains a potential risk in the longer term, with worries about the PRC's decision-making without democratic constraints. The PRC's military buildup and economic partnership with Taiwan pose challenges to U.S. efforts to maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. The KMT's skepticism about Taiwan's defense commitment and hindrance of U.S. arms sales have frustrated U.S. efforts to strengthen Taiwan's defense capabilities. Ma's defense policy stressed a \"Hard ROC\" approach and aimed to increase military spending to 3% of GDP. He planned to transition to an all-volunteer military by eliminating conscription in four to six years, causing anxiety in the military about upcoming changes. Ma's defense policy under Ma aimed to transition to a professional military, estimated to cost $2 billion. He planned to acquire U.S. weapons to counter PLA's modernization. Despite no explicit mention, Ma supported the purchase of submarines, new fighters, and destroyers. He also called for peace efforts with the PRC, including withdrawal of PLA's missiles targeting Taiwan and military contacts with the PLA. In February 2008, Ma emphasized \"soft power\" in his national security strategy, focusing on deterrence and defense against offensive weapons. He advocated for a strong defense capability to maintain the status quo and reiterated his \"Three Noes\" policy regarding Taiwan-China relations. While not explicitly mentioning submarine procurement, he did express support for acquiring F-16C/D fighters for national security. Ma's focus on maritime capabilities, including the navy and shipbuilding, has increased since the \"Hard ROC\" defense policy. Presidential candidate Ma supported military and commercial procurement of advanced weapons to counter PRC's military modernization. He aims for a peace agreement, more economic ties with China, FTAs with the US, Japan, and Singapore, U.N. membership, and repairing the relationship with the US. The KMT, under President Ma Ying-jeou, aims to repair the relationship with the United States and restart cross-strait dialogue with the PRC based on the \"1992 Consensus.\" Ma's \"Three Noes\" policy includes no unification, independence, or use of force. The KMT may choose to accommodate, challenge, or seek bipartisan consensus with Beijing, but internal disputes on defense policy and ties to Beijing could bring uncertainty. Ma and the KMT seek closer economic integration with the PRC. The KMT, led by President Ma Ying-jeou, aims to strengthen ties with the United States and engage in cross-strait dialogue with the PRC. They support closer economic integration with the PRC, including proposals for a \"common market\" and increased investments. The issue is not whether to increase economic ties, but whether to normalize them to remove restrictions faced by Taiwan's businesses. Taiwan's economy is heavily dependent on the PRC, with concerns about over-reliance and potential security threats. The KMT seeks closer ties with the PRC, including economic integration and investments, raising fears of capitulation to Beijing and regional instability. The KMT, despite the PRC's \"Anti-Secession Law,\" maintains close ties with China and sees Taiwan as part of China. KMT Chairman Lien Chan met with Communist Party of China's General-Secretary Hu Jintao in Beijing. The KMT is interested in F-16 fighters and urged U.S. approval before Ma's inauguration, signaling a shift in their stance on U.S. security ties. The KMT might not submit a request for F-16C/D fighters under Ma due to US refusal since 2006. The KMT could complicate US arms acquisitions by freezing defense funds and objecting to missile defense systems. The KMT-controlled LY decided to fund four sets of PAC-3 missiles but freeze funds for two more. They may restrict the development of Taiwan's HF-2E long-range land-attack cruise missiles to target only military sites on the coastal areas of mainland China. A foreign policy advisor to Ma has objected to \"offensive\" weapons in Taiwan's military, suggesting canceling the HF-2E program. The KMT's decision on missile programs could impact U.S. actions. Concerns arise about the KMT shifting towards closer ties with Beijing over the U.S. and Japan. The KMT has historical ties with Japan but aims to stand up to Beijing. Ma's national security advisor prioritizes repairing US relations over improving ties with China. Ma plans to visit the US and Japan before his inauguration. The KMT officials support Taiwan's military in requesting new F-16C/D fighters from the United States. They are now committed to U.S. arms sales, including submarines and Patriot missile defense, but have concerns about the Po Sheng command and control program. The credibility of the KMT's pro-U.S. assurances is supported by their willingness to give credit to President Chen and the weakening of the pro-China PFP party. The KMT-led \"Pan-Blue\" coalition has taken over governing responsibility in Taiwan, with the pro-China PFP weakened. The KMT understands the importance of maintaining a strong negotiating position with Beijing, including security ties with Washington. Taiwan's democracy and separate identity will challenge the PRC's authoritarian rule, and the KMT has the option to work with the DPP on national identity and security issues. The KMT could also address the politicization of defense debates, a long-standing issue highlighted by the Defense Department. The Defense Department has long lamented the politicization of defense debates in Taiwan. Steps to create a more resilient Taiwan against coercion from Beijing are crucial. The KMT could potentially negotiate closer ties with the PRC, while U.S. policy supports a resolution of the Taiwan question with the consent of its people. After the election, KMT emphasized reconciliation, but there was little talk of a new national security consensus with the DPP. Working with DPP lawmakers in the LY, especially in the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, could be an option for the KMT. The newly reorganized committee in the LY has 11 KMT legislators, 3 DPP legislators, and 1 independent legislator. Options for Ma include appointing DPP members in major ministries, granting a presidential pardon to Chen, and fighting corruption in defense programs. The results of March 22 have reduced cross-strait tension, with President-elect Ma expected to be less provocative towards Beijing than Chen. President Ma and KMT interlocutors are giving pro-U.S. assurances. President Ma is expected to be less provocative towards Beijing than Chen. This presents an opportunity for the U.S. to focus on urgent global issues requiring improved cooperation from China. There is also a chance to advance U.S. security interests in Taiwan's self-defense, democracy, and economy. U.S. policymakers may strengthen engagement with the KMT to further U.S. interests. U.S. policymakers may strengthen engagement with the KMT and DPP to achieve clear goals aligned with U.S. interests in Taiwan's stability and security. These goals include upgrading Taiwan's self-defense, bolstering Taiwan's will to fight against PRC coercion, restoring Taiwan's confidence in U.S. support, improving critical infrastructure protection, enhancing crisis-management capabilities, and ensuring prior consultation with the U.S. in times of tension or conflict. The curr_chunk discusses the importance of U.S. policy options in the relationship with Taiwan, focusing on key events such as the inauguration of Ma Ying-jeou as the new president, President Bush's attendance at the Olympic Games in Beijing, and the end of Bush's term. It also mentions the need to maintain Taiwan's ties with U.S. allies, keep Taiwan separate from PRC control, and support Taiwan's economic ties with the U.S. amidst balancing links with the PRC. Additionally, it highlights the potential actions of Beijing towards Ma at the start of his term. The curr_chunk discusses Beijing's interest in Ma's ability to deliver results for Taiwan to sustain KMT rule. New engagement with Taiwan post-Ma's inauguration could improve relations with the U.S. President Bush's presence at the Olympic games could provide leverage in U.S.-Taiwan relations. Delays in decisions may occur until the next U.S. administration. The Bush Administration's criticism of Taiwan's U.N. referendum and refusal of new fighter requests from Taiwan have raised concerns. The Administration's acceptance of Taiwan's request for new F-16C/D fighters in 2006 has raised concerns about perceptions of \"co-management\" with Beijing. U.S. policymakers are considering dispelling these notions and countering Beijing's rising expectations. Ma Ying-jeou's election provides an opportunity for U.S.-Taiwan relations. Options for advancing U.S. interests in the Taiwan Strait are being discussed by Congress and the Bush Administration. (CRS takes no position on these options.) One approach is for the Administration to \"run out the clock\" until the end of President's term. The United States could delay pursuing new initiatives with Taiwan until after Ma takes office, allowing time for the KMT to clarify its national security policy. This approach aims to avoid provoking Beijing and focus on other U.S. priorities requiring PRC cooperation. The United States may consider changing its approach to acquisitions of U.S. arms given recent events. Options for engaging with president-elect Ma include allowing him to visit Washington, DC or another U.S. city before his inauguration, hosting a video conference, and working with his transition team to ensure a smooth power transition. Discussions should focus on Ma's inauguration address and his policy intentions towards the PRC and Taiwan's security.

Discussions should focus on Ma's inauguration address and his policy intentions towards the PRC and Taiwan's security. To strengthen U.S.-Taiwan relations, a senior delegation could attend Ma's inauguration and policy options could include setting positive objectives in the relationship with Taiwan. Chen's departure could impact U.S. stance on Taiwan. Acceptance of Taiwan's request for new F-16C/D fighters may change with his removal. In 2007, the House passed H.Res. 676 urging security assistance based on Taiwan's defense needs. Senators Johnson and Inhofe offered assistance to Defense Secretary Gates regarding Taiwan's request. Engage with pro-U.S. elements of the KMT, including Ma Ying-jeou and his advisors with ties to the U.S. Ma Ying-jeou, educated at Harvard University, has daughters studying in U.S. universities. U.S. efforts to support pro-U.S. leaders in the KMT, like Ma, should be undertaken early to counter influence from the PRC. Engage with moderate, pro-U.S. elements of the DPP to create a viable opposition. Support Taiwan's bipartisan efforts to gain observer status in the WHO, as seen in the passing of H.R. 4019 and S. 2092 in 2004. President Bush supported Taiwan's observer status in the WHO by signing S. 2092 into law. The next WHO meeting will start on May 19 in Geneva. Engage with the KMT to reduce uncertainties in the military about expected changes under Ma's administration. Conduct a dialogue with Taiwan's military to address the HF-2E cruise missile program. Allow U.S. naval port visits to Taiwan to strengthen defense ties. Support Taiwan's representation at APEC summit and inclusion in PSI for nonproliferation efforts. Taiwan's responsible partnership in weapons control highlighted by Defense Department's announcement. Strengthen engagement with Taiwan's government. Engage more meaningfully with Taiwan's government through various channels for continuity of government, critical infrastructure protection, and crisis-management. Negotiate an FTA with Taiwan, considering its importance as a trading partner and dominance in IT industries. Consider pursuing an FTA in the services sector and send a Cabinet-level official to visit Taiwan. The Bush Administration has reversed policies on Cabinet officers visiting Taiwan. The last officer to visit was Secretary of Transportation Rodney Slater in 2000. The U.S. role in cross-strait dialogue has been a longstanding issue. President Reagan's \"Six Assurances\" of 1982 included no mediation between Taipei and Beijing. There are various possible U.S. roles in ensuring a peaceful dialogue across the Taiwan Strait. The United States should focus on functional cooperation in cross-strait dialogue to prevent a war between two nuclear powers. President Bush emphasized the importance of dialogue for peace and stability, encouraging Taiwan and Beijing to engage in peaceful resolution of their differences. Hu Jintao acknowledged the \"1992 Consensus\" as \"one China, different interpretations,\" emphasizing the need for peaceful resolution of differences. Suggestions include a strategic policy review and coordination with allies for a comprehensive approach towards Taiwan. To address the Taiwan issue, a strategic policy review and coordination with allies in Europe and Asia are suggested, including Australia, Japan, South Korea, and Singapore."
