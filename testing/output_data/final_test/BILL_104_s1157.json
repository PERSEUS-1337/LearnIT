The Fund's purpose is to provide military equipment and training through an international mechanism. The agreement for the Multilateral Bosnia and Herzegovina Self-Defense Fund must meet requirements such as the United States chairing the international board, membership including representatives from Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia, and control of military equipment. The agreement for the Multilateral Bosnia and Herzegovina Self-Defense Fund includes procedures for controlling military equipment and requires written assurances from the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina that the equipment will not be used against civilians. The international board responsible for the Fund will be transferred to the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina before the termination of the US arms embargo if it would not violate the embargo. Definitions include eligible countries, the Fund, and the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The term \"United States arms embargo of the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina\" refers to the policy adopted in 1991 and any similar policy currently applied by the US government. The US arms embargo prohibits transfers of defense articles and services to Herzegovina. The US will contribute $50,000,000 from the Foreign Military Financing Program for the Fund. Additionally, there is drawdown authority. The President is authorized to transfer defense articles worth up to $50,000,000 to an international board responsible for the Fund without reimbursement. Appropriations are authorized to reimburse for these articles. Additionally, a report is required. The President must submit a report on the actions taken to implement section 2(a) of the Act. The Act does not authorize the deployment of US forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina for any purpose."
