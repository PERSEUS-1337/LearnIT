    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Ending Common Core and Expanding School Choice Act.\" It amends Part A of title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to provide State Educational Agency Grants to eligible children. The Act \"Ending Common Core and Expanding School Choice Act\" allocates funds to State education agencies based on the number of eligible children aged 5 to 17 from families below the poverty level. States use poverty criteria from the Census Bureau, updated by the Consumer Price Index. The State educational agency calculates the per pupil amount by dividing the funds allocated under section 1111 by the number of eligible children in the State. The funds must be used for qualified education expenses as directed by State law. If State law allows, funds may be distributed to parents, who must show compliance with the law and may need to establish an educational savings account. The term 'qualified elementary and secondary education expenses' refers to various educational costs, including those within the local educational agency's budget, public or charter school expenses, tuition for attending schools in the state, and fees for participating in educational programs. Fees are required for a child to participate in a State-approved educational program. SEC. 1113. RULES OF CONSTRUCTION. No federal officer or employee can mandate or control specific educational content, standards, assessments, curricula, or programs of instruction for state or local educational agencies or schools. This includes not requiring the adoption of Common Core State Standards or any other common academic standards. Additionally, federal officers cannot force the implementation of assessments, standards, or accountability systems on educational entities. The text chunk states that educational agencies, schools, or Indian Tribes must implement an annual assessment, academic standard, or accountability system to receive funds. Additionally, there are conforming amendments related to state assessment grants and authorization of appropriations."
