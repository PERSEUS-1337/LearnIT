Plans call for the purchase of 183 F-22s, but Air Force leaders believe 381 are needed. The debate over exporting F-22s has intensified as procurement funding nears its end. The issue of continuing production will be addressed by the 111th Congress. The 111th Congress will face the issue of whether to export the F-22 fighter jet. The Department of Defense is neutral, but Congress has prohibited foreign sales since 1998. The U.S. alliance with Japan is crucial for military readiness in Asia, with 53,000 troops stationed there. President's predecessors have emphasized the importance of this alliance. The U.S.-Japan alliance is a key component of East Asian security, with high-level bilateral initiatives since 2001 focusing on security cooperation and military interoperability. However, resistance to base realignment and political gridlock in Tokyo have stalled some agreements. Japan faces security threats from North Korea and suspicion from other states regarding changes in its defense policy. The historical enmity and competition with China also contribute to Japan's challenging regional context. In 2006, Japan's defense planners are concerned about Beijing's military modernization due to historical enmity and competition with China. The Japanese Self Defense Forces have observed Chinese military activities near Japan's outlying islands, including submarine incursions and warships near a disputed gas field. Japan also faces strained relations with South Korea over historical annexation and territorial disputes. The U.S. executive branch proposes arms sales to Japan, raising questions about East Asian security and domestic interests. Exporting F-22s to Japan is seen as a way to maintain the F-22 production line and support employment in the aerospace sector, benefiting the U.S. economy. Factors to consider in arms transfers include technology proliferation and regional stability. Exporting F-22s to Japan would help maintain the production line, reduce per-aircraft costs, and benefit the U.S. economy. The F-22 assembly stage requires less skilled labor compared to earlier design and engineering phases. The industrial base issue also involves the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter capabilities and development. The F-22 and JSF aircraft are now competing for procurement funds, with the possibility of extending F-22 production to hedge against JSF delays. The F-22 is considered technologically advanced, and protecting its intellectual property is a national security priority. Exporting F-22s to Japan could help maintain the production line and benefit the U.S. economy, but agreement on capabilities for the export variant is uncertain. Japan values industrial defense autonomy but has relaxed this stance to cooperate with the US on missile defense. They prefer to license or co-manufacture advanced aircraft to acquire engineering knowledge. There is concern about technology transfer and potential leaks of US technology. The leak of secret data associated with the Aegis weapon system by Japanese military personnel in 2002 raised concerns about the potential threat of technology transfer. Other countries in the region could perceive the sale of F-22s to Japan as causing an imbalance of military power, leading them to seek their own advanced aircraft or defensive systems. Israel has reportedly expressed interest in the F-22. Japan's interest in acquiring F-22s could enhance military interoperability with the U.S., allowing for shared state-of-the-art equipment. This could also potentially enable the U.S. to rotate its aircraft out of the region when needed. Despite ambitions for increased interoperability, achieving this goal faces challenges due to constitutional and legal constraints. Japan's interest in acquiring F-22s for military interoperability with the U.S. faces challenges such as constitutional constraints, funding limitations, language barriers, and opposition from localities hosting military bases. Concerns from China and South Korea about Japan's military upgrades potentially leading to regional destabilization and arms race. Analysts caution that selling F-22s to Japan could contribute to an image of Japan becoming America's proxy. Japan's interest in acquiring F-22s for military interoperability with the U.S. faces challenges such as constitutional constraints, funding limitations, and opposition from localities hosting military bases. South Korea has expressed unease at Japan acquiring F-22s, potentially leading to regional destabilization and arms race. Japanese defense officials justify their request for F-22s by pointing to China's increasing air capabilities. Despite strong relations between Tokyo and Beijing, concerns remain about the potential impact on regional dynamics. Despite strong relations between Tokyo and Beijing, Japan faces challenges in enhancing its military capabilities, including constitutional constraints and budgetary concerns. Some U.S. and Japanese commentators support the sale of F-22s to Japan to maintain the \"Taiwan balance,\" but questions remain about Tokyo's ability to follow through. Article 9 of the Japanese constitution prohibits war as a sovereign right and raises doubts about Japan's military expansion. The Japanese Self-Defense Forces (SDF) are well-funded and well-equipped despite constitutional concerns. Japan's self-imposed ban on exporting arms limits its participation in joint development projects. Tokyo's decision not to join the F-35 consortium highlights Japan's aversion to military exports. The legal issue surrounding the F-22 Strike Fighter in Japan is whether it is considered an offensive weapon, which could impact its sale due to the country's constitution only allowing defensive capabilities for the Self-Defense Forces. The F-22's offensive capabilities have been a point of contention, with advocates emphasizing its ability to penetrate contested airspace and destroy enemy defenses. Japan's defense budget is substantial at $44 billion in 2007, but there are concerns about the perception of the F-22 as primarily an offensive weapon. Japan's defense budget, one of the largest globally, faces pressure to reduce government spending. The budget has been declining modestly over the years, traditionally capped at 1% of GDP. Concerns arise about the Self-Defense Forces becoming a \"hollow force\" due to insufficient procurement systems. Budget constraints persist due to an aging population and a shortage of workers. Japan is considering alternatives to the F-22 due to an aging population and shortage of workers. Options include the JSF and F/A-18/E/F Super Hornet, each with strengths and weaknesses in operational capabilities and security concerns. The JSF, designed as a multinational aircraft, offers advanced radar and avionics but lacks the speed and agility of the F-22. The F/A-18/E/F Super Hornet, flown by the U.S. Navy, does not have stealth technology but is expected to remain in active inventory. The F-15 Eagle, operated by Japan and the U.S. Air Force, may be upgraded to meet Japan's needs instead of importing a new fighter. Another option is to develop or import a UCAV for advanced capabilities. The USAF Predator and UCAVs are compared as combat platforms, with UCAVs seen as the future of combat aviation. Japan may import advanced combat aircraft from Sweden, Russia, or a consortium of European countries to establish a second source of technology and reduce reliance on the U.S. military imports."
