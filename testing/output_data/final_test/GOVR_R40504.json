This contingent election has only been used once for each office since the amendment's ratification. Possible scenarios leading to an electoral college deadlock include a closely contested election, multiple candidates gaining electoral votes, or electors voting against their pledged candidates. Congress would need to consider and discharge functions in such situations. The 12th Amendment provides backup procedures for electing the President and Vice President in case of an electoral college deadlock. This report examines constitutional requirements and historical precedents associated with the contingent election process, highlighting the significance of Congress's role in such situations. The original provisions for electing the President and Vice President through the electoral college proved unworkable, leading to the 12th Amendment. It required each elector to cast two votes for President, with the runner-up becoming Vice President. If no candidate received a majority, the House of Representatives would choose from the top five candidates. Voting in this contingent election was done by states. The original form of contingent election involved voting by states, with each state's House delegation casting a single ballot. The Philadelphia Convention of 1787 did not anticipate the rise of political factions. By 1796, party organizations offered joint tickets for presidential and vice presidential candidates. George Washington retired in 1796, leading to the emergence of pro-administration Federalists and anti-administration Jeffersonian Republicans as political parties. In 1796, both Federalists and Jeffersonians offered unified tickets with party candidates for President and Vice President. Party strategists planned for electors to withhold votes to avoid a tie in the electoral college, but this did not happen. Federalists won with 71 electors to Jeffersonians' 68. Adams was elected President, while electors split their vice presidential votes among multiple candidates. In the election of 1800, Adams won the presidency with 71 electoral votes, while Jefferson became Vice President with 68 votes. Jeffersonian Republicans won the election with 73 electors to the Federalists' 65, resulting in a tie between Jefferson and Burr for Vice President. In the 1800 election, Jefferson and Burr tied for Vice President, leading to a contingent election in 1805. The House, controlled by Federalists, faced pressure to vote for Burr to thwart Jefferson. Threats of violence and the prospect of Burr as President prompted Alexander Hamilton to intervene and urge Federalist Representatives to prioritize national interests over partisanship. During the contingent election in 1805, Federalist Representatives were urged by Alexander Hamilton to vote for Jefferson over Burr. Despite initial deadlock, negotiations behind the scenes eventually led to Jefferson's victory after a Federalist Burr supporter cast a blank ballot, swinging the state in Jefferson's favor. During the 1805 contingent election, Jefferson won over Burr with the support of Federalist Representatives, leading to a final tally of Jefferson with 10 states, Burr with four, and two states divided. Support grew for a constitutional amendment establishing separate electoral votes for President and Vice President, delayed by Federalist opposition until the Eighth Congress. The ratification process proceeded quickly, with 13 out of 17 states approving by July 1804. In July 1804, 13 out of 17 states ratified the 12th Amendment, which was declared ratified by Secretary of State James Madison in September. The Amendment changed electoral college procedures by requiring separate ballots for President and Vice President, and a majority of electoral votes to win. Contingent election procedures were mostly unchanged, except for the elimination of a provision. The 12th Amendment made two revisions: it eliminated the provision for the electoral college runner-up to become Vice President and reduced the number of presidential candidates considered in a contingent election. It also established the same qualifications for Vice President as for President. This separation of presidential and vice presidential ballots has ensured electoral stability since 1800. The 12th Amendment established the two-party system in American presidential politics, leading to electoral college dominance by one ticket. It has deterred independent candidacies and new parties, with contingent elections held only twice since its ratification. Despite its success, the amendment remains as a fallback in case of an electoral college deadlock. Contingent elections may occur if multiple candidates split the electoral vote, \"faithless\" electors deny a majority, or the electoral college ties at 269 votes. Congress has conducted contingent elections twice since the 12th Amendment was ratified in 1825 and 1837. In 1837, the Vice President was elected due to no candidate receiving a majority of electoral votes in the 1836 election. The presidential contest of 1824 marked a shift towards a more democratic political environment as new states in the west and southwest gained influence. Voter requirements were liberalized, leading to a larger electorate. The democratization trend in the electoral process extended to the election of 1800, with 10 out of 16 states having the legislature pick electors. By 1824, 17 out of 24 states used some form of popular vote for presidential electors. The Federalists had become a regional party by 1824, while the Democratic Republicans controlled the presidency and Congress since 1800. Presidential nominees were generally chosen by consensus within the party. In 1824, the Democratic Republican caucus nominated James Madison and James Monroe for the succession elections. John Quincy Adams, William Crawford, Andrew Jackson, and Henry Clay were also contenders. The election resulted in an electoral college deadlock with Andrew Jackson winning the popular vote. In 1824, the election ended in an electoral college deadlock as Andrew Jackson won the popular vote but did not secure the required electoral vote majority. Jackson had 99 electoral votes, Adams had 84, Crawford had 41, and Clay had 37. Clay, despite being the fourth candidate, influenced the House to support Adams, leading to accusations of a \"corrupt bargain\" by Jackson supporters. In the 1824 election, Adams was chosen as President in a contingent election, with Clay becoming his Secretary of State, sparking accusations of a \"corrupt bargain.\" This controversy overshadowed Adams' presidency and fueled Jackson's supporters for the 1828 election, which Jackson won. The Senate later elected Martin Van Buren as Vice President in 1836. In 1836, Martin Van Buren was chosen as the Democratic Party's presidential candidate, with Richard Mentor Johnson as his running mate. The Whig Party had multiple candidates for both President and Vice President. Van Buren won the election with a slight popular vote majority and 170 electoral votes, while Johnson fell five votes short of a majority, leading to a contingent election in the Senate. In 1836, Martin Van Buren was chosen as the Democratic Party's presidential candidate, with Richard Mentor Johnson as his running mate. The Senate had a contingent election between Johnson and his Whig opponent, Representative Francis Granger, with Johnson winning by voice vote. The 12th Amendment sets requirements for contingent elections in the House of Representatives, limiting the number of candidates eligible for consideration. The 12th Amendment sets requirements for contingent elections in the House of Representatives, limiting the number of candidates eligible for consideration. If no candidate receives a majority of electoral votes, the House shall choose the President from among the top three candidates. The House must proceed to the contingent election immediately without delay. In 1825, the House of Representatives conducted a contingent election for the President, requiring voting \"by ballot\" interpreted as a secret, paper ballot process. Each state delegation had dedicated ballot boxes for internal voting, followed by marking state results on secret ballots for plenary voting. The 12th Amendment specifies that a quorum for the contingent election must consist of members from two-thirds of the states. In a contingent election for the President, the House of Representatives requires voting \"by ballot\" interpreted as a secret, paper ballot process. The 12th Amendment specifies that a quorum must consist of members from two-thirds of the states. The Speaker of the House is designated as the presiding officer for the contingent election, and rules were drafted by a select House committee for supplementary procedures. During the contingent election for the President, state delegation Members needed a majority to cast their state vote. If no majority was reached, the ballot was marked \"divided.\" The House met in closed session with only specific individuals admitted. Despite the secrecy, votes were widely known soon after the 1825 election. Adjournment motions required support from state delegations, not individual Representatives. State delegations were positioned in the House chamber from left to right based on the roll call order. The contingent election process for the Vice President in the Senate is less complex than that for the President in the House. The 12th Amendment requires a quorum of two-thirds of Senators and a majority vote to elect the Vice President. Unlike the House, the Senate does not have to vote by ballot, and in 1837, the election was conducted by voice vote. In 1837, the Senate conducted the contingent election for Vice President by voice vote, with each Senator naming their choice. The likely result was known in advance, and Richard Mentor Johnson was elected comfortably. It is unclear if the election was held behind closed doors, but spectators from the House and the public were likely present. President pro tempore William R. King presided over the election, not outgoing Vice President Martin Van Buren. Van Buren presided over the 1837 contingent election, retiring from duties as President of the Senate on January 28, 1837. The contingent election process was modified twice in the 20th century, first by the 20th Amendment to the Constitution in 1933 and later by the Presidential Succession Act of 1947. The 20th Amendment set new expiration dates for congressional and presidential terms, aiming to eliminate lame duck post-election sessions of Congress and shorten the period between election and inauguration of the President. The 20th Amendment aimed to shorten the period between election and inauguration of the President, remove responsibility for contingent election from a lame duck session of Congress, and ensure the President and Vice President are chosen by the newly elected House and Senate. Section 3 of the amendment addresses contingent election and empowers Congress to provide for situations where neither a President nor Vice President qualifies. The Presidential Succession Act of 1947, based on the authority provided in Section 3 of the 20th Amendment, outlines the procedures for presidential succession. It states that the Speaker of the House would act as President if neither the President nor Vice President is qualified, followed by the President pro tempore of the Senate. If both decline, the acting presidency would go to the head of the most senior executive department. The Presidential Succession Act of 1947 outlines procedures for presidential succession, stating that the Speaker of the House would act as President if needed. The act also addresses the limitations on serving as President in such circumstances. The House or Senate may need to consider various factors if called upon to elect a President or Vice President. The House of Representatives may need to consider different committees' jurisdiction over rules for a contingent election of the President. Precedents from 1801 and 1825 show the House establishing select committees for this purpose, as the Committee on Elections only dealt with congressional elections. The House of Representatives may need to determine which committee has jurisdiction over the contingent election process for the President. Past precedent shows select committees being formed for this purpose in 1801 and 1825, as the Committee on Elections only handled congressional elections. The current House Administration Committee, Committee on Rules, and House Committee on the Judiciary could all potentially assert authority over the process. There may be pressure for a modern contingent election session to be open to the public. Pressure may exist for a contingent election session to be open to the public and covered by media. Proponents argue for transparency, while opponents emphasize the need for confidentiality and debate exchange. Calls for public disclosure of individual Representatives' votes in the first round may also arise. Advocates argue for public transparency in the contingent election process, suggesting that the decision should be made openly to hold Representatives accountable. Defenders of a secret ballot cite original intent and potential external influence on votes. In a contingent election, the sanctity of the secret ballot for Representatives may be questioned, as well as the House's requirement for a majority vote within state delegations in the first round of voting. The Constitution does not specify this plurality requirement, leading to debate on its legitimacy compared to the electoral college's majority rule. In a contingent election, Representatives may face competing demands on how to vote, as the Constitution does not mandate a first-round majority vote within state delegations. The 12th Amendment does not specify the constitutional duties of individual Members in this situation, leaving room for debate on alternative positions. During the House's consideration of contingent election arrangements in 1825, various alternative positions were debated. Some Representatives argued for electing the candidate with the most popular or electoral votes, while others suggested considering the popular election returns and weighing the candidates' merits. Another alternative proposed that contingent election was a separate process triggered by the failure of voters and the electoral college to reach a majority decision. During the House's consideration of contingent election arrangements in 1825, Representatives debated various options for choosing a candidate, including the idea that the contingent election was a new event where individual judgment could be exercised without reference to earlier contests. This historical debate may carry less weight in today's majoritarian democracy, but Representatives could still cite Edmund Burke's defense of the elected representative's right to use their judgment in making a decision. Representatives may consider voting for the candidate who won the popular vote, the candidate who won a plurality of electoral votes, or the winner in their state or district. These options are based on fairness, respect for the electoral college, and honoring the voters' choices at the state or local level. In contingent election, Representatives may consider voting based on party loyalty, personal preference, and shared principles. Open debate on the House floor is crucial for a serious examination of alternatives. The 12th Amendment requires a vote \"by ballot\" but does not prevent Representatives from announcing their choices. In contingent election of the President, Representatives can announce their votes, leading to dramatic deliberations. The 23rd Amendment allows DC citizens to vote in presidential elections but not in contingent elections. The District is not considered a state for this process. The 12th Amendment has fewer procedural demands on the Senate for contingent elections. The 12th Amendment has fewer procedural demands on the Senate for contingent elections of the Vice President. The process would require fewer process-driven decisions by the Senate, historical precedent supports a voice vote in open session. Proposals related to procedures would likely be referred to the Committee on Rules and Administration. The Senate Committee on Rules and Administration would likely handle proposals related to procedures for contingent elections of the Vice President. This committee has jurisdiction over congressional rules, Senate rules, and Federal elections, including the election of the President and Vice President. Constitutional amendments related to House of Representatives voting in a contingent election have been proposed in past Congresses. The 12th Amendment allows for contingent election of the President, which has been a topic of reform proposals. Recent proposals in the 110th Congress suggested a change where each Representative would cast a vote instead of each state, with the person receiving the most votes winning. The only difference between the proposals was the quorum requirements for the House during contingent election sessions. The 12th Amendment's quorum for contingent election has been proposed to change from \"a member or members from two-thirds of the states\" to \"a majority of the House\" or \"two thirds of the members of the House\" in different proposals. The aim is to ensure a majority or super majority presence during the election process, as the current requirement allows for a contingent election session with as few as 34 Members present. This change is seen as necessary due to the constitutional significance of the House's role in the contingent election of the President. The proposed amendments aim to change the contingent election process for the President by eliminating state equality and allowing each Representative to cast one vote based on their state's population. This change is argued to be more democratic, reflecting the population differences among states. Arguments against the amendments could focus on the potential weakening of the process. Arguments against the proposed amendments to change the contingent election process for the President include concerns about weakening the federal nature of the existing process and the symmetrical nature of the current system for electing both the President and Vice President. No further action was taken on the proposed amendments before the 110th Congress adjourned, and no similar proposals have been introduced since then. American presidential elections have been dominated by two major parties since the early 19th century. Third party or independent candidacies have the potential to disrupt this tradition, as seen in four elections since 1968. The 2000 election in Florida also raised the possibility of electoral votes being challenged and excluded by Congress. In the event of electoral votes being challenged and excluded by Congress, a contingent election may be required to choose the President and Vice President. This process would be governed by the 12th Amendment and could involve the House and Senate. Despite past attempts to reform the election process, constitutional amendments for direct popular election have not been successful. The Constitution is difficult to amend, requiring a two-thirds vote in Congress and approval by three-fourths of states within seven years. Successful amendments often result from broad national consensus after lengthy debate or urgent response to significant events. Examples include the 17th Amendment for direct election of Senators and the 24th Amendment for the 18-year-old vote. The Constitution is difficult to amend, requiring a two-thirds vote in Congress and approval by three-fourths of states within seven years. Successful amendments often result from broad national consensus after lengthy debate or urgent response to significant events. The 12th and 25th Amendments address presidential succession and disability. The support of prominent members in Congress is crucial for amendments to gain traction. Existing provisions like contingent election may remain unchanged unless compelling reasons arise for modification. The public, Congress, and states are ready for reform, with broad national consensus and support from prominent members in Congress being crucial for successful amendments."
