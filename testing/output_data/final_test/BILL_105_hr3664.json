The Secretary of Agriculture estimates costs for administering tobacco programs, including the tobacco quota program, tobacco price support program, and crop insurance programs for tobacco. The Secretary of Agriculture estimates costs for administering tobacco programs, including additional coverages for tobacco crops, extension services, and market share assessments for tobacco product manufacturers and importers. If the estimate is insufficient, adjustments are made for the next fiscal year to cover additional costs incurred by the Department. The assessment payable by tobacco product manufacturers and importers is determined based on estimated costs and market share for the most recent calendar year. The amount each manufacturer or importer owes is calculated by multiplying the total estimated costs for the fiscal year by their market share. The Secretary collects these assessments each fiscal year as prescribed. The Secretary collects nonrefundable assessments from tobacco product manufacturers and importers based on estimated costs and market share. The assessments are deposited into the Tobacco Assessment Fund, which covers Department costs without further appropriation. The Secretary may enforce collection of assessments in US courts. The Secretary may refund excess amounts collected under the Tobacco Assessment Fund to tobacco product manufacturers and importers. The funds cannot be used to change crop insurance premiums for tobacco producers under the Federal Crop Insurance Act.
