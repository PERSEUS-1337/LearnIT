Amends Chapter 19 of title 38, United States Code by adding a new subchapter for supplemental mortgage protection life insurance for certain veterans. Sec. 1991 allows the Secretary to purchase mortgage protection life insurance for veterans unable to obtain commercial insurance due to a service-connected disability. Sec. 1992 specifies that the initial insurance amount for a veteran may not exceed $40,000 or the outstanding loan amount on a dwelling. Sec. 1992 specifies that the initial insurance amount for a veteran may not exceed $40,000 or the outstanding loan amount on a dwelling, including necessary land. The insurance amount will be reduced based on the loan's amortization schedule and will not exceed the outstanding loan with interest. Premiums for this insurance shall be paid as prescribed by the Secretary and based on specific criteria. The Secretary will prescribe premiums based on mortality data to cover the cost of insuring veterans with service-connected disabilities. Premiums will be deducted from veterans' compensation and paid to the insurer. Insurance amount will be paid to the mortgage holder upon the veteran's death. The insurance policy purchased under section 1991 of this title shall include reinsurance provisions approved by the Secretary for the best interest of veterans or the Government. Reinsurance with other insurers meeting qualifying criteria may participate in such reinsurance. The Secretary may discontinue or exclude loans from an insurance policy if deemed in the best interest of veterans or the Government. Insurance issued to a veteran cannot be canceled solely due to policy termination. The Secretary can transfer policy amounts to new insurers if the policy is discontinued. The new policy must include the determination of reserves, issuance of uniform certificates to veterans, and other necessary provisions. The insurer must provide an accounting of premiums to the Secretary annually. The insurer must determine reserves based on contract details, including mortality and claim charges, expenses, and risk charges. If the reserve exceeds total charges, the insurer holds the difference as a contingency reserve with approved interest rates. The Secretary may review the contingency reserve as needed. The Secretary may review and adjust insurance premium rates and contributions to prevent substantial accretions to the contingency reserve. If the contract is discontinued, any positive balance in the reserve must be paid to the Secretary in equal monthly installments over a maximum of two years. The Secretary has the authority to adopt regulations related to insurance under this subchapter. Insurance regulations under this subchapter, including eligibility, maximum amount, and duration, are determined by the Secretary in the best interest of veterans or the Government. Insurance takes effect on a date set by the Secretary and terminates upon the veteran's loan satisfaction or 70th birthday.
