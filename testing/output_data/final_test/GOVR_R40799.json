There has been litigation over using trademarks as keywords for sponsored results, with courts struggling to determine trademark infringement. This report gives an overview of trademark law and reviews court opinions on this issue. Trademarks are words, names, symbols, or devices used to indicate the source of goods or services and distinguish them from others. The main federal statute governing trademarks is the Trademark Act. The Lanham Act governs trademarks in the U.S., providing federal protection for marks used in association with products or services. Trademark law aims to prevent others from copying a source-identifying mark, as described by the U.S. Supreme Court. Trademark law under the Lanham Act aims to prevent others from copying a source-identifying mark, reducing customer costs and encouraging the production of quality products while discouraging inferior ones. Trademark owners can pursue federal private causes of action to prevent unauthorized use of their mark. The Lanham Act governs federal trademark infringement claims, prohibiting unauthorized use of registered marks that may cause confusion or deceive consumers. The Lanham Act prohibits unauthorized use of registered marks that may cause confusion or deceive consumers. To establish a violation of the Act, the trademark owner must prove the validity of the mark, unauthorized use by the defendant, and likelihood of consumer confusion. The Lanham Act requires the plaintiff to prove the validity of the registered mark and unauthorized use by the defendant, as well as the likelihood of consumer confusion. The defendant's liability is established by showing commercial use of the plaintiff's trademark in connection with the sale of goods or services. The Lanham Act defines \"use in commerce\" as the bona fide use of a mark in the ordinary course of trade, not just to reserve a right in a mark. It specifies that a mark is in use on goods when placed on them or their containers, sold or transported in commerce, and on services when used in advertising or rendered in commerce. The Lanham Act defines \"use in commerce\" as the genuine use of a mark in trade, whether on goods or services. The focus of trademark infringement claims often centers on the \"use\" prong, particularly in keyword advertising litigation. The third element, \"likelihood of confusion,\" does not require proof of actual consumer confusion but rather the probability of confusion regarding the source of goods. This analysis involves assessing whether the conduct in question is likely to confuse a significant number of careful consumers. Customer surveys are commonly used as evidence in determining this element. Customer surveys are often used to determine the likelihood of confusion in trademark infringement cases. Different federal circuits have set forth factors to consider, such as the similarity of marks, goods, channels of trade, advertising, classes of purchasers, evidence of confusion, intent of the defendant, and strength of the plaintiff's mark. No single factor is decisive in determining likelihood of confusion. The defendant can assert defenses to escape liability in trademark infringement cases, such as the first sale exhaustion doctrine and nominative fair use. Nominative fair use allows using the plaintiff's trademark to identify them for specific purposes, subject to a three-part test. In trademark infringement cases, defendants can use defenses like the first sale exhaustion doctrine and nominative fair use. Nominative fair use permits using a trademark to identify a product or service, as long as it is necessary and does not imply sponsorship or endorsement. Descriptive fair use allows protectable trademarks for words that inform consumers about a product's characteristics, quality, or function, with acquired \"secondary meaning\" indicating a unique source. An example is \"PARK 'N FLY,\" associated with a specific off-site parking business near airports. The defendant in a trademark infringement case is using the \"descriptive fair use\" defense, claiming they are using descriptive words in good faith to inform the public about their own goods or services. This defense is codified in the Lanham Act and allows the use of descriptive terms fairly and in good faith. Internet search engines like Google, Yahoo, and Bing generate revenue from selling keywords for online advertisements. Online advertisements use keywords related to search terms entered by users to display banner ads or sponsored links on web pages. These ads direct users to the advertiser's website when clicked. For example, General Electric could purchase the keyword \"refrigerator\" from Google to have a sponsored link for their refrigerators appear next to relevant search results. Other companies can also purchase the same keyword, with the search engine following a priority system for requests. When search engines like Google sell keywords like \"refrigerator,\" they may prioritize requests or hold auctions for advertisers. Selling a competitor's brand name as a keyword could lead to trademark infringement issues, with potential lawsuits from the affected company. For example, if Google sells the trademark \"Whirlpool\" to GE, Whirlpool could sue for unauthorized use of its trademark causing consumer confusion. The potential for trademark infringement arises when search engines sell competitors' brand names as keywords, leading to consumer confusion. The outcome of potential lawsuits, such as Whirlpool suing GE for unauthorized trademark use, remains uncertain due to a lack of legal precedent on the matter. Despite concerns from trademark owners about increased costs to secure their own trademarks in keyword auctions, some argue that selling trademarks as keywords benefits consumers by allowing them to discover competing products and compare prices. Consumers can comparison shop and stay informed about news and criticism related to trademark names through keyword-triggered advertising. Trademark infringement cases involve lawsuits against search engines or advertisers. Search engines may be held liable for direct or contributory infringement. While cases against search engines like Google receive attention, most involve direct lawsuits against advertisers. Courts treat trademark infringement issues in keyword advertising cases similarly, with few final rulings. Courts address whether a trademark owner can overcome defense motions to dismiss based on the use of a trademark as a paid keyword not constituting \"use in commerce.\" Genuine issues of material fact determine potential summary judgment rulings in favor of alleged infringers. In keyword advertising cases, courts consider whether a trademark owner can overcome defense motions to dismiss based on the use of a trademark as a paid keyword not constituting \"use in commerce.\" A genuine issue for trial exists if the trademark owner presents evidence that could resolve the material issue in their favor, as explained by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The burden shifts from the moving party to the non-moving party to show specific facts supporting a genuine issue for trial. Judges presiding over keyword advertising cases have not been concerned with weighing evidence but determining the presence of a genuine issue for trial. The judges in keyword advertising cases focus on whether a plaintiff is entitled to offer evidence to support their claim, rather than on the ultimate outcome of the lawsuit. There was a split in opinion among federal courts in different circuits regarding the use of trademarks as keyword triggers for online advertising. District courts in certain circuits have found that using a trademark as a keyword trigger constitutes \"use in commerce\" under the Lanham Act, allowing trademark infringement suits to proceed. The defendant's use of plaintiff's marks to trigger internet advertisements for itself is considered a violation of the Lanham Act, as it involves using protected marks in connection with the sale or advertising of goods or services. District courts in the Second Circuit have differing opinions on whether using a trademark keyword to trigger online ads constitutes \"use in commerce\" for trademark infringement claims. The defendant's use of plaintiff's marks to trigger internet advertisements was deemed a violation of the Lanham Act. District courts in the Second Circuit had conflicting views on whether using a trademark keyword to trigger online ads constitutes \"use in commerce\" for trademark infringement claims. This issue was resolved in April 2009 by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. In April 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit overruled conflicting district court views on using trademark keywords for online ads in Rescuecom Corp. v. Google, Inc. The court ruled that Google's recommendation of the trademark \"Rescuecom\" to competitors constituted trademark infringement under the Lanham Act. Rescuecom filed a trademark infringement lawsuit against Google for displaying competitors' ads when users searched for \"Rescuecom.\" The district court ruled that Google's internal use of the trademark did not constitute trademark infringement under the Lanham Act. Rescuecom appealed the lower court's decision to dismiss the case against Google for trademark infringement. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found that Google's recommendation and sale of Rescuecom's trademark to advertisers constituted \"use in commerce.\" The appellate court remanded the case for further proceedings, stating that internal use of trademarks by search engine operators may still be protected under the Lanham Act. The Lanham Act's protections prevent search engine operators from using trademarks in ways that could deceive consumers, such as allowing advertisers to pay for top placement based on a competitor's trademark. The federal appellate court ruled in favor of the trademark owner, allowing Rescuecom to proceed with the case against Google for trademark infringement. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Rescuecom, allowing them to proceed with a trademark infringement lawsuit against Google. The court attached a non-binding appendix discussing the ambiguity of the \"use in commerce\" requirement in the Lanham Act, suggesting that Congress should clarify this issue. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Rescuecom, allowing them to proceed with a trademark infringement lawsuit against Google. The court discussed the ambiguity of the \"use in commerce\" requirement in the Lanham Act, suggesting that Congress should clarify this issue. The court explained that the statutory definition of \"use in commerce\" is more properly applied in the context of trademark registration and the benefits provided by the Lanham Act, rather than specifying the conduct for liability in infringement cases. The term 'use in commerce' in \u00a7 1127 is defined as the bona fide use of a mark in the ordinary course of trade, not for reserving rights. This definition clarifies that liability for infringement is not limited to conduct that causes harm. An accused infringer may escape liability if they acted in bad faith, as a bad faith infringer would not have made a use in commerce. This means liability would only apply to those who acted in good faith. The Second Circuit interpreted the \"use in commerce\" language in the Lanham Act as a way for Congress to regulate trademark infringement under the Commerce Clause. The court traced the legislative history of the Act and concluded that Congress did not intend to exempt infringers from liability, even if they acted in bad faith. The appellate court clarified that Congress intended liability for trademark infringement to be based on acts affecting commerce, not just the statutory definition of \"use in commerce.\" This ruling aligns the Second Circuit with other circuits and may impact keyword advertising cases in the region. Rescuecom ruling aligns Second Circuit with other circuits on trademark infringement liability based on acts affecting commerce, impacting keyword advertising cases. District courts can focus on \"likelihood of confusion,\" increasing litigation costs and potentially leading to more settlements. Concerns raised about chilling effect on Internet search engines' keyword advertising practices. The use of trademarks in keyword-triggered advertising can create a likelihood of confusion, impacting trademark infringement liability. Courts have issued divergent opinions on this issue, depending on the circumstances. Courts have found that the appearance of trademarks in online advertisements can lead to a likelihood of confusion. However, the use of trademarks as keywords to trigger ads may be subject to the nominative fair use defense. One court granted summary judgment for an advertiser defendant, stating that there is no confusion when trademarks are not visibly displayed in the ad text. The advertiser defendant argues that there is no likelihood of confusion when trademarks are used solely as keywords in online advertisements. The links to the defendant's website on search result pages are distinct and independent, preventing potential consumers from confusing their services with those of the plaintiff. Another court suggests considering new factors in determining likelihood of confusion in keyword advertising. Ultimately, confusion will depend on what the consumer saw on the screen and reasonably believed in context. The court considers various factors in determining likelihood of confusion in keyword advertising, including the mechanics of web-browsing, specific search results, downstream content, consumer sophistication, and duration of confusion. In a case where a jury ruled on consumer confusion, the court emphasized the importance of what the consumer saw on the screen and reasonably believed in context. The federal court in Fair Isaac Corp. v. Experian Information Solutions, Inc. rejected the plaintiff's keyword advertising claims due to lack of credible evidence supporting consumer confusion. The \"initial interest confusion\" doctrine was invoked to show potential confusion caused by keyword-triggered advertising. The alleged harm caused to the trademark owner is intentional diversion of consumer attention from one trademarked good to a competitor's good. An example of \"initial interest confusion\" is when a competitor's billboard misleads customers looking for a store, leading them to the competitor's store instead. This analogy may not apply in the Internet context, especially in keyword advertising cases. In keyword advertising cases, the initial interest confusion doctrine may not apply as in the billboard analogy. Instead, sponsored linking can offer a variety of products similar to a menu, based on the consumer's initial search. When a consumer searches for a trademarked item, she receives search results with links to the trademarked product's website and a competitor's website. The court noted that mere diversion without confusion does not constitute trademark infringement. However, in this case, the plaintiff alleged a plausible likelihood of confusion in the overall context of the internet search, allowing them to proceed with an initial interest confusion theory. Another federal court has also accepted the use of this doctrine. Another federal court has accepted the initial interest doctrine in proving likelihood of confusion in keyword advertising cases due to misappropriation of the trademark owner's goodwill. In Morningware, Inc. v. Hearthware Home Products, Inc., the court found sufficient facts to establish potential initial interest confusion by consumers. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant's use of the trademark on similar products could lead to confusion. The district court found that initial interest confusion can occur even if consumers are briefly misled to a website, as seen in a Seventh Circuit appellate case involving the use of trademarks in metatags. Equitrac's use of Promatek's trademark in its metatags diverts consumers to its website, allowing Equitrac to benefit from Promatek's goodwill. The duration of consumer confusion is not significant; what matters is the misappropriation of Promatek's goodwill. Consumers directed to Equitrac's website may learn about Equitrac before searching for Promatek. The district court's decision that Promatek could succeed on the merits due to initial consumer confusion was correct. The legality of using trademarks as keywords for online advertising is a debated issue in recent court cases. The courts have resolved the \"use in commerce\" threshold for the Lanham Act, but there is still a lack of consensus on whether trademark use causes confusion. The extent of affirmative defenses and appropriate remedies for infringement have not been fully examined. This issue will continue to be a source of dispute between trademark owners and keyword buyers and sellers."
