The \"Biological Implant Tracking and Veteran Safety Act of 2014\" mandates the adoption of a standard identification system for biological implants in VA medical facilities. This system will track implants from donor to implantation, ensuring compatibility with existing identification systems. The Secretary must implement inventory controls compatible with the tracking system for biological implants subject to recall by the FDA in VA medical facilities. If deemed appropriate, patients must be notified of recalls based on risk evaluations. In case of conflicts, this section must align with FDA regulations. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act or Public Health Service Act regulations apply to biological implants, defined as human cell or tissue products regulated under FDA guidelines. A clerical amendment is made to include this definition in the relevant chapter. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs must implement a standard identification system for biological implants within 180 days of the enactment of the Act. The Secretary of Veterans Affairs is required to adopt a standard identification system for biological implants in compliance with FDA regulations.

The Secretary will use Federal Supply Schedules for procurement unless not available. The Secretary will accommodate vendor requests to educate medical professionals about biological implants listed on Federal Supply Schedules. Section 8123 does not apply to the procurement of biological implants. If unavailable on the schedules, competitive procedures will be used for procurement. Penalties apply to Department procurement employees who violate requirements. Penalties apply to individuals who violate the requirements regarding biological implants, leading to ineligibility for certain roles. Definitions for 'biological implant' and 'production identifier' are provided in this section. The text discusses requirements for biological implants and includes a clerical amendment to the table of sections. Section 8129 of title 38, United States Code, pertains to the procurement of biological implants. It specifies that the effective date of this section will be 180 days after the implementation of a tracking system required under another section. Additionally, there is a special rule for cryopreserved products allowing for the procurement of biological implants produced before the effective date without relabeling."
