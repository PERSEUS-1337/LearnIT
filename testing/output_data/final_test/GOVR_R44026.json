New sequencing technologies generate big data, stored and analyzed using cloud technology. This supports changes in health research and precision medicine, combining genetic, environmental, clinical, and behavioral data for personalized healthcare. Medicine prioritizes providing healthcare based on patient and disease characteristics, supported by genetic and genomic research generating large-scale data subject to NIH data sharing policies. Advances in sequencing technology have enabled the generation of vast amounts of data, outpacing storage and analysis capabilities. Advances in genomics research have led to a rapid increase in DNA sequencing output, with data stored in the 'cloud' to overcome storage limitations. The National Cancer Institute has launched Cancer Genomics Cloud Pilots to facilitate access to large data repositories for studying genetic underpinnings of diseases like diabetes. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has established a policy for sharing genomic data from research funded by NIH. Investigators must outline data sharing plans in funding applications, de-identify the data before submission, and comply with HHS Common Rule and HIPAA Privacy Rule requirements. Failure to submit required data may result in funding withholding. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) policy requires de-identification of data before submission, compliance with HHS Common Rule and HIPAA Privacy Rule, and assignment of random codes. Data is submitted to NIH-designated databases by investigators, with IRB determining access levels based on informed consent. Controlled-access data requires NIH approval for secondary research use. Some databases offer varying levels of data access, such as open and controlled access in dbGaP. This allows for broad release of non-sensitive data while ensuring oversight for sensitive data involving personal health information. Gathering large amounts of data for genetic research and precision medicine relies on individuals willing to participate in research studies. The trust in biomedical research relies on honest disclosure of risks and privacy safeguards. Privacy considerations in research studies include disclosure of personal data, access controls, and appropriate data use. Laws like HIPAA, GINA, and the Common Rule govern these aspects. Data privacy has mainly focused on identifiability so far. The privacy of data has been mainly focused on identifiability, with de-identified data being defined as information that cannot be linked to an individual. Large-scale genomic sequence data is often considered de-identified when entered into the public domain. Recent studies suggest a need to re-examine current paradigms for managing identifiability of genomic data. Recent studies challenge the traditional belief that de-identified personal genome data cannot be reidentified. In a study by Gymrek et al. in January 2013, researchers successfully reidentified nearly 50 participants in the International HapMap Project using publicly available de-identified personal genome data and other data sources. Matching de-identified data with a second source of genetic data linked to identifying information allowed for reidentification. The study by Gymrek et al. successfully reidentified individuals using a public genealogy database linked to surnames as a second source of genetic data. The study matched de-identified personal genome data with genetic information from the genealogy database to link it with surnames and other identifying data. The findings may not be broadly generalizable to the whole population due to the specific second source of genetic data used. The study relied on the 1000 Genomes database, an open-access resource, while NIH data repositories often have controlled access. As genetic databases grow, the risk of reidentification increases due to refined connections between genetic variations and personal characteristics. With the technical feasibility demonstrated in the Gymrek study, the expanding genetic data and analytics availability pose a growing risk of reidentification. The NIH and others prioritize funding genomic research and sharing its results widely. Privacy and security concerns arise in genomic research, necessitating protection for data generation, handling, and release. Policymakers may monitor NIH's data sharing policies and relevant federal laws, including HIPAA, the Common Rule, GINA, and FOIA. FOIA allows public access to government-held information. The NIH's Genomic Data Sharing (GDS) Policy requires NIH-funded researchers conducting human genomic research to adhere to the Common Rule and have their studies approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB). The IRB must review informed consent materials to explain risks and benefits of sharing genomic data with NIH for secondary research use. NIH provides guidelines for IRBs reviewing genomic research proposals. Researchers seeking controlled-access data from NIH repositories must comply with these regulations. The GDS Policy requires NIH-funded researchers to follow the Common Rule and obtain IRB approval for human genomic research. Researchers accessing controlled-access data must sign a Data Use Certification Agreement and adhere to privacy and security safeguards. Concerns exist regarding the adequacy of patient privacy protection under the Common Rule and HIPAA, as well as limitations on data access and inconsistencies between the two standards. The Common Rule and HIPAA have concerns about inconsistencies in patient privacy protection. HHS addressed some concerns in a 2013 final rule, making amendments to the Privacy Rule under the HITECH Act. The Common Rule requires IRB approval for research protocols to protect human subjects, including obtaining informed consent and providing information on research purpose, procedures, and risks. The Common Rule and IRB guidelines focus on protecting human subjects in research by requiring informed consent and addressing privacy issues, especially in the context of health data analytics. The waiver of informed consent may be considered if the research poses minimal risk and is not feasible without it. The Common Rule defines human subject research as collecting identifiable information about participants. De-identified information is not subject to Common Rule requirements. Individually identifiable information is data that can readily identify a subject. The Common Rule emphasizes privacy protection and confidentiality in research, requiring IRBs to ensure privacy safeguards and informed consent to address confidentiality. The Common Rule emphasizes privacy protection and confidentiality in research, requiring IRBs to ensure privacy safeguards and informed consent. It permits consent for corollary and future research, allowing research participants to allow future research on their identifiable information or specimens. The HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules establish federal standards to safeguard personal health information. The HIPAA Rules set federal standards to protect personal health information for covered entities and their business associates. The Privacy Rule covers \"protected health information\" (PHI) and includes a de-identification standard to remove identifiers or assess re-identification risk. De-identified information meeting the standard is not subject to the Privacy Rule. The Privacy Rule under HIPAA prohibits the use or disclosure of PHI without authorization. Covered entities must implement safeguards to protect PHI from unauthorized access. The Security Rule applies to ePHI and sets security standards based on organization size and complexity. Administrative standards include security management and training, while physical standards cover facility access and workstation use. The Security Rule under HIPAA sets physical and technical standards for protecting digital information, with implementation specifications for each standard. Some specifications are required, such as conducting a risk analysis, while others are \"addressable\" and must be assessed for appropriateness. PHI cannot be used for research without authorization, except when waived by an IRB based on minimal risk. The Privacy Rule under HIPAA allows for waiving authorization for the use or disclosure of PHI in research under certain criteria. PHI may be reviewed for research protocol preparation, and deceased individuals' PHI can be used for research purposes. The Institute of Medicine found that the Privacy Rule does not adequately protect health information privacy and hinders new research. The report highlighted challenges in interpreting and following the Privacy Rule for health data collection. It discussed inconsistencies with the Common Rule in governing human subject research, such as restrictions on combining authorizations. In 2013, HHS modified the Privacy Rule to allow compound authorizations for any research activity and permits authorizations for future research, as long as the description is clear. NIH provides guidance for IRBs reviewing genomic research proposals involving data submission. The NIH document provides guidance to IRBs on data privacy protections and informed consent for sharing genomic data. It discusses risks like participant identification and unauthorized disclosure. Investigators submitting data to NIH repositories must follow guidelines to reduce identification risks. Investigators submitting genomic data to NIH-designated repositories must de-identify the data according to Privacy Rule standards by assigning random codes. The NIH acknowledges the potential for identifying individuals from genotype-phenotype data and encourages IRBs to consider obtaining a Certificate of Confidentiality for added protection. A Certificate of Confidentiality from NIH provides additional protection for researchers by preventing disclosure of identifying information about research subjects in legal proceedings. Genomic research participants may need to provide compound authorization including informed consent and HIPAA authorization for access to their medical information. The HIPAA authorization form should outline potential future uses of the data. When researchers access medical information about their subjects, they must comply with the Privacy Rule's requirements. Researchers and their institutions are typically not HIPAA-covered entities. To access data from an NIH genomic repository, investigators must submit a Data Access Request and a Data Use Certification outlining terms for data use. This includes following all relevant laws, using data only for approved research, and not attempting to identify participants. The Data Use Certification for accessing data from an NIH genomic repository requires investigators to handle the data securely, follow IT security requirements, and notify NIH of any unauthorized data sharing or breaches. The NIH genomic repository requires investigators to handle data securely, follow IT security requirements, and report any data breaches. Investigators and institutions are not bound by HIPAA standards but must adhere to dbGaP Security Best Practices which align with HIPAA technical security standards. The Freedom of Information Act grants public access to executive branch information, including unpublished agency records. The NIH genomic repository requires secure data handling and compliance with IT security requirements. Data shared with NIH may be subject to FOIA, which allows public access to certain information but exempts trade secrets and national security-related data. Disputes over data accessibility can be resolved in federal court or through mediation. Concerns have been raised about the potential public release of genetic and genomic data collected by federal agencies, despite attempts to de-identify the information. The public release of de-identified genetic or genomic data may raise concerns about personal privacy protection and lead to calls for legislation clarifying access to such information. FOIA exemptions, such as Exemption 3 and Exemption 6, could impact the disclosure of genetic material by withholding data protected by specific statutes to prevent unwarranted invasion of privacy. The Health Service Act and the National Defense Authorization Act provide exemptions (b(3) exemptions) to protect identifiable information and trade secrets in genetic and genomic data from public release. Future statutes passed by Congress could also qualify for these exemptions. The release of genetic and genomic data may qualify for a b(3) exemption, allowing the withholding of personally identifiable information. Exemption 6 of FOIA permits agencies to withhold records containing such information if the individual's privacy interest outweighs the public interest. The NIH believes that releasing unredacted GWAS datasets would invade personal privacy under Exemption 6, historically applied to information linked to specific individuals. The potential release of genetic research material that could be traced to specific individuals may trigger privacy concerns under Exemption 6 of FOIA. The federal government argues that the data collected is currently not identifiable, which could impact the application of exemptions. However, even if data allows for identification, the balance between privacy interests and public disclosure must be considered under FOIA. The specific facts of each information request also play a role in determining disclosure. The specific facts of each information request could trigger various FOIA exemptions, such as Exemption 7 for law enforcement activities, Exemption 5 for memorandums, and Exemption 4 for commercial information. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 protects against discrimination based on reidentified research subjects' genetic information. GINA establishes prohibitions primarily affecting genetic data security and appropriate use. GINA prohibits discrimination based on genetic information by health insurers and employers. It is divided into Title I, which addresses discrimination by health insurers, and Title II, which focuses on discrimination in employment. Genomic sequence data may not be protected under GINA, but specific genetic test results are covered. Title I of GINA prohibits genetic discrimination in group health plans and health insurance issuers by preventing the use of genetic information to adjust premiums, deny coverage, or request genetic testing. The health reform law (ACA) and GINA have provisions that may overlap regarding limitations on insurance premiums. GINA prohibits using genetic information for coverage and premiums, while the ACA defines factors for insurers. The ACA provisions may affect GINA requirements, especially in terms of access to genetic information. Title II of GINA prohibits genetic information discrimination in employment, including hiring, firing, and promotions. Employers are restricted from requesting or purchasing genetic information, with exceptions for inadvertent requests, wellness programs, or law enforcement DNA analysis. The ACA lacks a comparable provision to GINA's restrictions on group health plans and insurers requiring genetic testing. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) prohibits genetic information discrimination in employment, with exceptions for inadvertent requests, wellness programs, or law enforcement DNA analysis. Policymakers may consider expanding GINA's protections as genomic data becomes more accessible, potentially by strengthening requirements for lawful use of genetic information. GINA does not apply to life, disability, or long-term care insurance, TRICARE, the Indian Health System, the Veterans Health Administration, or the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program."
