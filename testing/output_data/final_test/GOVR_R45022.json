    "content": "The Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies (THUD) Appropriations Subcommittees in the House and Senate draft bills for annual appropriations for the Department of Transportation (DOT), Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and related agencies. DOT primarily provides grants for transportation infrastructure and oversees safety. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) within DOT operates the U.S. air traffic control system. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) primarily addresses housing issues for low-income households through rental assistance programs like Public Housing, Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers, and Section 8 project-based rental assistance. Additionally, block grant programs like HOME Investment Partnerships and Community Development Block Grants help finance housing and community development activities for low-income families. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) offers grant programs to assist low-income families and homeless individuals, including those with AIDS. The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insures mortgages for homebuyers with low down payments and developers of affordable rental buildings. Title III of the THUD appropriations bill funds various agencies involved in transportation, housing, and community development. This includes the Access Board, National Transportation Safety Board, and oversight of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Title IV of the THUD appropriations bill contains general provisions, such as funding restrictions and supplemental funding for disasters. Most programs in the bill are funded through regular discretionary appropriations allocated annually by the appropriations committees. Some accounts may receive advance appropriations or emergency appropriations from the general fund of the Treasury. Emergency appropriations are sometimes provided by Congress in response to disasters, outside of regular appropriations acts. These funds, typically from the general fund, may not be included in the discretionary appropriation total for an agency. The Department of Transportation's budget mainly consists of contract authority, which is mandatory budget authority based on federal trust fund resources. Contract authority controls spending from the Highway Trust Fund and the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, with the amount typically set in DOT authorizing legislation. Appropriators determine the final amount of contract authority available each year by establishing a limitation on obligations. The annual discretionary budget authority for THUD is typically around half of the total funding provided in the bill, with the remainder made up of DOT's mandatory contract authority. Congressional appropriators are subject to limits on new nonemergency discretionary funding. Ways to stay within these limits include appropriating no more than the allocated amount in the annual appropriations act or finding ways to offset higher funding levels. The cost of regular annual appropriations for the THUD bill is offset through rescissions and offsetting receipts. The annual discretionary budget authority for THUD is typically around half of the total funding provided in the bill, with the remainder made up of DOT's mandatory contract authority. Funding for DOT and HUD declined after FY2010, with FY2017 funding still below FY2010 levels. Legislative action on the FY2018 THUD appropriations bill is outlined in Table 2. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees divide discretionary spending allocations among their subcommittees to develop regular appropriations bills. These suballocations set the parameters for funding decisions, although they cannot determine individual account or program funding. The House and Senate did not agree on a budget resolution for FY2018 until October, after both committees had already taken action on THUD appropriations. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees released informal suballocations for THUD appropriations in July 2017 to continue developing the FY2018 appropriations bills. The committees reported their FY2018 THUD appropriations bills based on these suballocations. Table 3 shows the discretionary funding for THUD in FY2017, Trump Administration's request for FY2018, and the suballocations by the committees. Table 4 lists the total funding for each title in the bill for FY2017 and the requested amount for FY2018. The Trump Administration's FY2018 budget included $106.65 billion for programs in the THUD bill, $9.7 billion less than FY2017. Reductions included $2 billion for DOT and $7.5 billion for HUD, cutting funding for various programs. The House-passed H.R. 3354 and Senate-reported S. 1655 differ in funding for THUD, with the House bill proposing a slight reduction and the Senate bill recommending a slight increase compared to FY2017. The House bill would result in a 3% reduction in real THUD funding, while the Senate bill would result in a slight increase. Net discretionary budget authority for THUD agencies may differ from the amount of new discretionary budget authority due to budgetary savings from rescissions and offsets. In FY2017, THUD subcommittees provided $10.1 billion in discretionary appropriations to agencies above the budget authority level, thanks to rescissions and offsets. The main source of budget savings is HUD's FHA insurance fund, with estimates varying annually based on mortgage projections. The Trump Administration requested a $1.1 billion reduction in DOT from FY2017 levels, primarily by eliminating the Essential Air Service program and the TIGER grant program, and reducing funding for the transit New Starts program. The House-passed bill proposes a slight increase in funding for DOT, while the Senate-reported bill recommends a 2% increase, with a focus on highways and FAA programs. The Senate bill includes policy provisions such as increasing the passenger facility charge at airports and authorizing DOT to ban cell phone calls during flights. The President's FY2018 budget request for HUD includes $40.7 billion in gross discretionary appropriations, a $7.3 billion decrease from FY2017. The proposal also aims to eliminate funding for several HUD grant programs, including the CDBG and HOME programs for states and localities. The President's FY2018 budget request for HUD includes $40.7 billion in gross discretionary appropriations, a $7.3 billion decrease from FY2017. Large funding reductions for public housing, including a 68% cut for the capital fund and elimination of funding for the Choice Neighborhoods program. Several policy proposals, such as increasing the share of rent paid by certain HUD-assisted housing recipients from 30% to 35% and eliminating utility reimbursements. H.R. 3353 would have provided $48.0 billion in gross discretionary appropriations for HUD. The HUD budget for FY2018 includes $48.0 billion in gross discretionary appropriations, a $7.3 billion increase from the President's request. Funding for tenant-based and project-based rental assistance accounts would see small increases, while the public housing operating fund would remain level and the capital fund would be cut by 5%. There are also funding reductions for major HUD grant programs, with cuts to the SHOP account by 17%, HOME by 11%, and CDBG by 3%. Amendments were approved to increase funding for CDBG, SHOP, Public Housing Capital Fund, Housing for Persons with AIDS, and Housing. The Senate Appropriations Committee's S. 1655 proposes $49.9 billion in gross discretionary appropriations for HUD in FY2018, a 4% increase from FY2017. Funding increases are allocated to programs such as Housing for the Elderly (+14% over FY2017), while decreases are seen in areas like Public Housing Operating Fund and Information Technology. Policy changes include blocking HUD's implementation of certain manufactured housing regulations and allowing for the study of specific foundation materials. The Senate Appropriations Committee's S. 1655 proposes a 4% increase in gross discretionary appropriations for HUD in FY2018. Funding increases are allocated to programs such as Housing for the Elderly, project-based rental assistance, and tenant-based rental assistance. Level funding is proposed for grant programs like CDBG and HOME. New policy changes include an expansion of the Rental Assistance Demonstration and new penalties for HUD if reports on failed inspections are not issued. Appropriations levels for related agencies funded within the Transportation, HUD, and Related Agencies appropriations bill are shown in Table 8. The President's FY2018 budget request includes winding down the Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH) with a proposed funding level of $57, an 80% reduction from FY2017, to cover closing costs by November 2017. The House committee bill supports terminating the USICH, while the Senate committee bill funds it at FY2017 levels and eliminates the statutory sunset. The President's FY2018 budget includes winding down federal funding for NeighborWorks America, created in 1978 to support affordable housing. The requested $27 million is for winding down existing commitments, while both House and Senate committee bills would continue funding at FY2017 levels."
