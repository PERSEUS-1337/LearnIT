    "content": "The \"Over-Classification Reduction Act\" aims to increase information sharing and public access by reducing improper classification within the Federal Government. The Archivist of the United States, in consultation with federal agencies, will create regulations to prevent over-classification of information, including specific requirements for determining when classified products should be prepared in a governmentwide format and when they should also be prepared in an unclassified format. The Archivist of the United States will establish requirements for Federal agencies to implement processes for challenging classification decisions without retribution and rewarding successful challenges. The curr_chunk discusses challenges related to classification markings, informing individuals about penalties for noncompliance, and penalties for repeated noncompliance despite notice and training. The regulations for noncompliance consultation and deadline, along with Inspector General responsibilities for auditing classified information, are outlined in the text. The Inspector General is responsible for randomly auditing classified information to assess compliance with policies, identify issues, recommend training improvements, and report findings to Congress and the public. SEC. 4. ENFORCEMENT OF OVER-CLASSIFICATION PREVENTION WITHIN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. The Archivist of the United States requires personal identifiers to be included on classified information to address over-classification problems and assess information sharing impact. When implementing the security education and training program, the Archivist integrates training on prevention of over-classification, proper use of classification markings, consequences of over-classification, and non-compliance with classification rules. The Archivist integrates training on prevention of over-classification, proper use of classification markings, consequences of non-compliance with classification rules, and lessons learned from implementation of regulations including audits. The program is conducted efficiently to reduce costs and administrative burdens. The Archivist implements a detailee program to detail Federal agency personnel to the National Archives for training and educational purposes, bolstering oversight authorities and ensuring compliance with classification policies and procedures. The detailee program implemented by the Archivist ensures consistency with agency policies and procedures, and will end on December 31, 2012. SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS.

An \"affected Federal agency\" is one that employs individuals with classification authority. The document was passed by the House of Representatives on September 9, 2008, with Lorraine C. Miller as the Clerk."
