    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act\" and it addresses interest rates. The Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 regarding interest rate provisions for new loans after July 1, 2013. The Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to set interest rates for Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loans and Federal Direct PLUS Loans disbursed between July 1 and June 30 based on the bond equivalent rate of 10-year Treasury bills auctioned before June 1, plus 1.85 percent. The Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act sets interest rates for Federal Direct Stafford Loans as follows: 1.85 percent for undergraduate students, 3.4 percent for graduate students, and 4.4 percent for Federal Direct PLUS Loans. The Secretary determines the rates after consultation. The Secretary determines the applicable rate of interest for Federal Direct Stafford Loans, Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loans, and Federal Direct PLUS Loans after consulting with the Treasury Secretary. The rate is fixed for the loan period. Consolidation loans for Federal Direct Consolidation Loans received on or after July 1, 2013, will have interest rates based on the weighted average of the consolidated loans or 8.25 percent, whichever is lower. Exit counseling requirements for loan recipients are also amended. The borrower's options for loan consolidation, information on the income-based repayment plan with capped monthly payments and loan forgiveness, and details about Federal Direct Consolidation Loans with a maximum interest rate of 8.25 percent for applications after July 1, 2013, are included in the updated regulations. The Act clarifies that the Secretary of Education cannot mandate new counseling beyond what is required by existing laws. Additionally, the budgetary effects of the Act must comply with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010."
