    "content": "The Act titled \"Professional Standards for Government Attorneys Act of 2001\" amends Section 530B of title 28, United States Code, to establish professional standards for government attorneys. The Act establishes professional standards for government attorneys, including defining the term 'Government attorney' to include various officials and attorneys within the Department of Justice and other agencies authorized to conduct law enforcement investigations. The Act defines a 'Government attorney' as including officials and attorneys from the Department of Justice authorized to conduct law enforcement proceedings on behalf of the United States, independent counsel, outside special counsel appointed by the Attorney General, and excludes investigators or law enforcement agents not authorized to represent the United States. The term 'State' includes Territories and the District of Columbia. The standards of professional responsibility for a Government attorney in the District of Columbia are determined by the rules and decisions of the court where the attorney is conducting work. Government attorneys must adhere to the standards of professional responsibility set by the Federal district court where they primarily work. They must be licensed to practice law in a State but are not required to be a member of the bar of any specific State. Despite State laws, a Government attorney can provide legal advice and participate in covert activities to enforce Federal law, even if it involves deceit or misrepresentation. The text discusses the admissibility of evidence in Federal criminal proceedings despite violations of disciplinary rules. The Attorney General has the authority to create and modify rules to ensure compliance. Additionally, there is a technical amendment regarding professional standards for Government attorneys. Reports are required to encourage the Supreme Court to establish a uniform national rule for Government attorneys. The Judicial Conference of the United States will submit a report to the Chief Justice of the United States within 1 year, recommending amendments to the Federal Rules of Practice and Procedure for a uniform national rule for Government attorneys. Another report will be submitted within 2 years to the Committees on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and the Senate regarding actual or potential conflicts. The Judicial Conference of the United States will review conflicts between Federal duties and attorney regulations, and make recommendations for amending the Federal Rules of Practice and Procedure to address any identified conflicts. The Judicial Conference of the United States considers multiforum and multijurisdictional litigation, the needs of investigating and prosecuting violations of Federal law, and practices consistent with Federal law enforcement techniques."
