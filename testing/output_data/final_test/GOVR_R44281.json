    "content": "This report provides information and analysis on the BDS movement against Israel, private economic measures, product labeling policies, anti-BDS efforts, legislative considerations, and policy questions faced by Congress and the Trump Administration. The BDS movement against Israel involves various actors advocating economic measures, expressing sympathy for the Palestinian cause. No foreign government has acknowledged participation, and there is no secondary tier targeting companies doing business with Israel. Palestinian civil society groups issued a \"Call for BDS\" in 2005, comparing their grievances to the struggle against apartheid in South Africa. Palestinian civil society groups compared their grievances against Israel to the struggle against apartheid in South Africa. They called for international support for non-violent punitive measures unless Israel changes its policies, including ending occupation, recognizing rights of Arab-Palestinian citizens, and respecting Palestinian refugees' rights to return. They urged global boycotts, divestment initiatives, and embargoes similar to those applied to South Africa during apartheid. The BDS movement aims to pressure states to impose embargoes and sanctions against Israel to change its treatment of Palestinians, potentially impacting Israel's demographic and sociopolitical structure. Israeli officials strongly oppose the movement's demands, fearing it could jeopardize Israel's identity as a Jewish state. U.S. officials have consistently denounced boycotts targeting Israel. In January 2017, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and UN Ambassador Nikki Haley opposed BDS-related measures. There is ongoing debate about economic differentiation between Israel and Israeli settlements in disputed areas. Some groups oppose BDS against companies in Israel but support measures targeting settlements. They question the legitimacy of Israeli communities in areas controlled since the 1967 war. Some European countries and U.S.-based Christian churches have divested from companies with settlement ties due to concerns. BDS measures are part of international criticism of Israel, with debates on economic differentiation between Israel and settlements. Israel faces isolation concerns, but some officials note improved relations with other countries. Some divestment and boycotts of Israel have had little impact on the economy. For example, SodaStream closed its West Bank factory due to BDS pressure, leading to layoffs of Palestinian employees. The debate revolves around the impact of BDS advocacy on the employment situation of West Bank Palestinians. While some argue that Israeli settlements and restrictions hinder job prospects, others justify constraints for security reasons. There is a discussion in Israel about how changes in policy towards Palestinians could affect international perceptions of the country. Changes in Israeli policy towards Palestinians can impact international attitudes towards Israel. Right-of-center politicians view criticisms of Israeli actions as rooted in prejudice, while left-of-center figures criticize government steps that may weaken support for Israel. Israeli leaders actively oppose BDS, allocating $26 million annually to counter BDS activities through public diplomacy, enlisting allies, and digital initiatives. Israeli diplomats emphasize the importance of robust efforts to combat BDS. In 2016, Israeli diplomats warned that strong efforts to counter BDS could backfire by giving the movement free publicity and alienating potential supporters. Private individuals and organizations raised funds to combat pro-BDS sentiment in the US and elsewhere. In March 2017, Israel passed a law allowing the government to block entry of nonresidents who support boycotts against Israel or West Bank settlements. Debates on labeling consumer products from Israeli settlements in the EU and US have implications for BDS and differentiation policies. Israeli officials are concerned about potential economic consequences with the EU, their largest trading partner, due to Palestinian-related developments. Some EU member states have implemented measures to differentiate between Israel and its settlements project in bilateral relations, not necessarily in support of the BDS movement. The European Commission issued guidelines for labeling products from Israeli settlements in areas captured in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Products from settlements in the West Bank and Golan Heights should be differentiated from those produced outside of settlements. EU diplomats state that the labeling is a technical move and not part of a boycott or sanctions against Israel. The EU issued guidelines for labeling products from Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Golan Heights, aiming to differentiate them from products produced outside of settlements. This move was not intended as a boycott or sanctions against Israel, but rather to provide consumers with information to make informed choices. Israel criticized the EU's decision, calling it discriminatory and politically motivated. Israel suspended contact with several EU bodies in response, but later resumed discussions in February 2016. The Palestinian Liberation Organization viewed the labeling as a significant step towards a total boycott of Israeli settlements. Some Israelis and Members of Congress opposed EU guidelines for labeling products from Israeli settlements, while the Obama Administration stated that labeling is not equivalent to a boycott. The EU guidelines for labeling products from Israeli settlements have had a muted economic impact, with less than 1% of Israel's annual trade with the EU affected. Debate continues over the implications of these differentiation measures. The EU guidelines for labeling products from Israeli settlements have had limited economic impact, with less than 1% of Israel's trade with the EU affected. A 2016 report highlighted slow progress in EU differentiation, while an Israeli journalist criticized the labeling system as a step towards a BDS program. Tensions over Israeli settlement policy may lead to the EU reviewing and expanding differentiation measures, with some diplomats calling for full implementation of labeling guidelines. The EU guidelines for labeling products from Israeli settlements have limited economic impact. In January 2016, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency clarified labeling requirements for goods produced in the West Bank or Gaza Strip. The guidelines state that these goods should be marked with specific terms like ''West Bank'' or ''Gaza,'' and not with ''Israel'' or ''Made in Israel.'' The U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency clarified labeling requirements for goods produced in the West Bank or Gaza Strip, stating that they should not be marked with terms like ''Israel'' or ''Made in Israel.'' Proposed legislation in 2016 aimed to allow products from West Bank settlements to be labeled ''Made in Israel,'' but none were enacted during the 114th Congress. Several bills were enacted during the 114th Congress, including the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-26) which provided trade promotion authority to the President. U.S. policymakers and lawmakers have opposed the BDS movement, with some seeking legislative options to limit its influence. Proposed anti-BDS legislation is under congressional consideration. The Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015 (P.L. 114-26) granted trade promotion authority to the President for negotiating U.S. trade agreements, including the U.S.-EU Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP). The law aimed to discourage politically motivated economic actions against Israel or Israeli-controlled territories. Public debate focused on whether EU differentiation between Israeli settlements and Israel promotes BDS-related activity. The office responded to the enactment of P.L. 114-26, emphasizing the growth of trade ties with Israel since the U.S.-Israel Free Trade Agreement. The U.S. government opposes boycotts targeting Israel but criticizes the conflation of Israel and Israeli-controlled territories in the Trade Promotion Authority legislation. It reaffirms the longstanding U.S. policy against Israeli settlement activity beyond the 1967 lines. The U.S. government does not support Israeli settlements or activities associated with them. President Obama signed a law opposing punitive economic measures against businesses in Israel or Israeli-controlled territories, but certain provisions treating West Bank settlements as part of Israel are not in line with U.S. policy. Various U.S. states have also enacted similar measures since 2015. Various U.S. states have enacted or proposed anti-BDS legislation since 2015, with laws focusing on investment and contracting. These laws require divestment from companies deemed to be against Israel's interests. Examples include New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's executive order in 2016. Various U.S. states have enacted anti-BDS legislation to prohibit public entities from doing business with entities deemed to be against Israel's interests. All 50 U.S. governors and the mayor of Washington, DC, have signed onto an initiative against BDS. The existing U.S. antiboycott regime was crafted to address the Arab League boycott of Israel, and members may consider modifying it to address the BDS movement. The Arab League boycott has primary and secondary tiers restricting business with Israel. The U.S. antiboycott legislation was established in the late 1970s to discourage cooperation with the Arab League boycott of Israel. It targets the secondary and tertiary boycotts, preventing U.S. firms from implementing foreign policies that go against U.S. interests. In FY2016, there were 549 requests related to this legislation. In FY2016, 549 requests by Arab League members to participate in the boycott were reported to U.S. officials. The majority were from the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, and Iraq. Participating in the BDS movement would not violate existing federal antiboycott legislation. Some Members of Congress have introduced legislation to extend antiboycott penalties to BDS-related activity. Members of Congress are considering extending legislation to apply to boycotts against Israel by international governmental organizations. One option is to create a dual system where Congress designates foreign BDS \"offenders\" through legislation, while executive branch agencies can designate offenders based on criteria like market behavior and impact on Israel. Congress could require the executive branch to justify its designations through reports. Congressional designation measures for BDS participation could raise constitutional concerns. Legislation at federal and state levels aims to limit BDS activities, such as restricting federal funds for entities engaging in BDS. Some states have laws prohibiting government contractors from boycotting Israel. Some states have laws prohibiting government contractors from boycotting or discriminating against countries like Israel, while legislation at federal and state levels aims to limit BDS activities. State pension funds may be required to divest from companies engaged in BDS activity. The constitutionality of laws and executive actions related to BDS activity is a topic of debate, with some arguing it raises First Amendment concerns. The constitutionality of laws and executive actions related to BDS activity is a topic of debate, with questions surrounding whether BDS activity is protected by the First Amendment and if government restrictions are suppressing free speech or regulating discriminatory conduct. Answers depend on specific statutes and other factors, making outcomes hard to predict. The First Amendment's Freedom of Speech Clause prohibits the government from restricting expression based on message, ideas, subject matter, or content. While nonverbal conduct may also be protected, the government has more leeway to regulate expressive conduct than pure speech. However, there are limits on regulating conduct with expressive elements under the First Amendment. The Supreme Court has interpreted refusals to do business, including boycotts, as conduct protected by the First Amendment. Boycotts for economic gain can be regulated by the government, but those with political or social motivations may be protected under the First Amendment. The question of whether BDS activity is protected by the First Amendment is debated among scholars and advocates. BDS supporters argue that their activity is protected by the First Amendment, citing the Court's decision in NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware which upheld the right to politically motivated boycotts for governmental and economic change. BDS participants aim to pressure Israel for policy changes through nonviolent means, claiming First Amendment protection similar to the Claiborne Hardware boycott. However, differences exist that may impact constitutional protection for BDS activities. The BDS movement aims to influence Israel's policies through nonviolent means, seeking First Amendment protection similar to the Claiborne Hardware boycott. However, courts generally defer to Congress and the executive branch on foreign affairs, raising questions about the government's ability to deter BDS activity. The Claiborne Hardware case highlighted the potential restriction of protected First Amendment activity under narrowly tailored statutes. The Claiborne Hardware Court raised the question of whether a statutory boycott restriction balancing competing interests could limit protected speech. A commentator suggested that a Supreme Court decision in International Longshoremen's Ass'n v. Allied Intern., Inc. supported the argument that BDS activity may not be constitutionally protected. The case involved a union boycott against Russian products after the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan, which was challenged under the National Labor Relations Act. The Supreme Court ruled that a union's boycott, challenged under the National Labor Relations Act, was not protected by the First Amendment as it was deemed coercive rather than communicative. The Supreme Court's ruling in International Longshoremen's Ass'n stated that coercive conduct, not communication, was not protected by the First Amendment. This may not directly apply to arguments about statutory restrictions on BDS activity, as the case dealt with union boycotting. The Court has historically viewed restrictions on union activity as permissible to balance union freedom of expression with the rights of neutral parties. However, BDS activities do not involve unions, which may limit the relevance of this jurisprudence. Some commentators argue that BDS activity may be restricted based on federal statutes and executive orders that limit participation in foreign government-sponsored boycotts. The Export Administration Act of 1979 imposed penalties on U.S. persons involved in boycotts against countries friendly to the U.S. The Act's regulations prevented U.S. persons from responding to Arab League questionnaires supporting the boycott against Israel, which was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. The Seventh Circuit upheld the restriction on answering the Arab League questionnaire as a valid regulation of commercial speech, not political speech. Plaintiffs argued their answers were political speech to influence decisions, but the court disagreed, stating they only sought to show they should not be subject to boycott sanctions. The Seventh Circuit upheld the regulation of commercial speech, stating that BDS activity may not be considered commercial speech but rather political speech aimed at pressuring Israel to change its policies. This distinction is important as regulations of political speech are scrutinized more closely than commercial speech. The Seventh Circuit case upheld regulations on BDS activity as political speech, not commercial speech. The regulations prohibited communication via speech but did not address whether boycotting a foreign nation is constitutionally protected speech. Politically motivated boycotts may have some constitutional protection, but the government may have more leeway to regulate them than pure speech. The government may have more leeway to regulate politically motivated boycotts, particularly when they have the power to coerce third parties. An early congressional proposal aimed to restrict entities participating in the BDS movement from receiving government funding, sparking a debate on its constitutionality under the Spending Clause of the Constitution. The Spending Clause grants powers to limit federal funds to ensure compliance with Congress's will. The First Amendment restricts conditions on federal funding. The constitutionality of restricting funding to entities engaged in BDS activity depends on various factors, including targeting speech. Some argue that such restrictions could be viewed as prohibitions on discrimination. The Supreme Court has upheld restrictions on federal funding to entities engaged in discriminatory activities, citing cases like Grove City College v. Bell and Christian Legal Society v. Martinez. Congress can attach conditions to financial assistance without violating First Amendment rights, as seen in the Title IX case. In Christian Legal Society, a law school's requirement for inclusive student groups was upheld. The Supreme Court upheld a law school's requirement for inclusive student groups, stating that the school's nondiscrimination policy did not violate the Christian Legal Society's First Amendment rights as it only placed indirect pressure on the group to allow any interested student to join, and they could continue to discriminate in membership if they forgo government subsidy. The Supreme Court upheld a law school's nondiscrimination policy, stating it regulated conduct without reference to motivation. If a federal funding restriction applied only to BDS activity, without restricting speech, it could be constitutional. Some argue laws aimed at deterring BDS activity may still restrict refusals to deal. Funding restrictions targeting BDS participation may raise First Amendment issues as they aim to suppress a specific viewpoint. Opponents argue that such restrictions could be unconstitutional if based on the message conveyed by the BDS movement, potentially conflicting with Supreme Court precedent. The government's funding restrictions on entities engaged in BDS activity may implicate the First Amendment by disfavoring a message it dislikes. While the government can prohibit the use of federal funds for purposes it does not approve of, the restrictions must be relevant to the federal interest in the program. The government cannot dictate the speech of entities receiving federal funds, as per Supreme Court precedent. The government cannot dictate the speech of entities receiving federal funds, as per Supreme Court precedent. While the government can restrict the use of federal funds by entities engaged in BDS movement, the restrictions must be relevant to the federal interest being funded and not burden speech funded privately. Some states have taken action related to BDS activity, including prohibitions on state contracting with entities engaged in BDS and divestment of state assets from companies participating in BDS. Some states have enacted legislation to restrict state contracting with entities engaged in BDS activity, arguing that it does not raise First Amendment concerns if aimed at preventing discrimination. Government contractors are already prohibited from discriminating based on various factors. If the restrictions are viewed as targeting discriminatory conduct rather than suppressing a particular viewpoint, they may be upheld in court. The First Amendment may limit the government's ability to restrict BDS activity by government contractors, as contractors retain their rights to engage in speech on public concerns. However, the government's legitimate interests as a contracting party may outweigh contractors' First Amendment rights in some cases. Reviewing courts weigh these rights and interests to determine the outcome. The First Amendment may limit the government's ability to restrict BDS activity by government contractors, as contractors retain their rights to engage in speech on public concerns. Reviewing courts may balance the government's interests as a contracting party with contractors' speech rights to determine permissibility. The Supreme Court has addressed limitations on existing contracts but not on new bids for government contracts. The Constitution may limit the government's ability to deny contracts based on protected speech, with lower courts in disagreement. Some states have divested funds from entities involved in BDS activity, citing First Amendment concerns. Proponents argue that BDS is not protected speech, justifying investment restrictions. The constitutionality of state restrictions on investment related to BDS activity is uncertain, as it is unclear if BDS is protected speech under the First Amendment. There is no direct precedent on whether limiting state funds based on entities' speech violates the First Amendment. The Supreme Court's analysis of government funding restrictions may provide some guidance on this issue. In a recent opinion on government funding restrictions on speech, Chief Justice Roberts distinguished between conditions that define government spending programs and those that aim to regulate speech beyond the program's scope. State investment restrictions may be scrutinized to determine if they express support for a public policy or seek to control speech. Some state and local governments are implementing measures to counteract BDS-related actions, which could raise constitutional concerns. Sanctions influencing foreign politics raise constitutional issues related to federal law preemption, foreign commerce burden, and interference with federal foreign affairs power. State actions may be limited by the Supremacy Clause, which establishes federal law as supreme. The constitutionality of state or local measures depends on specific legislation details. When Congress enacts federal statutes, it has the power to preempt state laws in a specific area. This can be done through express preemption, where Congress clearly states its intent to preempt certain state laws. Even without express preemption, federal laws can still impliedly preempt state or local actions. Field preemption occurs when federal regulation is extensive enough to suggest that states are preempted in that area. The Supreme Court has ruled on conflict preemption, where state laws obstruct federal objectives. Congress may include nonpreemption language in sanctions legislation to avoid implied preemption. The Combating BDS Act of 2017 allows state and local governments to divest from certain entities. The bill allows state and local governments to divest from or prohibit contracting with entities engaged in BDS-related activity. It is based on the Sudan Accountability and Divestment Act of 2007. The Constitution grants Congress the authority to regulate commerce, including restrictions on states interfering with commerce under the dormant Commerce Clause. The Commerce Clause prohibits states from unreasonably burdening or discriminating against interstate or foreign commerce without congressional authorization. The Supreme Court has set criteria for examining state taxes that burden foreign commerce without congressional permission. State selective purchasing or divestment laws can be defended under the market participant doctrine if Congress has not clearly immunized them. The market participant doctrine allows state and local governments to defend laws related to government investment and procurement as long as they are not regulating other investors or buyers. However, this doctrine may not apply if the state's actions extend beyond its immediate market. The Supreme Court has indicated that the doctrine may not apply in Foreign Commerce Clause cases. Additionally, states cannot encroach on the federal government's exclusive authority over external affairs. In Zschernig v. Miller (1968), the Supreme Court struck down an Oregon law that restricted nonresident aliens from inheriting property, deeming it an unconstitutional intrusion into foreign affairs reserved for the federal government. The Supreme Court reaffirmed the dormant foreign affairs power in 2003 by striking down a California law interfering with a German initiative on Holocaust insurance claims. It remains uncertain if state regulations conflicting with federal foreign policy can be permitted. The federal district court blocked an Illinois law that restricted state funds from being deposited in financial institutions doing business with Sudan, citing interference with federal foreign policy power. The impact of the nonpreemption language in the Sudan Accountability and Divestment Act of 2007 on similar state laws remains unaddressed in court."
