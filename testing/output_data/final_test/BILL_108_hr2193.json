    "content": "The \"Port Security Improvements Act of 2003\" may be cited as the short title for this Act. After the 9/11 attacks, Congress focused on enhancing aviation security with the Aviation and Transportation Security Act in 2001. Subsequently, the focus shifted to port security with the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002, which lacked specific deadlines for improvements. The United States maritime transportation system includes over 300 ports with more than 3,700 cargo and passenger terminals. The top 25 ports handle 98% of the 6 million container shipments entering US ports annually. The system is vulnerable to terrorist activities, posing a threat to national security and the economy. Expenditures for the maritime transportation system by 13 Federal agencies averaged $3.9 billion per year from 1999 to 2001. The Corps of Engineers, Coast Guard, and Customs Service accounted for 93% of these expenditures. Customs Service operations cost $484.2 million, $538.4 million, and $577.2 million in fiscal years 1999, 2000, and 2001 respectively. Additionally, 11 Federal agencies collected $1 billion annually from maritime transportation system users, with customs duties on imported commodities averaging $15.2 billion per year. Before September 11, 2001, the Interagency Commission on Crime and Security in United States Seaports estimated that the cost of upgrading security infrastructure at United States ports ranged from $10,000,000 to $50,000,000 per port. These estimates could increase dramatically due to new post-September 11 security requirements. For example, for the first $93,300,000 of Federal grant funds for port security made available in a supplemental appropriations Act, the Federal Government received grant. In the second round of Federal grants, the government received applications totaling $997,000,000 for an expected $105,000,000. The Coast Guard estimated first-year costs for maritime security improvements at $1,300,000,000 and 10-year costs at $6,000,000,000. SEC. 3. FINANCING PORT SECURITY ENHANCEMENTS. The Secretary of Homeland Security can use 30 percent of duties collected at ports for port security enhancements, including administrative processing and services for increasing security. The term \"port security costs\" refers to expenses incurred by the Federal Government for maritime transportation systems, including administrative processing, physical services like inspections and certifications, construction, maintenance, and miscellaneous services. The term \"vessel\" is defined in section 401 of the Tariff Act of 1930. Amounts for port security costs will be available for the first five fiscal years after the enactment of this Act. The Secretary of the department in which the Coast Guard operates must issue interim final regulations within 6 months and final regulations within 12 months after the enactment of this Act. Additionally, there will be standardization of security requirements for ports, vessels, and facilities. SEC. 5. Standardization of security requirements for ports, vessels, and facilities will be established by the Secretary of the department where the Coast Guard operates under title 46, United States Code. This includes setting national minimum security requirements for ports, facilities, and vessels entering U.S. ports."
