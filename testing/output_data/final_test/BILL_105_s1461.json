    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"JUMP Ahead Act of 1997\". Congress recognizes the need for mentoring programs to support at-risk youth living in areas plagued by drug use and crime, often coming from single-parent homes. Mentoring provides a vital bond of commitment and mutual respect that can lead these young individuals towards a better future through dedicated relationships.
