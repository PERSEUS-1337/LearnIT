    "content": "South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa took office in February 2018 after his predecessor Jacob Zuma resigned under pressure from the African National Congress (ANC). Ramaphosa is leading a reform agenda to address economic challenges and corruption scandals. He is serving out the remainder of Zuma's term and is eligible for two additional terms. Expectations for his leadership are high, but he faces fiscal, structural, and political challenges. International expectations of President Cyril Ramaphosa are high, but he faces diverse fiscal, structural, and political challenges. U.S.-South Africa ties are cordial, based on shared democratic values and regional development goals. South Africa is considered a strategic U.S partner, although high-level bilateral engagement is not as frequent as with other partners. Congressional attention towards South Africa has mainly focused on healthcare assistance, trade issues, and consultations during congressional travel to the country. South Africa's economic and political influence in Africa often differs from U.S. positions in multilateral contexts. The United States has a significant diplomatic presence in South Africa, with a history of high-level leadership visits. South Africa has been a major recipient of U.S. assistance, particularly in healthcare through programs like PEPFAR. The U.S. has also supported South African-led development and crisis response efforts in other African countries. In 2010, a U.S.-South African Strategic Partnership was initiated and remains in effect. The U.S.-South African Strategic Partnership, initiated in 2010, focuses on cooperation in various areas such as health, education, food security, law enforcement, trade, investment, and energy. South Africa is the largest U.S. trade partner in Africa since 2014, with occasional friction in trade and differences over foreign policy issues. South Africa maintains cordial relations with Iran, diverges from the U.S. on various issues, including votes in the United Nations and responses to the crisis in Venezuela. South Africa opposed the Trump Administration's decision to withdraw from the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change. Anti-U.S. rhetoric may stem from historic grievances over U.S. policy during apartheid. During the anti-apartheid struggle, the Reagan Administration labeled the ANC as a terrorist organization and vetoed the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986. The Trump Administration has not made significant changes in bilateral ties with South Africa, but President Trump nominated Lana Marks as U.S. ambassador to South Africa in late 2018. The Senate did not act on her nomination by the end of the 115th Congress. President Trump discussed expanding trade and bilateral cooperation with President Zuma, including counter-terrorism and peace issues. In August 2018, Trump's tweet on land reform in South Africa sparked controversy, criticizing the government for alleged land seizures from white farmers. Despite efforts to change the constitution for land expropriation, it was not yet implemented in 2018. Congress has historically been actively involved in U.S.-South African relations, especially during the anti-apartheid struggle from the 1960s to 1994. This involvement included passing the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986, overriding President Reagan's veto. In recent years, congressional focus has been on overseeing foreign aid programs, particularly South Africa's efforts in addressing the HIV/AIDS crisis. In recent years, Congress has focused on overseeing foreign aid programs in South Africa, particularly regarding the HIV/AIDS crisis. Efforts to strengthen trade and investment ties with South Africa have also been a priority, with congressional action helping to resolve trade disputes and address concerns over tariffs. Members periodically travel to South Africa to enhance bilateral relations and promote trade and investment. No specific South Africa-centered bills have been introduced in recent congresses. The State Department's FY2019 foreign aid budget request highlights South Africa's importance as a key player for U.S. engagement in Africa and a critical partner for trade and economic growth. Despite being the economic and security anchor of the region, South Africa faces challenges such as corruption, a slowing economy, high unemployment, crime, HIV/AIDS, water scarcity, and wildlife trafficking. The Trump Administration requested a significant decrease in funding for South Africa for FY2020. Since 1994, South Africa has been a top recipient of U.S. aid, mainly for health programs like PEPFAR. Aid levels peaked at nearly $587 million in FY2018, with cumulative PEPFAR funding totaling $6.26 billion from FY2004 to FY2018. The Trump Administration proposed a significant decrease in funding for FY2020. The Trump Administration proposed a significant cut in PEPFAR funding for FY2020, reducing it to $161.8 million from the requested $500 million in FY2019. The State Department criticized PEPFAR in South Africa for fundamental problems in its core treatment program despite previous U.S. government support. Despite an infusion of resources by the U.S. government, the PEPFAR program in South Africa has shown poor performance in retaining individuals on HIV treatment. Results have been stagnant from FY 2017 to FY 2018, with more people lost from treatment than gained in the latter year. Overspending and underperformance at the partner level indicate a program management issue. Improvement in linkage and retention is urgently needed. In South Africa, there is a need to improve linkage and retention in COP 2018 implementation. Recent U.S. development aid has supported programs in basic education, civil society capacity-building, public service delivery advocacy, and energy projects. USAID also provides support for small enterprise activity and development-focused financing. USAID supports development-centered policymaking in South Africa and administers the Trilateral Assistance Program. South Africa is a \"Strategic Partner\" under the Feed the Future initiative, providing agricultural technical assistance to other African countries. The State Department and USAID administer most U.S. development assistance programs in South Africa, collaborating with specialized agencies like the CDC. U.S. agencies, including the CDC, provide financial services and grants to boost exports and development in South Africa. The Peace Corps and USADF also have programs in the country. Security cooperation efforts receive less funding than development programs. In prior years, INCLE funds were used for law enforcement support, while NADR-EXBS funds focused on trade and border control training. IMET and FMF aid have supported South African military capacity for regional crises and peacekeeping. ACOTA has provided peacekeeping training since 2005. South Africa's military has received support from various U.S. programs, including ACOTA for peacekeeping training. The country is influential in Africa due to its investments, political engagement, and leadership in the African Union. Despite progress in post-apartheid transformation, negative socioeconomic effects of apartheid persist. After the tumultuous end of apartheid in South Africa between 1990 and 1994, a system of universal suffrage and multi-party democracy was introduced. Nelson Mandela was elected president in the 1994 elections, leading to the adoption of a new constitution in 1996. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) was established to address crimes and human rights abuses from 1960 to 1994, promoting restorative justice and accountability. The ANC, holding a majority in the National Assembly since 1994, has worked to address the effects of apartheid through social welfare programs and promoting a multiethnic national identity. Despite improvements in racial relations, challenges persist with racially motivated crimes and socioeconomic disparities from apartheid. Many damaging socioeconomic effects of apartheid persist in South Africa, including high levels of poverty, social inequality, and unemployment. Racial disparities have decreased, but most black South Africans still live in poverty with significantly lower incomes compared to the white minority. Income distribution is highly unequal, with the wealthiest 10% and 20% enjoying the highest share of income. South Africa's GINI coefficient, a measure of income inequality, is consistently among the highest globally. There are also significant regional, rural-urban, and intra-racial disparities. Large segments of the poor majority in South Africa lack access to decent housing and infrastructure services, especially in rural areas and informal settlements. Township dwellers, mostly poor black and mixed race inhabitants, face eviction and land ownership issues. Despite land redistribution efforts, there are extreme racial disparities in land access. Since 1994, there has been a rise in black ownership of land in some provinces in South Africa, but redistribution and restitution processes have been slow. The white minority still owns over 70% of land nationally, leading to calls for state expropriation of private land. The country also faces challenges such as labor strikes, high rates of violent crime, and capacity issues in the criminal justice system. South Africa's national police force faces challenges with vigilante justice, abusive tactics, and corruption among leaders. Social cohesion is strained by socioeconomic inequality, xenophobic attacks, crime against white farmers, and residential segregation. High HIV prevalence is another significant issue, with 18.99% of adults estimated to be HIV-positive in 2018. Statistics South Africa estimated that 18.99% of adults were HIV-positive in 2018, up from 2017. Despite this increase, there has been a decline in the annual growth rate of HIV prevalence and incidence. National efforts to counter HIV have received international support, but citizens' demands for rapid socioeconomic transformation exceed what the state can provide, leading to frequent demonstrations. Service protests in South Africa have led to violent demonstrations, often related to public corruption and cronyism. President Ramaphosa had to cut short a trip in 2018 due to unrest, including service delivery protests and clashes within the ANC. The government is working on funding free higher education for the poor. Despite challenges, many state agencies remain functional. Despite the politicization of the state bureaucracy under Zuma, many national state agencies in South Africa possess substantial institutional and technical capacity. The country ranked second globally on the International Budget Partnership's 2017 Open Budget Index, indicating public budget transparency. State-owned enterprises manage large national infrastructure systems, while the welfare system supports millions of grants and is seen as a key anti-poverty tool. The ANC party in South Africa has faced controversy despite its efforts to reduce poverty. It combines leftist ideology with support for private sector growth under a \"developmental state\" model. The party's credibility stems from its anti-apartheid history, but it struggles to address current challenges and faces growing opposition. Despite some electoral losses, the ANC maintains parliamentary dominance amid internal rivalries. The ANC in South Africa faces internal rivalries at provincial and local levels, often leading to political assassinations. National Assembly elections use a party-list proportional representation system, with ANC leadership playing a crucial role in national politics. The party president is key as they are usually nominated for national president. COSATU and SACP influence the ANC through the Tripartite Alliance. The Tripartite Alliance, involving the ANC, COSATU, and SACP, weakened during Zuma's tenure due to internal criticism and discontent. The DA, the second-largest party in parliament, has historical liberal origins and has gained support among blacks. Led by Mmusi Maimane, the DA often challenges the ANC in parliament, sometimes aligning with the EFF, a populist party focused on black empowerment. The EFF, a party focused on black empowerment, was formed in 2013 by Julius Malema, a former ANC Youth League leader. Malema, a vocal critic of corruption, was expelled from the ANC in 2012. The EFF draws support from marginalized groups and operates disruptively in parliament. The Inkatha Freedom Party, once a fierce ANC rival, is now a centrist party from KwaZulu-Natal province. The Democratic Alliance (DA) is now a centrist party in South Africa with 10 seats, making it the fourth largest political party. The \"Born Free\" generation, born in 1994 or later, is a key target demographic for all parties due to their discontent over corruption, public services, and poverty. During Zuma's presidency, the DA and the EFF used the courts to check executive power by suing state officials, with many successful cases related to executive overreach and malfeasance. In March 2016, the Constitutional Court ruled against Zuma for defying a recommendation to reimburse the state for a state-funded upgrade to his private compound. The DA used this ruling for an impeachment motion that failed but was a blow to Zuma. Another case by the DA led to a High Court ordering the NPA to review a corruption case against Zuma. The government faced legal setbacks for ignoring court orders. The South African government ignored a court order by not detaining Sudanese President Omar Al Bashir, who had an ICC arrest warrant. Efforts to withdraw from the ICC were deemed unconstitutional. Former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela issued reports on corruption and malfeasance, including the critical \"State of Capture\" report on Zuma and the Gupta family. The \"State of Capture\" report by former Public Protector Thuli Madonsela alleged extensive state malfeasance involving a family of business owners with close ties to Zuma. The report led to the establishment of a judicial commission of inquiry, which Zuma tried to prevent. Ramaphosa succeeded Zuma as president in 2018 after a contentious ANC party leadership election. President Ramaphosa narrowly won the late 2017 ANC party leadership election, defeating the faction linked to Zuma. His priorities include fighting corruption, improving governance, and boosting economic growth through public and private investment. The Ramaphosa administration aims to stimulate investment to create jobs, improve social services, and expand GDP. Emphasis is placed on economic transformation for equal access to opportunities, including small business promotion and industrial growth. Other priorities include mining and trade reform, attracting investment, digital sector growth, and agricultural expansion. The administration supports a constitutional amendment for land expropriation without compensation for redistribution to victims of apartheid-era discrimination. Parliament endorsed a recommendation for a constitutional amendment allowing land expropriation without compensation in South Africa. This has sparked controversy over fears of targeting white minority farmers and concerns about international investor confidence in property rights. Ramaphosa clarified that expropriation would mainly target unused land and properties with strong historical rights. Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan is leading efforts to improve governance and effectiveness of State-owned enterprises (SOEs) in South Africa. President Ramaphosa has ordered investigations into irregularities at major SOEs like Eskom and Transnet, replacing their boards and addressing alleged malfeasance. Additionally, the head of the tax service, a Zuma ally, was fired after a commission of inquiry into malpractice. Parliamentary and state investigations have also looked into systematic irregularities at Eskom. Ongoing investigations into alleged corruption and influence peddling under Zuma, known as \"state capture,\" involve a network of Zuma-allied ANC and business associates, including the Guptas. High-profile hearings by a judicial commission of inquiry are key in these investigations. Several commissions of inquiry are investigating alleged malfeasance at state agencies and the politicization of state security agencies. The judicial commission, established by Zuma in 2018, is focusing on corruption during his administration, implicating the Guptas and revealing systematic corruption by other actors like Bosasa. President Ramaphosa appointed a special tribunal in 2019 to expedite the recovery process. President Ramaphosa appointed a special tribunal in February 2019 to fast-track recovery of public assets lost to graft, potentially leading to new charges against Zuma and the Guptas. The hearings could bring negative attention to the ANC before the 2019 election and impact Ramaphosa's standing if his administration is implicated in malfeasance. Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene resigned after admitting links to the Guptas, with Tito Mboweni appointed as his successor. Minister of Home Affairs Malusi Gigaba, a Zuma ally, resigned over a perjury accusation and a sex tape scandal. In a long-running corruption case, Zuma is facing 16 charges of fraud, corruption, racketeering, and money laundering related to a 1990s-era state arms deal scandal. The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) reinstated the charges in 2018 after a court ruling deemed their previous dismissal as \"irrational\" and politically influenced. The trial is ongoing and could have implications for the ANC's future, with allegations of improper favoritism towards Zuma by the NPA. In late 2018, Ramaphosa appointed Shamila Batohi to head the NPA, with a focus on pursuing state capture and public agency malfeasance cases. President Ramaphosa aims to consolidate power within the ANC and unify the party by addressing economic and governance issues, potentially sidelining the opposition. Ramaphosa faces challenges in pursuing his agenda due to divisions within the ANC and the need to cooperate with allies of Zuma. Public anger over poor services and economic issues also hinder his efforts. Despite political headwinds, he remains popular. South Africa has a diversified economy with a high GDP per capita. South Africa, a top producer of commodities like platinum, steel, gold, diamonds, and coal, has a diverse economy with industries in automobile, chemical, textile, and food manufacturing. The industrial base contributes 26% of GDP, while the services sector, including tourism, financial, energy, legal, communications, and transport, contributes 62% of GDP. South African firms are active in Africa and globally, with the Johannesburg Stock Exchange among the top 20 globally. South Africa's economy, known for producing commodities like platinum, steel, gold, diamonds, and coal, is diverse with industries in automobile, chemical, textile, and food manufacturing. The industrial sector contributes 26% of GDP, while services like tourism, financial, energy, legal, communications, and transport contribute 62% of GDP. The Johannesburg Stock Exchange is among the top 20 globally. Despite economic strength, GDP growth has slowed, dropping from almost 2.5% in 2013 to under 0.6% in 2016. The IMF projects a decline to 0.8% in 2018, with GDP in dollar terms falling from $417 billion in 2011 to $296 billion in 2016 due to exchange rate volatility. In dollar terms, South Africa's GDP fell from $417 billion in 2011 to $296 billion in 2016 due to exchange rate volatility, before rising to $349 billion in 2017. Weak investor confidence, attributed to uncertain economic policy trends and alleged poor governance under Zuma, along with weak commodity prices and sluggish global demand, have contributed to low growth. Foreign investors face challenges such as high taxes, currency exchange volatility, regulatory burdens, and compliance costs. Foreign investors in South Africa have concerns over the Protection of Investment Act, which removed special FDI rights and requires disputes to be settled through the legal system. This has led to a sharp drop in FDI flows, totaling $1.3 billion in 2017. Outward flows have increased, surpassing inflows in 2017. The auto industry has been a significant source of FDI, with Ford plants and other automakers present in the country. South Africa has attracted significant foreign direct investment (FDI) in the auto industry, with Ford plants and other automakers like Toyota, BMW, and Nissan making manufacturing capacity investments. The country is ranked as the second most competitive economy in sub-Saharan Africa by the World Economic Forum (WEF), citing strengths in market size, infrastructure, financial system, and innovation capability. However, research and development capacities are seen as inadequate. South Africa's World Bank Doing Business rankings are middling, with room for national improvements. The private sector is dynamic but faces challenges due to high unionization. South Africa's private sector faces challenges with a highly unionized labor force, rigid labor laws, and sector-wide wage agreements. These factors protect incumbent jobholders, limit formal sector opportunities for the unemployed, and contribute to high unemployment rates. The country recently enacted a general minimum wage law, but sectoral labor agreements have mixed outcomes, often favoring incumbent firms and unions. Oligopolies in some sectors hinder competition and lead to high prices for locally produced goods. Skill and geographical mismatches also exist in the labor market. The labor market in South Africa faces challenges such as skill and geographical mismatches, low education quality, and high unemployment rates. Structural racial disparities are being addressed through Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) policies aimed at promoting economic inclusion and equality. BEE policies in South Africa promote economic inclusion and equality through market-based incentives for private firms. Compliance with BEE requirements, including a scorecard system, is necessary for obtaining public contracts. However, these policies have been criticized for favoring middle- and upper-income blacks and limiting hiring choices. State-owned firms, despite poor performance, enjoy regulatory preferences in some sectors, impacting key products/services like power, telecommunications, and transportation. South Africa's sovereign credit ratings have fallen sharply in recent years due to rising public deficits and debt. The country faces challenges with social service delivery, unmet infrastructure needs, and electricity generation deficits leading to rolling power blackouts. Droughts have also caused extreme water shortages. South Africa has faced recent droughts, leading to extreme water shortages in Cape Town. President Ramaphosa aims to attract $100 billion in new investments, with $55 billion already committed. Efforts are also being made to reduce unemployment, poverty, and inequality, improve education and healthcare, and unite the divided society. The National Development Plan (NDP) in South Africa aims to address the country's challenges through investments in social services and infrastructure, with a focus on boosting employment and incomes. However, implementation has been hindered by poor governance, policy inconsistency, and financing limitations. Energy issues, particularly in the power sector, are sensitive political topics that can impact the economy and political prospects for the ruling party. Periodic rolling electricity blackouts in South Africa are caused by power generation shortages and plant maintenance issues, attributed to delays and overspending on coal-fired plants. Eskom, the state-owned power utility, faces debt, low credit ratings, and mismanagement allegations, including questionable coal and uranium deals. Public and opposition criticism has arisen over Eskom's reliance on coal and failure to expand renewable energy sources. Eskom, South Africa's state-owned power utility, faces challenges due to generation shortfalls, $30 billion in state-backed debt, and reliance on coal. The government plans a $4.9 billion restructuring to split Eskom into three entities. Despite opposition, Eskom recently won a rate increase and aims to increase nuclear power generation capacity by 9,600 MW by 2030. The South African government plans to increase nuclear power generation capacity by 9,600 MW by 2030 through the construction of new nuclear power plants. Pre-bid negotiations were held with firms from various countries, including Russia, France, China, the United States, and South Korea. The estimated cost of the project ranged from $30 billion to $100 billion, sparking concerns over costs and environmental impact. Opposition grew due to lack of concrete cost estimates and suspicions of favoritism towards Russian interests in the negotiations. The controversial acquisition of a firm by the Guptas for fuel production for nuclear plants was invalidated by the High Court in April 2017. This decision voided procurement agreements with Russia, the United States, and South Korea, requiring the government to restart the procurement process. The Ramaphosa administration is not in favor of expanding nuclear power in South Africa, while Russia is pushing for a new nuclear deal. The debate over domestic natural gas production through fracking is ongoing. The debate over domestic natural gas production through fracking in South Africa is ongoing. Supporters view natural gas as a cleaner alternative to coal and a way to reduce reliance on energy imports, while opponents, especially farmers, are concerned about possible water contamination in the Karoo region. The 2011 moratorium on exploration was lifted, but a 2017 court ruling invalidated national fracking regulations. The Ramaphosa administration aims to fast-track new exploration applications and regulatory requirements. Mining sector reform is also a focus of debate, with the Zuma administration issuing a draft mining charter in 2017. The mining charter aimed to increase black economic participation by requiring firms to comply with a 30% black ownership share quota. The revised charter under the Ramaphosa administration allows firms to remain compliant even if black ownership shares fall below 30%. It also permits firms to make payments in place of worker and community shares, eliminates dividends for such owners, and requires compliance with BEE regulations for mining firms involved in public procurement transactions. In 2017, South Africa was the 35th largest source of U.S. imports and the 43rd largest U.S. export destination globally, with bilateral trade totaling $13 billion. U.S. FDI in South Africa stood at $7.34 billion, focused on manufacturing, professional services, and wholesale trade. A U.S.-South Africa Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) signed in 2012 facilitates bilateral trade. The Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) signed in 2012 between the U.S. and South Africa facilitates bilateral trade and investment dialogues. South Africa is eligible for duty-free benefits under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), with $2.9 billion in AGOA exports to the U.S. in 2017. There is potential for greater bilateral trade in various goods according to a 2018 U.S. International Trade Commission study. During the 2015 AGOA reauthorization debate, concerns were raised about South Africa's AGOA eligibility due to its reciprocal trade agreements with the EU, which some argued put U.S. firms at a disadvantage. Another issue was the size and advanced nature of South Africa's economy compared to its African peers, potentially impacting its eligibility under AGOA criteria. South Africa's economy, relative to its African peers, is seen as a U.S. competitor in certain sectors. It is the only country utilizing AGOA for exporting advanced manufactured products, such as motor vehicles. In 2017, South Africa's auto exports under AGOA totaled $1.2 billion, comprising a significant portion of African non-oil exports. Debate surrounds whether stricter income requirements are necessary to target the least-developed African countries or if AGOA preferences are effectively aiding South Africa's economic development. Removing South Africa from AGOA could impact intra-regional trade. Removing South Africa from AGOA could undermine intra-regional trade as it is a key trade partner for many African countries. While no significant changes were made to South Africa's AGOA eligibility, issues like import restrictions on agriculture products have drawn congressional scrutiny. A trade dispute over anti-dumping duties and import restrictions on U.S. poultry, pork, and beef products was resolved in 2016 through bilateral engagement. The Trump Administration's use of tariffs under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 has also impacted trade dynamics. In March 2018, the Trump Administration imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum products from South Africa under Section 232. U.S. imports of affected products were valued at $279 million and $340 million in 2017. South Africa sought exemption from these tariffs, which was granted in October for 161 aluminum and 36 steel products. This action alleviated concerns and was in response to U.S. firms' requests for exclusions. The Commerce Department conducted a Section 232 investigation on autos and auto parts, potentially leading to additional U.S. tariffs of up to 25%, including from South Africa. South Africa opposed the tariffs at a hearing in July 2018. President Trump received the investigation report in February 2019, with undisclosed recommendations. Other concerns for South Africa's AGOA participation include intellectual property issues raised by the International Intellectual Property Alliance regarding South Africa's Copyright Amendment Bill. The U.S. Trade Representative annual AGOA eligibility review hearing raised concerns about South Africa's Copyright Amendment Bill potentially affecting AGOA compliance and intellectual property rights. Despite disputes from various parties, the bill was passed by the National Assembly in late 2018 and awaits consideration by the upper house. Other issues impacting U.S. investment in South Africa are addressed in the State Department's annual Investment Climate Statements publication. U.S.-South Africa bilateral relations remain generally friendly, with occasional differences over foreign policy issues. South Africa and the U.S. have friendly relations but differ on foreign policy issues. South Africa supports developing countries in multilateral forums, which sometimes conflicts with U.S. interests. South Africa has criticized U.S.-backed interventions and has close economic ties with China, which the Trump Administration views negatively. Sub-Saharan Africa is a key focus for both countries. South Africa's foreign policy in Sub-Saharan Africa focuses on investment, peacekeeping, and representing African views in multilateral forums. It plays a key role in the African Union and other sub-regional organizations. Serving on the U.N. Security Council from 2019 to 2020 is seen as an opportunity to revitalize its international role. South Africa has been actively involved in regional efforts, playing key roles in the formation of the African Union (AU) and the establishment of the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD). It ratified the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) in 2018 to boost intra-African trade. Former Foreign Affairs Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma chaired the African Union Commission from 2012 to 2017. President Ramaphosa is the First Vice Chairperson of the AU and is set to chair it in 2020. South Africa also hosts around 273,000 refugees and asylum-seekers. South Africa actively participates in resolving political crises and conflicts in Africa, hosting a large number of refugees and migrants. Former President Thabo Mbeki chairs the African Union High Level Implementation Panel on Sudan and South Sudan. South Africa has mediated conflicts in countries like Cote d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Burundi. South Africa contributes troops to U.N. peacekeeping missions in various African countries, including South Sudan, Darfur, and the DRC. They played a key role in forming the Force Intervention Brigade to combat armed groups in the DRC. South Africa aims to establish the South African Development Partnership Agency for foreign aid, but progress has been slow since 2009. The South African Development Partnership Agency (SADPA) aims to coordinate foreign aid with a focus on African countries' democracy, governance, conflict prevention, and development. It would replace the current African Renaissance Fund (ARF) administered by the Department of International Relations and Co-operation. The United States partners with South Africa through the Trilateral Assistance Program (TAP) to leverage South Africa's strengths for development goals. The South African Development Partnership Agency (SADPA) focuses on coordinating foreign aid for African countries' development, democracy, and governance. It provides training, exchange programs, and funding to support South Africa's technical assistance to other African nations. Projects under the Trilateral Assistance Program (TAP) address various issues such as constitution-making, food security, gender-based violence, and climate change responses in Africa. South Africa has strong diplomatic and trade relations with China, its largest trade partner, under a comprehensive strategic partnership pact. Recent cooperation agreements were signed in September 2018 during a heads of state summit. During the 2018 Forum on China-Africa Cooperation summit in Beijing, China agreed to provide $10 billion in financing for South Africa, in addition to $14.7 billion pledged during the BRICS summit. This funding will support South African economic stimulus efforts. China has provided financing to South Africa for economic stimulus and development projects. The terms of the deal have not been disclosed, leading to concerns from the opposition party about increasing indebtedness to China. Other business transactions between China and South Africa include investments in a special economic zone and a potential purchase of assets by a Chinese oil and gas company. Chinese investments in South Africa have exceeded $25 billion, with Beijing Automotive International Corp. investing $759 million in a vehicle-production facility. South Africa has cordial relations with Middle East countries like Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. Reports suggest that Saudi Arabia and the UAE may invest $10 billion each in South Africa, potentially targeting the Denel arms manufacturing SOE. South Africa has exported arms to these countries, with reports of their use in the Yemen war, raising concerns about human rights violations. Closer relations with Riyadh may impact South Africa's ties with Iran and its role as a mediator between Iran and Saudi Arabia in the Yemen war. President Ramaphosa is addressing corruption and economic issues from the Zuma era through inquiries and reforms in SOEs. The success of these efforts depends on improved public sector performance, successful prosecutions, and regulatory reforms. President Ramaphosa faces political challenges in prosecuting guilty parties, implementing reforms, and balancing pressures from various factions. His ability to pursue policy reforms depends on the outcome of the May 2019 elections and his influence within the ANC. Reversing economic stagnation will be difficult, despite progress in attracting investments and initiating reforms. South Africa's economy faces structural challenges, but there is potential for growth if the large pool of unemployed can be integrated. Positive economic progress could lead to increased international trade, including with the United States. However, potential U.S. trade restrictions could hinder growth. South Africa is well positioned to be a key U.S. investment and export destination in Africa. South Africa's potential for growth in international trade and investment ties with the U.S. is supported by ongoing government and private sector efforts. Cooperation in development and infrastructure projects, such as the Power Africa program, could address challenges in South Africa's electrical sector. Despite occasional strains in relations, South Africa's strategic partnership with the U.S. under programs like Feed the Future and TAP, as well as its membership on the U.N. Security Council, could pave the way for further collaboration. Membership on the U.N. Security Council could serve as a platform for increased bilateral cooperation on international issues of mutual interest."
