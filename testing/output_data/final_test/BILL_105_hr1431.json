    "content": "The Act may be cited as the \"European Security Act of 1997\". It includes statements of policy. The Congress declares the policy of the United States regarding NATO enlargement, stating that emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe should not be the last countries invited to join NATO. The US should ensure that all other emerging democracies in the region will be considered for NATO membership once they meet the criteria outlined in the NATO Participation Act of 1994. Policy regarding NATO enlargement should emphasize the defensive nature of the Alliance and enhance security for all countries in Europe, including Russia. The United States and NATO Allies should clarify this intention in negotiations for the NATO-Russia Charter and adaptation of the CFE Treaty. It is crucial to demonstrate NATO's defensive and security-enhancing intentions to Russia without compromising US security interests or NATO's effectiveness as a defensive alliance. No commitments should jeopardize these priorities. No commitments should be made that would jeopardize NATO's defensive nature and security priorities, including extending different rights to new members, limiting NATO's ability to defend new members' territory, or giving authority to non-NATO entities to impede NATO actions. The NATO-Russia Charter should include commitments from the Russian Federation to demarcate all its borders with neighboring states and to station its armed forces on their own territory to enhance security and stability in Europe. The United States should engage in close consultations with NATO allies, Central and Eastern European democracies, Ukraine, and Caucasus states during negotiations on the adaptation of the CFE Treaty. Additionally, the US should proceed with ballistic missile defense cooperation efforts with Russia. The United States and its NATO allies should cooperate with Russia on missile defense, including early warning and technical aspects. Congress should promote this cooperation while maintaining its constitutional prerogatives on arms control agreements related to missile defense with Russia. AUTHORITIES RELATING TO NATO ENLARGEMENT.
