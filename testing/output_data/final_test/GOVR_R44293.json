    "content": "An endowment fund for a college or university is an investment fund used to cover operational costs, capital expenditures, special projects, or for reinvestment. It may include hundreds of individual funds from donors with various restrictions on spending. Endowment funds for colleges and universities can be true endowments, term endowments, or quasi-endowments. In 2017, $255.3 billion (45%) was in true endowments, $135.4 billion (24%) in quasi-endowments, and $12.3 billion (2%) in term endowments. Endowments are tax-exempt for specific reasons. The term endowment balance was $12.3 billion (2%) and is tax-exempt for universities as 501(c)(3) organizations or government entities. Contributions to 501(c)(3)s and government entities are generally tax deductible. Endowments' tax-exempt status allows for tax-free investment earnings. The 501(c)(3) status of colleges and universities is for charitable and educational purposes. If endowment returns were taxed at 35%, the estimated revenue gain would be $15.3 billion. If colleges and universities were taxed at 35%, the revenue gain is estimated at $15.3 billion; at a 21% rate, the amount would be $9.9 billion. Private universities and colleges subject to a tax would gain $10.4 billion at 35% and $6.4 billion at 21%, with public institutions responsible for 32% of assets. This can be compared with other tax provisions benefiting educational institutions, such as charitable contributions deduction reducing revenues by $10.5 billion, private activity tax-exempt bonds at $3.8 billion, and general obligation tax-exempt bonds benefiting public institutions. The tax on net investment income for certain private colleges and universities is estimated to be around $1.4 billion, with benefits totaling approximately $15.7 billion. This tax, imposed annually beginning in 2018, applies to institutions meeting specific criteria, including having at least 500 tuition-paying full-time equivalent students and assets of a certain threshold. The value of these provisions is expected to decrease under new tax rules. The new provision under IRC Section 4968 imposes a tax on applicable educational institutions with assets of at least $500,000 per student. The IRS is yet to release guidance on this excise tax, and the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated its impact to be significant. The excise tax under IRC Section 4968 applies to private colleges and universities with endowments of at least $500,000 per student. The tax is estimated to raise $1.8 billion over the 2018-2027 budget window, with an annual revenue of about $0.2 billion. Unlike private foundations, college endowments are not subject to a payout requirement. Private foundations are required to distribute 5% of their fund annually under IRC Section 4942 and are subject to a 2% excise tax on net investment income. The tax rate can be reduced to 1% if qualifying distributions exceed a historical average. The purpose of the tax is for private foundations to share in the cost of government oversight, but the revenues go to the general fund. Data on endowment balances can be obtained from sources like the U.S. Department of Education. The National Association of College and University Business Officers (NACUBO) gathers endowment data from numerous public and private colleges and universities. In FY2017, 809 institutions reported $566.8 billion in endowment assets. The Internal Revenue Service collects data on endowments of 501(c)(3) higher education institutions, with 1,782 institutions reporting $390.2 billion in endowment funds. The IRS data for 1,782 501(c)(3) higher education institutions in 2014 reported $390.2 billion in endowment assets. Endowment values reported in the NACUBO survey closely track Department of Education data. Endowment balances have increased substantially since the early 1990s, reaching $565.9 billion in 2015. fluctuations in balances have been observed over time. The NACUBO survey reported endowment assets of $566.8 billion for 2017, with the top 120 institutions holding around 75% of the total. Endowment values decreased during the 2007-2008 financial crisis but recovered to $565.9 billion in 2015. In 2017, NACUBO data showed total endowment assets of $566.8 billion, with 12% of institutions holding 75% of endowments. Private nonprofit universities had 68% of endowments. 31 private colleges had endowments of at least $500,000 per student. Harvard University had the largest endowment of over $36.0 billion in FY2017. In FY2017, Harvard University had the largest endowment totaling over $36.0 billion, with a per-student endowment of $1.5 million. The top five institutions with endowment assets of $15.0 million or more and per-student endowment of at least $1.3 million were Harvard, Yale, Stanford, Princeton, and MIT. Harvard held 6.4% of all reported endowment assets, followed by Yale with 4.8% and Princeton with 4.2%. Endowment assets are concentrated in private doctoral-granting universities, with an average endowment per student of $360,787. Public doctoral-granting universities had a significantly lower average endowment per student of $27,092. The average annual effective spending rate from endowment funds has fluctuated within a one-percentage-point band since 1998, with a period high of 5.1% in 2003 and a period low of 4.2% in 2012. In 2017, the average payout rate was 4.4%. Colleges and universities may deviate from predetermined spending policies, especially during financial crises like the 2008-2009 recession. NACUBO publishes data on average annual effective spending rates from endowment funds. In 2017, the average payout rate was 4.4%, with private institutions having a higher rate of 4.6% compared to public institutions at 4.1%. Endowment size also influenced payout rates, with larger endowments above $1 billion having an average rate of 4.8%. IRS data from 2014 showed an average payout rate of 4.3% for 501(c)(3) institutions, with larger endowments having rates between 3.8% and 4.9%. In 2014, payout rates varied across institutions based on endowment size. Trends showed a decrease in payout rates from 2003 to 2008, followed by an increase from 2008 to 2011. Institutions with larger endowments had higher average payout rates compared to those with smaller endowments. During and after the Great Recession, institutions with larger endowments increased payout rates, while those with smaller endowments saw a decline. Payout rates for all institutions have now converged around 4.4%, with strong returns on invested endowment assets in recent years. In FY2017, endowment assets earned a return of 12.2% on average, resulting in income of $64 billion. Returns fluctuate over time, with some years showing negative returns. Larger endowments tend to earn higher returns, especially when looking at longer periods. Institutions with larger endowments also have a higher share of assets invested in alternative strategies like hedge funds and private equity. Institutions with larger endowments tend to have a higher share of assets invested in alternative strategies like hedge funds and private equity. There has been a shift in where endowment assets are invested in recent years, with a decline in equities and fixed income investments, and an increase in alternative strategies. The share of endowment assets invested in alternative strategies, such as hedge funds and private equity, increased from 20% in 2002 to 51% in 2009, and was 52% in 2017. Research suggests that competition and higher background income drive institutions to invest more in alternative assets. The use of offshore \"blocker\" corporations to avoid UBIT on hedge fund investments has raised concerns among policymakers. Policy options related to the tax treatment of endowments may depend on the overarching policy objective, such as encouraging specific use of endowment funds or generating federal revenue. Policy options for the tax treatment of endowments include maintaining current-law tax treatment, repealing the 1.4% excise tax on private college and university endowments, reducing or eliminating the tax for specific situations like financial aid allocation or meeting payout objectives, and requiring increased reporting on endowment funds. Options to modify the tax on private college and university endowments include expanding the tax to more institutions, changing the cut-off points, or making the tax more punitive. Representative Reed has proposed requiring institutions with over $1 billion in endowment assets to use a portion of investment gains to reduce costs for lower- and middle-income students, with a tax penalty for those not meeting the target. The Tax Reform Act of 2014 proposed a flat excise tax for foundations and extended it to net investment earnings of private universities and colleges. The 2017 tax revision imposed a 1.4% tax on net investment returns of private college and university endowments with endowments over $500,000 per student. Some policymakers suggest requiring endowments to pay out a minimum amount annually to prevent excessive accumulation. Some policymakers propose a minimum annual payout requirement for college and university endowments to prevent excessive accumulation of funds. This could involve a 5% payout rate, similar to private foundations, to make college education more affordable. Various policy design choices could be considered, such as setting a threshold for endowments subject to the requirement. Some policymakers suggest imposing a minimum annual payout requirement on college and university endowments to prevent excessive accumulation of funds. This could be tied to investment earnings, tuition levels, or metrics on student need. Various policy design choices, such as setting a threshold for endowments subject to the requirement, could complicate the decision-making process. Opponents argue against imposing payout requirements on endowments above a certain level, raising questions about which measure of students should be used. Opponents of a payout requirement for endowments argue that it may be misguided and criticize different policy options. Institutions with larger endowments tend to offer more financial aid and have higher average payouts. Imposing a 5% payout rate on all institutions regardless of endowment size could burden smaller institutions. Some question if the 5% rate is suitable for endowments, as operating foundations often have lower payout rates. There are concerns about the impact of imposing a payout requirement. One concern raised by university representatives is restrictions on endowments imposed by donors, with 90% of new gifts in FY2014 being restricted for specific purposes. This could potentially limit institutions from exceeding a required payout rate. Restrictions on endowments imposed by donors could limit institutions from exceeding a required payout rate. Payouts might come from quasi-endowments rather than donor-restricted funds. In 2017, 24% of endowment funds were held in quasi-endowments. It is unclear how a payout requirement might affect institutions with a higher proportion of restricted endowment funds. Restrictions on purposes are unlikely to constrain increased payouts. Increased payouts from endowments can be constrained by specific purposes and legal restrictions on donations. Legislation may require a \"safe harbor\" for colleges and universities to meet payout requirements without violating restrictions. Protections against asset value fluctuations could involve minimum payout averages or imposing taxes on endowment values. One option to increase federal revenues is to impose a tax on endowments or endowment earnings. This tax could be applied based on endowment size or institutions with significant endowments that have raised tuition above inflation rates. The tax rate could be similar to the current 21% rate imposed on tax-exempt entities for unrelated business income. The generated revenues could be used for student aid or other purposes. A tax on endowments could impact universities' spending behavior, as it may make saving through endowments more expensive due to lower after-tax returns. Donors can claim charitable deductions for contributions to endowments, even if the funds are not immediately used for charitable purposes. Limiting the charitable deduction for gifts related to endowments could alter incentives for donations. Limiting the charitable deduction for gifts to endowments could reduce the tax incentive for contributions, leading to a potential decrease in overall donations. One approach could be to base the deduction on when the contribution is expected to be spent, considering inflation. Another option is to provide an enhanced deduction for certain types of gifts. Some concerns have been raised about the use of offshore blocker corporations to avoid UBIT and the disparate tax treatment between domestic and offshore investments. There are also worries about the incentive to borrow to increase endowment levels, potentially leading to spending cutbacks in a downturn. In 2007, a bill was introduced to address these tax treatment disparities. In 2007, Rangel introduced bill H.R. 3970 to address tax treatment disparities between domestic and offshore investments by exempting partnership income from UBIT. A draft proposal in 2008 suggested disallowing offshore blocker corporations and expanding UBIT rules. In 2016, Senate and House Committees sent a letter to colleges and universities regarding tax issues. The Chairman of the Ways and Means Oversight Subcommittee requested information from colleges and universities about their endowments, including spending on financial aid, administrative expenses, types of endowments held, and real property holdings. Policymakers may consider modifying IRS Form 990 to collect additional information on endowment funds. The Chairman of the Ways and Means Oversight Subcommittee requested information from colleges and universities about their endowments, including spending on financial aid, administrative expenses, types of endowments held, and real property holdings. Collecting additional information on college and university endowments could increase transparency for policymakers, but there is a potential trade-off with increased administrative burden. Endowment data reported to the IRS by 501(c)(3) institutions is available on Schedule D of IRS Form 990 informational returns, with the most recent data from 2014. Public universities and colleges are not required to file 990s, so information on their endowments is not included in the IRS data. The IRS collects data on endowment balances, contributions, investment earnings, grants, scholarships, expenditures, and administrative expenses from higher education institutions. In 2014, $11.3 billion in contributions were reported to 501(c)(3) higher education endowments, representing 3.0% of total endowments. In 2014, $11.3 billion in contributions were reported to 501(c)(3) higher education endowments, representing 3.0% of total endowments. Net investment earnings on endowment funds were $20.3 billion in 2012, or 5.4% of total endowment funds. Endowment spending in 2014 included $12.0 billion for facilities and programs, $4.2 billion for grants and scholarships, and $1.0 billion for administrative costs. Payout rates can be calculated using data reported by universities and colleges on their IRS Form 990. The distribution of payout rates for 501(c)(3) higher education institutions shows that median payouts are higher for institutions with larger endowments. Payout rates are more concentrated for larger institutions, with a greater difference between the 25th and 50th percentile for smaller endowments. The top 100 U.S. college and university endowments, including Harvard University with the largest endowment of $36.0 billion, are listed in Table B-1. The top 100 U.S. college and university endowments, including Harvard University with the largest endowment of $36.0 billion, are listed in Table B-1. Yale University holds the second-largest endowment at $27.2 billion, accounting for 4.8% of all endowment assets. The top 25 private institutions ranked by endowment assets per student are included in Table C-1."
