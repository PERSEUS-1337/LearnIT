    "content": "The people of the State of California enact the following. Section 803 of the Penal Code in California is amended to state that the limitation of time for prosecution is not extended unless specified. Time during which prosecution is pending does not count towards the time limit. The limitation period starts upon the discovery of certain offenses, such as fraud, theft from elders, or misconduct by a public official. The Penal Code in California lists various offenses that can lead to prosecution, including grand theft, forgery, bribery by public officials, fraud, and violations of specific code sections related to different industries. Violations of specific sections of the Health and Safety Code, Section 529a, and Section 368 can lead to prosecution, even if the defendant is out of state at the time of the offense. A time limitation for offenses does not start until the offense is discovered or could have reasonably been discovered. This applies to offenses under specific sections of the Water Code, Health and Safety Code, Business and Professions Code, and other divisions. A criminal complaint may be filed within one year of a report to a California law enforcement agency by a person alleging they were a victim of certain crimes while under 18 years of age. This applies if the specified limitation period has expired and the crime involved substantial sexual conduct. Independent evidence must clearly and convincingly corroborate a victim's allegation, especially if the victim was 21 or older at the time of the report. This evidence cannot include mental health professionals' opinions and cannot be inadmissible during trial. In criminal investigations of crimes against children, the limitations period is tolled from the initiation of litigation challenging a grand jury subpoena until the final disclosure of evidence to the prosecuting agency. (g) (1) A criminal complaint may be filed within one year of suspect identification through DNA testing for certain crimes listed in Section 290, with specific deadlines for DNA analysis based on the date of the offense. For certain crimes listed in Section 290, a criminal complaint may be filed within one year of suspect identification through DNA testing. The time limitation for prosecuting crimes where evidence was seized under a warrant but is unavailable to the prosecuting authority is tolled until final disclosure of the evidence. This does not affect any evidentiary privilege or attorney work product. A criminal complaint may be filed within one year of discovering a hidden recording related to certain violations. If a person flees the scene of an accident causing death or serious injury, a complaint may be filed within one year of suspect identification by law enforcement, but no later than six years after the offense. (k) If a person flees the scene of an accident, a criminal complaint may be filed within one year of suspect identification by law enforcement, or within six years of the offense, whichever is later. (l) The time limitation for offenses involving bribery to a public official does not start until the offense is discovered."
