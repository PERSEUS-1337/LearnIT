Agencies are required to conduct periodic reviews of rules with significant privacy impact on individuals. The agency must determine if rules can be amended or rescinded to minimize impact while complying with statutes.

Each year, agencies must publish a list of rules to be reviewed the following year, including a brief description, need, and legal basis for each rule, inviting public comment. Individuals affected by final agency action can seek judicial review of compliance with specific requirements. Each court with jurisdiction to review a rule for compliance with section 553 can also review claims of noncompliance with specific subsections. Individuals have one year from the date of final agency action to seek judicial review, unless a shorter period is required by law. In cases where an agency delays issuing a final privacy impact assessment, judicial review must be filed within 1 year of the assessment being made public or as specified by relevant laws. Relief can be granted in actions under this subsection. In actions under this subsection, the court can order the agency to take corrective action, such as remanding the rule and deferring enforcement unless it's in the public interest. This subsection does not limit the court's authority to stay the effective date of a rule or grant additional relief in a judicial review of a rule.
