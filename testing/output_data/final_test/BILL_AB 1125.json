    "content": "The State of California enacts the following. Section 4535.2 of the Government Code is amended to set a maximum preference and incentive of 15 percent for bidders, with a cap of $50,000 for any bid and $100,000 for combined preferences and incentives. If the 15-percent limit exceeds $100,000, the latter amount applies. The bid limit is $100,000, but if preferences or incentives are included, the total cannot exceed $150,000. Small business bidders qualified under Section 14838 have precedence over nonsmall business bidders, ensuring that the application of any bidder preference does not deny the award to a small business bidder. This applies when the small business bidder is the lowest responsible bidder or eligible for the 5-percent small business bidder preference and incentive. Section 14838 of the Government Code is amended to facilitate small business participation in state contracts for goods, services, and construction of state facilities. Directors of state agencies must establish goals for small business involvement in these contracts. The amendment to Section 14838 of the Government Code provides for small business preference in the award of state contracts for goods, information technology, services, and construction. Small businesses and microbusinesses are given a 5 percent preference in contracts awarded to the lowest responsible bidder meeting specifications. Nonsmall businesses that include small business or microbusiness subcontractor participation can also receive a preference of up to 5 percent. In solicitations, small businesses and microbusinesses receive a 5 percent preference in awarding contracts based on evaluation factors. Nonsmall businesses can also receive up to a 5 percent preference if they include small business or microbusiness subcontractor participation. These preferences cannot be awarded to noncompliant bidders or used to meet minimum requirements. The preference for small businesses and microbusinesses in contract awards is capped at $100,000, with a combined limit of $150,000 from all provisions. Special considerations include reducing experience and inventory requirements, as well as providing assistance in submitting required information. Under Section 10163 of the Public Contract Code, awards should be given to small business and microbusiness bidders whenever possible. This can be achieved by breaking down major projects into smaller subprojects to allow these contractors to qualify for bidding. Small business and microbusiness bidders have precedence over nonsmall business bidders. In case of a tie between a small business or microbusiness bidder and a disabled veteran-owned small business or microbusiness bidder, the contract will be awarded to the disabled veteran-owned small business or microbusiness. This provision applies even if the small business or microbusiness bidder is the lowest responsible bidder. The small business and microbusiness bidder preference grants eligibility for an award. Section 42893 of the Public Resources Code is amended to limit the recycled tire product preference to $50,000 to ensure small businesses have a fair chance at receiving awards. The bid preference limit is $150,000 when combined with other incentives, exceeding the $100,000 and $50,000 limits in subdivisions (a) and (b) respectively."
