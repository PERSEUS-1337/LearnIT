The Industry and Analysis unit advances U.S. industries' competitiveness through trade and investment policies, export promotion, and market access improvement for businesses. The federal government supports small and medium-sized enterprises through programs like the Market Development Cooperator Program. In FY2020, the Administration proposed increasing funding for the Industry and Analysis unit by $10.0 million (19.1%) compared to the previous year.

ITA's Office of China Compliance, established in 2004, enforces U.S. AD/CVD laws and counters unfair trade practices in China.
