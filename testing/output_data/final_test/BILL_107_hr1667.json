    "content": "The Act is titled the \"National Beverage Container Reuse and Recycling Act of 2001\". It includes findings related to beverage container recycling. Congress finds that the failure to reuse and recycle empty beverage containers wastes national energy and resources, contributes to littering, increases solid waste, and makes it challenging for local communities to sustain recycling programs. The reuse and recycling of empty beverage containers can help reduce burdens on individuals, governments, and the environment by conserving energy and resources. State laws with refund values on beverage containers have been effective in promoting resource recovery and reducing financial burdens on communities. A national system for refunding beverage containers would incentivize individuals to clean up the environment, promote reuse and recycling, reduce solid waste management costs, and conserve energy and resources. Unclaimed refunds could fund comprehensive recycling programs nationwide. Recycling beverage containers creates sustainable business and employment, aligning with the Solid Waste Disposal Act. Subtitle K--Beverage Container Recycling is added to the Solid Waste Disposal Act, including definitions in Section 12001. The term 'beverage' includes various liquid drinks for human consumption. A 'beverage container' is a sealed container made of metal, glass, or plastic with a capacity of up to 1 gallon. A 'beverage distributor' sells beverages in containers for resale in interstate commerce. A 'beverage retailer' is defined as a person who sells beverages in containers to consumers. The term 'consumer' refers to a person who buys a beverage container for personal use, not for resale. The Administrator will establish regulations for defining 'beverage retailer' in cases involving beverage vending machines. The term 'refund value' refers to the specified amount for a beverage container under section 12002. An 'unbroken beverage container' includes containers opened as designed and compressed metal or plastic containers with readable refund value statements. A 'wine cooler' is a drink with less than 7% alcohol by volume, consisting of wine, water, and a non-alcoholic beverage. A non-alcoholic beverage container may contain flavoring, coloring, fruit juice, sugar, carbon dioxide, or preservatives. Required beverage container labeling is mandated by SEC. 12002. SEC. 12007 prohibits selling beverages in containers without a clear 10-cent refund value statement. The Administrator will set standards for the statement's size and location. Adjustments to the refund value will be made after 10 years. The Administrator will adjust the refund value every 10 years based on changes in the Consumer Price Index, rounding to the nearest 5 cent increment. SEC. 12003 outlines the collection of refund value from retailers by distributors and from consumers by retailers for beverage containers sold in interstate commerce. No person other than those specified may collect a deposit on a beverage container. The legislation requires retailers to promptly refund the deposit value on empty beverage containers returned by consumers. Distributors must also pay consumers the refund value plus an additional 2 cents per container for returned items of the same brand, kind, and size. The legislation mandates retailers to refund the deposit value on returned beverage containers. Distributors must pay consumers the refund value plus an extra 2 cents per container. Agreements can be made for centralized collection centers and crushing or bundling of containers. \"Legislation requires retailers to refund deposit value on returned beverage containers, distributors must pay consumers refund value plus 2 cents per container. Agreements can be made for centralized collection centers and container processing.\" Unclaimed refunds from beverage distributors are paid to states at the end of each year. States can use these funds for pollution prevention and recycling programs. If a distributor pays more refunds than the total refund value of containers sold, it is considered excess. If a distributor pays more refunds than the total value of containers sold, the excess amount can be credited for the following year's payment to the state. SEC. 12006 prohibits detachable openings on metal beverage containers and post-redemption disposal of labeled containers in landfills. SEC. 12007 provides exemptions for certain states. Exemptions from certain requirements are granted to states that have implemented similar beverage container regulations or achieved an 80 percent recycling rate. If a State fails to maintain an 80 percent recycling or reuse rate of beverage containers, certain regulations will apply until a subsequent determination is made. States imposing a tax on beverage containers cannot tax the refund value. This does not affect the authority of States or political subdivisions. The authority of any State or political subdivision is limited regarding laws on refund values for containers other than beverage containers and regulation of redemption centers for empty beverage containers. SEC. 12008 imposes civil penalties for violations of specific sections, with fines ranging from $1,000 to $10,000 per violation. SEC. 12009 requires the Administrator to establish regulations within a year, and SEC. 12010 states the effective date of the subtitle, except for SEC. 12009. The table of contents is amended to include \"Subtitle K--Beverage Container Recycling.\" Subtitle K--Beverage Container Recycling includes definitions, required labeling, collection of refund value, return of refund value, accounting for unclaimed refunds, prohibitions on disposal, exempted States, penalties, and regulations. Effective date is specified in Sec. 12010."
