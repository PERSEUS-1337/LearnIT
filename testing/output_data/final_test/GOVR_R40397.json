    "content": "Child nutrition programs and the WIC program provide assistance under federal laws including the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act, the Child Nutrition Act, and Section 32 of the Act of August 24, 1935. The Food and Nutrition Service administers the programs at the federal level, with funding included in Agriculture Department appropriations laws. Congressional jurisdiction is held by specific committees in the Senate and House. The House Agriculture Committee periodically reviews and reauthorizes federal laws related to commodity assistance and Section 32 issues. Child nutrition and WIC programs are operated by various local providers with varying degrees of state involvement. State agencies have control in the WIC program, while local educational agencies and school food authorities play a major role in school meal programs. At the state level, education, health, social services, and agriculture departments are involved. At the state level, education, health, social services, and agriculture departments oversee local providers for programs benefiting millions of children, infants, pregnant women, and post-partum women. These programs operate in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. WIC-like benefits are available in Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands, with no restrictions on eligibility. Federal aid for meal service programs includes subsidies for meals/snacks that meet nutrition guidelines, with most subsidies in cash payments and some in federally donated food commodities. Free or reduced-price meals are provided to lower-income children. Providers who serve free or reduced-price meals to lower-income children receive higher subsidies. Federal meal/snack subsidy rates are adjusted annually for inflation, but do not cover the full cost of meals. States and localities contribute to cover program costs, along with families paying charges for non-free or reduced-price meals. Required nonfederal cost sharing is minimal, with states needing to spend at least $200 million annually to receive federal school lunch funds. Federal subsidies may cover providers' administrative/operating costs, with limited direct federal payments for administrative/operating costs. Costs for child nutrition programs are limited to expense grants for state oversight agencies, funds for state audits of child care sponsors, and special administrative payments to sponsors of summer programs and family day care homes. Federal appropriations cover tailored food packages and administrative/nutrition services under the WIC program. Additional information can be found in relevant CRS reports and on the Agriculture Department's Food and Nutrition Service website. The School Lunch and School Breakfast programs provide federal support for meals meeting nutrition standards for low-income children. Meals are served by schools and child care institutions, with subsidies for eligible meals. Free meals are available for children below 130% of the federal poverty guidelines. Children may receive free, reduced-price, or full-price meals based on their family income. Free meals are for those below 130% of the federal poverty guidelines, reduced-price meals are for those between 130% and 185% of the guidelines, and full-price meals are for those who do not qualify for free or reduced-price meals. The School Lunch Program provides subsidized lunches to children in schools and RCCIs. In FY2007, 30.5 million students participated, with 49% receiving free lunches and 10% receiving reduced-price lunches. Over 90% of federal funding goes towards subsidizing meals for low-income children. In FY2007, federal school lunch costs totaled $8.7 billion, with 30.5 million students participating in the School Lunch Program. The School Breakfast program served 1.7 billion breakfasts in 80,000 schools, with 10.1 million children participating daily. 70% received free meals, and 10% purchased reduced price meals. In FY2007, federal school breakfast funding totaled about $2.2 billion, with meals priced at $1.40 and $1.10 for free and reduced price breakfasts. Participating schools receive federal cash subsidies and donations of food commodities. The value of federal commodity aid to schools has exceeded $1 billion annually, with at least 12% of aid required to be in commodities. Cash and commodity support is based on the number and type of meals served. The WIC Program provides food assistance, nutrition risk screening, and related services to low-income pregnant and postpartum women, infants, and children up to age 5 from low-income families. Participants must have family income at or below 185% of poverty and be judged to be nutritionally at risk. Most income-eligible applicants meet the program's nutrition risk criteria. The WIC Program provides monthly vouchers for specific food items to income-eligible beneficiaries based on nutrition risk criteria. The range of permissible food items includes milk, cheese, eggs, infant formula, cereals, fruit or vegetable juices, and fresh fruits and vegetables, tailored by recipient category. Administering state agencies have some flexibility in implementing federal standards. The WIC Program provides monthly vouchers for specific food items to income-eligible beneficiaries based on nutrition risk criteria. Recipients must also receive nutrition education, breast-feeding support, and may receive other services like referral to medical care providers. The federal cost of providing WIC benefits varies depending on recipient category, prescribed foods, retail prices, and administrative expenses. States can gain rebates from infant formula manufacturers to help with cost containment strategies. The WIC Program provides monthly vouchers for specific food items to income-eligible beneficiaries based on nutrition risk criteria. Recipients must also receive nutrition education, breast-feeding support, and may receive other services like referral to medical care providers. States can gain rebates from infant formula manufacturers to help with cost containment strategies, totaling over $1.8 billion a year nationwide. The program has categorical, income, and nutrition risk requirements for eligibility, with an average federal cost of $39 a month per participant in FY2007. To qualify for the WIC Program, individuals must have family income below 185% of the federal poverty guidelines and may also be eligible if they receive TANF, SNAP benefits, or Medicaid assistance. In 2006, 60% of WIC enrollees had income below the poverty guidelines. Participants receive benefits for a specified period and may need to be recertified. The WIC program is federally funded and administered by state and local health agencies. It is not an entitlement program and participation is limited by funding. Pregnant women can receive benefits throughout pregnancy and up to 6-12 months after childbirth. In FY2007, federal spending for the WIC program was $5.4 billion, serving 8.3 million women, infants, and children. The program includes special vouchers for fruits and vegetables, and a separate farmers' market nutrition program funded by Agriculture Department appropriations. Table 3 summarizes WIC participation and federal spending, with food costs making up over 70% of the total. Child nutrition laws provide federal subsidies and commodity support for schools and institutions offering meals to children in outside-of-school settings. Assistance is available for various types of institutions, including day care centers and programs for chronically impaired adults and elderly persons. Federal support for day care, summer, and outside-of-school meal/snack programs totaled $2.5 billion in funding for FY2007, with over 5 million children and 100,000 adults participating. The majority of assistance for meals and snacks in outside-of-school settings is provided through the CACFP, which subsidizes meals in nonresidential child care centers, family day care homes, adult day care centers, and after-school programs. The CACFP provides federal payments for meals and snacks served in participating centers or homes, with subsidies based on the number of meals served and per-meal rates. Meals must meet federal nutrition standards and providers must meet licensing requirements. Subsidies are available for children age 12 or under, migrant children age 15 or under, handicapped children of any age, and chronically impaired adults in care centers. The CACFP provides federal payments for meals and snacks served in centers or homes for children age 12 or under, migrant children age 15 or under, handicapped children, and chronically impaired adults. Payments are distributed directly or through sponsors to child/adult care centers, including public or private nonprofit centers, Head Start centers, for-profit centers meeting low-income enrollment requirements, and shelters for homeless families. Adult day care centers also receive subsidies if they meet specific requirements. In FY2007, 48,000 child care centers and 2,500 adult care centers participated in the CACFP, serving a total of 2.2 million children and 105,000 adults daily. Centers receive subsidies for meals and snacks that meet federal nutrition standards, with varying subsidy rates based on family income. Subsidies are indexed annually for inflation and evaluated periodically. Subsidies for meals and snacks in the CACFP are evaluated periodically. The largest subsidies are for children with family income below 130% of the federal poverty guidelines. Smaller subsidies are available for children with family income between 130% and 185% of the poverty guidelines, as well as for children who do not qualify for free or reduced-price meals. Independent centers must cover administrative costs with non-federal funds. Federal commodity assistance valued at 21 cents a meal is available for CACFP centers and day care homes. Day care homes serve 5-10 children on average, with 30% of CACFP children served through homes. In FY2007, 143,000 home sites received subsidies. Payments to day care homes cover no more than two meals and one snack per child. Day care homes under CACFP must have a public or private nonprofit sponsor with 100+ homes. Sponsors receive monthly payments based on the number of homes. Homes receive cash subsidies based on two indexed rates, with Tier I homes in low-income areas receiving higher subsidies. Tier II homes receive smaller subsidies. Federal subsidies for day care centers vary based on family income, with Tier I providers in low-income areas receiving higher subsidies. Tier II providers receive smaller subsidies but can seek Tier I rates for individual low-income children. Centers can adjust tuition to account for federal payments and charge separately for meals/snacks, with limitations for children meeting income tests. Family day care homes also receive federal subsidies, with adjustments to tuition allowed. The CACFP does not regulate tuition fees directly. In FY2007, the CACFP provided $2.1 billion in cash subsidies for meal costs and $77 million worth of commodities, along with $137 million for sponsors' administrative costs. The Summer Food Service program offers cash subsidies for meals or snacks served by local public and private nonprofit institutions during summer youth programs. Sponsors in the National Youth Sports program, including schools, local governments, camps, colleges, universities, and private nonprofit organizations like churches, can be approved for three types of summer programs: \"open\" sites in lower-income areas, \"enrolled\" sites with eligible children, and summer camps. Summer sponsors receive operating cost subsidies for providing free meals/snacks to children in these programs. Sponsors in the National Youth Sports program receive subsidies for providing meals and snacks to children in summer programs. Payments cover meals, administrative costs, and health inspections, with subsidies ranging from $3 for lunch/supper to 70 cents for snacks. In FY2007, 3,600 sponsors served 1.9 million children daily, totaling about $300 million in program costs. Federal assistance for snacks and meals in after-school programs is provided through the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) and the School Lunch program. The CACFP offers subsidies to sponsors for snacks served to at-risk children in lower-income areas, while schools can also operate after-school snack-only programs. All snacks and meals are generally served for free. Federal assistance for snacks and meals in after-school programs is provided through the Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) and the School Lunch program. The majority of after-school sites are operated by schools, with average daily participation of approximately 1.2 million children in FY2007. Spending on this assistance is included in the figures for the School Lunch program and the CACFP. States receive federal grants to cover administrative costs for child nutrition programs. Federal assistance for child nutrition programs covers administrative and oversight costs, amounting to about 1.5% of cash support. States receive grants based on their program spending, with additional funds allocated for specific initiatives like the CACFP and commodity distribution. In FY2007, state administrative expense funding exceeded $160 million, with states having flexibility in allocating these funds. Additionally, states receive grants for a Fresh Fruit and Vegetable program to support selected schools in purchasing and distributing fresh produce. The Fresh Fruit and Vegetable program provides funding for selected schools to distribute fresh produce to all students, regardless of family income. Funding is allocated based on a formula, with an emphasis on schools with a higher proportion of low-income children. The program received $40 million for the 2008-2009 school year, increasing to $150 million for the 2011-2012 school year and inflation-indexed for later years. Additionally, schools and institutions not participating in other federally subsidized meal programs are eligible to participate. The Special Milk program provides subsidized milk to kindergartners and pre-kindergartners without access to regular school meal programs. In FY2007, 90 million half-pints were subsidized at 15 cents each, with federal costs around $15 million annually. The program does not require free milk provision to needy children. The FNS conducts compliance evaluations through a $5 million-a-year coordinated review effort to improve management and identify problems. The Agriculture Department's Economic Research Service (ERS) and the FNS conduct nutrition research, studies, surveys, and program evaluations, totaling about $10 million a year. The Food Service Management Institute (FSMI) provides technical assistance, instruction, and materials related to nutrition and food service management, funded at $4 million a year. An information clearinghouse supports community-sponsored food assistance initiatives with funding of about $250,000 a year. Special FNS projects like \"Team Nutrition\" and food safety initiatives aim to help schools and providers with nutrition education materials and program integrity efforts. Efforts to improve meal service operations and meal quality in schools and other providers are funded at $15-$20 million a year to ensure federal support is spent correctly."
