    "content": "The Act titled \"Desalination Water Supply Shortage Prevention Act of 2005\" includes definitions for key terms. The \"Qualified Desalination Facility\" is defined as a facility owned by a State, Indian tribe, or corporation providing water services, producing desalinated water for sale with a source water greater than 1000 parts per million total dissolved solids, and first used commercially within a 10-year period after the enactment of the Act. The term \"Indian Tribe\" refers to federally recognized tribes in the contiguous 48 states and the Metlakatla Indian Community in Alaska. The term \"Secretary\" refers to the Secretary of Energy, and \"State\" includes several states and territories. SEC. 3. DESALINATED WATER PRODUCTION INCENTIVE PAYMENTS. The Secretary will provide incentive payments to owners or operators of qualified desalination facilities to offset energy costs. Payments require a written agreement by the end of fiscal year 2016 and can last up to 10 years, starting from the facility's first use and ending by September 30, 2026. Payments made by the Secretary to owners or operators of qualified desalination facilities will be based on the amount of desalinated water produced, at a rate of 62 cents per thousand gallons. Payments will be adjusted for inflation annually. The Secretary may not grant funds to owners or operators of qualified desalination facilities unless an application is submitted with required information. In any fiscal year, no more than 60 percent of funds will be available to facilities obtaining source water directly from the sea or estuary. Priority is given in awarding incentive payments. Priority is given to projects using innovative technologies to reduce energy demand, renewable energy supplies in desalination, regional water supply benefits, secure water sources for national defense, reducing water supply disruption risks, minimizing damage to marine life, and providing water quality benefits. Funding is subject to budget act compliance. Authorization of Appropriations: $200,000,000 authorized for the Secretary from fiscal year 2006 through fiscal year 2016. The Secretary will support research and development of new desalination technology for cost-effective water desalination. $10,000,000 is authorized for this purpose from fiscal year 2006 through fiscal year 2016."
