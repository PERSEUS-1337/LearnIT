    "content": "As a WTO member, the United States must adhere to rules governing domestic farm policy. Each member country has its own specific policy commitments outlined in a Country Schedule. U.S. agricultural sector heavily relies on trade, with exports contributing to 20% of total production. The U.S. farm policy is closely monitored for compliance with WTO rules and its impact on future multilateral negotiations. The 2014 farm bill made significant changes to U.S. farm policy, impacting compliance with WTO rules on domestic support programs and international market distortions. This report assumes knowledge of U.S. farm safety net programs and relevant WTO rules. The report examines U.S. farm safety net programs under the 2014 farm bill in relation to WTO commitments, focusing on compliance with the Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) and Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM). It highlights key parameters of farm support programs and potential violations of WTO spending limits. The United States must adhere to WTO spending limits outlined in the Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) to avoid market distortions and international trade disputes. The country is committed to spending no more than $19.1 billion annually on amber box programs, as specified in the AoA. Since 1995, the U.S. has remained within these limits, as shown in Figure 1. The United States has complied with WTO spending limits on domestic support, staying within its amber box limits. However, there have been years where judicious use of DM exemptions was necessary. Crop insurance premium subsidies were notified as non-product-specific support from 1995 to 2011, allowing for exemption under the DM exclusion. In 2012, the U.S. changed its notification status for crop insurance premium subsidies to product-specific support, with $11.8 billion in amber box outlays notified as \"product-specific.\" The United States reduced its U.S. amber box outlays subject to spending limits to $6.864 billion by excluding certain programs under the DM product-specific exemption. Market-distorting programs may face challenges under the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM) if they cause adverse market effects internationally. The \"Brazil cotton case\" highlighted the importance of complying with SCM rules, leading to substantial policy changes in U.S. farm bills to align programs with WTO regulations. The United States aligns farm programs with WTO regulations to comply with SCM rules, which may lead to challenges if market distortions occur. WTO dispute settlement panels review data to determine if subsidies incentivize overproduction and impact market prices or trade patterns. Subsidies found to be actionable must be withdrawn or altered. The United States aligns farm programs with WTO regulations to comply with SCM rules. WTO prohibited subsidies must be stopped or withdrawn promptly to minimize market distortions. Incentives based on farm activity levels can lead to overproduction and lower market prices. The United States aligns farm programs with WTO regulations to comply with SCM rules, aiming to minimize market distortions. New legislation may be necessary to make even minor changes to farm programs in case of a WTO violation. Policymakers evaluate existing and new farm programs based on their impact on U.S. commitments under the AoA and compliance with SCM rules. The Agricultural Act of 2014 reshaped U.S. commodity support programs, shifting support away from traditional methods. The 2014 farm bill terminated core farm safety net programs from the previous bill, including direct payments, counter-cyclical payment program, and ACRE and SURE programs. It retained the marketing loan program with adjustments for upland cotton and replaced CCP with Price Loss Coverage program. The 2014 farm bill replaced core farm safety net programs with new programs like Price Loss Coverage (PLC), Agricultural Risk Coverage (ARC), Supplemental Coverage Option (SCO), and Stacked Income Protection (STAX). It also introduced Dairy Margin Protection Program (DMPP) and Dairy Product Donation Program (DPDP) to replace previous dairy support programs. The evaluation of domestic support programs depends on perspective and is assessed by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) against a baseline of current farm law. The evaluation of domestic support programs by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) compares proposed program changes to current farm law. Savings from eliminating 2008 farm bill programs offset costs of new safety net programs. Different perspectives, like those of foreign producers, may view U.S. farm programs as providing unfair advantages in international markets. Evaluations may differ based on CBO's cost calculations versus WTO's rules for determining production and trade distortions.

Savings from eliminating 2008 farm bill programs offset costs of new safety net programs. Different perspectives, like those of foreign producers, may view U.S. farm programs as providing unfair advantages in international markets. Evaluations may differ based on CBO's cost calculations versus WTO's rules for determining production and trade distortions. In different evaluation outcomes for the same program change, direct payments (DPs) of the 2008 farm bill had a federal budget cost of about $5 billion annually, but from a WTO perspective they were fully decoupled and mostly non-market-distorting. Replacing DPs with a \"shallow-loss\" program coupled to market prices and current yields would represent a saving of $2 billion from CBO's perspective but an increase of $3 billion in market-distorting amber box from the WTO's perspective. The U.S. sugar program is required by statute to operate at \"no net cost\" to taxpayers, resulting in a budget score of zero, but the implicit price subsidy inherent in the tariff rate quota (TRQ) protection provided to U.S. sugar producers is valued at about $1.4 billion annually by the WTO. The 2014 farm bill is projected to reduce the federal budget deficit by $16.6 billion over 10 years, but may face challenges due to lower farm prices caused by record corn and soybean harvests in 2014. USDA reports a 46% decrease in corn prices and a 30% decrease in soybean prices compared to 2012/13 levels, impacting the new farm safety net parameters. The 2014 farm bill may face challenges due to lower farm prices caused by record corn and soybean harvests in 2014, impacting the new farm safety net parameters. The classification of new farm programs like ARC and PLC under the WTO is uncertain. The 2014 farm bill introduces new domestic support programs with payments limited to 85% of historical base. Assessment of their WTO classification and market effects is preliminary. Spending estimates for the first year will be available in late 2015, with final outlay estimates expected in early 2017. The programs are discussed in terms of potential market distortions and compliance with WTO rules, with green box programs being non-trade-distorting and not subject to spending limits. U.S. green box notifications have increased to $46 billion. The United States notifies a variety of domestic support programs as green-box-compliant, including conservation activities and food programs. The 2014 farm bill consolidated conservation programs, reauthorized nutrition assistance, and extended funding for USDA green box programs through FY2018. The main U.S. farm price and income support program in the green box is direct payments (DPs), with average annual notifications of nearly $5 billion from 1996 to 2012. DP outlays were fixed and decoupled from current market conditions, thus not influencing producer behavior. The green box in the United States includes direct payments (DPs) and crop insurance subsidy components. DPs were repealed by the 2014 farm bill, while crop insurance A&O expenses were $1.4 billion in 2012. The 2014 farm bill added expanded coverage options under the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP), which remains green box compliant. NAP payments have a limit of $125,000 per person. The green box in the United States includes direct payments (DPs) and crop insurance subsidy components. DPs were repealed by the 2014 farm bill, while crop insurance A&O expenses were $1.4 billion in 2012. The 2014 farm bill added expanded coverage options under the Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP), which remains green box compliant with an annual payment limit of $125,000 per person. Blue box programs are market-distorting but production-limiting, not subject to payment limits, and the United States has not notified any of its farm programs as blue box since 1995. The U.S. CCP program was supposed to be reclassified from amber box to blue box but this never happened due to the incomplete Doha Round of negotiations and the program's repeal by the 2014 farm bill. It is uncertain if the blue box designation could be applied to PLC and ARC outlays. PLC and ARC programs are similar to CCP and ACRE, with PLC providing payments when prices fall below a reference price without the need to plant the crop. The PLC and ARC programs do not require planting to receive payments, as producers declare historical base acres for program crops. Payments are made on historical base acres, not actual planted acres, and are triggered at the county level. These payments are decoupled from planted acreage and farm-level yield, but not from market prices. The blue box designation, with no spending limit, could potentially accommodate PLC and ARC payments, but notifying them as such may face international criticism. The notification of U.S. amber box outlays through 2011 included various product-specific and non-product-specific payments under different programs. In 2012, there was a potential shift in the notification process. In 2012, the United States reclassified federal crop insurance premium subsidies as product-specific support, impacting the notification process for U.S. amber box outlays. Price-deficiency and shallow-loss programs, which make up most non-exempted U.S. amber box spending, are counter-cyclical, with outlays highest during low commodity prices. The period of high market prices from 2006 to 2013 led to lower non-exempt U.S. amber box notifications. Crop insurance premium subsidies are positively correlated with market prices. The 2014 farm bill introduced expanded price and income support benefits, including a price deficiency payment program that triggers payments when market prices fall below a certain level. The program aims to support producer incomes during periods of low market prices. The bill extended the traditional nonrecourse marketing loan program (MLP) and introduced the new PLC program. These programs do not prevent market prices from reaching equilibrium but provide income support to producers when prices are below certain triggers. Under the 2014 farm bill, the Marketing Loan Program (MLP) supports crop prices at statutory loan rates through a nine-month nonrecourse loan program. Producers can choose to place their crops under a USDA marketing loan to avoid selling at low prices. If market prices remain below the loan rate, producers may forfeit the crop to USDA. MLP benefits are tied to actual production, making outlays dependent on market prices and planted acres. Participation in MLP does not require any fees or premiums, and payments are received without experiencing losses. The Marketing Loan Program (MLP) operates like a price-deficiency payment, using fixed loan rates to establish a floor price for qualifying program crops. Producers receive benefits when market prices fall below the loan rate, including loan deficiency payments and marketing loan gains. The 2014 farm bill made adjustments to the loan rate for upland cotton to address market distortions identified by the WTO cotton-case panel. The 2014 farm bill adjusted the loan rate for upland cotton, lowering it to a range of $0.52/lb to $0.45/lb. The PLC program uses fixed reference prices to determine deficiency payments for program crops. Lawmakers set support prices above trigger prices in the bill. The 2014 farm bill adjusted reference prices for program crops well above trigger prices set in the 2008 farm bill. Reference prices appeared to provide support below market conditions in the 2008-2012 period but were significantly higher when compared to average farm prices from 2000-2013. Fixed reference prices do not consider market conditions and can be set near or above average market levels. The 2014 farm bill increased reference prices for program crops, potentially distorting outcomes during low market prices. Shallow-loss programs supplement crop insurance by covering part of the deductible. These programs may influence farmers' planting decisions. The 2014 farm bill introduced shallow-loss programs like ARC, SCO, and STAX, which can impact farmers' planting choices. ARC offers revenue deficiency payments based on actual per-acre revenue compared to a target. ARC has county-level (ARC-CO) and farm-level (ARC-ID) versions, with no producer premiums required. ARC-CO doesn't need farm-level production or loss for payment, while ARC-ID requires both. These programs use a five-year Olympic moving average. The ARC program uses a five-year Olympic moving average to calculate revenue guarantees, with the PLC reference price acting as a floor price. This can distort planting incentives and generate large payments during periods of low prices. SCO supplements crop insurance policies. The 2014 farm bill introduced the Stacked Income Protection Plan (STAX) for cotton producers, separate from other major crops, to address a WTO case. STAX is a county-based revenue insurance policy with a revenue guarantee based on expected county revenue. Producers can purchase STAX in addition to their existing crop insurance policy. The federal crop insurance program has grown in importance, covering 294 million acres in 2014. Producers can purchase this policy in addition to their individual crop insurance or as a stand-alone policy. The government subsidizes premiums, with rates ranging from 38% to 80%. In 2012, USDA classified amber box outlays as product-specific outlays, while insurance underwriting costs and A&O expenses were considered green box outlays. Crop insurance premiums and subsidies have increased significantly, reaching $7.5 billion in 2011 and becoming the largest farm program cost, accounting for 53% of U.S. amber box outlays. Premium subsidies slightly decreased to $7 billion in 2012, with insurance underwriting costs varying based on weather events. Federal outlays for crop insurance are projected to range between $8.0 billion in 2015 to $9.0 billion in 2025, including premium subsidies, delivery support, and underwriting support. The sugar and dairy programs are significant contributors to U.S. amber box outlays, relying on import restrictions to support market prices. Neither program has been challenged under the WTO dispute settlement process. The U.S. sugar price support program, part of the Uruguay Round agreement, remains unchanged by the 2014 farm bill, costing around $1.4 billion annually. In contrast, the U.S. dairy program saw major changes, with the elimination of the DPPS, MILC, and Dairy Export Incentive Program. DPPS accounted for the largest portion of U.S. amber box notifications, averaging $4.2 billion annually from 1995-2011. MILC program outlays were smaller due to their counter-cyclical design. The 2014 farm bill eliminated the DPPS, MILC, and Dairy Export Incentive Program, freeing up space for new program spending under the U.S. amber box limit. The Dairy Margin Protection Program (DMPP) replaced the repealed dairy programs, providing payments to dairy producers when the national milk margin falls below $4.00 per hundredweight, with coverage up to $8.00/cwt available for purchase. Payments under the DMPP program are tied to market prices and historical farm-level production with no payment limit. The proposed margin insurance program under the 2014 farm bill has been criticized for not reflecting anticipated risk in milk and feed markets, and for having fixed premiums without a rating method. The share of the premium paid by the federal government can impact market distortion and compliance with WTO regulations. Lower premiums or higher government contributions may incentivize increased milk production by producers. The proposed margin insurance program under the 2014 farm bill has been criticized for not reflecting anticipated risk in milk and feed markets. If milk margins fall to levels that activate indemnity payments, a weakened feedback process between producers and market price signals could prevent normal market adjustment, resulting in persistent oversupply, lower margins, lower farm incomes, and larger federal expenditures. The program design allows producers to purchase coverage on up to 90% of their recent historical maximum output, with a $8.00/cwt maximum coverage option potentially leading to annual outlays of up to $5 billion during low-margin periods. The 2014 farm bill authorized disaster programs for livestock and fruit trees, including Livestock Indemnity Program (LIP), Livestock Forage Disaster Program (LFP), Emergency Assistance for Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm-Raised Fish Program (ELAP), and Tree Assistance Program (TAP). Payments under these programs are product-specific and uncertain market conditions and program costs for the Dairy Margin Protection Program (DMPP) are unlikely to be triggered due to current market analysis showing strong dairy product prices and weak feed prices. Over 50% of U.S. dairy farms elected to participate in DMPP for 2015, with 55% purchasing coverage above the $4 minimum margin. In 2011, $314 million in disaster assistance payments were made to livestock through LFP, LIP, ELAP, and TAP programs, all qualifying for a product-specific DM exemption. No payments were reported in 2012. De Minimis (DM) exemptions are small amber box outlays, with product-specific exemptions being more favorable with a 5% spending limit. Since 1995, U.S. agricultural production has varied in value from $184.7 billion in 1999 to $396.6 billion in 2012. The U.S. non-product-specific DM exemption upper limit ranged from $9.2 billion in 1999 to $19.8 billion in 2012. From 1995 to 2011, non-product-specific DM outlays averaged $4.9 billion, with a high of $9.2 billion in 2011. U.S. crop insurance premium subsidies drove growth in this category, reaching $7.5 billion of the $9.2 billion in 2011. In 2011, U.S. crop insurance premium subsidies were classified as non-product-specific amber box outlays, exempt from the U.S. amber box limit. However, in 2012, the U.S. changed the status to product-specific amber support, subject to evaluation against 5% of the value of the specific commodity. In 2012, $5 billion in premium subsidies were exempted under product-specific DM exemptions, while $2 billion exceeded individual product DM thresholds and counted against the $19.1 billion amber box limit. The United States excluded $7.5 billion of crop insurance premium subsidies and $1.4 billion of SURE payments from the amber box limit in 2011, but in 2012 crop insurance premium subsidies were subject to evaluation against specific commodity thresholds. In 2012, crop insurance premium subsidies were reclassified as product-specific support, leading to a reduced $0.3 billion potential amber box outlays under the non-product-specific DM exemption. The product-specific DM exemption increased to $5.0 billion in 2012, compared to an average of under $0.4 billion annually since 1995. Other U.S. farm programs previously classified as non-product-specific DM outlays included CCP payments, irrigation and grazing subsidies, SURE program payments, and payments under REAP and BCAP programs. In 2012, crop insurance premium subsidies were reclassified as product-specific support, reducing potential amber box outlays. Product-specific DM exemptions increased to $5.0 billion in 2012, up from an average of under $0.4 billion annually since 1995. Various U.S. farm programs have been included in product-specific DM exemptions, such as CCP payments, irrigation and grazing subsidies, SURE program payments, and payments under REAP and BCAP programs. In 2012, insurance premiums were reclassified as product-specific support, increasing DM exemptions to $5.0 billion. U.S. policymakers are considering the impact of expanded domestic support programs on multilateral trade negotiations, aiming for a successful Doha agreement to lower spending limits and eliminate export subsidies. Key proposals include reducing spending limits for amber box and DM exemptions, establishing a limit on the blue box, and lowering the total limit for U.S. amber box spending to $7.6 billion. The U.S. is considering reducing spending limits for amber box and DM exemptions, setting new product-specific limits, and establishing a global spending limit called the overall trade-distorting domestic support (OTDS). The limit for U.S. amber box spending would be reduced to $7.6 billion, while DM exemption limits for non-product-specific outlays would be set at $4.85 billion. Blue box limits would also be established for non-product-specific outlays at $4.85 billion. The U.S. is considering reducing spending limits for domestic support programs, including the amber box, DM exclusions, and blue box, to establish a new overall trade-distorting domestic support (OTDS) limit. The proposed limits for amber box outlays are $7.6 billion, which is lower than projected spending under the 2014 farm bill. Assessments of the new domestic support programs' compliance with WTO restrictions are preliminary due to program implementation and producer participation uncertainties. The new farm safety net programs, including PLC, ARC, SCO, STAX, and DMPP, are still in the process of being implemented. Program outlays are dependent on future market conditions, with the possibility of exceeding proposed spending limits if market prices decline significantly. USDA will determine the classification of these programs, with some potentially falling under the amber box or blue box categories. Among the price and income support programs, MLP benefits are directly tied to producer behavior, while PLC and ARC are based on historical plantings. The new farm safety net programs, including PLC, ARC, SCO, and STAX, provide revenue guarantees near market averages, reducing farm-level risk and potentially incentivizing greater acreage and production. These programs may exceed the $19.1-billion amber-box limit if market prices decline significantly. The U.S. program spending may exceed the $19.1-billion amber-box limit due to low market prices and large outlays across multiple programs. Concerns about potential distortions in international agricultural markets and challenges under WTO rules are also raised. The new farm bill's programs could make it challenging for the United States to agree to future agreements. Price support programs may hinder the United States from agreeing to future reductions in domestic support expenditures as part of WTO trade negotiations."
