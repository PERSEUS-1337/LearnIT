The Clean Water Act sets performance levels for treatment plants to prevent harmful waste discharge into surface waters. The Clean Water Act requires treatment of sewage to remove harmful waste before discharge into surface waters. It authorizes federal programs to aid in wastewater treatment plant construction, with over $92 billion appropriated to assist cities in complying with the act. The overall objective is to restore and maintain the integrity of the nation's waters. Title II of P.L. 92-500 authorized grants to states for wastewater treatment plant construction under a program administered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), based on states' financial needs and population. Amendments in 1987 (P.L. 100-4) introduced a new program to support State Water Pollution Control Revolving Funds (SRFs). States used federal grants to make grants to cities for various wastewater treatment projects. The State Water Pollution Control Revolving Funds (SRFs) replaced the previous Title II program in FY1991. Federal grants now require a 20% match from states, which are used to make loans to communities for construction projects. Repaid funds create a revolving source of assistance. The SRF program was intended to transition to full state and local financing by FY1995, but funding and administrative issues delayed this shift. Despite challenges, most states believe the SRF program is effective today. The State Water Pollution Control Revolving Funds (SRFs) were created in FY1991 to replace the Title II program. SRFs provide loan assistance to communities for wastewater construction projects, including project construction loans, refinancing of debt, and loan guarantees. States also offer additional subsidization such as principal forgiveness and negative interest loans. Congress continues to appropriate funds for wastewater construction activities, with SRFs representing a shift in how the nation finances wastewater treatment needs. The State Water Pollution Control Revolving Funds (SRFs) provide loan assistance for wastewater construction projects, with options for additional subsidization like principal forgiveness and negative interest loans. States must repay the SRF within 30 years, dedicating a revenue stream for repayment. SRF monies must first be used for wastewater treatment facilities compliance before supporting other water quality programs. Eligible projects include wastewater treatment plant construction, stormwater treatment, energy-efficiency improvements, and reuse/recycling of wastewater or stormwater. The State Water Pollution Control Revolving Funds (SRFs) provide loan assistance for wastewater construction projects, with options for additional subsidization like principal forgiveness and negative interest loans. States must repay the SRF within 30 years, dedicating a revenue stream for repayment. SRF monies must first be used for wastewater treatment facilities compliance before supporting other water quality programs. Eligible projects include improvements at treatment works, reuse and recycling of wastewater or stormwater, and security enhancements at treatment works. States must ensure communities meet specifications such as locally prevailing wages and use American-made iron and steel products in projects. Decisions on project assistance are made by states using a priority ranking system based on water pollution severity and financial considerations. All states have mechanisms to administer the loan program and are eligible for SRF capitalization. Some states leverage federal capital grants and state matching funds as collateral to borrow in the public bond market, increasing available project funds. Small communities and states with large rural populations face challenges with the SRF program, requiring major projects for compliance. Many small towns did not participate in previous grants programs and struggle with the transition to a program that demands greater financial management expertise. Since 1989, small communities have struggled with the SRF program due to limited resources and difficulties in qualifying for loans. Despite facing high per capita user fees, 67% of all loans have gone to towns with less than 10,000 population. The Clean Water Act is the main federal program, but the USDA also offers assistance for water supply and wastewater facilities. The USDA operates grant and loan programs for water supply and wastewater facilities in rural areas with funds totaling $347 million from FY2015 appropriations. Other programs include the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) with $3.0 billion in funds, and the Economic Development Administration (EDA) providing project grants for public facilities in approved economic development programs. The Economic Development Administration (EDA) funds public works and economic development programs, including water and sewer systems, in areas of lagging economic growth. EDA's program for FY2015 is funded at $99 million. Local governments primarily finance wastewater treatment facilities through federal and state grants, local taxes, and bonds. Local governments often finance capital investments for water utilities through tax-exempt municipal bonds, with almost 70% of U.S. water utilities relying on debt financing. Shifting from categorical grants to SRF loans has made localities responsible for 100% of project costs, alongside other financing challenges like funding drinking water and solid waste management. Over the past 40-plus years since the CWA was enacted, the nation has made considerable progress in controlling and reducing certain kinds of chemical pollution of rivers, lakes, and streams, much of it because of investments in wastewater treatment. Between 1968 and 1995, biological oxygen demand (BOD) pollutant loadings discharged from sewage treatment plants declined by 45%, despite increased industrial activity and a 35% growth in population. EPA and others argue that without continued management and increased operating costs, localities may need to raise additional funds or reallocate funds from other programs to comply with federal standards. The population served by sewage treatment plants increased from 85 million in 1972 to 223 million in 2008, representing 72% of the U.S. population. However, about 3.8 million people are served by facilities that provide less than secondary treatment. Wet weather pollution from combined sewers remains a key concern. The Clean Water Act has provided over $91 billion in assistance since 1972, but there is still a high funding need of an additional $298 billion according to a 2010 estimate by the EPA and states. This includes costs for controlling wet weather problems, toxic waste discharges from industries and households, and improving wastewater treatment and collection systems. The estimated funding needed for wastewater infrastructure includes $187.9 billion for treatment and collection systems, $63.6 billion for sewer overflow corrections, $42.3 billion for stormwater management, and $4.4 billion for recycled water distribution systems. Small communities account for 8% of the total needs, with the largest needs being pipe repair, new sewer pipes, improved treatment, and overflow corrections. The EPA released a study called the Gap Analysis in 2002, estimating that the United States needs to spend nearly $390 billion over the next two decades on wastewater infrastructure. Without increased investment, there will be a $6 billion annual gap in funding. Increasing wastewater spending by 3% annually could reduce this gap by nearly 90%. The EPA's Gap Analysis in 2002 estimated the US needs $390 billion for wastewater infrastructure over 20 years. Increasing spending by 3% annually could reduce the funding gap by nearly 90%. Congressional interest in federal assistance for states and cities, including expired SRF grants, remains an ongoing issue. The House passed a reauthorization bill in the 104th Congress, but no legislation was enacted due to controversies. Focus has shifted to projects for wet control. Funding needs for wet weather water pollution projects are estimated at nearly $106 billion. The 106th Congress authorized $1.5 billion for CWA grant funding for these projects, but the authorization expired in FY2003. No funds were appropriated for wet weather projects since then. House and Senate committees have approved bills to extend the SRF program, but no legislation has been enacted. Issues debated in connection with extending SRF assistance to meet funding needs, modifying the program for small communities, and addressing water quality priorities beyond traditional treatment plant construction. Congress made changes to the SRF provisions in 2014, including extending loan repayment terms, expanding eligible projects, and imposing \"Buy American\" requirements. The 2014 amendments to the SRF program included extending loan repayment terms, expanding eligible projects, and imposing \"Buy American\" requirements. However, unresolved issues include authorization of appropriations for SRF grants, state-by-state allocation of grants, and prevailing wage requirements under the Davis-Bacon Act. Additionally, a new Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) program was authorized for large water infrastructure projects. Congress is focused on reducing federal spending, making it challenging to provide assistance for water infrastructure programs. Interest in meeting the nation's water infrastructure needs remains strong, but policymakers must balance assistance for local communities with fiscal discipline. The outcome of infrastructure programs in these debates is uncertain."
