    "content": "President Bush announced plans to adjust U.S. laws and policies to enable civil nuclear energy cooperation with India, despite restrictions due to India's possession of nuclear weapons. The Henry J. Hyde United States-India Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation Act of 2006 provided the means for this cooperation. President Bush announced plans to adjust U.S. laws for civil nuclear energy cooperation with India, despite India's nuclear weapons possession. A cooperation agreement was reached in 2007 and submitted to Congress in 2008, along with required documents and reports. President Bush determined that the agreement would not pose an unreasonable risk to common defense and security. President Bush submitted the nuclear cooperation agreement with India to Congress after the IAEA and NSG approvals. The agreement cannot enter into force without congressional approval as per P.L. 109-401 and AEA requirements. Congress must hold hearings on the proposed agreement after a consultation period with the President. After President Bush submitted the nuclear cooperation agreement with India to Congress, the House passed H.R. 7081, waiving the provisions for congressional consideration and approval. The Senate also approved the legislation, and President Bush signed it into law as P.L. 110-369 on October 8. The States-India Nuclear Cooperation Approval and Nonproliferation Enhancement Act was signed into law by President Bush without indicating any differences with the legislation. The agreement between the US and India entered into force on December 6, 2008, after exchanging diplomatic notes. The 2010 NPT Review Conference urged all states-parties to ensure their nuclear-related exports comply with the treaty. India has not signed the NPT and lacks safeguards on nuclear material, but is increasing nuclear cooperation with other countries. India intends to engage in nuclear cooperation with U.S. companies for the construction of nuclear power units at approved sites. India intends to engage in nuclear cooperation with U.S. companies for the construction of power units at approved sites capable of generating 10,000 MW. Deals will be based on mutually acceptable terms for a viable tariff regime. The partnership aims to provide energy to India's population considering affordability, sustainability of nuclear fuel resources, and credibility of waste management. New Delhi has designated specific sites for U.S.-supplied reactors, pending certification of IAEA safeguards agreement by the President. President Obama certified to Congress that India's IAEA safeguards agreement has entered into force and its declaration of nuclear facilities is consistent with the separation plan provided to Washington. U.S. firms are in negotiations with Indian counterparts for nuclear trade, but concerns remain over India's liability policies. India signed the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear. India signed the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage (CSC) on October 27, 2010. The State Department viewed this as crucial for U.S. nuclear firms to compete globally. However, concerns over liability issues persist, with discussions ongoing with Russia and France. India's Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Bill, passed in August 2010, is a point of contention, with differing opinions on its compatibility with the CSC. India signed the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for Nuclear Damage (CSC) on October 27, 2010. U.S. officials have raised concerns about India's liability policies and want India to ratify the CSC by the end of 2011. India signed the CSC in 2010 and aims to ratify it by the end of 2011. The regulations for the civil nuclear liability bill are being finalized, but the U.S. has concerns about their compatibility with the CSC. Discussions between the U.S. and India are ongoing to address these issues. India aims to address U.S. concerns regarding the civil nuclear liability bill regulations and ratify the CSC. Discussions between the two countries are ongoing, with a focus on providing a level playing field for U.S. companies within the framework of the law. Westinghouse Electric Company has signed an agreement in this regard. Westinghouse Electric Company signed a Memorandum of Understanding with NPCIL for preliminary licensing and site development work. Washington still has concerns about India's liability law and is discussing monitoring arrangements for U.S. nuclear exports. India has provided retransfer assurances for state-owned entities but not yet for private entities under the nuclear cooperation agreement with the US. New Delhi has consent to reprocess nuclear material transferred, but must establish a new national reprocessing facility dedicated to reprocessing safeguarded nuclear material. Consultations between the US and India on arrangements and procedures for reprocessing must be concluded within one year. India and the United States completed negotiations on a nuclear cooperation agreement, with India insisting on a reprocessing facility agreement before signing contracts with U.S. nuclear firms. The agreement outlines arrangements for reprocessing spent nuclear fuel at two new national facilities in India. The agreement between India and the United States allows for reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel at new facilities in India. Secretary of Energy Steven Chu submitted the arrangement to Congress, stating it will not increase proliferation risks or aid India's nuclear program. Chu also certified efforts to ensure similar arrangements with other countries. The July 30, 2010 agreement allows India to construct additional reprocessing facilities for U.S.-supplied reactors, subject to a new subsequent arrangement submitted to Congress. India has negotiated nuclear cooperation agreements with NSG countries, including France, for reactor and fuel provision, but not enrichment or reprocessing technology transfer. France, through Ambassador Jerome Bonnafont, expressed interest in India reprocessing spent nuclear fuel in an IAEA-safeguarded facility. An agreement between AREVA and India's Department of Atomic Energy was made for the supply of uranium. AREVA and NPCIL signed agreements for the construction of up to six nuclear reactors. France and India signed agreements for the construction of nuclear reactors, with concerns remaining about India's nuclear liability policies. Russia and India also signed a nuclear cooperation agreement to collaborate on constructing additional nuclear power plants. Russia is constructing two reactors in India at Kudankulam, with President Dmitry Medvedev amending a decree to allow nuclear exports to India under IAEA safeguards. The TVEL Corporation signed a nuclear fuel supply contract with India's Department of Atomic Energy, and the two countries expanded their cooperation agreement in 2009. The 2009 agreement between Russia and India includes cooperation on research and development, construction of nuclear power plants, and fuel-supply arrangements. It grants India consent to reprocess spent reactor fuel and ensures continued fuel supply from Russia even if the agreement is terminated. Discussions are ongoing to resolve concerns over India's nuclear liability policies. India has signed agreements with Kazakhstan and Namibia for the supply of uranium and cooperation in peaceful uses of nuclear energy. Discussions with Russia are ongoing to resolve concerns over liability issues. Additionally, an umbrella agreement for cooperation in civil nuclear energy was signed with Russia in 2011. India signed agreements with Namibia, Mongolia, and Canada for cooperation in peaceful uses of nuclear energy. The agreements involve investments in the uranium sector, exploration for uranium, cooperation in nuclear reactor design and construction, and the supply of uranium. India also has nuclear agreements with Argentina for scientific, technical, and commercial support. India signed agreements with Namibia, Mongolia, and Canada for cooperation in peaceful uses of nuclear energy, involving investments in the uranium sector, exploration, reactor design, and uranium supply. Additionally, India has nuclear agreements with Argentina for scientific, technical, and commercial support. India also signed a nuclear cooperation agreement with the United Kingdom in 2010, allowing for technology transfer. Furthermore, India and South Korea signed a similar agreement in 2011. The agreement between India and South Korea, signed in 2011, allows for South Korea's participation in India's atomic power plant construction. India is also exploring the possibility of acquiring a stake in a uranium mine abroad, as stated in a March 2012 statement. P.L. 109-401 allows the President to exempt a U.S. nuclear cooperation agreement with India from certain requirements, with President Bush certifying completion of necessary steps in 2008. The P.L. 109-401 requires India to provide a credible separation plan for its nuclear facilities, gain approval from the IAEA for a new safeguards agreement, make progress towards an Additional Protocol, support efforts to ban fissile material production, halt the spread of sensitive nuclear fuel cycle technologies, secure nuclear materials through multilateral control regimes, and obtain exceptions from NSG export control guidelines. U.S. and Indian officials have agreed on India's separation plan. India and the U.S. agreed on a separation plan in 2006, which includes placing eight indigenous power reactors under safeguards. Future reactors can also be safeguarded if declared civilian. Some facilities in the Nuclear Fuel Complex will be specified as civilian in 2008. Nine research facilities and three heavy water plants will be declared civilian but are \"safeguards-irrelevant.\" Not included in the separation list are indigenous power reactors, Fast Breeder test Reactor, Prototype Fast Breeder Reactors under construction, enrichment facilities, and spent fuel reprocessing facilities. India and the U.S. agreed on a separation plan in 2006, including placing eight indigenous power reactors under safeguards. Research reactors like CIRUS and Dhruva, the Advanced Heavy Water Reactor, three heavy water plants, and military-related plants were also part of the plan. India aimed to bring its facilities under safeguards by 2014, with a revised timeline due to IAEA approval delays. Facilities excluded from the civilian list were those of strategic significance. The 2006 agreement between India and the U.S. included placing indigenous power reactors under safeguards, along with research reactors, heavy water plants, and military-related facilities. India aimed to bring all facilities under safeguards by 2014, with delays due to IAEA approval. The plan raised concerns about the separation of civilian and military facilities, as military reactors would still provide civilian electricity. Domestic opposition from leftist parties delayed talks with the IAEA on a safeguards agreement until July 2008. The Progressive Alliance government, led by Prime Minister Singh, needed support from other parties to stay in power. The Left Front threatened to withdraw support if the government proceeded with safeguards discussions. After negotiations, the Left Front allowed the government to engage with the IAEA. Talks began in November 2007, with the government planning to seek approval from a political committee before finalizing the agreement. The government, led by Prime Minister Singh, needed support from other parties to stay in power. The Left Front allowed the government to engage with the IAEA for safeguards discussions. External Affairs Minister Mukherjee stated that the draft agreement would be brought back to the UPA-Left Coalition committee for approval. Communist Party of India (Marxist) General Secretary Karat emphasized that the outcome of talks should be presented to the committee before moving forward. Despite the committee meeting in June 2008, the government did not present the safeguards agreement text to them. The IAEA Secretariat circulated the draft text to the agency's board in July 2008, leading to strong reservations from Pakistan and other board members. The Board of Governors approved the safeguards agreement despite reservations from unidentified members. Left Front parties withdrew support but the coalition government won a vote of confidence. The Left Front demanded termination of the nuclear agreement, but the coalition government strengthened its position in the 2009 elections. The opposition BJP opposes the deal and aims to renegotiate. The Party opposes the nuclear deal and plans to renegotiate if it regains power. Former IAEA Director General ElBaradei called India's safeguards agreement an \"umbrella agreement\" allowing future facilities to be safeguarded efficiently. India signed the agreement on February 2, 2009, and it came into force on May 11, 2009. The agreement requires India to declare its nuclear facilities in two steps. India provided a document to the IAEA in 2008 containing a list of its nuclear facilities, satisfying a requirement regarding New Delhi's declaration. India later provided the required declaration, but the exact timing is unclear. In October 2009, New Delhi provided the IAEA with a list of 14 nuclear facilities to be placed under safeguards, as per the agreement. Six reactors from the separation plan were not included but will be safeguarded by 2014. India's decision on facility classification is tied to civil nuclear cooperation agreements with other countries. Some concerns have been raised about the agreement's preamble suggesting India's potential withdrawal from nuclear commitments. The agreement's preamble suggests India could withdraw nuclear facilities or fuel from safeguards if needed for uninterrupted operation of civilian nuclear reactors. India aims to develop a strategic reserve of nuclear fuel to guard against supply disruptions, potentially to hedge against fuel cut-offs in case of nuclear weapon testing. ElBaradei noted that the agreement's termination clauses take precedence. ElBaradei emphasized that the termination clauses of the agreement take precedence over general clauses, with India expressing the view that IAEA safeguards should be considered 'in perpetuity' for implementing the U.S.-India Agreement. If India were to end IAEA safeguards on U.S. nuclear exports, fall-back safeguards would be required as per Section 123 a. (1) of the AEA. The nuclear cooperation agreement mandates safeguards on all nuclear materials and equipment transferred under the agreement. The State Department emphasized the importance of IAEA safeguards for all nuclear materials and equipment under the U.S.-India Agreement, even after its termination. The United States presented a draft decision in 2006 seeking an exception for India to NSG requirements. The United States presented a draft decision in 2006 seeking an exception for India to NSG requirements, which did not contain restrictions on enrichment or reprocessing cooperation. A second draft was developed in 2008, after consultations with New Delhi, which also did not impose additional restrictions on India. The NSG exempted India from some export guidelines, allowing individual governments to decide on nuclear item exports to India based on their own policies. The NSG exempted India from certain export guidelines, allowing governments to decide on nuclear item exports based on their own policies. The final language of the exemption does not include explicit conditions, but is based on Indian commitments and actions, including a unilateral moratorium on nuclear testing. India is required to have full-scope IAEA safeguards, with sensitive exports subject to specific guidelines on restraint in transfers of nuclear-related technology. The NSG exemption for India allows for the transfer of nuclear items based on individual government policies. Recipients of enrichment or reprocessing facilities should consider multinational involvement. Any enrichment facility transferred should not produce over 20% enriched uranium without supplier consent. Ireland noted that no NSG member plans to transfer enrichment or reprocessing technology to India. The NSG exemption for India allows for the transfer of nuclear items based on individual government policies, with a focus on restricting the export of enrichment and reprocessing technology. Secretary Rice made a commitment to prioritize prohibiting such exports to non-NPT states, and the NSG reached agreement on criteria for exporting such technology in 2011. The NSG exemption for India allows for the transfer of nuclear items based on individual government policies, with a focus on restricting the export of enrichment and reprocessing technology. In June 2011, the Group agreed on criteria for exporting such technology, including the requirement for the recipient to be an NPT state-party in good standing. If violations occur, NSG members could cut off nuclear supplies. In the context of the NSG exemption for India, members could agree to cut off nuclear supplies in case of a nuclear test by India. Mukherjee's statement on India's stand on disarmament and nonproliferation played a decisive role in persuading NSG governments to agree to the exemption, despite not introducing any new commitments. India remains committed to a voluntary moratorium on nuclear testing, but Congress Party spokesperson mentioned the readiness to test if it serves national interests. India is prepared to test nuclear weapons multiple times if necessary. The IAEA has approved an Additional Protocol for India's civil nuclear program to detect undeclared nuclear activities. India's willingness to test nuclear weapons is contingent on national interest. India's Additional Protocol with the IAEA differs from the Model Protocol, requiring only information on nuclear exports. India has submitted a declaration to the IAEA but is not obligated to place new facilities under safeguards or adhere to a separation plan, although foreign assistance requires safeguards on facilities. The State Department report assesses that India has harmonized its export control laws with the NSG and MTCR guidelines. India has stated its adherence to the NSG and MTCR guidelines in letters to the IAEA and MTCR. The group's chair is requested to consult with India regarding changes to guidelines. The group's chair, which rotates annually, consults with India on changes to NSG guidelines. India, a non-member, has been hesitant to adhere to the guidelines due to lack of decision-making power. The US supports India's full membership in NSG, MTCR, Australia Group, and Wassenaar Arrangement in phases. US circulated a paper in 2011 to NSG for India's membership bid, but support may be less vigorous. The US supported India's NSG membership bid, but with less vigor compared to previous support for a nuclear cooperation agreement in 2008. The House and Senate passed legislation approving the agreement, which was signed into law in October 2008, obviating certain procedural requirements. Congress approved the United States-India Agreement for Cooperation on Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy, subject to applicable U.S. law. Lawmakers had concerns about ambiguities in the agreement meeting requirements of previous legislation. During the debate over the United States-India nuclear agreement, concerns were raised about ambiguities meeting legal requirements. Berman inserted State Department responses to clarify key issues. Provisions were included to prevent India from using fuel reserves for nuclear testing without consequences. The United States seeks to prevent the transfer of nuclear equipment to India from other NSG participants or any other source. Provisions in the law require a fuel reserve for India's nuclear facilities and certification from the President to ensure compliance with NPT obligations. The President is required to certify U.S. policy to restrict transfers of uranium enrichment and spent fuel reprocessing technology to NSG members. President Bush submitted certifications and a Memorandum of Justification in October 2008, without providing reasoning. Additionally, efforts are to be made to establish principles for peaceful use and accounting of by-product material within the NSG or with relevant governments. The President must certify U.S. efforts every six months to achieve changes in nuclear cooperation agreements. Before the NRC can issue export licenses, the President must certify that India's IAEA safeguards agreement is in force and consistent with its separation plan. India signed its safeguards agreement in 2009, and President Obama submitted the required certification to Congress in 2010. President Obama submitted the required certification to Congress on February 3, 2010, stating that India has met the legal requirements. The certification did not provide reasoning for the determination. P.L. 110-369 includes additional reporting requirements and amendments related to India's separation plan and notifications to the IAEA. It also requires the President to report on potential activities under the nuclear cooperation agreement. The AEA requires the President to inform Congress about any new or amended agreements for peaceful nuclear cooperation. An agreement between the US and India was signed in 2010 for India to reprocess spent nuclear fuel. Procedures for Congress to consider such arrangements are specified in P.L. 110-369. The President must provide a report to Congress with reasons for the arrangement, its description, and a certification of efforts to ensure other nations follow similar protocols. India must reprocess or alter nuclear material transferred to them under specific arrangements. Congress has 30 days to approve or disapprove the proposed arrangement, with a shortened timeline for committee reports. Secretary of Energy submitted the arrangement to Congress on May 11. The Secretary of Energy submitted a nuclear cooperation arrangement to Congress on May 11, 2010, which requires full-scope IAEA safeguards for significant nuclear exports to non-nuclear-weapon states. India, a non-NPT party with a nuclear weapons program, does not have full-scope safeguards. Section 129 also requires exports to stop if a non-nuclear-weapon state detonates a nuclear weapon. The Atomic Energy Act (AEA) has provisions in Sections 126, 128, and 129 regarding the President's ability to waive export requirements and sanctions for non-nuclear-weapon states. The Supreme Court decision in INS v. Chadha in 1983 deemed legislative veto provisions unconstitutional, leading to amendments in 1985 for joint resolutions of approval or disapproval. This affects how Congress can disapprove of presidential determinations under existing law. The Atomic Energy Act (AEA) has provisions in Sections 126, 128, and 129 regarding the President's ability to waive export requirements and sanctions for non-nuclear-weapon states. The Supreme Court decision in INS v. Chadha in 1983 deemed legislative veto provisions unconstitutional, leading to amendments in 1985 for joint resolutions of approval or disapproval. This affects how Congress can disapprove of presidential determinations under existing law and the impact of the Administration's proposed legislation on nuclear cooperation agreements. Section 123 of the AEA specifies the criteria and process for approving nuclear cooperation agreements, including exemptions and approval procedures for different types of agreements. The United States has over 20 agreements for nuclear cooperation in place, including one with India from 1963 to 1993. These agreements set the terms of reference and provide authorization for cooperation, but do not guarantee cooperation or nuclear material transfer. Section 123 of the Atomic Energy Act lists criteria that agreements must meet, with exemptions possible if the President deems necessary. The United States has agreements for nuclear cooperation, including with India. Section 123 of the Atomic Energy Act outlines criteria for these agreements, ensuring safeguards on nuclear material, non-proliferation, and U.S. approval for transfers and activities. The full-scope safeguards requirement for non-nuclear-weapon states under Section 123 a. (2) is challenging to meet. India is classified as a non-nuclear-weapon state due to not detonating a nuclear device before January 1, 1967. The President can exempt cooperation agreements from certain requirements if they are deemed detrimental to U.S. non-proliferation goals or national security. Approval from both chambers of Congress is necessary for exempted agreements to take effect. Approval of an agreement for cooperation exempted from full-scope safeguards would waive the NRC's consideration of safeguards as a criterion for export licenses. Congress retains the authority to review one export license authorization annually after the agreement enters into force. Failure to disapprove such agreements constitutes a failure to adopt a resolution of disapproval for the Commission's consideration of applications. The Atomic Energy Act (AEA) outlines procedures for licensing exports, including criteria for framework agreements and authorization of export licenses. The NRC must meet criteria for authorizing export licenses, with a requirement for full-scope safeguards for non-nuclear-weapon states. The President can authorize exports if NRC criteria are not met. Congressional review is required for one export license authorization annually after an agreement enters into force. The President can authorize exports if NRC criteria are not met, with Congressional review required for one export license annually. If the export fails to meet criteria, the President must submit an executive order to Congress for review, with a 60-day period for approval unless a resolution of disapproval is passed. The NRC does not need to meet full-scope safeguards for exports under exempted agreements, and Congress can review one license per year. Section 128 and 129 of the AEA allow the President to waive termination of exports by notifying Congress of certain conditions. Section 129 requires ending exports to non-nuclear-weapon states under specific circumstances. Section 129 of the AEA allows the President to halt exports to nations that have violated nuclear agreements or assisted in obtaining nuclear weapons. The President can waive termination if it would harm US nonproliferation goals. The President can halt exports to nations violating nuclear agreements or aiding in obtaining nuclear weapons to achieve US nonproliferation goals. The determination must be submitted to Congress for review, and legislation was introduced in both the House and Senate. The House passed H.R. 5682, and the Senate passed its version with amendments. One issue that delayed the Senate bill was the inclusion of implementing legislation for the U.S. Additional. The Senate bill included implementing legislation for the U.S. Additional Protocol, enhancing IAEA inspectors' tools. The House and Senate versions of H.R. 5682 were similar, with differences in waiver authority and reporting requirements. Senate also had unique sections on cooperation agreement. The Senate bill included implementing legislation for the U.S. Additional Protocol, enhancing IAEA inspectors' tools. It had two unique sections related to the cooperation agreement, Sections 106 and 107, both of which appear in the conference report. Section 106 prohibits exports of equipment, material, or technology related to uranium enrichment, spent fuel reprocessing, or heavy water production unless conducted in approved facilities. Section 107 would establish a program to monitor the appropriate use of U.S. technology by Indian recipients. The Senate version also contained implementing legislation for the U.S. Additional Protocol in Title II, which was retained in the conference report. P.L. 109-401 allows the President to exempt a proposed agreement for cooperation with India from the full-scope safeguards requirement. The President can exempt a cooperation agreement with India from certain requirements under the Atomic Energy Act, but not from a future cutoff in exports if India conducts another nuclear test. P.L. 109-401 outlines specific prohibitions and reporting requirements for such agreements. The Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) guidelines prohibit assistance to any country for nuclear weapons production. The law also restricts enrichment and reprocessing cooperation, except for approved multinational programs. President Bush signed the act to strengthen the US-India strategic relationship. President Bush signed the act to strengthen the US-India strategic relationship. He stated that certain provisions of the bill would be considered \"advisory\" only, questioning whether Congress was ceding authority to approve U.S. exports to the NSG. U.S. officials have assured Congress that the government would abide by NSG guidelines. The President's signing statement on the US-India strategic relationship Act indicated that certain provisions may be limited by the executive branch to protect information related to foreign relations, national security, and executive processes. The implications of this approach will become clearer once required reports are produced. The US-India nuclear agreement announced in July 2007 lists civilian nuclear projects for cooperation, raising concerns about its consistency with US law. Congress and non-governmental experts questioned the agreement's alignment with P.L. 109-401 and urged resolution of discrepancies before proposing changes to NSG guidelines. The US-India nuclear agreement raised concerns about its alignment with P.L. 109-401. Non-governmental experts questioned aspects of the agreement, highlighting inconsistencies with US law. Despite restrictions on exports related to uranium enrichment, spent fuel reprocessing, and heavy water production, the agreement allows for transfers of sensitive nuclear technology and facilities, subject to applicable laws and regulations. The US-India nuclear agreement is subject to restrictions outlined in P.L. 109-401. The State Department has stated that the US will not transfer dual-use items for use in sensitive nuclear facilities to India. The agreement does not exempt India from a future export cutoff if they test a nuclear explosive device again. The US-India nuclear agreement allows either party to terminate the agreement with one year's notice, without limiting the grounds for termination. Consultations are required before ceasing cooperation, and termination can occur if mutually acceptable resolutions are not possible. The US-India nuclear agreement allows termination with one year's notice, consultations required before ceasing cooperation. If India conducts a nuclear test, it may argue for agreement continuation based on geopolitical circumstances, but US right to terminate is not constrained by consultations. US has the right to require return of nuclear materials if a nuclear test is conducted. The US-India nuclear agreement allows termination with one year's notice, consultations required before ceasing cooperation. If India conducts a nuclear test, the US has the right to require return of nuclear materials. The agreement does not explicitly state that a future Indian test would allow the US to exercise its right of return. The US-India nuclear agreement allows termination with one year's notice. The agreement also includes assurances regarding India's future nuclear fuel supply, with the US supporting India in negotiating an India-specific fuel supply agreement with the IAEA and developing a strategic reserve of nuclear fuel. The US-India nuclear agreement includes provisions for India's future nuclear fuel supply, allowing for a strategic reserve of fuel to last the lifetime of India's reactors. In case of a disruption in fuel supplies, a group of friendly supplier countries would be convened to restore fuel supply to India, potentially mitigating the effects of a U.S. cessation of nuclear exports. The US-India nuclear agreement includes provisions for a strategic reserve of fuel to last the lifetime of India's reactors. Section 103 (b) (10) addresses the issue of a fuel reserve, while Section 103 a. (6) seeks to prevent the transfer of nuclear equipment, materials, or technology to India after a nuclear test. The US-India nuclear agreement includes provisions for a strategic reserve of fuel to last the lifetime of India's reactors. President Bush's message to Congress characterizes the fuel-supply assurances as \"political commitments\" that are not legally binding. The agreement does not compel specific nuclear cooperation and only refers to disruptions in fuel supplies that are not India's fault. The US has not sought commitments from other countries to supply fuel to India. If supply disruptions occur, the US would encourage transfers of nuclear fuel by other NSG members. The US-India nuclear agreement includes provisions for a strategic reserve of fuel to last the lifetime of India's reactors. The agreement does not define what it means to \"support an Indian effort to develop a strategic reserve.\" The US may not supply India with a fuel reserve sufficient for the lifetime of India's reactors. India actively promoted nuclear energy cooperation with the United States from the mid-1950s, but refused to join the 1970 Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) due to discrimination concerns. Despite conducting nuclear tests in 1974 and 1998, India maintains its stance on nuclear weapons. India conducted a \"peaceful\" nuclear test in 1974 and tested nuclear weapons in 1998, but is not recognized as a nuclear-weapon state. The 1974 test highlighted the potential misuse of nuclear technology for weapons. In response, the US passed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978, imposing strict requirements on nuclear exports. The Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) was established in 1975 to regulate nuclear exports, with guidelines published in 1978. The NSG established guidelines in 1978 to regulate nuclear transfers for peaceful purposes. The US faced challenges in supplying fuel to India's reactors at Tarapur due to full-scope safeguards requirements. Despite attempts to export uranium under executive order, all nuclear exports to India from the US were halted after 1980. France later supplied fuel under a separate agreement. After the NSG adopted full-scope safeguards in 1992, China and Russia supplied fuel for India's reactors. The NPT does not explicitly prohibit nuclear commerce with non-NPT states, but the 1995 NPT Review Conference supported limiting assistance to non-NPT parties. India and Pakistan conducted nuclear tests in 1998, leading to UN Security Council Resolution 1172 urging them to halt weapon development. The Bush Administration considered a strategic partnership with India in 2001, focusing on cooperation in nuclear energy. The U.S.-India 2004 Next Steps in Strategic Partnership initiative included civil nuclear technology cooperation. President Bush announced a global partnership with India in 2005, emphasizing civilian nuclear cooperation. President Bush expressed commitment to achieving full civil nuclear energy cooperation with India, including adjusting U.S. laws and policies. The joint statement highlighted the importance of nuclear energy for meeting global energy demands and mentioned potential collaboration on fusion research and future reactor design. India agreed to separate its civilian and military nuclear facilities, declare civilian facilities to the IAEA, place them under safeguards, sign an Additional Protocol, continue nuclear test moratorium, work on a Fissile Material Cut Off Treaty, refrain from transferring certain technologies, support efforts to limit their spread, and secure nuclear materials through export control legislation. The AEA requires congressional approval and oversight of peaceful nuclear cooperation agreements. Congress held hearings on the global partnership and consulted with the Administration on the U.S.-India nuclear agreement. The Bush Administration aims to transform relations with India strategically. Some Members of Congress have raised concerns about using civil nuclear cooperation to advance the relationship with India. Representative Jim Leach suggested supporting India's bid for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council instead. There are also questions about whether U.S. energy assistance should focus on nuclear power or other alternatives. Some experts argue that nuclear power may not be the best solution for India's energy needs, as it currently only provides 2.7% of installed electrical capacity. They suggest that India should focus on improving efficiency and exploring clean-coal and renewable energy technologies instead of importing nuclear power reactors. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee's November 2, 2005, hearing focused on the importance of civil nuclear cooperation in the U.S.-Indian strategic relationship. Then-Under Secretary of State Nicholas Burns emphasized India's central role in the partnership. The Bush Administration viewed civil nuclear cooperation as beneficial for nonproliferation efforts, aiming to bring India into the nonproliferation mainstream and enlist it as an ally in U.S. nonproliferation policy. Some observers are concerned that India may not fully support U.S. nonproliferation policies, especially regarding Iran, due to its growing strategic relationship with Iran and its tradition of foreign policy independence. India's policy independence and opposition to the discriminatory nature of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty have led to concerns about its support for U.S. nonproliferation policies, particularly regarding Iran. Indian officials do not support a nuclear weapons option for Tehran but disagree with the U.S. on reporting Iran's nuclear program to the U.N. Security Council and limiting Iran's nuclear fuel cycle development. This has been seen as interference with India's autonomy in foreign relations and disregard for its security and energy needs. On September 24, 2005, India voted with the United States, finding Iran in noncompliance with its safeguards agreement, despite significant domestic dissent. India explained its vote by stating opposition to Iran being declared noncompliant and that the current situation did not pose a threat to international peace and security. The resolution did not refer the matter to the Security Council, aligning with India's position to address outstanding issues under the IAEA's oversight. India supported reporting Iran's noncompliance to the U.N. Security Council in 2006 and voted for a resolution criticizing Iran's failure to comply with IAEA and U.N. Security Council obligations in 2009. New Delhi's stance on curtailing peaceful nuclear programs may be tested by Iran. India has historically supported states' rights to develop nuclear energy and criticized nonproliferation policies. Prime Minister Singh emphasized Iran's right to peaceful nuclear energy in 2005. India also expressed support for Iran's nuclear technology choices in 2006. Concerns exist about India's relationship with Iran, including the potential transfer of weapons of mass destruction. India's relationship with Iran includes limited nuclear, chemical, and missile-related transfers. In the early 1990s, India provided nuclear-related assistance to Iran, including training Iranian nuclear scientists. The United States imposed sanctions on Indian nuclear scientists in 2004 under the Iran Nonproliferation Act. Indian officials protested cooperation under IAEA Technical Cooperation program. Scientists passed information to Iran on tritium extraction. Sanctions lifted on Dr. Surendar in 2005. One confirmed transfer of 60 tons of thionyl chloride from India to Iran in March 1989. Other shipments reportedly halted under U.S. pressure. India not listed as supplier of chemical-weapons-related exports to Iran in CIA's nonproliferation report. India signed Chemical Weapons Convention in 1993. In 1993, India signed the Chemical Weapons Convention and ratified it in 1996. The United States imposed sanctions on Indian chemical manufacturers in 2005 and 2006 under nonproliferation acts. India committed to not transferring enrichment and reprocessing technologies to certain states. The NSG is considering criteria for exporting such technology. India's External Affairs Minister stated in 2008 that India will not transfer these technologies. India, under External Affairs Minister Shri Pranab Mukherjee in 2008, pledged not to proliferate sensitive technologies like enrichment and reprocessing. Reports by the Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) raised concerns about India potentially exporting centrifuge enrichment-related technology. The extent of India's involvement in technology transfer remains unclear. The U.S. nuclear cooperation agreement with India will not impact New Delhi's procurement practices for technology transfer. While the U.S. will not engage in reprocessing or enrichment technology cooperation with India, other NSG members may transfer such technology. India's commitment to reporting exports of NSG Trigger List items to the IAEA could affect the nuclear nonproliferation regime. The cohesion within the NSG is crucial for effective export controls. The NSG follows U.S. guidelines on full-scope safeguards. Chairman Hyde emphasized the importance of maintaining NSG strength. The U.S. must continue to abide by NSG guidelines to prevent weakening or destruction of the group. The administration will continue to abide by NSG guidelines and not implement the new India policy without NSG consensus. P.L. 109-401 states that the NSG should decide by consensus on supplying nuclear items to India. Dissent within the NSG could hinder U.S. nonproliferation objectives. U.S. cooperation with India in nuclear matters could influence other suppliers like China to provide nuclear technology to non-nuclear-weapon states such as Pakistan. China, a member of the NSG since 2004, has supported NSG decisions based on criteria rather than exceptions for India. Russia's decision to resume fuel supplies to India's Tarapur reactors in 2006 under a safety exception has caused concern among NSG members. India's exclusion from regular nuclear activities has been a longstanding issue. India has long complained about being excluded from nuclear commerce due to its status outside the NPT. Some believe this exclusion is necessary to uphold the treaty, while others argue that a new approach is needed for India. The NPT involves non-nuclear-weapon states giving up nuclear ambitions in exchange for peaceful nuclear cooperation, while nuclear weapon states commit to disarmament. India, not bound by these commitments, raises concerns about undermining the NPT agreements and disarmament efforts. India's unilateral testing moratorium is seen as insufficient compared to signing the CTBT. The absence of a cap on India's fissile material production for weapons may hinder China's declaration of halting production. The strengthening of the NPT and export control regimes was influenced by revelations of clandestine nuclear weapons programs in the early 1990s. The strengthening of the NPT and export control regimes was influenced by clandestine nuclear weapons programs in the early 1990s. NPT parties affirmed the NSG's decision to require full-scope safeguards for nuclear exports, supporting the principle that non-NPT parties should not receive the same assistance. Most states agreed to strengthen the nonproliferation regime by allowing intrusive inspections under the Additional Protocol. In the wake of 2004 revelations about A.Q. Khan's nuclear black market sales, non-nuclear-weapon states are asked to consider further restrictions on their sovereignty by voluntarily restricting access to sensitive nuclear technologies. Some view the U.S.-Indian nuclear cooperation agreement as a breach of faith in the NPT's basic bargain, potentially weakening the nonproliferation regime. Ambassador Joseph sees the nuclear initiative as a net gain for nonproliferation, energy security, and the strategic relationship. Some experts believe the U.S.-Indian nuclear cooperation agreement may not have required significant concessions from India to justify the benefits promised by the United States. The agreement could potentially weaken global nonproliferation efforts by granting India recognition as a de facto nuclear weapon state and access to the international nuclear energy market in exchange for symbolic nonproliferation concessions. Robert Einhorn, Advisor for Nonproliferation and Arms Control, stated that India's commitments were mostly reaffirmations of existing positions, with a focus on nonproliferation measures such as a nuclear testing moratorium, Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty, and export control. The Indian embassy downplayed the depth of these commitments. India has supported FMCT negotiations for years and continues to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons. Prime Minister Singh stated India's willingness to join a non-discriminatory, multilaterally negotiated FMCT. The agreement includes commitments to separate civilian and military facilities, declare civilian facilities, and place them under safeguards, seen as a nonproliferation \"plus.\" India has broad latitude in determining which facilities to put under international safeguards, a privilege currently only given to nuclear weapon states under the NPT. The exclusion of military facilities from inspections is seen as a tacit recognition of their legitimacy. IAEA Director General Dr. Mohamed ElBaradei advocates for more Indian facilities to be under safeguards for additional safety benefits. The NSG already has exceptions for safety-related items, and the Bush Administration recognizes India's exceptional record in nonproliferation. India's \"exceptional\" record in nonproliferation is acknowledged, with most evidence supporting India's restraint in export controls. However, concerns remain about India's nuclear weapons program, as it has not agreed to halt fissile material production despite promises to adhere to NSG guidelines. The Bush Administration did not push for curtailment of fissile material production as part of the civil nuclear initiative. Indian officials emphasized that there is no commitment to stop producing fissile material until a multilateral FMCT treaty is concluded. Prime Minister Singh stated clearly that India will not accept a moratorium on fissile material production. While India agreed to a testing moratorium, it did not commit to signing the CTBT. This stance raises concerns about India's nuclear weapons program and its compliance with NPT obligations regarding aiding in the production of nuclear weapons. India's stance on fissile material production and nuclear weapons programs raises concerns about its compliance with NPT obligations. U.S. assistance to India could potentially aid in the development of nuclear weapons, leading to questions about violating Article I of the NPT. David Albright of ISIS highlighted the risk of nuclear assistance spilling over into India's weapons program, particularly in the fuel cycle areas. Concerns also arise about whether cooperation with India could inadvertently confer nuclear weapons state status and encourage further development of its nuclear arsenal. India's separation plan must be credible, transparent, and defensible from a nonproliferation standpoint. Some observers question its credibility due to India's past nuclear weapons program and the impact on its fissile material production. The Bush Administration defended India's separation plan as credible and defensible, covering more than just a token number of facilities with safeguards in perpetuity. However, there are concerns about the transfer of information, technology, and know-how from the civil sector to the military sector, which the September 2008 NPAS does not address. This loophole could arise from U.S. assistance to indigenous power reactors. Some Indian commentators doubt U.S. technology assistance to indigenous power reactors. Concerns arise whether nuclear cooperation grants India nuclear weapon state status, potentially fueling its weapons program. India had sought this status unsuccessfully before the July 18 joint statement, which opponents argue undermines the NPT's core bargain. The United States will treat India as a nuclear weapons state under the NPT, granting it access to civil nuclear technology and commerce without requiring all nuclear facilities to be under IAEA safeguards. This recognition provides India with political benefits, despite concerns about fueling its weapons program. The United States recognizes India as a nuclear weapons state, granting it access to civil nuclear technology. Despite differing opinions, the U.S.-India deal has placed India among de jure nuclear weapon states. India's nuclear weapons program has been legitimized by the United States, granting it access to civil nuclear technology. This recognition places India among de jure nuclear weapon states, with observers believing it to be on par with the five Nuclear Weapon States who are signatories to the NPT. The July Statement acknowledged India's military nuclear facilities and exempted it from full-scope safeguards, allowing for the continuation of its nuclear weapon-related activities. India's strategic programme is outside the purview of the July Statement, opposing scrutiny of nuclear weapons program or unsafeguarded facilities. Critics argue that international uranium access for India could free up domestic resources for weapons program due to limited indigenous reserves. New Delhi has reduced power reactors' output due to fuel shortages and lacks access to the international uranium market since the NSG's 1992 safeguards condition adoption. India needs to import higher capacity reactors and uranium fuel for a major expansion in nuclear power. The current fuel situation hinders India from producing enough fuel for both its nuclear weapons program and civil nuclear program. India's nuclear-power reactors face fuel shortages, hindering production for both weapons and civilian use. To address this, Indian strategist K. Subrahmanyam suggests using imported fuel for civilian reactors to preserve domestic uranium for weapon-grade plutonium. This proposal aims to expedite the development of India's nuclear deterrent arsenal. India's access to international uranium market will increase indigenous uranium available for weapons, as domestic uranium can be preserved for weapon-grade plutonium. Arguments that India has enough uranium for nuclear arsenal expansion do not consider constraints on civilian and military nuclear programs. Washington has no concerns about New Delhi's future nuclear arsenal plans. The NPAS argues that India's nuclear intentions are irrelevant to U.S. compliance with its obligations. It also suggests that the nuclear cooperation agreement may limit India's ability to produce more fissile material for weapons. India's nuclear cooperation agreement with the U.S. may limit India's ability to produce fissile material for weapons, as per the NPAS. The State Department report highlights that IAEA safeguards and U.S. export control policies will prevent India from using its civil nuclear facilities for military purposes. India's stance on disarmament and nonproliferation was reiterated in a statement by the External Affairs Minister. The External Affairs Minister reiterated India's commitment to disarmament and nonproliferation, emphasizing the importance of full civil nuclear cooperation with the Nuclear Suppliers Group. India believes this initiative will strengthen the international non-proliferation regime. India believes that full civil nuclear cooperation will benefit the country and the world by enhancing global energy security and combating climate change. India has submitted a Working Paper on Nuclear Disarmament to the UN General Assembly, outlining initiatives for complete elimination of nuclear weapons through negotiations for a Convention prohibiting their use, production, and stockpiling. India also maintains a voluntary moratorium on nuclear testing. India has a voluntary moratorium on nuclear testing and a policy of no-first-use of nuclear weapons. It is committed to global disarmament efforts and has strong export control legislation in place to prevent proliferation. India supports international non-proliferation efforts and is interested in participating as a supplier nation for Thorium-based fuel. India values the role of the IAEA's nuclear safeguards system and looks forward to implementing the India-specific Safeguards Agreement. India is committed to signing and adhering to an Additional Protocol with the IAEA for its civil nuclear facilities, working closely to ensure its early conclusion."
