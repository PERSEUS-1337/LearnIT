    "content": "The Act is titled the \"Mexican Gray Wolf Recovery Plan Act\" and defines terms such as Director, Mexican gray wolf, and prey. It establishes a recovery plan for Mexican gray wolves. The Director must publish a revised recovery plan for Mexican gray wolf populations in Arizona and New Mexico within 180 days of the Act's enactment. The plan must emphasize the importance of State and individual cooperation, including input from State wildlife authorities, livestock producers, ranchers, and natural resource managers. The Director must publish a revised recovery plan for Mexican gray wolf populations in Arizona and New Mexico within 180 days of the Act's enactment, emphasizing cooperation with State wildlife authorities, livestock producers, ranchers, and natural resource managers. The plan should include enforceable maximum population goals for the Mexican gray wolf in the two states, in compliance with the Endangered Species Act. The revised recovery plan for Mexican gray wolf populations in Arizona and New Mexico must ensure that the wolf population remains sustainable and acceptable to the majority of State entities and individuals. The number of Mexican gray wolves should be agreed upon by the relevant parties to prevent the decrease of wild ungulate species in the two states. The revised recovery plan for Mexican gray wolf populations in Arizona and New Mexico includes a description of acceptable and unacceptable impacts on wild game, livestock, and recreation. It also outlines a range for the wolf's habitat that does not allow dispersal north of Interstate 40 in the two states. The revised recovery plan for Mexican gray wolf populations in Arizona and New Mexico focuses on supporting a robust wild ungulate population. The plan also includes efforts to share knowledge with Mexico for successful recovery, and allows State wildlife authorities to manage the wolves if the Director does not comply. The State wildlife authority of Arizona or New Mexico can determine noncompliance if the Director fails to comply. Within 90 days of this determination, states with Mexican gray wolf populations can propose to manage the wolves. The Director must approve the proposal upon receiving it. The Director shall approve the proposal for State wildlife authorities to manage the Mexican gray wolf within 90 days. If approved, the State wildlife authority must manage the wolf according to the agreement made during the recovery plan development. Eligibility for funding is contingent on management compliance. Eligibility for funding for the management of the Mexican gray wolf by a State wildlife authority includes applying for funding from the cooperative endangered species conservation fund, the State and tribal wildlife conservation grant program, and the Federal aid to wildlife restoration fund. SEC. 4. EXCEEDANCE OF POPULATION.\n\nIf the Mexican gray wolf population exceeds the acceptable limit, the Director will reduce the population by relocating wolves within their range.\n\n(b) If a wild ungulate herd declines significantly, the Director will manage the Mexican gray wolf population by relocating wolves to maintain balance.\n\nSEC. 5. DELISTING OF MEXICAN GRAY WOLVES. Beginning when the population goal for the Mexican gray wolf is met, the wolf will no longer be listed as endangered, threatened, or experimental under the Endangered Species Act. Each state with Mexican gray wolves will take over management. The Director's decision to delist the wolf is not open to judicial review. Before delisting the Mexican gray wolf, each state with the wolf present must determine criteria for the Director to include it on the endangered species list. Monitoring activities will be conducted to track the wolf population in Arizona and New Mexico. Once delisted, the Director's decision cannot be judicially reviewed. After delisting the Mexican gray wolf, the Director cannot include it on any endangered species list unless population numbers, impacts, and range described in the recovery plan are not maintained. No further recovery plans will be published after the recovery plan described in section 3(a). The Director will not publish any recovery plan for the Mexican gray wolf unless a determination is made as described in subsection (c) or (e)(2). SEC. 6. RECLASSIFICATION OF MEXICAN GRAY WOLF. This Act applies to the Mexican gray wolf regardless of any reclassification as a subspecies or distinct population segment."
