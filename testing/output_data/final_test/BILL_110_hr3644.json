    "content": "The Act titled \"Commission on Natural Catastrophe Risk Management and Insurance Act of 2007\" establishes a commission with specific duties, powers, and membership outlined in the table of contents. The findings of the Act are also detailed. The Congress finds that catastrophic hazards, such as tornadoes, earthquakes, volcanoes, landslides, tsunamis, flooding, and hurricanes, affect millions of people annually. In the 1990s, 2,800 natural disasters killed over 500,000 people and impacted 1.3 billion worldwide. Property damage from natural catastrophes has doubled every seven years, with a 14-fold increase in the past 40 years. Risk costs have risen significantly in coastal areas due to increased hurricane frequency and severity. This has led to higher catastrophe insurance and reinsurance costs. Some States have inefficient legal and regulatory environments that worsen insurance cost increases. Consumers face temporary rate volatility after catastrophes. Government catastrophe mitigation requirements are often sub-optimal. State efforts to reduce insurance prices in disaster-prone areas can lead to reduced coverage availability and subsidized development in sensitive areas. Several proposals in Congress aim to address the affordability of natural catastrophe insurance, with little consensus on the role of the Federal Government. An efficient approach is to establish a nonpartisan commission to study natural catastrophe risk management and insurance, reporting findings to Congress before the next hurricane season. Establishment of a nonpartisan Commission on Natural Catastrophe Risk Management and Insurance (referred to as the \"Commission\") with defined membership. The Commission on Natural Catastrophe Risk Management and Insurance is composed of 16 members appointed by various leaders from the Senate and House of Representatives.

They will consider the current condition and outlook for insurance availability and affordability nationwide, as well as the ability of states, communities, and individuals to mitigate natural catastrophe risks. The Commission will report to Congress on the impact of laws and regulations on catastrophe insurance affordability, market access, and development in high-risk areas. They will also assess the benefits and costs of a national insurance pooling mechanism. The Commission will report to Congress on the impact of laws and regulations on catastrophe insurance affordability and market access. This includes proposing Federal natural catastrophe insurance programs, improving tax policies for catastrophe reserves, and directing Federal agencies to sell catastrophe insurance to individuals. The Commission proposes various measures to improve catastrophe insurance accessibility, including creating a consortium for state catastrophe bonds, expanding the Liability Risk Retention Act for businesses, and providing temporary Federal assistance to low-income homeowners post-disaster. The proposal includes measures to improve catastrophe insurance accessibility, such as creating a consortium for state catastrophe bonds, expanding the Liability Risk Retention Act, and providing temporary Federal assistance to low-income homeowners post-disaster. Additionally, it addresses the financial condition of State residual markets and catastrophe funds in high-risk regions. The curr_chunk discusses the need for strengthened land use regulations and building codes in high-risk states for natural catastrophes, as well as the ability of the private insurance market in the United States to cover insured losses caused by natural disasters. It also mentions the importance of assessing the maximum amount of insured losses that could be sustained in a single year. The curr_chunk addresses the potential for insured losses exceeding the capacity of the US insurance market, demographic trends affecting future natural catastrophe losses, the role of the Federal Government in stabilizing insurance markets, and government incentives for risk mitigation efforts. The Commission will submit a final report before the 2008 hurricane season with findings, assessments, and recommendations for actions at various levels.
