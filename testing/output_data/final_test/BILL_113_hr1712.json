    "content": "The \"Housing Opportunity and Mortgage Equity Act of 2013\" may be cited as the short title. It includes provisions for affordable refinancing of mortgages owned or guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The \"Housing Opportunity and Mortgage Equity Act of 2013\" authorizes Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to refinance qualified mortgages on single-family housing they own. The program requires refinancing upon request of the mortgagor and a determination by the enterprise that the mortgage is qualified. A qualified mortgage is defined as a mortgage, regardless of the mortgagor's payment status. The \"Housing Opportunity and Mortgage Equity Act of 2013\" allows Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to refinance qualified mortgages on single-family homes. The mortgage must be a first mortgage on a one to four-family dwelling occupied by the mortgagor as their principal residence, owned or guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, and originated before the enactment of the Act. A refinancing mortgage is defined as a mortgage that meets specific requirements. The refinancing mortgage under the \"Housing Opportunity and Mortgage Equity Act of 2013\" must be secured by the same property as the existing qualified mortgage, with a fixed interest rate equivalent to the premium received on the qualified mortgage being refinanced. The interest rate may be adjusted to cover additional costs over the term of the mortgage. The refinancing mortgage under the \"Housing Opportunity and Mortgage Equity Act of 2013\" must have a term to maturity of not more than 40 years and waive all penalties for prepayment or refinancing. The servicer conducting the refinancing cannot charge the mortgagor any fees. The refinancing of a qualified mortgage must not charge the mortgagor any fees. Title insurance fees must be reasonable. The Director may require enterprises to pay a fee to the servicer for each qualified mortgage refinanced. No appraisal is required for a refinancing mortgage. The Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency may extend the one-year period for enterprises to refinance qualified mortgages. Definitions for \"Director\" and \"enterprise\" are provided. The Director will issue regulations to implement the program."
